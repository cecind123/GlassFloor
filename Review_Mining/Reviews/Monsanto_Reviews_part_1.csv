bad,supervisors were not understanding to employee concerns most of the time. New employees opinions were not taken seriously. staff rarely gave good feedback regarding employee work performance
bad,Complete lack of integrity from all levels of management and Human Resources. Employees are afraid to talk at the working place; they act as robots. Nothing human.
bad,Don't work there since they no longer exist. There is no point in going to work for the evil empire because they sold out and now are owned by Bayer so there is nothing there.
bad,"Things were fine when there was local American management.  When the Germans took over, a junior person from Germany will run things like they do in Germany for 2 years.  Then it's back to Germany for them and another junior German will take their place...Their managers don't want to be bothered...Is it any wonder that even experienced senior people are leaving?"
bad,"Terrible place to work at! Would not recommend at all! The supervisor in charge of all the contract employees is rude and condescending. They expect you to work your butt off for the whole 8 hours every single day of the week. Even when we were giving it our all, it still was not good enough for our supervisor. The company expects a lot from their contract employees and cares little about their safety and well-being. The hardest part of the job is that it is incredibly repetitive. I accepted because I believed that I would gain experience and learn some lab techniques. Be warned it is NOT a lab job at all. You do medial repetitive work every single day with little chance for advancement. I did not learn anything while working here. The workplace culture was fast-paced and stressful. Sometimes we were expected to finish two days work in one day because they did not want to pay us for overtime. I think it is ridiculous as to how much they expect from their employees and the management definitely did not help at all. Instead of being helpful and encouraging the supervisor was angry and irritated most of the time. The other lab technicians that have been there for a while also seemed to think that they were in charge of the new contract employees as well and they would often talk down to us in a condescending manner. Terrible job and terrible management!"
bad,"Very siloed environment no upward mobility Wizard of Oz mentality WHAT diversity? Kitchen staff is very nice, but I didn't work in the kitchen..RUN!!!"
bad,Contractors do all the work and get no credit. There is little to no chance for advancement. They never hire the contract employees for full-time permanent jobs.
bad,"It was like the bad girls club, if you made a co worker mad it was like second grade all over again for the last person to get picked on a team. They never heard the overall story of the information they got things from they just took one side over the next."
bad,"The company only hires contracted 'employees,' because they do not want to risk of thinking of them as people. They are hired for numbers (based on the contract time offered), that are expected to work without any training. This position was overlooked by some inexperienced HR representatives and after working here for a short contract, I not only didn't get further recommendations from other employers due to Monsanto's terrible reputations, but I also didn't see Monsanto following their mission statement. I feel sorry for the poor migrant workers they have working in their factory with countless safety violations. Do not believe me, take a stroll through the company via a tour and see for yourself how on edge the employees are because they are afraid they will be let go."
bad,"I had terrible time at Monsanto. Managers, director and HR lady harassed me very badly for my interest/ passion to learn and contribute in the science field that I was excited about. HR lady yelled at me to sign a paper that my manager framed lies about me. I am a 'A' student but they made me do the brainless labor works and never let me grow! I quit my full-time job there to start as a contractor in another company."
bad,"We worked in corn fields. We didnt learn alot, The management was very nice. The workers were easy to work with and get along with. The heat was the hardest thing."
bad,"It's a very stressful job, nothing to motivate employees to work, no communication with the managers and not very helpful. And managers always have an attitude."
bad,"Bayer has poor management, It's a seasonal position and you will work your butt off driving to 15 stores every two weeks. You are putting up displays and packing out your merchandise. But, If for some reason the company has no more use for you after the season is over, they will not give you any explanation in why they are letting you go?  I never have taken a day off from work and in each store that I have attendant my duties in putting up displays and packing out my merchandise. I have gotten nothing but praises from all of the other store managers."
bad,"Enjoyable job meeting doctors/ discussing with them about our products. Assisting medical reps close a sales, achieved an efficient and effective detailing call"
bad,"work like a dog with equipment that shouldn't even be in service, ""competitive wages"" is a joke unless you are comparing the wages to McDonalds, If you plan to advance here better be the laziest person around bc the people that work hard daily dont mean squat to this company, not even guaranteed a 40hr work week bc if it rains a half inch you go home and sit sometimes for 2 days...nobody actually cares about even working there, supervisors dont care, sleep in their trucks, some employees even sleep in the equipment DURING the work day, and guess what they still have a job!...  Dont fall for the ""Employee owned"" BS bc its NOT....But if your lazy and like to play on your phone all day, go for it...you can become a supervisor, the most enjoyable part about working here was being able to not have to go back to this place another day of my life"
bad,"Its a good place to work if you want to be stressed, nobody ever knows what they're supposed to be doing the managers can never be found and they don't care about the employees well being"
bad,"I worked there as a sesonal worker. Very disorganized, the companies didn't care about its workers and the work conditions they were in. Staff was not friendly, wouldn't even say hi."
bad,I was mistreated as a contractor and lied on. I will never work for that company and I don’t recommend it to anyone. The company doesn’t care about contractor. I experience racism and was mistreated on a daily basis. I was very depressed working there and I was talked about like a dog. I was also let go unlawfully.
bad,"Company doesn't recognise employee contribution. No leadership in countries (100% Head Quarter managed) Top management only saves their skin, no leadership"
bad,To much of a staff turnover. Alot of difference between people and everyone has a hard time getting along. The salary wasn't where I needed it to be. No room to grow.
bad,Monsanto does not take into account the information of all parties involved in anything they do. They choose what is best for a corporate environment and not what is best to take care of their customer or employees.
bad,"Dificil promoción muy politica, RH poco involucrado en el desarrollo"
bad,"No opportunity for permanent position. Impersonal, lack of professionalism in management. No development opportunities. Divided workplace. No affordable health care, vacation etc. "
bad,"This place was the worst group of managers that I have ever been associated with.  When it comes to work assignment, they want you to find new ways to perform on a task, even though you have completed all your assignments.  Not a good place to work!"
bad,"Do not under ANY circumstance consider this place for employment. The PTO is ridiculous, you barely accumulate any hours every pay check. Management is all about favoritism and brown nosing. You don't suck up, you go nowhere. They've taken away all bonuses, cut our pay by a substantial amount, give bogus quality scores, and act like we should be happy little peons to work there. This place is going down and I am not going down with the ship!!"
bad,The working environment was very enjoyable.  The technical requirements were challenging and the ability to learn was always present.  Management was easy to work and communicate with
bad,If you're a minority it's not a good place to work. The management hear looks down on you and i've heard multiple racial slurs. I had to quit because I was starting to feel uncomfortable working there as an employee
bad,I got stuck doing all the work there with no help i had to do 1st 2nd shift work I cleaned up everything they left with no problem but at the same time never got no props for it like everyone els I'm a good work if a good boss could see it an not just want me to clean up after everyone there sorry I'm a good work I gave a year in a half for them an got 1 raise an new workers where getting raises but I got stuck with the same ppl an doing more work then everyone till I said something about it an got let go
bad,This place is a joke. Watch out for the Bathroom Creeper in the Engineer Department. The Project Manager will time your bathroom breaks and even open the door to the ladies room to see if you are still in there.
bad,"The management is the absolute worse. They act like a big family instead of a company. They disclose personal information and promote friends. Too much lying and smiling while really backstabbing and doing very little to help the employees. You know how every family has secrets well this ""family"" absolutely has secrets. All management cares about is power and not losing it."
bad,"Bayer is a company filled with managers that only look out for their own. Half of the company is contractor employed and are not able to participate or be recognized by this company. The personal advancement in this company is based on what is most convenient for the company, not based on who most deserves or is most qualified for the position. As a contractor (which 90% start out as), you will not feel valued or taken care of."
bad,"Monitor various AS400 LPAR sessions and if any problems arise follow documented instructions using HPSM service Manager to notify the correct users of the problems."
bad,Didn't like working there... We were never busy and the place was small. I worked with two busy bodies that all they wanted to do was cause problems.....
bad,"My co-workers were really team players. The hardest part of the job was to learn the materials. The most enjoyable part of the job was my trainer had patience with me, not only was I able to run the bagger I ran so much more"
bad,Large quantity of work and phone contact. Constantly busy with vendors and research. Always new systems being installed and training was awesome.
bad,"A monsanto é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar."
bad,"David VS Goliath "
bad,I have very good experience with both organisations for acheving goals of the required fields
bad,"Empresa que possui seus méritos com muita rigorosidade, alguns funcionários difíceis de manter relações trabalhistas mais muitos bons também"
bad,"Typical day is getting woken up at 2am to do a job bringing gas to some tweaker who's just scamming their parents roadside service. "
bad,"Agradável, Técnologias, Amizades, Respeito e humildades com o proximo."
bad,I missed 1 day out  of the yr and month I was there. Worked hard and asked to learn to new things.
bad,"El dia es ameno gente amable servicial buen ambiente laboral"
bad,work in seed lab sorting seeds to be sent to other labs for futher testing. Worked on as needed basis.
bad,a typical day at work was confusion. poor training supervisor was rude to employees no plan no structure. all i learned was that this was a poor excuse for a company with bayers name. complaints about the treatment of contract workers went ignored. there was nothing hard about this job it was made hard by no communication from poor managment. all co workers in my department were looking for other work after a short period of time working there. no grown man wants to be treated with disrespect for working hard by a supervisor that just shows up for work. this is from day one on the job.
bad,"Very stingy with resources, workload of 3-4 people for one person, nobody is happy around, not motivating environment."
bad,"Not very well organized - subsidiary company that I worked for was a very successful and a great company with respect for their employees. Since Bayer took over and swallowed up the little company, the 'blue chip' HUGE international imposed their corporate 'culture' on the little company that could, and in the process killed all originality and everything good that once existed at very successful small company."
bad,Sad place to work.  Tons of lazy managers that are rude and arrogant and talk bad about upper management.  Huge overweight employees that are lazy plain and simple.  Managers talk down to you and tell you about schedule changes 2 days in advance.  Young immature managers that call in sick all the time.  That place has guys there who cant perform in areas and have worked there 15 years or more?  It's a joke plain and simple but corporate will never see how bad it is since I only saw them 1 time in 3 years?
bad,"He intentado justificar la valoración de Bayer tres veces,  pero no hay manera de que la publiquen. Parece que las opiniones sinceras no son aceptadas. Solo puedo decir por mi parte que se merece una sola estrella de 5 posibles. ¿Por qué? No me dejan explicarlo."
bad,"As a contractor, i don't like not having a definite date for contractors to be converted over to a regular fulltime employee. I don't like to be watch and the back stabbing employees in which i work with. There are alot of want to be supervisors (coworkers) that are annoying and nick pick. I hope to find another job asap and end my contract fast. Thanks but no thanks!  Just and FYI cookies are suppoesed to be SWEET not sour!"
bad,That place is ran by terrible mangers.  They are into micro managing.  The real mangers of that place are a couple of full time guys that keep the ball rolling in the plant along with one of the admins that doesnt smoke 12 times per day.  Part timers are treated like trash and the work load falls on guys who work.  Most of the managers don't even get to work by the start of the day .  They show up 20 to 30 min late every morn.  This site has major issues with mgrs.  I would not go back even if it's a temp job.  They use you and let you go with little or no warning.  You will get laid off as a temp and they may give 4 days of notice or 4 weeks?
bad,"Lots of gossiping, poor managers, in certain areas if you are not a certain ethnicity then you will be picked on, gossiped about, given unfair assignments while others do less. Difficult to move up at Oxnard Branch, especially with downsizing."
bad,Wouldnt recommend anyone to work at this warehouse.Hours varies and sometimes you will be sent home early.Line start up time ranges from 30 mins to hour.Lack of communication.Some jobs ends early as 4 hours into start time.Some line leaders are rude.Not a good place to take into consideration of building up at.
bad,"Typical day at work was mostly stressful. Lack of communication from management made it a difficult/hostile working environment. "
bad,"the leads was rude "
bad,"Unless you are part of the ""agricultural"" mindset, you are treated with a lack of respect.  When I arrived I was kind of thrown into the position with no introduction to staff and limited interaction due to a pending OSHA evaluation.  Once that ended, they expected me to know what the requirements for each season and when I worked to gain understanding, I felt as though I was being a burden for asking questions, let due to poor management skills on the part of site lead. Could not effectively and safely do my job.  Lack of communication and training biggest issues I could see."
bad,There was absolutely no advancement opportunities I was as high as I could go in the company as there was only two employees me and the boss slash owner
bad,"A maioria das pessoas são agradáveis para trabalhar"
bad,"Management at the corporate level is horrible. These people,have never been in a big box store.they do not know,how,to manage people or projects. They spend their time criticizing employees under them."
bad,"Bayer is a German based company that comes into the USA and mainly hires temporary workers. "
bad,"They give you a lot of time off."
bad,Bayer mi? Aman diyorum. Çok kötü bir İK deneyimine hazır olun.
bad,I love my job as an forklift operator theres nothing hard about the job and management is great and co-workers are very careful but some don't know how to treat people the job doesn't have a lot of benefits and its seasonal so theres no advancing
bad,"Behind in innovation and techniques and resources compared to Novartis, Pfizer, and other big Pharma."
bad,"Bayer is an excellent corporation that trains, initiates and provides top resources to enlist in best sales practices & resources to achieve goals & lifestyle."
bad,"Enjoyed working at Bayer (now Siemens). Highly motivated, intelligent co-workers. Management style was high energy, and driven managers who got the work done."
bad,"This is not a good place to work, long hours you can't leave till everyone is done with their work"
bad,"Working at Monsanto, now Bayer, has been all but good. Most of the people I work with are disrespectful. My coworkers often blame new employees for mistakes that are the result of the machines they use to perform the job. My intelligence is disregarded often when I want to learn something new. I am regularly told that the tasks I want to learn are too difficult to learn. The management communicates poorly and my coworkers in the lab seem to have little to no drive to do their jobs. The environment that has been created at this lab is dismal and not conducive to creativity. Nobody listens to the questions or advice I have. This is even more so a problem because they have told me several times that they appreciate the voice of new employees because they offer new perspectives to improve the their processes. I would not recommended working at Bayer. There seems to be little opportunity for advancements and few people care about the job they have. The job is very easy. I feel as if the employees are sexiest. I did not experience that myself, however; I did hear people who felt as if they did."
bad,"The manager in charge was used to working on big projects but not one of this level or design. She had zero skill with managing those under her and was inappropriate in how she handled situations. She rewarded people for screaming at teammates."
bad,"Management hires relatives of employees rather than promoting existing employees that interview for positions.  Management is consistently unfair with raises, employment, and bonuses.  It is a popularity contest with Management playing favorites.  The work environment is hostile with issues not being addressed.  Management has a do as I say not as I do attitude.  The company has gone downhill from where they used to be and it's due to mismanagement. They stress integrity in the workplace but it does not apply to Management which is unfortunate."
bad,"I contracted with Monsanto to apply herbicides to orange groves.  My company was called Butler Grove Service.  Somehow, this website got that mixed up."
bad,"je moet streng routine matig werk uitvoeren."
bad,"not a great company hard to advance management was poor and very cut throat. heart building and experience but the cultures was negative, overall bad culture"
bad,"The job was actually very good and very rewarding. Unfortunately, management was not good. They constantly made poor decisions that hurt growers. And my manager would sexually harass women and racially harass and degrade male employees."
bad,I wouldn't suggest working there unless you're into kissing butt... It wasn't what you knew it was who you knew.. And headgames between lazy employees and hard working employees was diplorable
bad,Working here was a chore. I wasn't happy and couldn't find a balance. Very stressful. Management didn't consider and team building events for personnel. I worked too hard for very little compensation.
bad,"Expect to work 3-5 years as a temp associate before you're considered for a permanent job at the plant."
bad,"HR is a mess. If you want to do better for yourself DO NOT INFORM HR, They hold you back and will stab you in the back. LIES LIES LIES"
bad,"Great place if your one of the ""good ol' boys"". Nepotism runs rampant. Supervisors are truly clueless, not knowing what is even running on production lines. If the FDA only knew what gets swept under the rug!"
bad,"great company to work for. good people, salary, teamwork, hours, benefits, healthcare. Learned many aspects of chemical plant functions"
bad,Poor: Bully behavior is supported by upper management.
bad,Not appreciated at all. If you don't suck up to the managers you will not advance. Temp for 5 years. The only good thing was the pay. The pay was not worth the stress and anxiety.
bad,"After being hired you're left to fend for yourself and figure out what your job is and how to do it. They afford no overlap or training. I actually had a great group of people who worked in my area many of which I still keep in touch with today. The problem is that everyone is so overworked even when they knew how to help me, they had no time to do so. "
bad,"This division of Bayer is a sinking ship. Management for this position is horrible and has no skills at motivating or encouraging employees, rule by fear tactics and lies. Check the internet for others who have similar stories, both current and past employees. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
bad,"I worked as a crop science contractor in the chesterfield location, mainly focusing on genetics. When I started my job there there was a very obvious gap between if you were a contract worker vs being a employee. This particular area also implemented a pod system, which literally made no since and meant you were working with the same exact group of 4 people everyday, and led to pods seeming to compete against each other and talk horribly about other coworkers who literally did the same thing as them. Since I was a contractor I also had 2 managers one being my pod manager, and the other my contracting manager (it was never clear who was above the other or who I was supposed to talk to). My pod manager for some reason was the same age as me, which is quite young and extremely unfriendly. In fact, the entire pod I entered into was very unfriendly and unperson-able. I felt like I was doing something wrong from the very first day and just could not relate to them at all. I attempted to make friends with other coworkers by helping them when we were done with our tasks, and also sitting with them at lunch. I quickly found out that everyone would talk bad about one another like I was in high school again. They all hated my pod, and told me how unfriendly they were, I couldn't disagree. This is when my contracting company started contacting me telling me all of these things my pod manager had problems with that I had done. I was extremely confused since I was not told or warned about these problems prior to me getting called, and even talked to at work by the contracting company I was"
bad,Come nuova esperienza non sono stato affiancato e seguito da nessuno dove per il poco che ho lavorato in questa azienda anche con i colleghi non ho avuto facilita nel relazionarmi con loro
bad,"Started there with the RR rice program and went like gangbusters, then program shut down by poor PR in Asia. Millions down the tube. Worked on many projects after that. Very interesting work and mostly good people, although mediocrity was promoted. Then Monsanto hierarchy began to overshadow the research. Good scientists lost their jobs, people were laid off en masse every 2 years as management jet-setted and paid no attention to daily operations. Then they would visit our site (from St. Louis) and change everything in short time periods. Very bad management style and bad human resources left us with mediocre management. People from St. Louis who had no idea of what to do. On the day I was laid off, Monsanto violated the law by enacting a ""mass firing"" (firing a third of the location in one day) without any advance warning, but kept every ones mouth shut with a ""package"". As an Agronomist I do not believe that  Monsanto proceeds with any respect or due regard to the environment, farming or farmers in general."
bad,"This company will tell you one thing and do the complete opposite. Some departments are managed by great leaders, while some are not. I was in a department that was not. It was quite awful and no need to go into specifics, but let's say I'd rather flip burgers for $7.50 an hour than work there. "
bad,This place is 70 to 80% temps. Its a rotating door for temps after temps. I was a former fulltime employee and the place has gone thru 5 different upper managerial complete overhauls. Low pay and typic politics to get ahead. They give ppl jobs instead of the ppl that actually do the work. Management is a complete joke.
bad,Good Salary but should have stayed at NOVARTIS CONSUMER HEALTH
bad,"worked for them for 13 years started when i was 13, I was offered full time employment and was hired but then my job was put on a hireing freeze I was asked if I would continue serving in the military and I told them that i was going to continue serving then I got layed off and had to take a volunteer deployment while I was deployed they hired another person as a receptionist and then she was hired as a assistant wich was very similar to the job I was ""hired"" for, then a guy retired who had the exact same job that i was ""hired"" for. I was told that now they required a 4 year degree for all positions and that even though I was hired before that I was ineligible now because I did not have a 4 year degree. To me it seems pretty shady and underhanded but that is life I guess. good luck to anyone who obtaines employment with them."
bad,managment and personel are rude crude and unprofessional. Poor safety record and could care less about work ethics
bad,"At first you will like it but later on you will realize that you have no personal life "
bad,"Agist IT management. Rewards cronyism.  Internal politics encouraged.  IT outsourcing destroyed any culture.   Hopefully improves with Bayer ownership.  Start as contractor with zero hope of converting unless you are young.  Hiring only friends of friends.   Who you know is more important than what you know.  Management talks age and gender equality and programs to support it, but don’t fall for it.  If you avail yourself of these programs you will be removed."
bad,Es una excelente familia o empresa el problema es que pagan muy poco
bad,Lot of spare time - terrible management - lots conflict and very little achieved.  There is good quality of life in many areas where the workload is not high.  Shouting and reducing staff to tears seems to be common and accepted.
bad,The company is going through some sever management realignment issues
bad,"The company and way of work are stuck in the 1980s in terms of innovation and ability of leadership to lead for success.  "
bad,"You are pushed to achieve goals that corporate sets for business purposes even if it's not in the customers best interest. They pay well and severance is impressive. They eliminate jobs and don't give you a chance to relocate- they just throw you away! And it is questionable why younger employees are kept and people 50+ years are let go. It's a monster company that is based in agriculture. But management and most of the employees have no idea what it is like to be a farmer or the implications that Monsantos practices have on their customers. Bottom line it's about money-that's fine, but don't pretend to care about the world, because they don't!"
bad,Horrible to work for if you’re not in the good old boys club then you don’t have a chance. Mayors motto you screw up you move up in that sense if you somebody that doesn’t can’t do your job right or anything else to move you up in a better easier position which is not fair to people that actually do their job. There’s a lot of backstabbing.
bad,No masks or anything was provided even though we worked directly with pesticides and other chemicals. Management does not care about employees. Hours are scarce.
bad,"Supervisor had no people skills. Some staff were not required to follow the rules. Hours were not steady, or dependable. Schedule was not consistent or reviewed"
bad,"Riesiges Shared Service Center"
bad,"The company had great benefits but NO loyalty to there hard working employees.  If you gave your life to them for 10 years does not matter, they will through you out to benefit themselves.  Would not recommend this company at all."
bad,"Worked second shift. Fast paced. Required to do the days work, even when the day should be over. Schedule changes for no reason other than to please first shift. Depending who you work under you may be EXPECTED to not document things properly."
bad,"It seems to me that at one time this was the place to work. Everyone talks about how great it used to be. I can say that this is no longer the case. The pay is great and if that is all you care about then this is the place for you. They reward mediocrity by not holding anyone accountable for their actions. They take the employees that are problem makers and move them to different areas instead of getting rid of them. HR is useless, if you go to them with issues be prepared for nothing to happen. It is a waste of time to go to HR because they are so afraid of getting sued that they will not let management discipline employees. If you work your butt off to try and make a better life for yourself and those that you work with, all you get is people talking about you behind your back. It's just like high school."
bad,"The leadership team at Bayer in Berkeley is laughable.  Poorest run site in U.S.  At this site it is definitely WHO you know not what you know.  The leadership team has its ""chosen few"" and unless you are one of those - you are invisible.  The environment is hostile and unfair.  Some get away with ANYTHING while others are reprimanded for everything.  Very depressing place to work."
bad,"Bayer Crop Science turned out to be the worse place I have ever worked in my life. Management is incompetent and will not advance anyone but relatives, friends and good ole boys as long as they are men.They are too busy padding their own pockets to think about anyone working below them.  There was no training to speak of.  No one would teach anyone anything because they were afraid someone might know more than them.  No trust and no team work. Basically it is a dog eat dog situation I would not recommend to anyone with any kind of morals."

bad,"Overall, I think my experience was out of the norm. The culture is usually an enjoyable one, but I was hired to work in a new department where the managers were lacking in social graces and/or experience. One manager let power get to her head and made the working environment very toxic and uncomfortable for the entire department."
bad,"I left a $70,000/yr job, have been unemployed for some time now and have no regrets about it. My life is better now than then."
bad,"Management is to non responsive to employees, i.e. listens to instructors, but not so much to employee. Instructors set you up for failure if they find ant reason to dislike you."
bad,"Zero job security, I never new if I was going to get sent home. Good Coworkers, Good service, Hard to balance when you're by yourself, otherwise easy job. Management never really introduced themselves.."
bad,"If you like working for a company that will hire new guys with no experience and pay them more than you, after working several years than you'll love this place.  Its a joke, having a class A cdl and making less than a new guy with a class B cdl after putting in four years, kind of puts a bad taste in your mouth!"
bad,"They have double standards as far as safety is concerned, when you get yelled at for doing a safety violation, then let a lead person get a way with a safety violation"
bad,"My time at Monsanto was spent being worked long hours to meet unrealistic timelines.  Upper management never appeared to care about employee moral, just the results."
bad,Goof company culture as long as the business is going well.
bad,Its sad to sit around and listen to people laugh and be fake as heck to the growers. I would never recommend working there not unless you just want to sit there and turn a blind eye everyone and collect a pay check. Hates the work environment I have to work with people that are least real with each other if they ain't going to be real with a customer.
bad,"after accepting the position, i was placed on a different team with a different function. the engineers and operators do not get along well and it slows down every engineering project. don't waste your time here."

Management is very critical to your work and allows very few mistakes on your end before they let you go.  There was nothing enjoyable about this job. Hardest part was making it through the hot day.
bad,The culture has changed and is bogged down in bureaucracy. Senior management is often let go during purges to avoid paying out benefits. This results in an intellectual vacuum when real experience and knowledge is traded down for lower salaries in an effort to rein in the bottom line
bad,"Algo pesado ya que algunas personas son groseras, como personal de recursos humanos, a los obreros nos tratan mal, y a la gente de arriba muy bien. No podemos reportar porque luego nos corren."
bad,"While their software development practices were primitive, the projects were interesting. However that practiced poor and severely restrictive management practices."
bad,Very fast paced but work won't get done because you have a bunch of young people that they bring in to work and they do lots of goofing off and don't want to pull they own weight
bad,"My manager was rude and never acknowledged her employees. I learned a lot about IT optimization and how to be organized, but I never felt secure. When I was laid off, it was a blessing in disguise."
bad,The company is solid overall. The lab is great place to get experience on instrumentation. Management in the lab and site in general is very poor. The lab environment is very cliquish. The people there will stab you in the back in a minute.
bad,"Travail en 5*8 salaire moyen,manipulation de charges lourdes ,poste en intérim et pas très aidé par les cdi."
bad,I do not have a  very good opportion of this company. I fee lb. They did not honor any of the complaints missions when it came to certain aspects of there company ideals.
bad,Hopefully it will be a better place to work under Bayer's reign. Far too much favoritism.  People are promoted based on their clique or who they are married/ related to. People in management positions with absolutely no clue as to what they are doing.
bad,"The job itself is good work. You can work 9am to 5pm and have a one hour lunch break and everybody at West Sacramento will do this. There's not a whole lot of micromanagement, for the most part you do your work on your own schedule and as long everything gets done timely you won't have any problems. There's nobody breathing down your neck and it feels pretty nice. The pay is good comparatively to other similar companies and there are plenty of meetings and company perks like swag, appreciation events etc. "
bad,"Management wants product out the door - Bayer looking to cut cost through cutting jobs, those left will be loaded up (overloaded even more at this time) which is already unhealthy -  need money for all the lawsuits"
bad,Part time employees work well over 2080 hours a year with no paid  days off and no vacations. no room for advancement no room for better benefits... dont apply for a part time job
bad,"Stationary Position loading medical components, assisted other employees with their tasks. Tasks include boxing of products, verification of correct components that are loaded"
bad,I started as a union employee and moved up into management.  The company was purchased by Bayer and my group was laid off.  This is when I went to Genentech.
bad,Uma empresa boa de trabalhar nao tenho o que reclamar
bad,"Very demanding with little reward, no regard for personal life all that matters is the job.  "
bad,"If you are not part of the good ole boys and kiss up to upper management, your chances of succeeding are null, The atmosphere at Berkeley is heavy and the blaming culture is what prevails here."
bad,"en horaires d'été la prise de poste se fait à 6h15 pour se terminer 13h15, le travail commence par faire l'entretien des plans qui nous sont assignés durant environ 3h, à 9h30, nous avons une pause de 20 minutes durant lesquelles nous pouvons boire un café qui est chaque jour gracieusement offert par l'entreprise. dés la reprise, nous commençons à tirer le pollen des différentes variétées demandées par le laboratoire jusqu'aux environs de 12h30, suite à quoi nous reprenons l'entretien des plans."
bad,"lots of reorganization and downsizing in progress, lack of consistency between team leads, mgmt has no idea of the reality going on down in the trenches, a lot of good people have left - own their own or with all the layoffs."
bad,"When I first began working with this company, everything seemed to be working out just fine up until the true nature of the company came to the surface. When I was there, I remember seeing an extremely high turnover rate, a lack of effective communication among management to the rest of the employees, and absolutely no type of organization. Hopefully these things have improved by now with the company for the sake of the hard working employees that have remained with them."
bad,"Co workers were great, Upper management didn't always do what was best for employee, but what was best for the company, I learned a lot about corn research"
bad,Empresa hierárquica focada apenas em resultados numéricos na cultura do café. Os valores da companhia não são praticados. Motivo pelo qual solicitei meu desligamento.
bad,Borderline nepotism with hiring and promotional practices. Bad culture were advancement is
bad,No opportunities for advancement.  Management likes to mange by fear tactics.
bad,"I liked the very set hours, they don't hound you about overtime but they also don't pay it. Has great bene's for their full time staff, but if you're over 40 you won't secure a perm position; all full-time hiree's are always under 30 yrs of age. The usual story in America for now. The farmers I had constant contact with generally REALLY hate MONSANTO; they only use them for their financing options since it is after all 0% and quite the deal. Farmers at the time didn't even need this kind of leverage, but when it's free hey...? MONSANTO sponsors a lot of local cultural events in effort to try to veil their unethical eco-unfriendly practices. Doesn't work...local St. Louis'ans still know what this company is all about. The tunnel network is beyond description for winter access to other departments/buildings, etc."
bad,"There is a new management set on restructuring the Quality organization. Layoffs have happened and are always a possibility in the future. If you don't mind working very long hours and weekends in a very stressful unforgiving environment, then this is your place. 3 years ago, it was an excellent place to work. A lot of long time employees with many years of experience were forced to leave."
bad,"I used to work for Bayer as a short term contractor and went to another interview for a longer contract. I would honestly say to stay away from those short term contracts - they will bring you nothing good. You'll lose precious time finding actual job while working like a slave for Bayer for measly $14/h. Mind you, this was the same salary I had with no completed education a year prior in a much smaller local lab. But according to the manager this job was perfect for a recent graduate! "
bad,"Na empresa monsanto  eu adoerei trabalhar la . Eu fiz muitos amigos, apreendi novas experiencias  e  trabalhei de tudo um pouco. No campo eu fazia despenduamento, crusamento, colheita manual ,  correr bonecas e polinisar. Foi uma otima experiencia de vida. Trabalhei lá por duas safra."
bad,"Managerial missteps has lead Bayer to make hard and rapid decision in divestitures, investment in the business, and with people.  Monsanto was a huge mistake"
bad,"My experience at Bayer was very bad, management will not handle any situation that's going on with employees. People are cheating Bayer by leaving when they are clocked in or by hiding somewhere in the company and not working."
bad,Would take an hour-long bus ride to corn fields where we would walk through them and pick tassels. We were given water when we were done walking though rows but there wasn't always enough for everyone. We were expected to bring out own lunch.
bad,"Prior to sale, the Monsanto culture was very positive and supportive.  With the manager change, and the sale to Bayer, the environment became very negative, aloof, unsupportive. Fellow employees were great.  Supervision, not so much."
bad,"Company reduced positions due to merger which caused excessive workload for employees with no increase in compensation or position title.  Management is poor, not supportive of employees and little room for advancement."
bad,The company has competitive benefits and pay. There is low respect for work-life balance of individual contributors. The work environment is demanding and decisions are made slowly because managers are afraid of making mistakes. It's not a forgiving environment when mistakes are made.
bad,"O ambiente é bom, mas falta um plano de carreira, ou oportunidades iguais para todos."
bad,"For the first two and a half months we had been promised that the workload was coming but it never did. Everyday consisted of everyone going to their departments in the lab or warehouse and just sit and wait and wait until break and lunch time and before you know it, it was time to go home. Of course there were a lot of people taking advantage of the down time on a daily basis but I made sure that I was professional no matter what. There was a morning meeting and there were announcements about not having your cell phone inside the lab or warehouse or do not nod off at your station. That message fell on deaf ears because it just wasn't me noticing that so many people were breaking the rules but I would also see management see these individuals on their phone and not say anything at all. Management consisted of three young guys who just didn't know what they were doing. When the work finally came and it was a lot, they began to demand out of no where for everyone to stay at least ten hours a day up to six days a week. I just never worked around people who were supposed to be in charge to be so unprofessional."
bad,"The Indianola facility is a nice place to work.   In-building cafe with excellent food.  Many interesting people to mingle with."
bad,Bayer is a decent company to work for. Bayer however does not offer many opportunities for employees to advance. The supervision at bayer is lax at best and doesnt really seem to know what is going on most of the time.
bad,It is difficult to advance in the current industry economy. This has left my group with too many managers not enough boots on the ground. The current uncertainty about mergers and acquisitions has soured moral.
bad,"Unfortunately, there was no organization.  Management needs work.  Clicks.  No trust.  I learned this environment was not a team environment.  Extremely unprofessional.  Very disappointing."
bad,"Too many layers of useless management.  Ph.D. = manager even though most are introverts with zero people skills.  Used to be a nice place to work, but I get the feeling now that top dogs are going to Enron the place as they switch to a 'Data Company'"
bad,Employees worked hard and were told they would have wonderful positions once the company was running again.Once the company was up and running again it decided to close and is currently trying to sell.
bad,"I have been at the Bayer Corporation for many years. My time, education and services have never benefited me for advancement, however, for others it has."
bad,Unless you have a masters degree advancement is impossible.  Nepotism and favoritism is rampant.  The benefits are not worth the low pay and hostile work environment.
bad,"No reward for good deeds."
bad,"Empresa focada  em segurança, deficiente em liderança e plano de carreira, boa empresa somente na área administrativa."
bad,Work life balance sucks
bad,"horaires à 38 h, payé 35 (RTT)"
bad,Would not recommend this job to Friend.
bad,"Company's focus is on making money. If site produces well, the site manager has complete control over everything. There is no oversight, even if the company has knowledge of his actions and behavior. There have been serious abuses but nothing will be done because money is made."
bad,"Bayer is going through a rough time here on the river in Luling La."
bad,"L'entreprise a très peu de considération pour ses salariés. Nous ne représentons que des FTE comme ils disent, c'est à dire des temps pleins et malheureusement de moins en moins d'humain........"
bad,"You'll contract for years with absolutely no chance of advancement. As a contactor you do all of the work without any of the benefits, or a raise ever. The managers on schedule you to do stuff, then go to meetings the other 90% of the time. Don't waste your time with this evil corporation."
bad,"No chance for full time employment .  No benefits.  Contractors rarely hired.  Management ""knows"" they can not hire even if contractors are good at the job."
bad,"I worked at the location for a minimal time.  Schedule was seasonal.  Factory type work, but was happy to have the experience and the work available at the time."
bad,You will do the same job at the same level forever.  The job levels are so tight that you will never move up.  You have to wait for someone to quit or die to get to the next level.
bad,"It was an okay place to work, but you had to go through a temp agency to get hired and then who knows how long before you actually got on with the company."
bad,"Generally worked 10 days in a row and then 4 days off. Checked final product and ingredients during catalyst production."
bad,"Under going major restructure, and divestiture of brands within the Consumer Health division, due to continuously missing objectives within the Americas region."
bad,"80-90% of employees at monsanto are contractors"
bad,"Top down approach expected. Not a flat hierarchy where others are heard. My role and jurisdiction can be shifted at any time by my supervisor."
bad,"Worked as a  lab tech temp, shouldn't be viewed as more than that, temporary.  Honestly I think it is a terrible system that takes advantage of hard-working, educated people."
bad,I worked for Monsanto for 5 years and the whole time they dangled full-time employment over me like a carrot. I was on repeated contracts for 5 years.
bad,"I'm a fat old lady and while most companies want people 40 years younger than me, I still have a family to support so I got a temp job here but was ignored, ostracized, deliberately not given work to do, snickered about and made fun of and received veiled threats, especially from one woman with a personality disorder who was no prize herself.  My saving grace is that I've always been intelligent and productive but never had a chance to show what I could do, which is much more than these people who spent their whole days in meetings, producing nothing but hot air.  It was discrimination from start to finish.  A finish that happened while my kid was in the hospital.  My opinion of these people couldn't be lower."
bad,"The company only hires contractors and does not often reward good contractors with permanent full time positions with benefits. When I was there, our group was all young women (5 total, 3 of them were pregnant) the company discontinued our group and 2 women who were about to have children were let go."
bad,"Currently Monsanto is in the due-diligence process of merging with Bayer, with an anticipated closing in Q1 of this year.  There is a lot of uncertainty permeating the company, with good reason."
bad,"As a contract worker, the culture is very progressive. Treats contractors fairly and are always focused on the bottom line and who could get the most done for the least amount."
bad,While the culture of Monsanto's main campus may seem ideal it is a cut throat environment where you can be terminated the same day you receive positive feedback and your next assignment without any explanation.
bad,"This was an externship related position so I did not receive compensation. I wanted to work for Monsanto throughout college, but after experiencing the culture, I quickly changed my mind."
bad,Es una buena empresa fui responsable puntual atenta con los clientes
bad,"No regard for individuals with families.  Ideally structured for people with nothing to do but work.  Management is inept and promotes on friendship not merit.  Culture promotes safety but forces production to work 12 hour days plus OT.  If you like politics and backstabbing, then this is the place for you."
bad,Too many meetings with very little getting accomplished. you may end up temping for years without getting hired. No incentive to work hard. Mediocrity is encouraged
bad,"Employees are so busy pointing fingers at others, no one accepts accountability for their actions.  Management wants employees to have fun, but they don't care if an employee works hard, only if they are fun to work with."
bad,the only reason i enjoyed working there is because of the people i have grown to love they have some good people working for them but i don't think they even know because after awhile they leave because they not being appreciated.
bad,"During my stay for over 6 years, my manager was reassigned due to poor management practices. There is an open investigation on racism as well as lack of diversity."
bad,"Arrive at 7am, wait for supervisors, go out into designated fields, either collect pollen or pollinate corn, and pick weeds. Lunch was 40 minutes."
bad,"The working nature is good, i used to look after the field and observation parts but its quiet hectic but i enjoyed the work, as am passionated about learning and implementing the new things to my work am busy myself.I enjoyed a good realtionship with my fellow co-workers and company colleagues and till date i never use to get any hard days, but as am passionate about learning and doing innovatiness, presently looking forward."
bad,Great sales training program and great mission.  Too bad all divisions don't follow it.
bad,"All that glitters is not gold. This is all smoke and mirrors. The facility will be closing this year. They never informed the employees until they could no longer deny it, plus they don't even give their employees a nice compensation, that is why everyone at Bayer is leaving and looking for work elsewhere."
bad,"Um ambiente contaminado por operadores que se acham Reis e buscam escravizar os recém contratados. Inveja e muita ambição. Uma das melhores políticas de benefícios, empresa íntegra no pagamento dos proventos."
bad,"On-call and subject to personal opinions. Mostly did not know where the assignment was, or received any advance notice, on Locations. Meaning: Assignments could be in a fifty mile Radius and with little notice. Traffic, Location and Time lacked clarity ."
bad,This just wasn't the job for me. Working outside with corn for hours really was not for me. Management doesn't care about you they just want you to work and if you dont work then you get fired.
bad,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, but was still more interested in my major. I would have still continued employment with this company, but my vehicle broke down and I no longer had transportation."
bad,"Managers I worked for only managed up to make themselves appear competent to their bosses, and did very little to help develop those working under them.  LIFE values were not followed and favorites were played based on gender and friendships as opposed to competence and results."
bad,"Monsanto was great to work at if you are looking for something temporary.  Just don't get your hopes up about getting hired as a regular employee.  They only hire contract workers to do everything unless you have a PhD with 7+ years experience.  I was in the same position for 4 years with no raise and absolutely no prospect of being hired on as a regular employee.  Even though they let me interview for a position and told me every year there was a ""chance"" I could get a raise.  Once the company was talking merger, they dropped their higher paid contractors and ""let go"" a lot more regular employees so they could afford to buy out another company.  They didn't even bat an eye."
bad,It's a nice job to work at other than the hours. But management is horrable. They choose to favorite certain people and if you have a problem with the favorites you get told to toughen up. Which is not good advice for being harrassed by a lady when you're a guy and it's not socially acceptable for me to yell back at her. And  ive never worked at a place that had favoritism so bad that they add more vacation time for the favorites. Other than the environment and the horrible management it's not too bad of a job . Benefits are great.
bad,Management doesn't care about your life. We have switched from 8hrs to 12hrs back to 8hrs. Seniority doesn't play a part any anything any more. I have been there for 15yrs and the job is only getting worse. I love doing my job but they need better management that don't promote friends that have only been on the job less than a year.
bad,Monsanto was not a very interesting job. I detassled for my job and the mangers were only useful by helping. The job was just boring and all around not useful in going into most careers.
bad,.Ambiente desagradavel devido a interferencia da gerencia
bad,"Good compensation.   Some really good team members and senior managers.   Micromanaged from Germany/Global.  Lack of transparency on Global expectations/changes."
bad,Company had great benefits such as adoption assistance and legal shield for employees. As a regional employee I supported 18 sites in 6 different states. Because of this I spent up to 90% of my time on the road. Things got a bit better when I moved to St. Louis
bad,"It was high turn over because people are quitting and not enough hours for the employees."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone I like. The management is not approachable. If you do get a chance to talk to them they will completely ignore what you have to say. Their ""open door policy"" is a complete joke. You are viewed as nothing more than an underling ""worker bee"" (as it was once stated in a mandatory meeting)."
bad,"Op mijn eerste dag/Nacht eigenlijk op Glyfosaat werd al snel duidelijk dat de veiligheid niet hoog in het vaandel wordt gedragen werd bij het werken met GI. "
bad,"Very political.  Not what you know or how you perform, but who endorses you."
bad,Management is terrible.  They expect you to do everything that a manager would be expected to do.  No consideration for your personal life.  Only good thing is the pay and benefits.
bad,"En términos generales no existe estabilidad laboral, el curso, la gente de ahí muy comprometida pero nada estable por la mala planeación de los proyectos."
bad,"nach der Übernahme der Schering AG durch Bayer hat sich das Klima im Labor drastisch verschlechtert. In der F&E sind der Großteil der tech. Angestellten im Labor von hochwertigen Arbeiten ausgeschlossen und haben eher den Status von Messknechten. Höherwertige Arbeiten können in der Regel nur von Mitarbeitern mit akademischen Grad durchgeführt werden. Der vom Vorstand propagierte Teamgedanke ist nur in den Hochglanzprospekten zu erkennen, die regelmässig bei den Selbstdarstellungen vor der Kantine verteilt werden. Die Probleme aus der Monsanto Übernahme waren die Eintrittskarte in den Ausstieg aus diesem Unternehmen"
bad,Most of middle management is a joke. Loads of lazy people who do nothing and hardly work their 40hrs without any repercussions. Entry level are expected to do all with no guidance or support
bad,Typical office / accounting job atmosphere. I was given flexibility in the beginning with my schedule but that was slowly taken away as I was there longer. I was terminated due to the Bayer merger / overlapping with financial roles in their organization. The whole experience was really subpar because I know that I was doing good work for them. Annoyed but moving on...it is definitely hard to move up in this company without playing politics.
bad,"OJO! Hablo sobre Bayer Business Services, no de Bayer (negocio). "
bad,The job it's self was fun and great and I got to learn alot about new things and tools. I just didn't like how our boss would take 30 minutes off of our pay if we didn't keep him happy.
bad,"En el centro de servicios mucha rotación y el hecho de estar formando siempre a gente nueva quema a los empleados antiguos. Las promociones o asignaciones de proyectos están asignadas a dedo desde el principio y muchas veces por amiguismo, aunque después simulen abrir un proceso interno para aplicar a ellas (y lo comento habiendo sido una de las personas promocionadas). Se parte de una base salarial baja y las subidas son mínimas. Mala gestión del management en temas como proyectos, organización departamento, motivación empleados..."
bad,"Been here for a while and its been good. Things get done and colleagues are generally good. Recently there has been some restructures so it has created some latent unhappiness but the pay and above average bonus covers that up. If you just want to do your job and go home to your family, its a good company. I think the worst team to possible work for is controlling due to poor leadership."
bad,the pay was great and the benefits were great. It was like a home away from home. Safety was a big concern. Everyone got along and helped each other.  There was always a lot to learn.
bad,From day one the manager I was assigned was not very helpful to become acclimated to the position.  I was hired into the position as a contractor.  They hired me in thinking I would come in and run the department.  They do not have a very good training environment.  There is no structure in the way they teach you on their policies and procedures.  I would only recommend working with this company in you are an expert for the position you are applying for.
bad,I appreciate my time there. I grew and learned alot. I liked working with co workers they were always quick to share time and info.
bad,"No hay oportunidad de desarrollo, a menos que seas del grupo que comenten actos fuera de compliences."
bad,"* Distributed all mail to individuals"
bad,"Expertise in Pharmaceutical Science"
bad,"Highly political environment. Management cares more about ""playing politics"" than actual work performance. "
bad,"I really enjoyed my job itself and some of the employees I worked with. Management was all about production not safety but always talked safety, would never listen to complaints or issues that needed to be adressed. Ther is no ownership so noone cares about their job quality. Management and upfront personal all about them looking good not whats best for the company."
bad,people working there were unpleasant... ……………………………………………………………………………………………………what else do you want me to say if you want the info then let me pass lol.
bad,"Few people carrying the whole team. Managers debating against each other. Low talent level. Leadership doesn't know what to do in projects, only caring about their own seats."
bad,"Very strong clique culture. If you are not ""in"" it makes it very hard to advance. There is no unbiased HR for HR. Benefits are excellent. Highly matrixed organization allows for networking."
bad,"Each batch lot produced made the company millions of dollars but conversely losing a lot cost the company a slightly less amount. I was trained to have a second person double check your work when training someone but in practice, this was never done due to management pushing production too hard and not assigning enough employees to a task. An employee lost a batch lot and was promoted to supervisor. I later made a similar mistake and was fired because I was active in the union and critical of management in front of them. When I pointed this out I was told that I did not know the details of the situation and it was a private HR matter. I do know the details as I was employed at the location and my coworkers spoke of the favoritism openly. Our union steward changed jobs to protect his job security. I told them directly I wouldn't file a lawsuit if they didn't protest my unemployment. They did not protest my unemployment."
bad,"In general, coworkers great.  My assigned manager was a ""checklist' manager with no interested in listening to details that may change work expectations."
bad,"Pay is good benefits are great and company is great at making you feel good about the work you are doing to benefit the world. HR policies are very progressive in comparison to other companies in the region. However, middle management is horrible. They exist to do one thing, look for their next job at the company. In 10 years I reported to 11 different managers. They have no interest in managing people. They manage up and manage their own careers. They are a waste of space and organizational resources."
bad,He incorporado muchos conocimientos técnicos y personales pero siento que he alcanzado un techo en el sector y en la compañia.
bad,"Conversion of contractors to employees is below par.  "
bad,"The Senior Chemist position at Monsanto consisted of primarily short term problems and mini-projects closely associated with various aspects of dicamba process development and some marketed product support for other products.  Because of the short term nature of the assignments the opportunity for significant contributions, meaningful work experience, learning,  and professional growth was quite limited. This may have more to do with the position being a temporary contract assignment than anything else, but even so for the type of work Monsanto wanted and the manner in which they managed it they would have done just as well to engage a junior chemist.  "
bad,"simply put: quality has no control over their computer system process, or a vision of what their process should be.  Regurgitation of  industry standards without understanding fundamentals.  Management changes constantly, with change never occurring simply because nobody understands what the issues are with the process, efficiency, and how to attain consistency (e.g. no templates).  Very immature company for it's age and size.  "
bad,"Con reestructuras constantes por lo que la información  y planeación a mediano y largo plazo es cambiante o volátil."
bad,For a young person sometimes it is challenging to be innovative.
bad,Je n’avais pas l’expérience j’ai appris et retourner sur la ligne avec deux opérateurs son conducteur de ligne
bad,"Was at one time a great place to work, however, after the Bayer acquisition management and working conditions went downhill.  Pay and benefits were good."
bad,"There were two separate Bayer companies at this plant. The company itself was divided into 27 divisions to avoid bankruptcy over numerous class action law suits filed against the Corporation, most of which involved dangerous drugs and cheating Medicare for 7 years.  Massive reparations were paid, and numerous suits are outstanding to this day.  All purchasing had to go through the Parent subsidiary at the plant.  Consequently, all required information (to and from vendors for example) had to be relayed through this Parent subsidiary which made communication meeting schedules difficult.  Purchasing was treated in the same manner."
bad,This company is one I have really enjoyed for about 1 year each time I worked for them.  The problems for me have been due to a transfer to a new set of managers in both cases.  There are many different ways to manage programming work.  I think I may be a bit particular about which styles work for me.  I like hard technical problems to solve and the freedom to solve them.  I do not much care for micromanagement or office politics.
bad,"I pollinated corn in the summer, I learned what hard work really is. The hardest part of my job was being in the hot sun, but i met a lot of new people and had a great time."
bad,"It was a lot of work but it was manageable, we got paid pretty well and I was sixteen so there wasn't a lot of other work available for me at the time."
bad,Traffic is very bad in Cambridge area and parking is limited.  It is in a building with other companies and there is a little cafeteria downstairs where you can buy food.
bad,"The management talks the talk , but rarely delivers.  You get a great benefits package, but once you are into the position they can careless about any of your needs."
bad,Enjoyed working with the people I did and I learned alot from the two ladies I worked with. What I did not like about it is that there was alot of back stabbing and two faced people that would talk behind your back.  When my boss started talking about my personal life that is when I decided to leave and move back home to MS.
bad,"I'm not going to say much other than I was fired on a lie. No management came to talk to me about the issue, I worked the full day, got a call I was fired as soon as I got home"
bad,"Maintenance Dept leadership is part of production and  is not familiar with maintenance in general and many times are unable to make informed decisions causing loss of production time.I found this extremely frustrating to see loss of time and cost to the company when it was actually preventable and unnecessary,"
bad,Really enjoy the differenet enviroment very out going interested things to learn
bad,"Typical work day involved securing the premises. Hourly tours performed around facility. Quiet and friendly work place. I only worked on weekends. Which the corporate building was closed, so I only worked with my partner and we got along great as a team."
bad,"Picking tassles is not so fun, but its a job that pays. its cold in the morning and super hot in the afternoons, but that doesnt bother me, because a job is a job as long as your getting paid."
bad,the benefit is to work consumer market as my experience was limited on pharma market only
bad,I am working in this field 2004  in Haryana and Punjab. But I have no working in Bayer company. Now I am working in Royal crop science India limited  as salse executive and  development manager in Haryana State.at h.q jind
bad,"The work was interactive"
bad,"Great team To work with."
good,After a 3.5 hour commute to office in NJ I would arrive at 9am and sit in a cubicle and work with people in Germany via my computer. 12pm lunch in the café and back to work on my computer for the rest of the day where it would take me 3.5 hours to get home.
good,The culture can be at times stressful and the pay does not meet the level of experience or education.  Not necessarily valued in this role.  Hoping the Bayer culture is better than Monsanto's was.
good,"The work was difficult in the heat, it is not a job for everyone and the ""management"" or ""bus drivers"" are inconsiderate. They did provide housing and transportation to job site."
good,Poor management and too much political b.s. Nobody can be trusted. Poor office environment. Too much backstabbing. Not a good place to work.
good,"At Monasnto Creve Coeur, I was harassed by one particular man. He would come to my desk and yell at me for things I didn't understand.When I went to the supervisor all I was told was this man was ""old school"" and I would have to deal with it. I was thrown into their way of working and programs without any instruction or training. I was only there for 5 months and the supervisor cut my contract short. Very few other drafters were willing to help me with questions that I had. It was pretty much every man for himself."
good,"Manutentionnaire charger, décharger des camions, préparation de commande ..."
good,Did not have a Manager who knew what was needed to make the position grow and move forward.
good,It was nice to work there but in the Christmas season it was very busy!
good,Its a decent job for young people wanting to get work experience. It will teach you hard work and build your stamina. The work is very physical demanding. I found it hard to do any thing during the work season due to being so tired.
good,"I've known several co-workers at Monsanto that have faithfully served their time and made valuable contributions to the company, however, the accountants of the company had different plans."
good,"Work is okay, but management is bad. Management doesn't know what is going on in the lab. Prioritized more on special projects than what is going on the lab."
good,"learn lot of things in management, and enjoy my job. the hardest part of the job is to making coordination between employee and service provider. good."
good,"I enjoyed my job at the Production site. Certain members of management were condescending and did not treat the employees with the respect or recognition they deserved. "
good,"Material Science for polycarbonate production. Visuals, colors, wet chemistry, and BPA. "
good,Es una empresa farmacéutica transformacional con mucha reputación.
good,Is a decent place to work for a short period of time. If you like politics and games this is the place for you. Very much like High School very young crowd perfect for a teenager or someone in their early 20's.
good,Monsanto makes it very difficult for contractors. This is one company where you can end up being a contractor for years and not get promoted. They also treat their contractors like they aren't important and are disposable.
good,Buen salario y beneficios pero un mal ambiente laboral y cultural
good,This place is not very compensated as a contracted employee. Would not recommend someone needing to provide for a family go to work here on a contract basis.
good,Very stressful work place no stability. Nice coworkers no management relationships very distant. If you are not stressed out daily your workload is not enough according to management
good,"There are a lot of new leaders, and they are all jockeying in turf wars and showing off for each other.  Hopefully they focus on the business and culture and get things back on track soon."
good,"Magnum é um lugar bom de ser trabalhar  pelo fato de fazer manutenções, o ambiente de trabalho era bom , um companheiro ajudando o outro."
good,"A good learning experience, management sucks and some of them are unqualified.  You can learn a lot if you ask it's an okay job.  Everyday there are rumors that people are going to start being let go."
good,Large company.  Easy to become lost in a large organization and not have impact or opportunity.  So many people involved in projects slow progress and cloud results.
good,they have great products and a great history.  They have change their business made and they are making it work.  They sell both to Clinics and to the stores
good,It was a good place to work but things change over time. Now half my job is in Mexico and the other half I'm no longer qualified to do it as far as Monsanto is concerned.
good,"Analysis of Financial Statements, Draft Deeds as per law applicable. Finalization of Financial Statements as per the Income Tax Act, Company Law. Designed formats of Financial statements of various companies as per Income Tax Act & Company Law."
good,"There is a culture of exclusion,  If you are not a full-time employee, they do not include you in many things.  Management makes sure to let you know that you are lesser than they are and that you will never get credit for your work here."
good,In a typical day you will be required to work until all the work is done for the day. That could mean putting in 15 hours day frequently. You never know when you are going to be done. They employee basically anybody with a heartbeat.
good,"I am a good person and I am of type management, I want to work in your company, I will do great work.i am married and one childern i wating you massage"
good,My position was cut but we were not told it was going to be. One day we went to work that day HR came in from corporate and we were escorted out we couldn’t even get our belongings it was not the way it should have been handled. But the severance package was very good.
good,Need to change the work culture and form small area in one reps location no one here will home and help one reps area......................... ...............
good,Ero in laboratorio chimico. I manager impedivano qqualsiasi crescita professionale. Avevo il compito di svolgere lo stesso test ogni giorno tutti I giorni. Non capiscono la differenza tra un essere umano e una macchina.
good,"Eine Schicht arbeiten:"
good,I really enjoy working at bayer but there are some flaws .i think the best thing when get hired is you vacation time snd benefits. Some things they need to work on is pay anf bonuses
good,"My best understanding of the way bear works is you become what you make of it. Being driven to network and spread yourself out throughout the company is beneficial in promotions and advancements if you could do this without putting a damper on your job productivity that you were hired to do. My personal experience I had a person in my department that I didn't get to know until halfway through the duration of my contract that only cared about their self and when the work got low that they would be the one doing it regardless if they were qualified. this person was not my manager but have the ability to advise management of budgets and things that wasted their money in the budget Personnel recommendations of contractors and used all this know how to ensure their job last forever. This is a small example of what I meant when I say you become what you make of it it could be for yourself advancement in your skill or personal financial needs that drive you drive you to do things that aren't focused on your actual skills expertise yet in a way they were."
good,Has had three reorgs. in last 4 years.  No clear direction from the top down.  Many Senior Management changes within that time.  Little to no subjectivity on matters
good,"A very fast paced environment when deadlines are up. Seemed as if the managers directly above me had troubles that downstream affected my workflow. Communication between my manager was not great. Leadership is great amongst a few managers in my department. A typical day in receiving seed and plant material is you receive a 2 or 3 x 200000 kg pallet of seed each containing 120 bags of seed. Define each bag within a program, assign weights and assign location. Repeat 100000 times, no joke. This job consists of repetitive manual labor. There are down times during the fall months and then an up time during the early spring and summer."
good,"The Management knows how to higher a skilled personnel and yet don't know how to manage them.  Management encourages employees to be proactive and self-starters while the staff is mainly Contract or Seasonal they don't have an understanding of the process to begin with.  The management expects but doesn't generally approve of innovation if it wasn't what they had in mind.  Leadership places rules throughout the season but won't enforce them, follow them, and then complain about no one following them.  They stress diligence in quality of work but when deadlines approach leadership freaks out and throws it all out the window to just finish.   "
good,"I learn something new everyday.Like computers, machinery.Management not great but room for improvement.Workplace culture not great.The hardest part . ."
good,"I contracted for Monsanto, and it was a decent job for what it was. I couldn't hardly go to the restroom without my boss texting me to ask where I was/what I was doing. A good opportunity as a recently graduated engineer, but the pay was not on par with what I expected to make as a BSME. I was told multiple times by my manager that he was not going to renew my contract for various reasons, most of them related to my lack of experience, which only served to make me look for another job that much faster."
good,la empresa en si ofrece de manera muy peculiar trabajo aun asi se podría arreglar varios ámbitos
good,Empresa que passa por muitas mudanças e você aprende a se adaptar constantemente.
good,Great people to work with.  Healthcare industry is changing and senior management needs to adapt.
good,typical day at work was awsome on everday bases and i actually learned alot from shipping samples that were very important for the company and developing technology on corn hybirds. The Co-workers were very friendly and so was management they comunicated very well and treated everyone with much respect. the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the work environment was very positive and that i would always have a good day at work
good,"I love the people I work closely with, my manager is another story. She will not stand up for you, she lies, she will not take blame for her own doing. She is good about letting you off if you have a dr's appt. The hardest part of my job is dealing with her, I don't believe you should have to worry about your manager lying on you, especially when you show up to work everyday and do a good job. My co-workers are the best part of my job, we work well together, it is great to have co-workers you get along with. A typical day we come in at 7am have a morning meeting, then we go in we read germs (seeds that have grown for 7 days), after that we check-in samples that have came in and then sort them out for different testings. Around 3pm we plant all the samples that came in that day and leave at 4pm."
good,"It was nice to put Bayer on my resume, however the working environment was unpleasant. Many of the more seasoned technicians would not help the new guys learn and become better for fear of job security. The management lacked any drive whatsoever and have become entirely to complacent. Pay was great for having just come out of school and the benefits were awesome due to the union."
good,It was a tolerable atmosphere. Not too stressful. I was a warehouse employee. So allot of truck loading and unloading. Seasonal work got old. I was only part time. So every season i had to draw unemployment and wait for callback.
good,Not so much anymore. The culture has become cut throat and no one will be accountable fore actions unless its a positive for them so yo have to take care of yourself before you can do your job.
good,"Vital equipment check,walk the site,check for equipment smooth  operation, Look for potential problems, check for any safety issues and correct first,check B.M.S. = Building Maintenance System, check computer for SAP notifications and work requests, continue projects in progress."
good,Una empresa que la verdad puede dar mucho más de lo que entrega
good,During heavy periods work life balance was out of control.  It was not unheard of to work 80 hrs per week during migrations.I would not recommend Monsanto/Bayer for a family oriented employee
good,"Working with Bayer in middle east region isn't the right place to develop or improve your competencies considering the high ambiguity & fast changes in contradicting business directions. "
good,It has been quite some time since I worked at this location.  My experience there was positive but desired more.  The supervisor was very personable and encouraging.
good,unico problema na empresa é o nepotismo como forma de ingresso.
good,Sometimes the work is overwhelming and limited assistance in getting it done. A very stressful and fast paced environment. It is a very dynamic place to work.
good,"Overlapping roles and responsibilities - Long work days and weekends, no management support / acknowledgement of employee contributions - no support staff - hoteling set up with no specific work space makes work hard. Not enough shared spaces to be able to conduct private discussions / meetings."
good,"Good people in Shawnee location.  Very nice pay and benefits package.  If you like and can deal with changes on a major scale, you will like working at Bayer."
good,"was a good place to make a living,,,,just was force to work overtime almost everyday,,they didn't replace people whem they left,,just force people tp work overtime"
good,"Was a fun place to work until the management style changed beginning in 2015."
good,"Very German.  Any business can be poached due to lack of competitive knowledge or interest.  Totally Marketing driven, no sales force to speak of.  Other better choices.."
good,This is a place that evaluates the validity of GMO corn and DNA via cross pollination and well as DNA manipulation. Seeds are received from other countries for experiments here in the USA while this company sends seeds to other countries as well.
good,Not too much of diversity here. There are a few minorities here however the atmosphere isn't too kind to those of US with darker skin. Black and brown people.
good,"It is a nice place to work , fun and upbeat . But the people that  the temp agency puts in there make things too diffecult.  Its a good place to have a part time job and then move on."
good,"Day to day we would go over specific fields or areas of corn and just pollinate and make sure the ears of corn were growing the way the people doing research would want them to be pollinated. The management was good, kind and respectful. The workplace is outside, so we usually started early to avoid the heat. But because we were all so spread out there was no social interaction. The hardest part of the job was that it was very repetitive for hours on end. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it gave you a lot of time to think."
good,"If you want a career in science, then Monsanto is a great choice. Support services are treated poorly and not a priority. For a company that touts itself as a tech company, it's IT support services are extremely poor and behind the times."
good,very simple job management very unprofessional forced long hours somtimes as long as 13 when your scheduled a 8 hr shift clean facility their is literaly no hard part to the job
good,I enjoy my assignment at Monsanto... The only problem with this company Monsanto wont hire non employees here.  I hate Rose International Staffing Co.
good,The company was a good company to work for but due to to size of the company there was very little hope of ever being anything other than a PA.  I saw three directors being promoted to incredible positions and had to start again
good,"Bayer se caracteriza por tener la parrilla de productos eticos y OTC mas importante del pais y productos prometedores para Alta Especialidad y Gobierno"
good,"Em minha rotina de trabalho na extinta unidade Bayer MaterialScience, realizava análises físico-químicas (GC, HPLC, FT-IR, UV-Vis, Titulação potenciométrica, Viscosimetria, Karl Fischer, etc.), síntese orgânica, desenvolvia métodos analíticos e projetos para redução de custos e ganho em performance; marcha analítica qualitativa para identificação de contaminantes no processo; calibrações dos instrumentos analíticos e manutenção básica, gerenciamento do sistema SAP fornecendo suporte aos colaboradores no Brasil e no exterior e a clientes; treinamento técnico de pessoal, elaboração de instruções de trabalho, relatórios de projeto e calibração, realização de DDS; inspeções de segurança nas fábricas e laboratórios, supervisão do laboratório da unidade de Poliuretanos multi-propósitos, participação ativa em nas reuniões de produção, responsável pelos cálculos e testes de correção ou reformulação de produtos e formulações; atendia emergências 24 horas no laboratório e para as fábricas em plantões semanais."
good,I am not agreed with my job title. When I was hired in Bayer they said your title will be revised within 6 months but till now after 10months effective participation as regulatory manager no such things happened.
good,"Great technologies and pipeline, good people, culture on the surface looks great, but underlying currents smell of social agendas.  Bench strength is getting weaker."
good,"It was a good place to be you know I was getting paid every week. I've learned a lot there learning the machines, how to clean them out when we finished the product, it was cool. My co-workers were cool u know I gotten to know a lot of people there and it was fun working with them. Management the one that owned the warehouse he didn't really like nobody mainly me because I was learning things that he didn't think I can handle, but one of my supervisors taught me everything I needed to know and I thank him that. The most enjoyable part about the job was that we had little get togethers where they feed us for doing a good job. There was nothing really hard about the job so I cant really say too much about it."
good,"This is a good place to learn the basics of working for a mid/large size company. Unfortunately, there is extremely limited opportunity for advancement in research and development. While the production side is not necessarily hampered by this constraint, careers on that side of the fence come their own overhead."
good,Inconsistent and Seasonal. Which makes for everything being up in the air all the time. Co workers were awesome if you could get the good ones to stay year to year
good,"A typical day at work involves being reminded of the schedule given the day before, being checked on to see if you are following the schedule, management assumes the worst about employees. Unpaid last minute overtime is the norm for my department."
good,I started as an ABM off cycle and did not go through the proper training.
good,"Unload trucks and maintain inventory of nursery stock.Sales,design and customer service.Maintain nursery stock-trim,spray for insect and disease control.Run front loader and forklift.Good co-workers but long hours."
good,"Unload trucks,run equipment,supervise new employees.Maintain, trim spray nursey stock for insects and disease.Sales and landscape design.Customer service."
good,"This is a very nice laboratory environment to work in. Everyone is extremely friendly. I would love to continue working here, but there is currently no room in the company for advancement. They are currently only hiring contractors and full time positions have not opened up in the past several years."
good,"Many Positions,"
good,Bayer is really some kind of place to work. I learned that this is a dynamic field. There is management at different levels. Co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is the steady stream of reports. The most enjoyable part is of course working in the field.
good,Extremely very busy environment. More staff needed for department.
good,"While there are many good products,  and huge potential,  middle and top managers play power games all the time, and don't share information and are very slow for taking decisions."
good,Typical day involves applying pesticides for new projects and reviewing other projects in progress. Weekly meetings and data reviews. Ok place to work.
good,"The job and the tasks I was assigned were monotonous, but were very easy.  The managment was not the best and they did not value employees that went above and beyond."
good,Foram anos de luta com o gestor para mostrar o caminho do desenvolvimento e novas práticas dentro da área de manutenção e quando estava caminhando para o sucesso do projeto fui desligado.
good,"Some middle level manager were incapable and were not open minded people. Some had bad leadership skills and discriminatory toward certain group of people like a Chinese ethic manager hated his own folks very much and tried to marginalize and kick them out for no obvious good reasons but made up some absurd reasons. It seemed OK with the company upper levels and nobody cared unless you want to file law suite to against the company, then the upper levels would fight to death to defend their lousy managers not the employees. They always let older employees to go first whenever the managers hated them and find a way to get rid of them."
good,Boa gosto de agilides de trabalhar .é uma ótima empresa todo dentro da lei
good,"I love my team members, however working as a contractor feels like being blindfolded and told to write a 10 page paper and getting yelled at because you didn't finish it within the day.  There is no communication, the full time employees go to meetings all day while most of the work is done by contractors, who make up most of their staff.  They dont give you the resources to find solutions to problems and when you dont get your work done on time due to not being allowed access, tthey throw your name under the bus.  This company does not care about contractors, this is only good for a start ing job position.  1 year max!  I know people who have been working here for 5 years and they are the backbone of their team, the full time employees dont even know what all they do, Yet they will not hire them.  Dont think your the exception"

Dont think your the exception!"
good,"The work is challenging/engaging, but as a contractor I did not feel secure in my position. There is no plan/path to becoming a full-time employee. Monsanto as a whole discourages coaching between management and contractors."
good,Empresa dinâmica com cultura de oportunidade de desenvolvimento em diferentes áreas a depender do perfil profissional.
good,"There were some people there that were wonderful but it was a cold, careless work environment; people were not friendly and it was not conducive for learning your colleagues behaviors; everyone pretty much just sat at there desks, didn't associate with one another and kept to themselves."
good,i dont understand why i have to do this but here it goes. i was a contractor. Monsanto does this so they do not have to hire anyone because it was cheaper
good,Started 20 years ago working in the corn field. Learned to program ladder logic and advanced to the engineering department. After 20 years corporate restructuring eliminated my position.
good,a typical day consists to trudging through mud and water for 12 hours with 1 hour of total break time 5 days a week with 8 hour days on the weekend with no benefits or perks
good,It started off as a good company but then they had mandatory OT which I couldn't do because I'm in school.  There usually wasn't much to do either but they still wanted you to stay late.
good,They bought my company. I would not have applied. They also sold my division to Innovatus like a bunch of slaves. Also Bayer retired me and gave low raises.
good,"Operating and maintaining various types of equipment by using various operating systems and hand tools. I learned how to use various operating systems, Management was not very good they didn't seem to concerned with operators work life balance and chose to promote friends over experience. The most enjoyable part of working there the people I met."
good,"One director level has lack of management skills such as telling everyone manager's favoritism, showing his racism, having affair with two colleagues. HR and his boss have been ignored his bad behaviors. They defense each other."
good,Empresa agradável de se trabalhar com uma cultura empresarial excelente.
good,"Working at Monsanto is great... if you are a full time employee.  Monsanto employs a high percentage of contract workers.  These still vital roles do not receive any benefits whatsoever.  The perks of Monsanto - one large one, extra days off during the holidays - are especially painful for those not getting paid for them.  "
good,"We install new PLC's and the wiring, verified and sold instrument loops, wired and verified motor controls, and verified system/PLC operations. Demoed/upgraded system controls for conveyer belt/bagging operations. Verified Delta V communications within the system and outside devices."
good,"Time for a change no Advancement available .Started off as a great company to work for as time progressed a lot of promises were not kept and over all quality of work has drop dramatically .The department that I work for was very busy and fast paced ,And we were responsible for a lot and took a lot of the blame when things went South ."
good,"very slow paced work environment, not really earth and environmental friendly, advancement is not correlated to the performance and knowledge, network and communication skills work more than education and professionalism."
good,It will be a better place when Bayer dissolves the current company leadership. It cannot get worse. The current situation should be avoided until Bayer gets rid of the incompetence.
good,"As a contractor, do not expect anything as far as guidance goes from management. The pace was frenetic during planting and harvest, but the work was enjoyable.  Some of the employees were a pleasure to work for if they did not care about the corporate ladder.  The ones that cared only about the corporate ladder wouldn't give the time of day."
good,"Management is very lacking and the room for advancement is very minimal. They pick favorites and write-off basically everyone else. Benefits are very amazing on the other hand, and raises are given yearly as well as a bonus once an employee is hired full-time."
good,"There was no room for advancement unless you are part of the ""in"" crowd. Nobody tells you when you are hired that the site closes for two weeks at Christmastime, during which contract employees do not get paid."
good,"I had the best boss ever in this company. The company has very good reputation. It is a well organized and wealthy company. Unfortunately, they do not give the opportunity to every one in the same manner. They discriminate on the manner of social status."
good,"Shipped 600 lb seed bins from the Warden plant to Dayton, WA.  Used forklift-trucks to trtansport bins to and from warehouse to flat-bed Semi truck.  Day's went by very fast."
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years and was recently laid off ahead of the Bayer acquisition announcement. It used to be a really great place to work and I enjoyed the people I was working for and with for the most part. Over the past 3 years, the morale has declined significantly, particularly in the Vegetables Division. People weren't being treated with respect and I saw many great assets to the company leave because of it."
good,"Shift work allowed plenty of free time to travel and relax, work was easy and co-workers were friendly, mistakes/errors were not taken lightly due to the critical importance of the product which led to some stress, management was helpful and very present."
good,"No clear cut job description. New position created. Reorganized stain and finish storage and distribution. Sprayed out customer samples for approval. Managed receiving, inventory control."
good,"Gives opportunity to grow in thinking, skills, innovation and gives challenging tasks therefore having advance opportunity, but making policy are bias only top management are beneficiary without consulting ranking files."
good,"Monsanto is a matrix organization, which means there is not hierarchical structure.  After being here several years and gaining some experience with this type of structure I am not a fan.  A matrix structure drives a lack of accountability and makes getting anything accomplished a practice of getting buy-in from everybody and their brother.  This is probably fine when times are good but in trying times it provides an atmosphere where marginal performers can hide and make a career out of it."
good,"O departamento que trabalhei era problemático. Alto turnover, estabilidade diretamente proporcional à nível de amizade com a diretoria."
good,"Bayer is a great company and this was a great starting job out of university.  Bayer has great benefits and job security which I value and appreciate to the utmost extent.  I enjoy learning and new challenges so after 3 seasons, this job is becoming too routine and that is why I am job-searching."
good,"There was not very good communication about the scope of work. "
good,"Too much internal report."
good,"Nice workplace but no supportive management "
good,"nice co-workers and staff development management,  the hardest  part of the job was the new certification compensation training and  the large territory.  I had excellent team and support staff."
good,"aprendi muito nessa empresa. Foi uma pena a terceirização. Aí caiu muito a qualidade."
good,Okay but I was never happy there. I wouldn't advise anyone I liked to stay there.
good,"Working in the Corn fields was a great experience, I honestly wouldn't mind doing it again. But Id have to say that the hardest part for me would of been working under the hot blazing Sun. There was a day or two that i felt like giving up, the heat would get to me but, i knew that giving up wasn't an option. A lesson id say I've gotten out of all this is that,  If we give up in life we will never move forward towards our goals. We are capable of more than we know."
good,Walked miles and miles picking corn tassels and checking others picking them as well.
good,"pull orders. load & unload semi's.I learned more about the agriculture field. Management  & co-workers were ok. The hardest part of the job was the schedule fluctuation of schedule on a daily basis. The enjoyable part was driving a forklift, wich I have done for many years ."
good,"Não pretendo avaliar a empresa, pois trabalhava em um call center onde não tinha contato sobre funcionários e ambiente da mesma."
good,"Empresa com bons benefícios e remuneração. Atua em diversas áreas. O braço farmacêutico é a menor parte. Mas possui produtos altamente conceituados no mercado, de qualidade. Investe no treinamento da força de vendas. Fornece suporte para a atuação dos representantes junto aos médicos."
good,"- Uma empresa muito boa e um setor ótimo;"
good,Benefits and compensation is lacking a bit. We have little to no pension anymore so the money you save is what you will need to retire on. The plant needs to become more competitive with the rest of the ship channel.
good,"A typical day is having a tale gate in the morning and the lead operator explains how important it is to pay close attention to your work surrounding. I've learned to do multiple jobs and be able to work where every a able body is needed. Management is management, you come to work on time, work safe and perform your job duties to the best of your ables with a team spirit. I work well with my co-working. The hardest part of my job was the first few days, not really knowing what to do and your never always on the same job, area or building and the fact that I'm a contractor that wants to be permanent. My most enjoyable part of the job is that your always learning something different."
good,Bayer Indianola has its benefits and downsides like every job. I worked in production in the clean room. You must wear PPE on your face and body because you are dealing with assembly and packaging of medical devices that are to be used at hospitals. Some workers are great and some are back stabbing liars all depends on who you talk to. Weekly pay was nice but just wasn’t enough for what they they wanted us to work like.
good,"Contratos tercerizados, y no dan oportunidad de seguir directo con la compañia"
good,"I have to say if you asked me what I love about Bayer its mostly the people who work there.  However management decisions and very unclear guidance to changes and systems has really made a once wonderful place to work extremely stressful.  Most people are now doing the jobs of 3 and with little or no recognition or room for growth may people are moving on to different places and altogether different careers.  "
good,"Our department was very top heavy. There were too many managers and not enough people working directly on projects. Managers were often in disagreement with each other and gave employees mixed messages, causing frustration and confusion. Some managers do not take into account employee feedback and suggestions on projects."
good,"I was originally hired by Bayer CropScience as a contract worker to harvest soybeans. This continued normally for over a year before Bayer CropScience bought Monsanto. Since the US Government decided that Bayer CropScience couldn't own both the LibertyLink and Roundup Ready traits, my department was sold off in a deal with BASF. I don't have a lot of opinions about them since I didn't spend a lot of time working for them, but I can say that there's zero opportunity for advancement as a contract worker, getting a raise is next to impossible, but the hours were flexible."
good,"Beginning temporary, was not given access to everything.  Hired for a temporary to hire position.  Was not given chances to learn new activities. Getting access for company computer sites was timely.  New position was unorganized."
good,"A Bayer é uma boa empresa de se trabalhar, quando analisado seus valores."
good,"Although I have only worked for Bayer for a short time, I have learned a lot.  My manager was amazing and shared processes with us to allow us to grow as a person and a team."
good,"The people I work with in my department have all been here for 30+years and are not willing to listen, learn, or cooperate.  I was promoted as their process leader, with a leader above me, and I am not respected in the slightest bit because they have all been here for so many years.  "
good,"I enjoyed the work experience at Bayer. It did change slightly when they changed from Monsanto to Bayer. Unfortunately, budgets didn't allow me to stay, but I admit it was a nice work environment and experience."
good,"Can be a great place to work, but some organizations have very poor cultures; primarily Breeding. Upper and mid management are very political. Who you know is much more important than performance. Preference and advancements are given more on how a person sells themselves on internal social media and through other things like meetings, etc., versus actual job performance."
good,Bayer is a decent company. If you're a marketer you should maybe look elsewhere if you want development. The division is really focused on recovering so development is not a priority.
good,I Would not recommend this job because of the production of GMOs and the hard labor that was required for this job. My overall experience was poor working for Monsanto.
good,"This position is good for fresh graduates, the daily route tasks are easy for someone who has a science background. However, it might becomes boring after a while"
good,"The company champions a culture of diversity and inclusion.  Also, the company compensates its employees fairly well.  The work/life balance is good.  However, job security and career growth/advancement are of concerns."
good,Angenehmes Klima allerdings ohne große Information über das Tätigkeitsfeld
good,"only seasonal job available mostly last for 3 months only,covered by "
good,Good place to work if you can find a full time job.There are a lot of experience workers who anyone can learn from. There's lot of training tools to work with.
good,"Working for Bayer was the best experience of my life.... They offered great pay, and rapid advancement. Unfortunately if they didn't relocate I would still be working this company today."
good,Trabajo duro con poca oportunidad e crecimiento par ami especialidad
good,"Durchschnittliches Arbeitsklima, eigenverantwortliches Arbeiten,"
good,"Bayer overall is a great company however, at the site I work at the upward mobility is limited.  The management here definitely has their favorites.  I have had stellar reviews several years in a row however, I consistently see opportunity going to others.  I also work for a very junior manager which can be frustrating when it is obvious that qualifications and leadership skills are lacking."
good,"Buena empresa, da confianza para realizar las actividades"
good,"This is a young man's job, you would enjoy it the job if you are single and have no children.  You are on the road a lot. Management never seems to know what's going on.  Things are always changing, typically not for the better.  This job was a lot better when I started than it is three years later.  You get a lot of vacation days, but no time to actually use them."
good,Challenging with high demand and stress.  Advancement opportunities are limited.  Culture is not the best and upper management often does not support their staff.
good,"Good"
good,"Due to business growth and structural changes some things are sacrificed - line staff motivation is limited, many low-skilled newcomers came, poor promotion potential. Salaries are not fixed to USD or EUR and are paid in local currency which is quite weak last years."
good,"Work loads are ordinary with the daily multi task and learned to become more focus on meeting the deadlines. I get to love and accept the conservative behavior in private and or in public places. "
good,"Overall good company to work for.  Very fair to employees when displaced, which unfortunately has been a trend over the last 10 years. Strong on benefits and potential bonus earnings."
good,"Monsanto es una buena empresa para prepararse como profesional, debes ser dinámico, seguro de tí mismo, mostrar coraje y transparencia; todas competencias que un líder necesita. Es una empresa en la que enfrentaras cambios contínuamente."
good,"this company develop my communication skills because of a huge counts of costumers that I face in my everyday duty, and I earned confidence and relevant manner of approaching various personality of customers and institution staff."
good,"There is no opportunity for personal advancement within the company. There used to be many perks for a seasonal employee but over the years they have been diminishing. Without an opportunity for advancement I am looking for something that may lead to an opportunity to advance elsewhere."
good,Good workplace with a good corporate culture depending on the department you work in. Investing heavily in digital capabilities. Exciting to see what happens with digital farming.
good,"Ive learn about on how to deal with different people, must know how to adjust certain situations. My co workers were good since they are part of being a teacher to me  because they are sharing what is good and what they have been in their experiences before. The hardest part of the job is when conversing a person that seems not to be interested on the things you are sharing. Inversely, the most enjoyable part of the job is when we are having meeting because we can socialize again and we can work together as well. Trained how to handle/manage clients."

good,Call center type environment servicing the Agricultural market. I worked with a great team of Seed advisers supporting the AG market through seed sales and customer relation management and outside sales support.
good,management is an ok but they mostly focus on the production and and not on there workers but the people there are really nice and easy to work with a usual day you go from sitting to standing in 3 hour shifts for a 12 hour work day can be a little hard on joints the hardest part is having a life outside of work there not really enough time in the dy
good,"Challenging and interesting business to be involved with.  I learned many new things at Monsanto, that I believe will be a benefit to any future employer.  The people at you work with daily are down to earth, and have positive attitudes."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, boa para trabalho, entrei lá sem noção alguma sobre produção e sai de lá como operador 1, os funcionários sempre atenciosos, sempre dispostos para te ensinar tudo o que sabem quantas vezes forem necessário, a direção de uns anos pra cá que ficou muito ruim, pois não valorizam muito a mão de obra, tínhamos que trabalhar com equipamentos muitos antigos (comparando com as concorrentes) ambiente sempre agradável com os membros de equipe."
good,A fast-past work environment with great coworkers. Both challenging and rewarding. Great employee incentives and good work/life balance.
good,"Average 9.5 hour days with normal work load"
good,Aprendi sobre analises fiscais e possíveis impactos fiscais.
good,"Overall the company is good, but there seems to be constant layoffs and change after change.  Promotions do not happen internally.  People are nice across all countries, but it is a very German run company.   Management is ok, but everyone is so busy, there is really no quality time with management to even develop a plan for future roles."
good,I enjoyed my time at Bayer.  There is a lot of opportunity at Bayer and they take good care of their employees.
good,"When first started w/ Bayer, it was fairly easy to call/e-mail  H.Q. with questions or problems but as time went by it became harder and harder and at the end of my employment it would take days to get any kind of response."
good,I was recruited into this company as a Graduate Engineer Trainee and started my career with this company. I learnt many new things. Had sweet and bitter experiences.
good,It was a good place to work. The employees are really the engine that make the place work.
good,Very collaborative environment.  Good opportunity to grow marketing skills across a cross section of disciplines.
good,"Excellent products"
good,"Employees have great control over their daily work schedules, and in prioritizing objectives. Organization is very lean, and lines of communication are short in the U.S."
good,Good company - most everyone worked independently . Not a lot of team projects. I took care of the safety shoe and safety glasses programs so was in contact with most all the employees which I enjoy very much. Nothing really hard about the job - I enjoyed learning new skills.
good,I have learned so much and have been given many opportunities to lead the boat.
good,"lo mejor es que tienes un amplio abanico de posibilidades. Lo peor que casi cada año ahi limpia de personal que conoces, y muchas veces ves que es injusto el despido. Otras veces no. El trabajo en sí es sencillo, lo más difícil es tener que venderte continuamente a la empresa. Lo que más me gustó es la independencia y formar parte de equipos diversos para un fin común."
good,Great place to get experience. Lots of opportunity to grow.
good,thumbs down. Its a shame because there r good people that work there.
good,retirement has its own set to problems. lack of challenges. minimum activities possible due to costs
good,Es wird Selbständigkeit und Teamgeist gefordert und Leistung abgefragt.
good,"Bayer is transitioning from monsanto merger. Using people up and letting them go.  They are having internal budget problems and are clawing back money from projects. "
good,MI Sto trovando Bene Grazie and un Coadiuvato gruppo Di colleghi Veterani
good,"The Kansas City, Missouri location offers great pay and benefits. But the 12 hour day/night rotating shifts with forced overtime are brutal. The place is a serious safety concern. In order to compete with Chinese production costs, they have the employees with the most amount of time running the processes. These people are not necessarily the best ones to be running things. The people on the floor are the newest hires. They really don't know how to do the floor work safely outside routine jobs. Be ready for the mushroom cloud."
good,Lot of hours during season with shift work.  Management can't make decisions.  Only cost of living raises.  Hard to move up to make better salary.  Good benefits but seam to be being slowly lowered/taken away after Bayer buy out.   Relaxed but busy work with long hours and mandatory shift work.
good,Bayer acquired Medrad in 2006 and has since destroyed the culture and work environment. Medrad was a two-time recipient of the National Malcom Baldridge Award for Quality and had annual growth figures in the double digits prior to the acquisition. It's now a shell of it's former self under the Bayer flag.
good,"We were promised unlimited water, but most days it ran out or was hot. Also we didn't get much for break and higher ups would get mad if incapable to keep working."
good,"Monsanto/Bayer was a good company to work for in an experience manner. The Transformation team, however, gossiped a lot and never quite got along between crop groups due to competitiveness. Way too much drama everyday with people getting offended and gossiping a lot. As a contractor, a job posting opens up about once a year, so it is extremely difficult to become full time. As a contractor, when full time employees  go to meetings all the time, you will be doing most of the work on your team."
good,"Learned something about a new area of Agriculture-Serving Corporation. "
good,"Rolling lay offs and uncertainty of future holdings, if you work for Monsanto and CEO,CFO,CTO aren't following your name, don't get too comfortable and keep your CV up to date. A great culture and top notch employees but I don't believe their business model is sustainable."
good,"Depending on the department a nice way to start your career wouldnt recommend staying , but has good options and benefits, they dont  treat contractors very welll"
good,Flexible hours so start when you want.  Wear whatever you want.  Go to meetings about 5 per day.  About 3 hours of available time to complete work.  Go home at a reasonable time.
good,"Great place to learn and grow but not for career advancement within the company. A lot like high school with gossip and cliques, the more friends you have, the faster and farther you'll move up the corporate ladder. Contractors are not given benefits, sick days, or holiday pay. Decent hourly wage, but not the best. There are opportunities to go full-time but very few actually get hired on."
good,"Detasseling made me an was an endurance focused work determined to get the job done well no"
good,"Bayer is an unstable company at the moment.  People are unsure if the will have a job down the road.  Bayer is moving departments to Basel, Switzerland.  They are in financial crisis."
good,"A Bayer por si só é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar e iniciar a carreira, entretanto, como em todas as empresas, a gestão interna, dificulta o desempenho profissional."
good,work life balance is not a well know concept here. constant politics between departments. redundant meetings. unrealistic schedules. golden handcuffs.
good,"I am NOT rating Bayer companies, as in Bayer Aspirin, which the logo on this page indicates. the company I work for is Bayer Interior Woods; spelled the same but not related in any way"
good,sterilize and clean yourself off before entering the clean room. start stretching and getting ready to fulfill work orders and do basic Assembly production. the workplace culture is very dynamic people from all over the world work at Bayer pharmaceuticals. the hardest part of the job was the heat and the repetitive work all day for 8 hours. the most enjoyable was the laid back environment.
good,"Ein nach außen tolles Unternehmen, doch im Inneren brodelt es. Man gibt sich Mühe durch Sozialangebote Broschüren, Flyer und natürlich Bezahlung zu begradigen was hochkommt."
good,"Aunque el ambiente de trabajo fue relajado y el salario era bueno, los contratos fueron solo por 3 meses y no había posibilidad de promoción."
good,"The building was in bad shape when I showed up. I brought in a new controls system and turned the building around. It was more productive, better able to handle what the company wanted."
good,I was only a contract worker for 6 weeks. I wish that they had a longer job for me as I feel I just got properly trained and able to work on my own when the job ended.
good,"its repetitive work, which makes it a long day. The management could use some help. The hardest part of job is trying not to get tired. there is room for career advancement, but you have to work extra hard."
good,"Trabajo con clientes de la empresa muy satisfactorio."
good,"Days were filled with meetings and job assignments. Employees generally have routine daily responsibilities. Management could be better. No diversity, only a hand full of minorities."
good,"Bayer is a pharmaceutical company located in Whippany, NJ.  The facility and the location are very nice. They also have a gym and it's an ok place to work.  The most enjoyable part of my work life was collaborating with my peers."
good,Difficult to adjust to and poor management because of deficiencies with the EPC contractor.  New company take over coming soon and hopeful they will build a new safety culture.
good,"Training in the laboratory was provided hit or miss and it seemed that you had to make a mistake first to learn proper procedure. Greenhouse training was very satisfactory."
good,Monsanto was a good place to work. The only down fall was that the location was not there headquarters so to continue to advance you would need to relocate.
good,I started my day around 8am.  I did learn about DNA is cotton that was fun.  Management could be improved upon.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I truly liked it
good,"My schedule was a typical workweek but flexible schedule with time on the weekends to catch up on administrative paperwork. It was a very demanding job, workplace culture was ok. There were lots of tests and ways to train and learn. The hardest part of the job was working with hospitals who could not use your product because of formulary issues. It was a bit frustrating and political. I really enjoyed watching business grow and the relationships I built with customers flourish. Sales, Marketing, Training and Building relationships are all natural skills I possess so overall, I did enjoy the job. I also enjoyed challenging myself and learning the medical aspect of my job. I really enjoyed the training and presenting."
good,"Monsanto is great place to work with, they are going through a big transformation of acquisition by Bayer. The head office is in USA and they have a number of strategies which they want to drive globally to align the organization goals."
good,"I was a temp for 16 years at Monsanto and the various departments was friendly, the culture is diverse, the work challenging in some departments, some were relaxed, for the most part it was a great place to work because of the people. Something new was always happening.  Each manager had their own style of managing and the company worked at maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusivity of all races, gender, and disabilities.  I've seen the blind, disabled, women and minorities working at Monsanto.  All working to put out an above standard product.  The most enjoyable part was when the company sponsored fun things to do to keep up morale such game seminars, fashion shows to raise money for charities, letting farmers  come sell their products, awareness campaigns, food & fitness programs. . . it was a lot going on at Monsanto. It was good."
good,"Il lavoro alla bayer farmaceutica, era gestito da una cooperativa, il lavoro era frenetico e stressante, ma nonostante tutto, io sotto pressione dò il meglio di me"
good,I like the people there. Didn't like doing the same thing everyday. I did like how I could set my own hours as long as if it was within reason.  It was a good temporary job.
good,The people are great to work with. The company is real flexible. The only problem I have is I was told when I was hired contract that it would likely turn into a permanent position within a year. I worked with a guy that hes been here for 4 years as a contract employee. I asked around and found out that there's a lot of contractors that have been here over a year or two.
good,"The workplace has a typical office environment. Management is good and work is not to stressful.However, job opportunities are limited during my stay as they were hiring project based staff."
good,"La pluriennale esperienza nel reparto Servizio Clienti mi ha permesso di acquisire le fondamentali conoscenze per la gestione delle mansioni di competenza del Servizio Clienti. Il carico di lavoro era costante per tutta la durata dell'anno fiscale. Una tipica giornata di lavoro dovrebbe renderti soddisfatto per lo svolgimento delle mansioni quotidiane I colleghi di lavoro erano collaborativi, disponibili all'ascolto e all'aiuto, professionalmente preparati per gestire il proprio lavoro. La parte più difficile della mansione di Supervisor è stata quella di coordinare le risorse, differenti per età ed esperienza e con modalità di lavoro differenti.La parte più piacevole del mio lavoro è stato il contatto giornaliero con i clienti con i quali si era instaurato un rapporto di amicizia, rispetto e stima"
good,"Condition de travail agréable sauf en pic de chaleur (canicule), très bon management général de l'entreprise."
good,"Like many places, one works in either cubicals or shared offices on computers.  Depending on the number of projects one is working, there are a number of meetings and presentations to make. The company has its own vocabulary for many statistical concepts. It also, uses many acronyms which takes some learning. Work loads can be large and rapid turn around is expected. Some teams do many standardized analyses in an almost assembly-line fashion. Other teams get to be more innovative. As with many large companies some mangers are great and some are not. I worked under both types. On one team work loads were reasonably managed and approaches were not restricted so progress was achievable. On another team, work requests were demanding, changed often and unpredictably, making it difficult to finish tasks. Also, approaches were limited, making the work much slower. The hardest part of the job was preparing for many nonexistent presentations. The most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating with co-workers to develop approaches to problems."
good,"Conducteur conditionnement qualifié. Participation a plusieurs projets d'amélioration de fonctionnement machine et participation à la création de nouvelles machines. Formateur interne pour les formations types ( gerbeurs, geste et posture, palan potence et haute pression)."
good,"I can never get used to this company, my skill has drastically improved, I have learned a lot some of the things I rather not say, management is good, I have a one of a kind manager, and always professional co-workers relationship, the lab employees are young energetic and hard workers."
good,"Very diverse work force"
good,"The culture is a buddy system, which favors friend over qualified personnel. Room for growth is quickly staggered and over shadowed by others agenda to take cake of a friend."
good,"Monsanto is a great place to work if you're seeking to define your career.  The benefits are good and seemingly tailored for families.  The recent flux by restructuring is unfortunate, and it leaves a lot to be desired with job security.  It seems to happen on an annual basis, too.  However, you're free to pursue self-education during your career development and complete your goals by the means you see fit.  You also must excel performing in ambiguous situations and reading conversations."
good,Good place to work.  Nice work life balance with every other Friday off.  Expect managers to hold the hands of employees who are under performers.
good,"Como todo en esta vida; dura lo que tiene que durar."
good,"Good time off and flex hours, good pay and benefits and flex time off. Management was concerned about the employees. sales position with no opportunities for advancement."
good,"Uma empresa  boa de se trabalhar, com pessoas sempre dispostas a te ajudar. Muitos benefícios e salario acima da média."
good,"Monsanto offers good development opportunities, though assuming international mobility to Switzerland, Netherlands, or USA. Internal promotions are common. Benefits package is fair, though is not always adjusted to the market. Work-life balance is not good in many positions, and working in evenings or weekends is a practise that often occurs. You need to be smart to be effectively operating in sometimes complex matrix structures with multiple stakeholders and managers."
good,it is good place to work. it provides good learning environment. coworkers are friendly. good work life balance. management is supportive for personal development
good,It was the most fun and productive work environment I have thus far experienced bc of the comrodry with some of my coworkers. Management was focused on the amount of product out the door
good,"Started my career here, it's a higher turnover environment but it's manageable. Decent opportunities given a large IT organization."
good,"Los días de trabajo eran buenos ya que no eran tan pesados, presionados ni tan aburridos."
good,"The company is successful in the areas of inventory, 2 second lean suggestions, implementing new regulations for the better of the company and establishing a safe safe area of operations."
good,"Trabalho intenso, que favorece o desenvolvimento profissional, com a abertura de boas oportunidades. Trabalhando na Bayer, ganhei agilidade na forma de atuar e aprimorei a interlocução com os colegas, inclusive em níveis hierárquicos superiores. O ambiente é muito competitivo, o que expõe o profissional a cobranças permanentes, embora o resultado seja compensador."
good,"I have been working with the current company as a permanent employee around 4 years and as a contractor-full time employee around 2 years; I feel Monsanto in general is a good place to work. "
good,"Did not do any accounting."
good,"I travel 4-5 days a week and have learned a great number of business and analytic skills in my days in management at Bayer. As a Key Account manager ,I am activally involved in area sales strategy and implementation of business plans in the Southeast. I have great co-worles who are motivaed and dedicated . Currently there as been a large transition in management and this has created a very unstable environment. The worst part of my job is currently the lack of communication from upper level mamagement about the direction of the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is building business relationships with customers that result in increased sales."
good,"Working for this company paid decent money, but the hours were non stop and executives where foolish and greedy."
good,I worked graveyard and my night at work was almost similar to BI. The only differences were we filled everyday and we used different equipment. While I was there I developed a shorter set-up time with less operators. My co-workers were a little hard to work with but we put our differences to the side and got the job done. But the hardest part of the job was dealing with managers trying to get over. Once again it was all about giving people a fighting chance.
good,A best suited Research based company to start with in pharma sales.
good,"The work load is high and low, however you have lots of opportunity to learn more and to advance."
good,"Worked at Monsanto Holdings India Private Ltd. Global Shared Services, as a Process Associate for the Accounts Payables Team EMEA. – Sept 2010 to Oct 2011 ? Was responsible for the accounts payables process for France and Netherlands. ? Posting of PO, Non PO and freight invoices in SAP FICO module. ? The role required constant communication with the clients, periodical reporting and meeting stringent deadlines, individual monthly targets and SLA. ? Contributed to the Client relationship management and Process Flow improvement."
good,"This was the first fun job. Though there was more to be done, the joy of having something to do without complaining was spectacular."
good,I was the receiving lead at Bayer. I was responsible for receiving all the incoming freight. I would enter and trasfer product into SAP. I was responsible for performing cycle counts and maintaing a clean and organized warehouse. I would help shipping build pallets for international shipping.
good,"Working at Monsanto at the time was tedious due to the nature of the work and the work atmosphere did not do a lot to alleviate that, although they tried to encourage us with nice meals and ice cream treats since it was summer."
good,"Local bem diverso para se trabalhar, no bairro do socorro sp"
good,Buen ambiente laboral. Empresa aún muy austera a pesar del renombre. Empresa que te ofrece todas las prestaciones. Hace falta romper paradigmas.
good,Very good work environment if you're committed to working there. People are friendly and will help you with any task you have. Job tasks arent hard just time consuming which is a good way to make the time fly by.
good,"I didn't work at Bayer, I worked at Monsanto; but it made me fill this out anyways which is annoying.  I supported the Laboratories and engineering offices and greenhouses - it was certainly a huge learning experience"
good,"Great culture and people, but moving too centralized and losing the personal relationships.  Since Bayer acquired Monsanto, they are moving many jobs out of the plant."
good,"Very fast paced environment with many guidelines and requirements. Each day was based on a time frame that was essential to patients and pharmacy timelines.  Due to the confidential nature of the work environment, details and urgency must be adhered to."
good,L' esperienza è sempre molto interessante lo consiglio vivamente a tuttj
good,"Grazie ad un cv inviato da indeed ho avuto la grande opportunità di lavorare in Bayer crop science di Filago (Bg). "
good,"Bayer is good to work for and encourages employees to move into other jobs.  The pay and benefits could be more competitive.  The environment could be family like, depending on the area you work."
good,This was an annually seasonal job which provided the opportunity for me to learn the responsibilities of a crop merchandiser and to strengthen my customer service skills.
good,la cultura laboral es buena y en planta hay un buen ambiente
good,"The best part of my job are the people I work with. They are fantastic and like an extended family. The merger has made it difficult but I hope that this is temporary. The agricultural arena is also difficult with trade wars and weather, which impact not only production but life in industry."
good,Nice place to work.  Nice atmosphere - plenty to do.  A lot of variety in work and nice people to work with.  Always something new happening and enough time to get it done.
good,"Plant where I work at has a lot of inefficiencies but the benefits are decent for the amount of work we actually do.  Depending on management, you truly can get ahead in your care. While others simply don't care."
good,"Not much to say except what was supposed to be a long term contract got cut at 4 months. They launched new software updates during the peak season for purchasing of chemicals in April. Needless to say,  user acceptance testing failed miserably and that is why my job got cut short."
good,"Poor management who were ignorant and unresponsive to problems."
good,It’s something to pass time  as long as u work but the will let you go playing people are good I like it you would like it if you work there take it from me go see
good,"It was an awsome place to work. They encouraged over time, I hate that my department was desolved for the rest of the season but look forward to going back in august."
good,"I worked at Bayer only in a contract capacity, so I do not know the ins and outs of a real full time employee."
good,Its an okay place to work. I only worked there for a couple of months so really didn't get a feel for the company. I would say from what I saw it is a fun place to work at and cares about the community.
good,"Since Monsanto was acquired by Bayer, we no longer have some of the many perks as a Monsanto Employee. We used to receive free Box Club Seats to the Fox Theater shows, Light Shows at the MO Botanical Garden, Bush Stadium Ball Park Box seats,and the Holidays observed have decreased. (Martin Luther King Holiday is not observed by Bayer.) The criteria for Legacy Monsanto Admins being placed into new positions has changed. It used to be easier to move about the company. Bayer is looking for more ""seasoned"" Admin's which makes it difficult for some Admins ( 10 years or less) to move/support different positions which means some Admin's have lost their jobs."
good,Boa empresa para trabalhar com chance de crescimento.
good,The job was slow paced and the managers were bigot towards me and treated me unfairly. I felt they had too many employees for the little amount of work that we were asked to do.
good,"In a regular work day, the jobs I performed were very repetitive, slow, had long hours, and required you to be able to lift heavy bags or drive heavy machinery."
good,Long work days and night due to rotating 12-hour shifts. Work was tedious and some times very stressful. work place culture was extremely divided and managers showed favortism
good,bon etat d'esprit à travailler dans de bonnes conditions
good,é uma bos empresa e com uma visão atrativa para se trabalhar porem não tem muitas oportunidade de crescimento para os terceirizados.
good,"I worked at Monsanto during the merger and Bayer made big cuts to benefits, holidays, and job. Monsanto used easy to many contractors. Hopefully Bayer changes that."
good,"Au travers de ma carrière chez Bayer, j'ai eu l'opportunité d'évoluer régulièrement pour accroitre mes compétences et grandir dans la direction souhaitée."
good,"The whole purpose of working in this contract project was to bring together data from different areas in Logistics for audit compliance."
good,Great team of people and I enjoyed working as a consultant. I don't have a lot to comment on because I worked for them over a decade ago and I'm sure much has changed.
good,I worked at Monsanto in a summer job after college.  This was a productive number of months to transition from school to the work environment.  I enjoyed gathering data to improve facilities.
good,"okay to work, strictly, long hours seasonal, learn different kind of corn there is and what is use for, enjoyable, always something to do, friendly place to work"
good,Monsanto was a really good company to work for.  They provide a good work life balance as well as the opportunity to expand your skills within the organization.
good,I worked at Bayer through another company. Bayer outsourced their cleaning. I was on my own all the time and the people at Bayer were very kind to me. The most enjoyable time was doing the little xtra things for the ladies and they appreciated me for doing that
good,"Ein gutes Arbeitsklima. "
good,Independent working environment. Good location. Flexible working hours. Lack of communications between management and employees. Salary below average.
good,"Loved small company Berlex. Bayer purchased company and so did the layoffs. Some advancement, but not alot of opportunities. Lot of future products in pipeline."
good,"Es una empresa en la que la flexibilidad es lo que más se puede resaltar, flexy day, home office y horario de entrada flexible de 7 a 10."
good,Good place to work at....... A bit slow in planning and implementing things.. apart from that there was lot of learning both professionaly and personaly..
good,Too much bureaucracy. Dull office environment. Low team spirit. Only good thing is employee benefits and low work pressure which leads to good work life balance. But it's like a black hole since there's little to no growth opportunity.
good,High paced environment. Managers amd other staff were great. It was a great place to work. Time went by quickly and smoothly. Somethings could have been ran better and needs better communication skills
good,"Viele engagierte Mitareiter, aber Ego-zentrierte Organisation ist hinderlich für das Vorankommen des Gesamtunternehmen"
good,"Mi paso por Monsanto no ha sido positivo"
good,People and research management of up to 5 full time employees and up to 20 seasonal employees. Location was responsible for growing out corn test plots and locations on western Great Plains of U.S.
good,Learned a lot about corporate culture and that taking work home to complete is the norm partly due to staffing shortages but also expected. Unfortunately many managers are not fit for their position.
good,"hired 8 people at one time. not enough training for all of us at once. The company plays favorites. They were good about making sure we had  our breaks. With eight of us being hired at one time, scheduling was an issue and getting vacation time was a nightmare."
good,My time at Bayer was positive but the site I was working at was shut down. I feel it was too long ago for me to fairly evaluate the company at it's current locations.
good,"The company is successful for its innovations and general research practice, I'll give it that. However, the hierarchy of positions creates a large void between full-time and part-time employees."
good,"Great culture. Exciting work. You'll never be bored. But almost no chance to be converted to permanent employee. Sure, contracts are renewed indefinitely, but you won't get real pay increases you've earned by your blood, sweat and tears. They're not interested in retaining you for the long haul. You'll get a pat on the back and verbal recognition for your accomplishments, but that's it. And teams pay wildly different for the same work, so you've got to be careful what team you end up on. Company closes for days at a time, meaning you don't get paid. But you'll never be forced to work more than 40 hours a week, neither will you have the opportunity to do so. Great coworkers though."
good,"Bayer Diagnostics developments and markets products for the in vitro diagnostics market.  My job was in research and development, where I worked on applied research and trouble shooting"
good,"Management of major continous improvement projects as well as facility, production equipment and calibration section management. Management was supportive and everyone was engaged."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Monsanto. I dealt with about 4 layers of bureaucracy and I was a tech. I enjoyed the challenge of working with people across many different backgrounds and ethnicity. The work was challenging and fun; during a busy day it was entertaining and constantly changing and engaging. However for the work we actually did, we were underpaid as techs."
good,Takes on new products and innovation.  Promotion potential.  Fair and equitable pay and concern for employees.  Could improve oversight and communications.
good,"I eager to advance my career and to obtain a challenge. I feel that am ready to take on new responsibilities and would like to continue growing within my Profession & apply the skills i learned to the new position while gaining new skills ."
good,"This company offers great benefits and a good opportunity to develop your professional career. Nevertheless, the management is not that great and could be improved."
good,I am not comfortable with this being a required field as this has absolutely nothing to do with my current job seeking paradigm. This should NEVER be required for ANY reason whatsoever in my humble opinion.
good,"One thing about Bayer is the environment is ever changing.  Company promotes good culture.  However, not all management is in align with the Bayer culture."
good,"Fast paced environment, collaborative teams worked to produce high quality products."
good,"Durch das Schülerpraktikum konnte ich einen"
good,It was ok. It was fun working there and I personally learnt a lot from my colleauges and helped them as well in learning new stuff. I recommend working at this place
good,"I learned a lot from Bayer"
good,"I used to work with a great team at Bayer, however it would tend to happen here you would get a few good employees, and then the rest were very lazy. Task balance was not even. Management had its flaws as well. People would be quick to  throw you under the bus."
good,Ever changing personnel at top levels means ever changing strategies which leads to a tough workplace culture and distrust in many cases. Big name in pharma but not a great place to work.
good,Monsanto relies highly on contract employees with little chance of a permanent position. The contract employees do the majority of the work while the permanent employees spend half the day in meetings
good,"Compensation is good.  Management is not so good."
good,"Find someone in a thriving community that hasn't heard about Bayer and all their reaches into so many different corners of market place with prescription, OTC, dietary and many other health markets covered. They have a firm hold in the agricultural chemicals arena also."
good,"My position with Bayer was a temp job. While the project did need my some days, there were many days that were slow and left me wanting more to do. I have no idea if this is a reflection on the company as a whole. My supervisor was amazing though."
good,A good place to work. The management is highly engaging with regular meetings. A lot can be learned from the diverse teams working together. Mumbai office is better than the one in Gurgaon.
good,Good place to work.  Acquisition activities. Changing environment. Job uncertainty.  Excellent Co-workers.  Fun place to work.  Long commute. Overall benefits were good.
good,En esta empresa desgraciadamente hay personas con puestos altos y solo se encargan de humillar y soba jardines al personal de menor rango no te dan la opción de crecer dan preferencia a personas nuevas para un puesto al que uno aspira en ves de darle prioridad a uno se lo dan a personas nuevas que no saben nada de la operación
good,"Never the same day twice. Fast paced office environment, dealing with clients across the world.  Good office staff. "
good,"Many people in Management roles are incompetent at their jobs and it would be helpful for them to receive coaching and more leadership/management training."
good,"Highly matrix organization"
good,It was ok to do just not really my type of job but the days did somewhat go by fast. You just had to focus on the task at hand and make the most out of your time
good,"worked as BI developer and provided support to the business users."
good,"I have enjoyed working here but it has limited advancements."
good,"This company is good to work for as long you are completing your tasks on time, company is notorious small little things which can get under your skin, benefits are okay."
good,"Provide administrative support for Chief Marketing Officer, upper management and direct reports; maintained calendars, coordinated travel, prepare monthly T&E reports, maintained competitive database, mail & phone coverage, ordered office and computer supplies, process invoices, coordinate numerous off-site meetings and conferences."
good,"Small town plant life has lead to a ""family"" culture which means its about who you know and how much time you've been there when it comes to advancement.  Management is not interested in your personal career growth and there is a serious lack of training to aid you in advancement. "
good,"In my position, there was nothing challenging. The culture is very quiet and bland, which was difficult for me because I am used to more camaraderie and socialization among peers."
good,Typical forklift warehouse environment. Very safety oriented. Care about environment and local community. Drive forklift to move product around warehouse.
good,Bayer acquired the small site I worked at. It seemed as though they had no interest in our site at all. I was not impressed and I didn't care for their global management of small sites.
good,"When I first started at Bayer it was a great place to work.  The executives were fair and the pay very good.  The department was growing and there was a positive vibe at the workplace.  After two years things started to change, it got more stressful after the last few attorneys were hired.  I spent more time with one attorney just doing this attorney's filing and the job became monotonous.  Less time was allocated to doing calendar management, org charts, paying bills expense reimbursement.  The faculty increased and my job changed drastically and very quickly.  Company announced plans to move, major organization changes occurred after that."
good,"A very good company to work, good culture, great colleagues and lots of innovation. The management is also supportive of new ideas and encourages fearlessness."
good,"Decent place to work, not many full time employees. lots of contractors. No benefits and paid time off. Full time employees get god pay, and benefits."
good,"Working various departments. Excellent growth potential, managers support professional development. Ability to attend college to further education. Very supportive and eager to train and compliance focused."
good,Good people to work with. Avoid head of central controlling as tough to work with. Productive culture. Lots of people been around for ages so can be time consuming overcoming old mindset
good,"Creo que es una empresa que si cumpliera las reglas y pautas en las que dice se basa seria mucho mejor, con mejores resultados, pero a su vez mas lentos de lo esperado, y una seguridad a largo plazo. Creo que no tienen buenos sistemas para medir lideres, pero estan cerrados en no ver eso. No hay preocupacion por la promocion de los empleados, ni la estabilidad emocional de los mismos. Sin embargo, fuera del ambiente interno, externamente promueve un crecimiento profesional debido al desarrollo de la actividad en una multinacional burocratica con gran potencial. En mi equipo, al ser muy pocos, las tareas diversas que tenemos (marketing, ventas, supply, registro, desarrollo) hacen que uno este preparado para multiples posiciones y de manejo de situaciones complejas."
good,"Me enseñaron otras cosas aparte de lo que tenia aprender"
good,"My work for Monsanto is seasonal."
good,"did not know what was go to be built every day so that was fun to me, I learned a lot, I could be on any type of job any day great! Management could have been a little more helpful if they would talked to me a little more what do they need the job to be."
good,"Ethically, as a farmland owner in Saskatchewan, I had a problem in general with this company contributing to the contamination of plants and ground water."
good,"Answered incoming and outgoing phone calls, distributed incoming and outgoing mail, mailed statements and customer service."
good,"The work life balance is good with Monsanto and I got all the required training to advance in my career but from a salary perspective, is below average."
good,"Se trabajaba relativamente cómodo, he aprendido a liderar grupos, he conocido a mucha gente agradable. "
good,I met a lot of very nice people there that are still my friends.The company did offer insurance to Their employees and would always have nice holiday dinnes.
good,"Visita a Clientes Directos, para trabajar en la planificación de sus siembras de maíz y soja, ubicando de la manera más adecuada los híbridos de maíz y/o variedades de soja del portfolio."
good,"es una empresa socialmente  mejor amplia para tener trabajo, mejor ambiente de  trabajo"
good,"A typical day at work is about reading many emails and trying to reply most of them. "
good,"big, bright sunny warm wet large cool. Red White blue yellow orange green red white blue grey green white red square round triangle circle heat venting. keep america clean."
good,Great workload and variety but poor management and job security in my position there was practically unlimited freedom to complete task however needed
good,was let go after 25 years of loyal service along with 10 other 20 year+ veterans.  Young management did not recognize what veteran staff meant to territory.
good,"Empresa flexível, dinamica, ambiente agradável para se trabalhar."
good,"Was fine to work for over a decade ago, but this application insists I write a review. All I can say is they were fine to work for before the turn of the century."
good,"Rotating 12 hour shift work is difficult"
good,I only worked there for a year with no possibility of extension so basically no job security.  I found it difficult to meet new people in different work groups due to a clicky environment.  The people that were nice were very helpful or somewhat accepting.  Different work areas were given preferential treatment so that caused riffs among people at the company. There was definitely a lack of training provided by staff members either because they were too busy or it wasn't worth their time considering they were training short term contracts. Strong management was also lacking in both GH and Lab groups which caused poor morale.  Contract positions were not valued to the same extent as permanent staff.  I found that there was also poor communication within a work group as well as between work groups.
good,I liked working at monsanto. the people are friendly and willing to teach you how to succeed.  the people i worked with were great and i would apply there again if the opportunity arrises.
good,"-.Identifying a starting point for development of new skills."
good,"It was a slow day most days, but a good employee will find the job very rewarding regarding benefits and people. There was not alot of work to do in my particular position, but the work I did do, kept the business running. A typical day was just paying any bills that came in the mail and greeting people that came in. "
good,"- good work flow environment"
good,agradavel de trabalhar pelos colegas e pela gerencia sao todos boas pessoas
good,"Typical production job , met great people there. There was no room to advance so I decided that wasn't in my best interest."
good,"My time with this company was heavily based on hitting a set number of dials each day and was overseen by a outstandingly difficult manager who is no longer with the company, but was the catalyst for myself and many others to seek employment elsewhere."
good,Good job and a diverse company so there is a lot of certainty of the company living through any economical down turn. Fun place with nice people.
good,"Lugar de trabajo industrial con altos requerimientos de higiene, orden y seguridad. Programas de trabajo definidos, certificaciones internacionales y mejora continua en sus procesos."
good,Highly intensive work day but professional and helpful superior. Great atmosphere for professional growth and development.
good,"For a contract job, it was fairly demanding in terms of time needed to spend at the site.  No access from home to the computer network in order to process data, which again comes with it being a contract assignment but it makes work more difficult."
good,en Bayer no solo tuve compañeros de trabajo sino llegue a crear muy bonitas amistades. El personal que trabaja en Bayer se caracteriza por el compañerismo y el profesionalismo que hacen enaltecer el nombre de una empresa tan importante a nivel mundial
good,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa, cresci bastante como profissional, porém não havia perspectivas de projeção de carreira, sem planos de carreira ou incentivos motivacionais."
good,"There are no new challenges, same work is done by same employee."
good,"Good to work with Monsanto."
good,Work/Life Balance is outstanding.  Management heavy with very deep organizational structure.  PhD preferred for most leadership positions.
good,Great company to begin my career with. Was able to take on responsibility quickly and made it a point to seek out opportunities. Excellent benefits and vacation plans.
good,"A good company to work for with lots of talented employees, and best in class products that significantly impact the lives of the patients that use them.  Like any large organization, it has it's fair share of challenges and it tends to implement change slowly,"
good,"Manage a team of 66 contract workers with daily plans and assisted with HR policy's and payroll.  Enter over 250,000 data points in a timely manner."
good,"Sometimes good, sometimes bad...and when bad can be very bad! "
good,"Great co-workers, excellent management, challenging work. Learned a lot about various thing in the payment and acquisition cycle, as well as general auditing."
good,I believe this is a good company to work for in general. I unfortunately was not in a pleasant department. Management in TPS was horrible. No direction was given as I was a new employee. Manager was not capable if managing team. I was set up to fail and discriminated against. I had nightmares every night about this job.
good,This is a good company to work for with great compensation and benefits. It is often difficult to balance work and family with this position due to the time sensitive nature of the Radiology and Interventional side of business.
good,Limited work life balance. Great earning potential. Excellent product performance. Must be willing to relocate. Good opportunities for advancement. Overall good company to work for.
good,"-> I love mondays. Early morning we have team meeting to communicate with the clients. then work planning for the week."
good,"Management lack of communication system.  Unfairness raise and two different pay skill for the same kind of work.  Supervisors lack of good judgement, tend to take opiom from other than to question the person him/her ."
good,"Gostava muito do meu trabalho, mas a fraca administração não deixa você evoluir"
good,Many of the processes at Bayer are very inefficient.  Upper management often lacks clear direction.  They seem to be uncommitted to retaining top talent and often restructure.
good,"company in general is a good company to work for, however, there are some areas in certain departments that need addressed"
good,"Every morning was very damp and progressed into very dry, hot, and dusty day. I learned how to cooperate with others. My co-workers were mostly very easy going and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was having to pull tassels from 6-7 ft tall corn stalks when I am only 5'4"". The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with such a fantastic group of people."
good,Temp position that required mindless work for hours.  The most enjoyable part was working out in the greenhouses.  THe staff was fun and knowledgeable.
good,"Driving all over the state of North Dakota and Northern Minnesota maintaing/farming show plots. Maintaining plots begins in the spring where we plant the canola seed. We plant 10-13 variation of seeds in different rows. Next is spraying, followed by harvest."
good,"This experience has helped enhance the points mentioned below."
good,"Full timers have great perks, however, it seems the company culture has been developed to abuse the help of long term consultants.   This is disappointing considering the importance they stress in maintaining consumer relationships.  When Permatemp loyalty diminshes,  they ultimately lose a customer.     Compensation for college grads and the like is very lean."
good,"I learned and gained several new skills at Monsanto Company through  over the 16 years I was employed   with this company."
good,"When working in this company you got to be fully covered from head to toe. If your not you can get a infection with the plants your working with or a nasty rash. You always got to look for the signs that say ""warning"" and take a shower after working on the field."
good,"Great company overall, as a stepping stone, especially for plant related fields. Usually, we get there and if no one is present to open the door on time, then we clock in late but are paid for the full time. I learned a lot about cotton plants. The management is generally professional, but could work on organization a little. We wait around a bit, especially first thing in the mornings. The coworkers were nice;  some were great, others were working on it. The hardest part is standing on your feet and walking and dealing with dust and smells of chemicals. The most enjoyable is that is is actually very laid back in that you can play music, leave for lunches and take water breaks as needed due to the greenhouse heat."
good,"it was just a job to fill in until i could find something else. the supervisor was never around and the department lead was constantly in my face always expected me to rush while i was carrying cabinets that weigh 20 to 400 pounds. the department lead would also tell me so ship poor quality cabinets, some were scratched badly, dented or poor finish quality and then we would be talked to on a weekly bases because customers called and complained about the quality of the cabinets."
good,"It was a nice palace to learn about the biotech industry. They have a lot of nice perks for employees such as a work out area, a lunch area with many different options, etc."
good,"Time management . Day to day challanges , personal development . Updates my subject knowledge . Certified for all indications . Build up my confidence level . International correspondence ."
good,Typical german biotech company here in the bay area. Pay and structure is good.
good,"Establecimiento y seguimiento de las parcelas demostrativas"
good,Had off periods because of weather conditions. Rotated work duties often. Worked at the quarry itself so never really saw management. Had to fill out pre work and post work reports on equipment. Also help with the demolition set up of explosives.
good,"Very busy kind of job, you always have something to do, but time always goes fast. And you meet a lot of people working, and the more you work the better the tips are."
good,Effectively communicating to Monsanto’s farmers nationwide encouraging them to assist in nominating school districts in their area to apply for educational grants offered by Monsanto Agriculture Company that promotes mathematics and science.  Successfully exceeding required confirmations of customer participation.
good,Great working environment. Odd shift rotation. Lots of overtime required.
good,"A great experience as I started in the tech field. I was able to learn a lot from a great team through the years while working with a diverse site of individuals. Arriving to work, enjoying a cooked to order breakfast in the cafe with co workers would be a typical morning. Hitting the ground running would immediately follow to tackle the days issues. The most enjoyable part was definitely meeting everyone there."
good,"I learned hybrid seed production management.how do area planning,how do increase quality productivity .etc"
good,Keep up the good work.  Blah blah stop forcing me to review.  Otherwise I will review Indeed which is being annoying by making me do this and no allowing to do the the function of which I came to this website to do.
good,I have learned many things regards to my profession in this company. Local Management was very good and helpful they always shown the way to success.
good,"It is a decent place to work an the pay is alright, but the only problem is most people have been temporary employees there for 3+ years and are still waiting to be hired on full time."
good,I learned alot from working for this company the hours are good the pay was ok and the people  are friendly . i just didnt see any room for advancement
good,"Report to National Sales Manager. "
good,Monsanto was a good company that provided many opportunities for a young chemist.
good,Its always fun to clean up a mess so no one gets hurt and it always helps people learn what they did wrong
good,"Good for Beginners,"
good,Very structured workplace. Co-workers are not to friendly. Everyone stays on task and to their selves. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the executives in the company.
good,A empresa é ótima para trabalhar o porem que trabalhei de terceira e não da muita oportunidade para mulheres.
good,I learned a lot about being in a lab environment and a lot of training in cell culture.
good,Providing Solutions to the Industrial Technology field was a Rewarding Experience with Diverse Situations making an Exciting Place to Work.
good,Bayer was a pretty good place to work.  I left because it was clear that my division would be eliminated.
good,Great company to work for called on OBGYN's in Central PA. Contract was not extended for entire sales force.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, solo que muy cortado el trabajo por cuestiones ajenas al personal de planta. problemas politicos con la empresa exteriores."
good,"Can be a good place to work , but they seem to be going through turmoil.  If you are looking for job security this may not be the best fit."
good,"It's an okay work life balance. The hardest thing I hated was being on call 24/7 and not having coverage for when I wanted to travel. Also, I got called out numerous times as an engineer for non engineering issues."
good,A good position for young student looking for a quick seasonal job.
good,"Morning greetings to my team members, log on , check e-mails action them , start entering orders received via Fax , E-mail and EDI."
good,"Good place to work as its one of the largest companies in which I have my first selling skills , in which it was a good start"
good,A typical day at Bayer was always pleasant of course some days were busier than others but it alwas ended positive. I learned so much about the company as well as my peers and I enjoyed every last one of them.
good,Cutting edge technology available to create great products. Management of people and their development is lacking.
good,"Monsanto paid well.  We had to swing shifts.  We worked 8-4, 4-12, 12-8, within a month.  The work was heavy but I was young and I could handle it.  We generated yarn for carpet.  "
good,"	Team Management"
good,"Bayer has a great location, decent benefits and plenty of intelligent and helpful people and is generally a stable place to work."
good,"Friendly people and we have a great team but our department is structured in a way that growth opportunities are very limited,dealing with difficult creditors ,i enjoy doing my work accurate and meet deadlines."
good,"I have learned that even though you are a leader you have to give all your support to the employees in order for you to get the best out of them."
good,The company is very strategic.
good,Big company atmosphere. Great for learning corporate life and thinking.
good,Good Company to work for. Bayer sold the pharma division in 2004 and 90% of sales force was displaced
good,The most enjoyable part of working at BAYER is that it is fast paced and much diversity within ones role. Never the same day twice.
good,There isn't a well defined careerpath but a Great Work Life Balance
good,The place is self managed but the teamwork is necessary for success.
good,• Responsible for providing internal and external support to assure access for all data control applications.
good,was great place to work
good,Run a batch process for producing automotive paint pigment.
good,Need time to be integrated with Bayer's culture since it's been acquired by Bayer from a small agricutural company.
good,- Un bon équilibre entre manipulations techniques et gestion de projet
good,Typische dag op het werk.
good,"O dia a dia é movimentado e, por mais que haja rotinas, deve-se trabalhar com muita flexibilidade;"
good,"Is becoming more and more German centric for the shared functions. Somewhat political, but less than you might expect for such a large organization. Good culture, good pay/benefits. Has a tendency to make things more complicated than needs to be......making it difficult to get things accomplished. Will struggle as healthcare changes in the coming years."
good,"The company has had a lot of changes, but it was OK. Great management and flexibility. Pay was great and benefits were good. There was a lot of relocating"
good,"The Germans are taking over ..."
good,"it is easy to get hired in a lab there, but there is no room for advancement for the contract lab workers. they rotate them in and out every couple of months. if you are so lucky to keep your contract going, you onlyl have 3 years to work for them in that role then you are let go."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Bayer facility for as long as I did and wish I could've stayed longer.The job is pretty simple, just pickup,sort, and deliver mail to every building in the facility. The people are very nice and polite and are not too hard on you once you make an error or two. However, while working there I was told that my contract was being extended and was ready to complete another set of months until I was let go without any warning or heads up. They did not specify on the exact reason why I was let go which was rather frustrating since I thought I was doing a good job and gave me no back up plan to fall back on; which pretty much leaves me desperately job searching. The worst part about that experience was that I wasn't able to retrieve my personal belongings that I left in my office since I was told not to make any contact with the company after my contract ended. My best advice is not to get too comfortable working there and to continue to pursue other opportunities once your contract starts."
good,"The Service Centre is a good place to stay forever, but if you have no intention to grow. "
good,"good company but I think its time for me to move on. they need new management and things are different in every site."
good,"A empresa prega igualdade, inclusão, liberdade, e principalmente direitos igualitários entre homens e mulheres, porém ainda peca no perfil da liderança que não se preocupa com mudanças."
good,"Bayer is a good company with a strong focus on the customer. There is not, in my experience, a focus on the growth of the employee. There is also a lack of knowledge and experience at the mid-management level."
good,need more enthusiastic management and more collaboration between department. need to really apply Bayer values and not only talk about it. far beyond the applying those values.
good,No room to grow. Nice environment but they treat the contractors like we are worthless at times. Contract agencies don’t care about you once you have gotten the job.
good,"Its my fortune to work with the Multi National firm, i learn a lot here all my collegues are very supportive, Laws & Comliance strictly followed in this company."
good,I have worked at Bayer in many different roles over the past 20 years.  I really enjoy the work culture. Bayer really cares about the work life balance
good,Good  it was my dad doing the most work thou he was the real contractor.  But i really worked hard for him counting rows making sure. Everbody was doing thete job. Making sure everbody got payed
good,"Merhaba,"
good,"Ótimo clima organizacional, profissionais muito qualificados."
good,"Empresa engessada, burocrática e  sem    dinâmismo"
good,"I think working culture is excellent, however no stability since the company is restructuring so many times since I started working there. There is always fear of lay off."
good,"This is a very male-dominated company that, at the time, had limited promotional opportunities for women.  "
good,Typical day for me is very fast paced and sometimes tiring because i do a lot of jobs from payroll to shipping as well as receptionist so i help out in the warehouse and the office on different days or at different times depending on the help
good,"This company offers the employee a chance to learn new skills in a fast paced, technical environment.  The ability to compete for other jobs in the company are made available."
good,I had an extremely encouraging manager and the team worked together to make a great work environment. I had the opportunity to learn many other facets while on the job.
good,This job was monotonous as I repeated the same job over and over. My boss was a real sweetheart and explained different aspects of the job which made it more interesting to come in every day.
good,"There was always something to do, from my normal CAD work to putting up vinyl signage, in-house gym & cafe, plus the people were easy going & fun to work with."
good,"The environment was very structured. I worked mainly in the project management area of the company. I was not a project manager. My group supported the project manager from an IT perspective. Since their world was very structured via procedures and reports, our work became very structured - almost rigid. I'm not saying that was bad, simply stating an observation. It was just part of the company culture."
good,"Grande Azienda Multinazionale di innovazione e lavoro per migliorare la qualità della vita."
good,"The work was very intense and high pressure, but the culture is great there.  I would recommend this to anyone who is in the ag sciences to check out.  A good company, but very stressful workload at times."
good,I found myself constantly looking for new projects because I was done with my tasks and no one really helped me or wanted my help until it was time to go home.
good,"None of us is as smart as all of us together. That’s why we have developed two initiatives that collect the best ideas and solutions from all Bayer employees: “WeSolve” allows employees to submit challenging questions and seek answers from colleagues, and the Bayer Ideas Pool elicits suggestions for improvements to the company."
good,"Peculiar that you can have 10+ years of experience and do the job better than anyone else but are unlikely to advance without a degree. Even if the degree is in a field that has nothing to do with your present job or the job you wish to move into, you still need a degree for this to even be a possibility"
good,"En IT el entorno es bastante internacional, cordial y hay buenas oportunidades de aprendizaje y mucha flexibilidad en cuanto al horario laboral. "
good,"you learn a lot with the Monsanto courses, however turn around is substantial, and no job security. You never know when they will replace you. Older crowed is safe but new comers are citizen non-stop. Benefits are good (except very low match 401K).  "
good,Tout va bien sauf que je suis en quête de nouveaux défis et challenges.
good,"A empresa é muito boa para trabalhar dar muitas condições para que possamos crescer profissionalmente e pessoalmente também tem muitos benefícios que nos da tranquilidade para que possamos execer nossas atividades com segurança, porém como ela é conduzidas por pessoas e são muitas diferentes umas das outra encontramos pessoas preconceituosas que acham porque temos alguma deficiência acham que estamos só pra preencher uma vaga de porcentagem na empresa."
good,"Empresa oferece excelentes benefícios. Tem projetos de melhoria de qualidade de vida, porém os seus executivos tem pouco autonomia para tomada de decisões o que torna a empresa um tanto lenta. Quanto as decisões são aprovadas acabam comprometendo a qualidade de vida dos colaboradores, por que ai tem que ser a toque de caixa."
good,"Good place to work if you didn't mind being kept on as a temp w/o benefits for ever - or until someone killed your project and layed everyone off. That was then, before Pharmacia/Pfizer/Solvay/Monsanto²."
good,The people at Bayer was really nice. I was there for 3 years and I learned a lot. I created a lot of relationships from this place. I really miss working there.
good,"Management and the Colleagues are really good and helpful.The workplace culture is so good, developers are given enough time for completing the tasks .The hardest part is fixing up the prod issues right away."
good,"Managed seasonal employee's, troubleshooting and maintain equipment, maintained safety program, drove forklifts tandum trucks and bucket trucks."
good,"The employers and co-workers are very friendly here. The safety guidelines at Monsanto help to keep all employees safe inside of work, and are also helpful outside of work sometimes."
good,"Proporciona todas las herramientas de trabajo de calidad porque asi tambien exige, se adquiere la experiencia de relacionarse con todo tipo de personas alta, media, baja lo que mas me gusto fue el trabajo de campo en compañia de personal independiente a la empresa,"
good,me siento tranquilo aprendo cada dia algo nuevo en base a mi entorno laboral con unos compañeros de trabajo solidarios y me gusta que es muy extricta en su entorno laboral
good,"We work as a line or team to get the daily expected out at the best speed to have quality products and keep safety a main concern. I have learned how fill on certain lines,palletize,and just get along with great people.The management is on and off good just depending on the manger that is there.Most of my co-workers on my line are fun while still being hard working to make the time go by a little quicker.Most enjoyable part of the job are the hour break for lunch and most of the people during the full shifts work.While the hardest part is just the heat."
good,"Am Interested to learn and improve myself"
good,A typical day at work at monsanto is very easy. I learned about different germination of seed. there are alot of supervisors always around. I had very nice co-workers although most of them did not speak english. The hardest part of the job was not being able to understand all of my colleagues. The most enjoyable part of the day for me was doing the stretches.
good,"Empresa global, boa para se trabalhar e se desenvolver, contato direto com pessoas em diferentes níveis hierárquicos."
good,Un bon management qui inclut le collaborateur dans son processus et qui le responsabilise en lui confiant différents projets
good,"This company used to be run by locals back when it was Cutter and Miles Labs, but was purchased by Bayer, who brought in their management, causing a culture clash.  Lots of talent, and great people, but hard to move up.  You can keep your same job until you retire."
good,"- established chemical and pharmaceutical co."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for.....as with most divisions, job security is a concern......job share needs to be looked into.....too many positions with 1 person doing the job of 3."
good,Monsanto is a great company to work at. Every team I have worked on has been very receptive and open to new thoughts and ideas. Teams are committed to the business and to impacts surrounding the business. For contractors it is a great place to gain work experience but a difficult place to advance or gain full time permanent employment.
good,"Rapporti di lavoro con persone con varie mansioni:"
good,Worked 12 hour shift.  very busy job.  Supervised 90 employees per shift.  Directed work force daily to assure production was met in a safe and effective way. the hardest part of the job was working shift work.
good,"I learned lots of thing while working in company , like enhancement in application , ticket handling."
good,Learned a bunch of different things within a biotech company.  Pay was great as a temp.
good,This division of the company has since been divested and under new management.
good,"A great place to work in terms of perks and industry presence.  Relatively forward-thinking in their approach to work, but lacks for work-life balance, despite claims to the contrary.   While I cannot speak for other divisions, within the area of oncology data data management (R&D), the notion of any such balance is a joke and in place of any so-called balance, the better descriptor would be ""burn out"".  "
good,"- good organization to work with."
good,"A typical day will start with site inspection and feed back from shift employees including security."
good,"A empresa tem uma estrutura muito considerável, visava trabalhar de maneira que mantivesse a integridade dos funcionário, em sua política  a segurança em primeiro lugar. Tinha como base realizar as atividades em equipe para uma melhor produção. Pode-se dizer que só horário não era muito flexível passávamos quase 12 horas desde a rota que fazíamos somado com o expediente, são alguns fatores que posso descrever da empresa."
good,Excellent benefits but work schedule prevents you from having much of a life outside of work.
good,"Sempre muito corrido, tendo que ser flexível o tempo todo, manter a calma para lidar com os colaboradores de uma forma geral."
good,"HR Assistant to HR Staff"
good,"Veiligheidsregels heeft dit internationaal bedrijf hoog in het vaandel. Grote zorg voor de veiligheid van het personeel.  Hiervoor worden jaarlijkse verplichte trainingen gegeven."
good,"Always changing and evolving, Bayer is always reinventing the wheel."
good,Bayer is a hardworking company that is doing important work in the field of medicine that provides vital research and pharmaceutical products to the world. Bayer cares about the health and well being of its employees.
good,Monsanto is overall a very good place to work. Most managers will let you do your job with very little looking over your shoulder. Only wish they would hire more regular full-time employees rather than relying on contractors for the majority of their IT support.
good,Good pay but poor management (Too Political and afraid to innovate)
good,I worked for this company as a lab assistant for about 17 months they had good culture however it was a challenging job with little reward I however did get experience in a lab and on field
good,"I have been at Bayer for 7.5 years as a Sr. Administrative Assistant. Unfortunately my current manager is a micro manager, does not value or appreciate her support staff. (this is why I am leaving). The SBU within Bayer has no consistantcy on how they treat the support staff."
good,A typical day at work is long and boring but interactive. I learned Fork Lift operations. Management sorted themselves out towards the end of my temporary service. Culture was diverse but minimal in barriers. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying on the fork truck.
good,es una buena empresa exelente atencion al trabajador
good,O clima de trabalho e bom mas as exigências são altas e muita presão desde managment.
good,"Good place to work. Summer time are boring if there isn't any field work to do.  Field work consist of roguing, inspecting fields. Nice to get outside on a sunny day, if fields are not muddy. Then you get alittle dirty."
good,"No room to become regular, but they need the help of contractors to continue. I would recommend this as a starter job if looking at going into this field."
good,"Good workplace and environment, have many departments such as packaging, process, warehouse, management, human resources. All of them are very peaceful work and have good communication"
good,Overall Bayer was a good company to work for.  They do care about their employees and their wellbeing.  I would give someone the advise to work there if they were offered a position and asked for my opinion.
good,Il mio lavoro è vario anche se un po' ripetitivo. Azienda solida.
good,I could complain about all the little issues that Bayer has but I don't want to focus on that. I don't know anyone that is so happy with where they work that they end up skipping to work ( unless you work and Pixar or Skywalker Ranch). Overall I enjoyed the bottom line.... we make medicine that helps people live better lives. I enjoyed being apart of that world for the time I was there.
good,"very competitive, high expectations with little direction, poor management, ineffective leadership communication through business transitions and corporate initiatives constantly changing and being roled out. creates stressful environment; always feel like nothing is good enough"
good,Bayer was a great opportunity to joing the pharmaceutical industry.  i learned a great deal and enjoyed the working environment.  Only reason I left was for opportunity professionally.
good,"A place with high level of responsibilities ,challenges. I learned extensively during my employments with Byer, experience that would help me significantly in future"
good,"Unfortunately, Bayer decided to close our site after a little less than 2 years. They handled business differently from Merck, which was unfortunate. Our Managers were great people."
good,"* Its as if Belcan has not shopped their health insurance in years."
good,"The people I worked with were great but the job was more than I bargained for. Quotas were not talked about in the job interview. Sales quotas were not talked about at all. I don't mind casual incidental sales but not aggressive sales. Besides the maintenance, repair, installation and sales, we were also acting as account managers which took up too much time making it hard to perform my basic duties."
good,"was a fabulous place to work until merger in 2015.  Lots of growing pains since, exacerbated by unrealistic expectations and fuzzy communication from upper management"
good,"Trabajo sacrificado."
good,"The broad list of responsibilities provides an interesting and ever-changing work environment.  However, too many responsibilities leads to the inability to accomplish any well."
good,"On y apprend beaucoup de choses dans cette entreprise. et pour ma part c'est une belle experience d'un point de vue professionnel pur. "
good,Work was generally easy and laid back and the hours and pay were alright as well. Some management was alright some was unorganized. Heat was never really a problem as we could take breaks often and always had water. Most of the people were great and fun to work with.
good,"Bayer is a company where people enjoy working. The management really promotes work-life balance, and they take care of their companies. Bayer really cares."
good,BBSPI is a place where employees are enjoying the work as the company really promotes work-life balance. Our management really takes care of their employees.
good,"Es una empresa de una larga historia mundial y nacional."
good,"Working in the Ag industry can be fulfilling-you feel as if you are helping the world.  However, Monsanto is a high pressure place to work, and it is not for everyone.  While there is an emphasis on work-life balance, it is sometimes hard to reconcile with the focus on driving results and meeting stretch goals."
good,"A trabajar en base a resuktados y objetivos especificos."
good,You cannot get hired to another position from a contract role.  I work in the lab and the Growth Chambers setting up the experiments and maintaining the equipment.
good,"Monsanto is a great place to work and I love my job. My boss is great, she gives me all the room I need to be creative, managing my own time. Unfortunately I am a contractor with no benefits package."
good,"Good work place, with a lot of new products launching for the past years. The crisis in Greece made me  look for jobs abroad because with this situation it is very difficult for young people to fulfill their work dreams, because of  the very little opportunities that exist."
good,Monsanto has a great research culture.  The organization is highly matrixed. Some functions are centrally managed but many are regional or functional matrices.
good,"Working seemingly long hours outside doing tedious field labor is good for the soul. Attention to detail is a must as, one mistake could mean more re-work for the entire crew."
good,"Human oriented but not competitive, friendly but challenging work environment, too much limitation due to current regulations. Difficult to adopt new trends."
good,"Os dias de trabalho que mais me completaram foram quando eu atuava na minha área, de enfermagem e trabalho."
good,"Great company, just need a higher salary.  Can't afford to send my son to college on this salary."
good,"having had to carry through my project without supervision, learned how to be self dependent and having to step up as a supervisor to the field workers,"
good,"Job for a single person, tons of hours and great benefits. Unorganized management and 10 different bosses."
good,"Um dia agitado, com muitas cobranças e bem cansativo, pois ao chegar em casa não tinha hora para acabar as funções no computador. Aprendi a ser uma profissional melhor e entregar o meu melhor. A minha ultima gerente, foi uma pessoa fora de serie, prestativa, humana, parceira, que compartilhava da sua experiencia, enviava feedback e era clara e objetiva. No trabalho nao fazemos amigos, devemos ser estritamente profissional. Receber material, muitas caixas, e o meu material fica armazenado na casa da minha mãe. O trabalho em si, dinâmico, o dia-a-dia com clientes completamente diferentes, realização de tarefas em que me identifico, como vendas, negociações, contratos, espaços, eventos, etc."
good,"Libertad de trabajo"
good,This job was very dependent on time management. We had a quota of product to make and time frame to do it. We also had formulas to guide how we make our different products. If there is a slight miscalculation the entire batch of product is worthless. I was required to be fully focused and on task at all times.
good,Bayer was very professional.  I began work in Process Improvement and was allowed to explore ideas and encouraged experiment with those ideas in order to improve the process of production.  Bayer gave me opportunities to self growth that I haven't really been allowed in my current position.
good,"Durch Gleitzeit erlangt man eine gewisse Flexibilität. Je nach Abteilung ist auch homeoffice teilweise gestattet. Wie überall steht und fällt eine Arbeit immer mit den Kollegen und dem Chef."
good,"trabalho sem problema,mais foi sobre segurança empresa muito rigida em segurança ,principalmente espaço confinado;otima gerencia,sem problema,nao tem parte dificil,de saber que agente ta trabalhando em uma empresa que se preocupa com agente,voltado a segurança ."
good,Buen entorno de trabajo. Grandes posibilidades de aprendizaje. Problema de inestabilidad laboral en función del negocio a nivel global
good,Great team. A lot of work. Fun and Stressfull specially in closing time.
good,"I like working for Bayer, they have a really diverse team. From the Shared Services we support all other countries of the business which gives us a good exposure and opportunities to develop."
good,I love working here.  I wish they had fewer contract workers and more full time direct hires.  They have way too many contract workers.  The contractors have invested many years in the company. It's time for the company to invest in them and flip them to full time already.
good,"The typical day would start by waking up in nice weather and getting on the bus to go to fields, make new friends, do your job, and get nice benefits when going back to school."
good,"Bayer is a good company to work for when things are stable.  At the moment it is very unclear if you will have a job in the future.  The company has plans to move department to Switzerland.  No one knows when this will happen and who will be affected.  Also, they are in financial crisis after buying another company."
good,"Boa empresa para o crescimento profissional, empresa de grande porte com boa opção de trabalhos diversor"
good,"buena empresa poco crecimiento profesional, el día a día era muy ocupado, la cultura laboral fue nueva y nuevo idioma."
good,Learned a great deal about budget creation processes in addition to product costing. Occasionally there were lulls where no work was available without assistance and coworkers were busy. Overall great learning experience but that line of finance was not for me.
good,"Matrix organization can be difficult to navigate, once one learns how, it can be a dynamic and rewarding place to work.  Relationships and networking is part of the culture"
good,Trabalhei no que gosto durante 13 anos.  Infelizmente o grupo teve que ser desfeito devido a corte de custos.
good,"Bayer was generally a good place to work, however it is not for everybody. Their hiring practices can be discriminatory and is contrary to their own corporate hiring policies."
good,"Learned importance of compliant and ethical promotion."
good,"Fun place to work, but work was inconsistent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture. They really care about the employees and show it by having a lot of fun activities happen outside of work."
good,Emprego temporário mas fundamental para adquirir experiência profissional e pessoal.
good,"great for science and tech post grads to start out, and has lots of connections to the donald danforth plant science center if they are more your thing. Amazing coworkers from all around the world, but then again no ethical employment or consumption under late capitalism"
good,"While the role is primary restricted to the responsibilities assigned,a self driven attitude person is given the forum and platform to deliver and meet self and organisations goals beyond the call of duty.Work culture emulates with most MNC work culture that is laid out basis the policy framework of the organisation"
good,"Bayer Built is a great place to work. They offer great full time packages. The benefits are extremely generous. However, the management is very one sided. They like the number of employees they have. Unfortunately, they don't seem to think it's necessary to pay the ones worth keeping a little bit more."
good,"Being a Sr. Administrative Assistant the culture at Bayer is good. Unfortunately it is very difficult to advance as an admin. The only way to advance is to work for a higher level person. You can not grow within the position you are in even though there is space to grow within the position, there is no real way to gain in way of salary."
good,"Monsanto is a very good company to work for, however, the political environment makes it very difficult to (1) get hired in and (2) get any type of promotion opportunities."
good,"Pouco tempo mais já com muito aprendizado na parte de aministrativo, conferencias de notas, lançamentos de notas no sistema,  criação e ajustes de planilhas."
good,"Capacitación muy profesional."
good,"As with all Corporations it had it's downside. Profitability was always at the forefront and sometimes overshadowed quality of the product that was being produced. The overall working environment was enjoyable, made mostly that way by the great group of people I worked with. I would recommend the company as they do provide wonderful benefits and a solid work/life balance."
good,"Aprendé de todo el proceso y manejo de hibridacion el trabajo consiste inspeccionar a los personales durante de polinización y e"
good,"Work life is good."
good,A company fair to all employee and take care of their employee. They put their employee first safety. My team is so approachable and so friendly.
good,"Good Place to work. "
good,"Seasonal work, good pay, and not a difficult job, but once they run out of work, they let you go with no warning. Basically you just sit and count seeds all day long."
good,"Empresa com foco em resultados com cultura voltada para vendas. Estrutura de trabalho com ampla visão corporativa."
good,In this company I have learnt different things related to CST &  VAT under very supportive & Co-ordianting Team members.
good,"É uma empresa boa ,tem algumas coisas para melhorar ."
good,"I really liked my manager and the territory. My counterparts did not want to work with a new rep, so I pretty much worked as if I were the only rep there.I did very well in this position also."
good,Big company with lots of employees. Good benefits and very goal oriented
good,"Avant d etre racheté par un groupe Français,  L entreprise Bayer offrait de grands avantages à ses collaborateurs. Ceux-ci les motivaient.Nous avions constamment l idée de challenge qui nous faisait également être coopératifs, unis, mais droits car les produits étaient exportés dans le monde entier (l image de marque devant être respectée).Après la vente de l entreprise, j ai dû partir à cause du salaire"
good,Great place to work.  The people are very affable and helpful.  The staff goes out of their way to work as a team to make sure that you have what you need to do your job.  Very team oriented.
good,E uma empresa. Boa de se trabalha muito organizada em tudo q faz e esta sempre correndo atras para um melhor para seus funcionarios
good,The facility I worked in was full of good people. There is a 401(K) matching contribution program. The location that I was at really did have a good atmosphere. I strictly left due to low wages and being stuck in a lab I didn't like.
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho nessa área nunca um dia é igual ao outro, é sempre muito intenso, diferente, produtivo, com necessidade de decisões rápidas, assertivas e coerentes. "
good,"Great company to work for if you have the required education to stay employed with them, they are currently restructuring right now so its not the most organized but im sure within a couple years it will all smooth out and be a wonderful place to work"
good,Worked in the IDC for Bayer Business Services. Known for amazing salaries and best in the industry increments + employee benefits. However the company no longer exists as the entity was acquired by Capgemini India pvt ltd.
good,"Working here was okay, some days better than others. Some co-workers treated me differently for my race but there was nothing I could do since they were higher ranked."
good,There are lots of activities that employee would enjoy. They listen to the needs of their employees and do what can be work on. Many are so active and competitive in all process improvements.
good,Pollinated corn. this consists of three tasks repeated for thousands or corn. It is not hard and can be done quite quickly if one cares. However very few people care about self pollinating corn
good,Bayer is een fantastische organisatie voor mensen die graag binnen algemeen beleid werken. Voor iemand die zijn creativiteit wil gebruiken en mee wil denken op operationeel niveau is er te weinig ruimte.
good,Bayer has taught me a lot about how to approach customers and managers. The only reason i am looking for another employer is the hours and the pay rate. I love my boss and what i do everyday
good,"A typical day starts with review of my daily objectives,list of accounts to call on, focus on high potential account customers, review of clinical reprints and sales resources to support clinical claims; delivering service and resources to partner with key account personnel; providing clinical information regarding Xarelto and/or Adempas and identifying patients based on product approved indications who would benefit from treatment with promoted products and asking for the business for those identified patients; follow up to assure patient access to needed medications and check patient outcomes."
good,"Salary is quite good for entry level"
good,"im Team zu arbeiten"
good,"ótimo local de trabalho , rotinas pertinentes ao cargo , sem complicação"
good,"A very physically demanding day, but very enjoyable. My co-workers were fun and interesting."
good,I would get on the bus at around 4:30 every morning and about an hour and a half bus ride we would arrive at the corn fields. I worked anywhere from 6-7 hours a day.
good,Luling does not have opportunity for advancement and leadership is lacking.
good,My first job out of college where I got to work with some great people in a small town.
good,"Buen puesto de trabajo, buen ambiente laboral y buena remuneracion"
good,"A typical day at work either involved throwing seed bags, or doing field research. I learned a lot about the growth of corn and how muddy fields could get. I learned how to sort through grain in the lab. The culture was mostly white people, and hispanics. The hardest part of the job was the summer weather. The most enjoyable part was the money for sure. They paid me 75 cents a mile on top of my hourly pay."
good,I'm thankful for the opportunity that Monsanto allowed me to have by hiring me. At 15 years old it was a great way to experience what it was like to have a job and work for my own money.
good,"It was great to work with the team. The manager was extremely open-minded to the business and new ideas. And he extended my research after my presentation, which was really good."
good,I enjoyed my time at Monsato. I learned an immense amount of knowledge about different weed types and the ways to eradicate them as needed for proper crop growth.
good,i work at a prodect  sales groth and we provee the hard work we work long hour at 11 pm we always work with honesty and respect our seniors . this company is the best
good,My team is great!  Management seems very concerned with my development to ensure that I am prepared to complete my assigned duties.
good,"La empresa hacia incapie y hacia conciencia sobre los riesgos de trabajo por lo que su prioridad era la constante capacitación sobre el uso apropiado del equipo de seguridad personal, donde los trabajadores son lo más importante; aprendí a manejar personal y ayudar a trabajar en equipo, donde todos lo encargados y administrativos cada quien aportaba  ideas y tiempo; al igual que los otros médicos del corporativo; la parte mas difícil del trabajo fue convencer algunas personas a enrolarse al grupo e integrarse a las actividades; lo que mas me gusto fue las capacitaciones y los resultados positivos de acuerdo a los estándares de calidad"
good,"Diariamente visitar 12 medicos y 3 farmacias, tratar de ingresar productos a Hospitales y Clínicas."
good,i learn how to detassel corn and learned how to sort corn. and great living quarters
good,"un ambito laboral muy bueno,con desarrollo de actividades normales, tuve como conocimientos manejo de maquina asi como clark auto elavadores, meisser, retractiles,zorras electricas. en la entrada esta la vigilancia a mas o menos 10 metros a la derecha esta la gerencia. compañeros muy capacitados y buenas relaciones interpersonales. no ay parte dificil con aprendizaje y atencion se aprende. desarrollar mis conocimientos y capacidades me gusto."
good,I got a chance to work with many intercompany department and business units which helped me to unsertsand the working of organisation
good,I design or redesign medical equipment for our facility with two othe designers. Every employee here is very friendly and easy to talk to.
good,"Typically you are given one job in the morning and you do that job for the whole day unless told otherwise. When working there during harvest or planting seasons, you will be given a specific job and will always meet at the fields instead of the plant."
good,A typical day at work started at 7am and ended between 3 and 4. Most of the time was spent in the fields and in the sun. It was hard work and i probably would have gone back another summer if I had more people i knew working with me.
good,the people are nice management is ok they just promise you a certain job duty and never go as planned easy work environment is somewhat clean tight security
good,Stood around half the time because the supervisor never gave things to do. never taught me how to do things i didn't know how to do
good,I worked for Bayer for over 16 years. Bayer is a well paying company to work for with lots of career growth potential and flexible work schedules.
good,Prepare different vegetable seeds for tests. learned of the different vegetable seeds. The workplace was joyful and the workplace culture was diverse  Very easy work assignments. Mostly standing up.
good,"a good work environment, fun people to work with. Management was very kind and supportive. Great safety features. Room to move up in the company that comes with higher pay"
good,"On a typical day at Monsanto's we arrive early in the morning and get debriefed and then went out in the field and start working. In this job we pollinated corn which involved a simple process of bagging shoots, bagging tassels, pollinating shoots the next day with pollen the bagged tassels this process was done every day. In this job I learned the skills of pollinating different types of corn in a timely and efficient manor. We had many managers at Monsanto's all of which were easy to get along with. However, they were managers so sometimes the could be a little strict. This job consisted of many workers most were easy get along with. However some were not as easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the getting up as early as four in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting work with a large variety of people"
good,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar, ótimos benefícios, fácil acesso a gerencia, além de horário flexível."
good,Wonderful teams and work progress attitude it is a great company to start and progress. The site in San Diego was perfect for small research facility.
good,"Also ich bewerbe seit  20 Jahren bei Bayer Schering in Bergkamen immer wieder  bekommt man eine Absage."
good,Overall a company that has room for growth but leadership changes limits the ability to advance.  Has senior employees who know the job but many be reluctant to teach others.
good,"A carga horária de trabalho boa, produto de ótima qualidade, bons benefícios."
good,Aprendi a trabalhar em grupo e liderança. Que o trabalho em equipe quando se feito com qualidade e respeito sai melhor que o esperado.
good,Manche Vorgesetzten nehmen ihre Mitarbeiter nicht ernst.
good,"Gutes Kollegenumfeld."
good,"Contract workers please avoid this location.They ONLY care about  permanent employees and who have Bayer Experience and only for AMERICAN CITIZENS. Try not to try and hope to get great pay and regard with this area on the off chance that you are other Country person.permanent Employees will treat their Contract colleagues like slaves here, individuals don't have another choice and trap with families will be battle a ton, so please avoid it.Management just for name and doing for chair not really they don't know what they are doing."
good,"Management is young and inexperienced. It shows through them working through the work issues.  Issues in the work place  dont get resolved then turn into bigger issues when should have been dealt with when began. Can feel temtion in the enviroment. "
good,"A typical workday is filled with safety culture and yet, a fast-paced environment.  They are many challenges for this being a new facility for Monsanto in bringing them aligned with the Saint Louis ESH sites.  But, in the end, we accomplished our mission."
good,"Money was good, management was all about making their bonus at the production workers expense.  Safety was only important as long as you did not get hurt."
good,"Handling team of 23 people in Delhi & Rajasthan, also worked in Haryana & Punjab for one year. Enjoyed giving training to new employees. Difference in work culture in Punjab, Rajasthan & Delhi.Always believe in team work and time to time give responsibility to team members so that they can take the responsibilities in future. Administrative working is the hardest part."
good,Otimo ambiente .Otimo salário e beneficio.Gostaria muito de continuar nesta firma mas não pude poque não tinha com quem deixar minhas crianças.
good,"You have the freedom to work and experiment. However, depending on the manager/department your work-life balance will be affected. Good colleagues. Lack of exposure to different departments across the company will stunt growth and expand your knowledge/skill/expertise."
good,it was worth it & a good job . picking cotton & putting it in a bag loading big bags & throwing them on the trucks then taking it to the company to gin it in the machine . it was long days in the fields some days but i liked it after catching on to everything like picking the cotton & put it in the machine to get the seeds out . Going out of town to pick cotton
good,"Most of the day is just routine. Answering multiple calls from various insurance companies that need our company to assist their customers with roadside assistance. It is definitely a fast paced setting and need to be on your A game since I am the only dispatcher during my work shift. It can be hard when customers get upset when drivers do not show up on time. But best thing to do is to calm the customer down and assure them that someone is on their way to them. This type of setting has really polished up my customer service skills since I am on the phone all day and have learned to think quickly. Ive very much enjoyed being in this work space due to its flexibility with hours, although the downside is there is no room for growth,"
good,Al ser una empresa grande tienes mucho trato con todo el personal trabajador de dentro y también con clientes y proveedores que vienen de fuera. Se ha formado un ambiente amigable y agradable en todo el entorno de la recepción (junto con los compañeros).
good,"Dificuldade em conhecer a região de atuação, por ser um desafio grande não tenho muitos parceiro tenho que conquistalos com o tempo."
good,"Walk through cornfields to remove tassels from corn, and you keep moving on with the day until you've reached 4-5 fields daily, stay hydrated and wear a cloth or bandana to cover your neck from getting corn rash"
good,"While at Bayer the culture was somewhat frayed due to an impending Plant reduction, and eventual shutdown. Needless to say at one time the culture was okay from what I had heard."
good,its a very good company and wonderfull culture.i learned lot of thinks from my company how to keep the timing and actually i m doing a marketing work. In our company follows a one of best rule that is helmet.they given the company helmets to all employers.till we should follow that rule.Then my co-workers are very talented and we doing team work.i dont feel any hardest part of my job.we doing some activities in hospitals like presentation programs conference these are all the enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Ambiente stimolante e flessibile, che permette e richiede contunua crescita personale e lavorativa con corsi gratuiti, cambi di ruolo e possibilità di trasferimenti in altri ruoli/paesi anche per brevi periodi (short time assignement)."
good,I like working for this company. I learned alot and was able to be a leader there. The fact that I worked through randstad held me back in becoming the employee I could of been.
good,"I started in the lab at $13.00 an hour but moved to the warehouse where I really loved my job. I learned how to do quality assessments on packaged product, when to reject product and how to move and store the product. I got to work with great guys on the dock who taught me about loading and unloading freight/shipmemts and how to verify the paperwork, what to do in the event of damaged shipements...all the steps to follow on the paperwork and how to input it into an IPad. I thought I was doing a great job because my supervisor said so...then I was told to leave without knowing why. That's very discouraging in itself. But then to be lied about by someone who had been on site less than 2 weeks was really hurtful. I wouldn't go back to work there...I wouldn't be able to trust anyone."
good,"i have learned a ton about corporate laboratory settings. great energy on the right teams."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar. Bastante benefícios, cursos e treinamentos."
good,The workplace was a fast paced environment with a mixture of older and newer technology. Career advancement was nothing to hold your breath over in the area where I worked. It did however allow me to see a lot as a Process Technician and was a good learning curve for me.
good,"Good working culture"
good,"kinda clicky, not much room for advancement, it has gotton away from work life balance, a lot of meetings that are non productive, no communication from management"
good,Pay could be better for the amount of hazardous chemicals we deal with and the amount of stuff they expect us to learn. Management speaks safety but alot of the time it seems like it gets thrown on the backburner.
good,"Great learning. "
good,"blind leadership with blind agendas and blind to reality."
good,"When I first started it was a decent place, everyone got alone and worked well together. Our manager made sure we had everything we needed and had lunch meetings every couple of weeks to go over tasks and where jobs were. Since he left this place has come apart and no one does what they are tasked with end then just dodges the blame around..."
good,"Bayer Admin team was great - lots of great experiences and a great work environment.  However worked alone most days, based out of Strathmore.  Was not as enjoyable as compared to working in a team environment, where help was readily available if needed."
good,"A empresa apresenta ótimos planos para os funcionários, porém na época em que trabalhei na mesma, o salário estava defasado. Uma empresa que realmente preza por seus funcionários, mas ""na unidade em que trabalhei"" encontrei problemas quanto às políticas da empresa e o que realmente se segue. Mas mesmo assim, a melhor empresa em que trabalhei até o momento."
good,"ständig wechselndes Personal, freundliche Gäste, einfacher Kellnerjob"
good,grate job only problem is management they rotate every year or two and most are horrible mico managing and un-understanding with unreal expectations
good,During my project i learned how to do effective work in the field of marketing and what strategy should fallow to achieve target. and how to communicate with farmers on their field visit  and distributes and retailers also.
good,"Working with Bayer was indeed a good development in oneself, Personally & Professionally."
good,"When I interviewed and hired I was told that I would have a job through at least 2018 and 6 months later I got laid off. Work schedule was ideal, working 4-10's is preferrable, I learned alot working in the chemical plant getting to go out and walk down junction boxes and instruments. Management was very unorganized, they would change your task every 5 minutes because nobody knew what was going on and that was the most frustrating part of the job."
good,"Nobody is worried about time, just about quality. Management wants employees to stay productive, but not buried in a giant work load. Some periods of downtime caused employees and managment to be flexible and patient with their work load."
good,"It's a nice summer job for those who are young and are still in school. However, the company had to relocate to a different area, so that's why I am no longer working there in the summers."
good,Local management culture currently under large change with little change management
good,Monsanto hours weren't as much hard work as they were boring. Work for the most part was VERY repetitive and you would be doing the same factory-like work for hours on end before changing. The weather when I worked there was 100+ degree heat.
good,Operated 3 small scale proto type foam machines for a research and development company for applications in flexible foam and slab foam development.  Quality control work on plant samples for shipments to customers.  Participated on committee to improve safety by observing work behaviors and collaborating with other employees to offer corrective solutions.  Worked with customers on identifying production issues and offering solutions at their manufacturing facilities.
good,"I worked there for 8 years and had a new manager every year.  6 managers were great.  2 were terrible.  When I left, the one I had was like working for the devil himself.The company was progressive.  Good pipeline."
good,I really enjoyed my time there but it was way to short. I would like to have had the chance to work for a longer period of time. The people were fun to work with.
good,"Empresa remunera muito bem, porém não consegue reter talentos devido ao péssimo clima organizacional."
good,"Bayer prides it's self on mass production, clean safe environment and, quility products. With hard work and motivation you can become a full time employee in this company."
good,"A lot is demanded in the lab and has a high daily throughput with unrealistic KPI's. The different group work in concert to acheive all final data that is required for each sample that is process.The actual protocols we follow are fairly basic, but the volume of samples prove to be a challenge. This challenge is compounded by lack of communication from management when there has been a change to  daily priorities. The workload changes seasonally and we have a high turn over of employees. Training new employees to meet the demand of the season is also challenging due to all the ISO protocols and USDA regulations that need to be followed along with all of the proper lab protocols to obtain quality results."
good,"Great organization, best place to work and develop the career. I have got 3 promotion within the organization. management is very supportive and professional."
good,"Typical day: "
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, los compañeros de trabajo apoyan en las dudas que surgen en un trabajo nuevo."
good,Je me suis très rapidement adapté à cet environnement que je ne connaissais pas.Ma mission s'est très bien déroulée et j'en garde un excellent souvenir.Dommage que cet emploi ne fut que saisonnier.
good,"Retornei à empresa, pois já havia trabalhado lá anos antes."
good,J'ai commencé en 1991 dans cette société puis le site a été vendu en 2002 où j'ai été promu responsable du service info ainsi que l'exploitation AS400. en polyvalence quand mon collègue partait en congés.
good,"Plano de carrerira não definido, direção não clara."
good,"Overall a good company to work for, but not sure about the IP group. Rare chance to advance, and will work you to no end. "
good,mucha inestabilidad por restructuras. pero el ambiente laboral es bueno al igual que las politicas. los mandos medios no son muy ecuanimes que digamos pero al final de cuentas vamos por los objetivos de ventas y se alcanzan a lograr de muy buena manera.
good,muy buena empresa en todos los aspectos tiene buen ambiente de trabajo tiene un buen comedor y tiene todos los servicios para sus trabajadores
good,"I handle all accounts related to the Consumer Branch of Bayer Environmental Science in Central & Northern California, Nevada and Hawaii. I also oversee a team of 11 merchandisers that call on the Home Centers and I have direct responsibility for 4 distributors that handle our products. Besides that I also put together Line Reviews for the Major Retailers and I forecast sales and future programs."
good,"Empresa de porte grande,com uma cultura forte em trabalho seguro mas com uma administração brasileira péssima."
good,"Bayer was a great place to work for the most part until they purchased the company Monsanto."
good,"Intentar poner ganas a la hora de aprender no destacar mucho a la hora de hablar con los compañeros. "
good,"Seasonal job through manpower"
good,"Easy job if you do not mind being outside for six or 7 hours a day in the heat. Easy to learn because it becomes repetitive, you do the same thing everyday."
good,"When we finally got work, the hours went by pretty quickly. The pay was very good especially when working overtime was offered. I met a few hard working and pleasant people which made it a joy to work within the same department."
good,Little work life balance. Money is tight right now due to the acquisition of Monsanto. Typical day is 7:30 am till 5:30-6:00pm. Multiple meeting and strict GSOP's
good,It was an extremely hard job working in the fields.  They did provide water and Gatorade and they offered a lot of breaks when the weather was extreme
good,"I was fortunate to work in the research areas. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.  After the Desk-side support teams were outsourced, I worked in the business section. It was kind of boring and a lot of ""politicking"" went on."
good,Great opportunity to learn and achieving results while working with intercultural and cross-functional teams. There is a possibility to develop horizontally and vertically.
good,"un lavoro molto duro ma molto ben retribuito, scomodo da raggiungere"
good,Uma empresa onde você chega pra trabalhar na operação e tem todo suporte pra você desenvolver suas atividades
good,"Una empresa muy organizada en todos sus procesos, que te da conocimientos en hidroponía y suelo de produccion de semillas de hortalizas, ademas de cultura de seguridad en el trabajo, liderazgo y trabajo en un equipo multidisciplinario"
good,"I worked as a contract canola seed cleaning employee (Bayer CropScience). This position is great for someone who needs to make a decent amount of cash over a contract period. At my particular location there was very little to no chance of advancement OR permanent employment, which made the job somewhat frustrating for a lot of employees who dedicated many years of contract work with this company. Plenty of opportunity for overtime but it is required to work long hours and to come in when the help is needed. Great people to work with every day but the work is quite mundane and boring. A big part of their procedures were outdated and still on paper (vs. electronic)."
good,We love the work in research agriculture but the upper level management was always moving the target or it was unrealistic we never felt we succeeded just got done.
good,Bayer is a great company to work for.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The maintence   department can be a little difficult to work for but overall the people are nice
good,"The company was great and very professional with a lot of options for healthcare, vision, and also 401k.  I worked in the warehouse, behind the scenes of the assembly lines, keeping the lines stocked with inventory. My coworkers and managers were fantastic but I just never could get used to the 12 hour night shifts. Great company and enjoyed my time there!"
good,My experience at Monsanto has allowed me to learn multiple facets of plant and animal sciences.  Working with incredibly knowledgeable and experienced people has helped me to advance in both fields.
good,"Very nice company and very focused on admin, targetted doctors, call rates and stream lined approach to sales excellence."
good,"Enjoyed working for Bayer,  many of the decisions made were politically based, performance was not always taken into account. Benefits were very good, car, expense account, travel budget."
good,"Fijne werkgever met leuke collega's."
good,work hard and you will be rewarded eventually. I really like working there and look forward to advancemen.t.  For the most part strong management and support.  lots of gossip.  just do your work and don't talk about your personal life
good,"I worked at a Monsanto Research Facility every summer during high school. While it isn't the best job in the world it has served as a starting point. They paid us the minimum wage with some extra tacked on, especially if you were a returning worker, rather than the lower 'student wages' that they were entitled to pay. As well as requiring no experience, this served as a great point for future job searches when I was older. ""yea I've worked for four years at this place!"" While other people my age had zero work experience I did. To top it off it doesn't even take your entire summer, they only need people for a few weeks when the corn is pollinating, so as a kid you still have a lot of summer to go around and now you have money set aside for whatever you like. I bought myself a Nintendo Wii after my first season without a second thought since I could now afford it."
good,I enjoyed my employment.  Regular schedule.  Some overtime.  Learned to use computer aided designing and drafting.  Learned to design electrical installations for the plant where I worked.  Learned to order the material required for installations of electrical and instrumental devices.  Learned to estimate how long it would be take for construction to perform such installations.
good,"Everyday I have to go Office as early I can , the reason I have lots of things can be done."
good,"Too much financial instability; there have been several rounds of layoffs since 2009. Though I acquired new skills and learned a lot, the salary for admins & clerical was low for the area. Company closes for two weeks during Christmas & New Year's."
good,"El horario es flexible, con salida todos los viernes a las 2 de la tarde. Brinda alimentación al 70%."
good,"Company communications portray Bayer as employee focused, but actual behaviors are entirely $ and bottom line focused."
good,you don't know what shift cycle you will be on in order to set up appointments.  There is a clear difference between the contract employees that perform the same jobs as the full time employees which make moral rather difficult.
good,"i learn in Bayer how to develop KOL for your brands ."
good,My main experience is learning new knowledge skills of every type of work into anything i do from retail to industrial..Everyday is a learning experience.
good,"Good company culture"
good,The company had very few opportunities for advancement that fit my background.  I felt like I traveled the world from my desk.  I wish my tenure had been longer.
good,"essa empresa me proporcionou vivenciar diversas situações na area fiscal uma vez que essa empresa tem três segmentos: farmaceutico, químico e agronegócio, tornando meu conhecimento em impostos bem amplo. A direção e gerência são pessoas capacitadas para gerir as áreas. As pessoas são fáceis de lidar em geral. O mais dificil do trabalho e a hierarquia e nem sempre consegue resolver o assunto de forma mais clara e precisa. A parte que me agrada nessa companhia é o desenvolvimento dos funcionários."
good,"BBTS is one of the most reputable companies in the world, but definitely had its share of pros and cons. There were a lot of ""office politics"" and unfair treatment, especially toward contractors. However, it was a peaceful atmosphere in which to work, but maybe TOO quiet as there was no tolerance for water cooler chit chat. I believe these cons were limited to my department only (Business Excellence and Risk Management); the rest of the company was a great place to work."
good,"In this position, I was able to develop and lead a team of Sr. Analysts to Managers. I feel fortunate for that opportunity. Management direction however is lacking, and feedback and guidance is limited."
good,"There wasn't ever really a typical day because the ""routine"" would change constantly. I learned a lot about business/work operations and customer service from the numerous client interactions in person as well as on the telephone. My co-workers and some of the employees were the best part of the job. Most of them are good friends of mine now and we continue to hang out outside of the office even when work is over."
good,interested in research in field work
good,"very good steady production and way to many hours worked and not enough off, 13 day work 1 off day in between"
good,Great company. No advancement. Great use of Customer interaction. Enhances your computer navigation & repair skills. Enhances your phone etiquette. Hardest part of the job is the customer relations & the IT involvement is very mi-nute.
good,"i learned how does a business worked and how to manage patient, time management and effort. the culture is not null and people thre is very friendly and positive."
good,"I enjoyed both my work and the people I worked with.  I enjoyed flexible hours and work from home benefits. I was able to learn many new skills with online learning, as well as keep my many skills current."
good,Good company to works for good scheduling nice people clean environment just a positive out look all round loved it best job ever really cafeteria everything you need
good,"I have suffered a lot with my reporting Manager. So, i quit from the company. Now our reporting Manager had resigned Bayer. So,now I want to work in this company. "
good,"Otima empresa para trabalhar, preocupada com a segurança dos seus colaboradores e o seu bem estar."
good,Travailler à Monsanto fut pour moi une expérience très intéressante et satisfaisante
good,"tolle Kollegen, abwechsunlungsreiche Arbeit, sehr faires Gehalt"
good,"Levantamiento, revision y elaboracion de planos. Codificacion y archivo de documentacion tecnica. Apoyo a labores de tecnicos de metrologia."
good,Hard to move to higher role. Ok benefits and time off. Middle managers are young and on a power trip.  Certain people get that tap on the shoulder regardless of skills.
good,"Act as team lead for offshore onsite coordinator, implementing arch, design and develop code."
good,"I enjoyed working for monsanto,  loved working outdoors. Would work for them again if they had an opening. I had medical condition with a kidney that took alot of surgery's to fix it, I had to take a lay off"
good,"The location that I worked at  seems to be very stable.  The company pays well and the benefits are great.  In recent years, the management seems to have gone downhill - but hopefully that can be turned around to help promote future growth for the company."
good,"It is rewarding to work for a company that helps save peoples lives. However, I felt that specific managers are put in position that are not deserving. As a manager you need to have people skills and be able to relate."
good,Once you are hired on 3rd shift it is very difficult to get the chance for a 1st shift position. They like to hire from outside the company for 1st shift.
good,The days are long and rigors on your physical body. This job involves a lot of walking and to finish the job at a certain time frame. it also requires you to learn as you go.
good,Good place to work. Generous benefits in a clean workplace. They provide plenty of training opportunities. 12 hour 2-2-3 schedule is a little rough...
good,Productive company with huge advancement. I just graduated from college and they took a chance on me. MAnagement is excellent. THe workplace is well diversified.
good,8/10 would work there again if I could. management needs to be more involved and people need to learn to get along with others more to make work more manageable.
good,"The great parts about developing at Bayer are the openness and ease of employing technologies you see fit for the problem, the team-oriented nature of workflow, and the autonomy of the development cycle."
good,all the boss are good. especially our big boss he is down to earth person and very humble. he treated his employees with respect. all i can say to this company is keep it up the good work.
good,"I found after almost ten years that Bayer does not create room for advancement. They do not have any type of flow chart to show you what you need to advance. The laboratory environment was good. Teamwork was very strong."
good,Not much to say. Plant was sold off years ago. Left before this happened to grow my career. Have not kept in touch with anyone and new Monsanto is only what I have read in the news.
good,Diversified company portfolio. Good people to work with.  Diversified company portfolio. Large pharma company with many regulatory barriers. Limited opportunities for growth.
good,"As many agricultural companies are struggling now, I'm writing this as a temporary review given the situation may be tentative. The staff is helpful and supportive at this job, but communication is a weakness throughout the organization and lack of cohesiveness between groups causes many inefficiencies in collaboration."
good,Depends on the department you are in. Union seniority rules there. Whether you do a good job or not is not the most important factor for keeping your job.
good,El ambiente es excelente para trabajar y te permite tener tiempo libre por las tardes
good,"It was a great job to learn hard work,  We were up early in the day and in the field early to miss the heat.  It was hard work, but it made me learn that values."
good,Bayer ist ein sehr guter Arbeitgeber. Es gibt viele großartige Möglichkeiten sich weiterzubilden.
good,i learn a lot at Bayer :
good,"As an intern, Monsanto made sure I saw as much of the company as I could in the three months I was there. Great experience interning with Monsanto seed production. Knowledgeable and caring employees."
good,"If you are a true Bayer employee, there are many benefits: healthcare, an excellent 401K matching program, Credit Union, Gym, discounts on Bayer Pharmaceutical products, 3 weeks paid vacation starting, opportunities for career growth, etc. The catch is, it's unlikely that you are hired into Bayer as a full-time Bayer employee. Most people start at Bayer as a contractor. There are no benefits to being a contractor. no paid time off, no guaranteed healthcare (some contractors offer it, but it's not always great) no paid holidays, and no job security. Sometimes employees wait only a few months and other employees wait years to be hired on directly with Bayer. "
good,Work environment & atmosphere are good and enjoyable
good,Existía una buena relación entre los distintos departamentos de la empresa.
good,"Excellent! Very nurturing and professional environment. professional co-worker's. Excellent corporate culture, great food and benefits. Insurance, 401K, etc."
good,"Each day was unique; however, my typical day at work was very fast-paced. Everything had to be done in a timely manner with utmost highest accuracy. My co-workers were friendly; however, everyone keeps to themselves at work. I plan out my day ahead before getting to work, and if not planned, you will not be productive."
good,Good work place. Would work there again if offered. Looking for a different career than Monsanto can provide for me. Great manager. Good location of job.
good,Generar ventas a corto plazo. Checar existencias y agotados. Caducidad. Frenteo. Exhibición. Etc
good,"Getting ahead is rough and sadly, often a popularity decision. In general most people are great to work with. Creating new positions is not currently possible."
good,The work culture is amazing everyone is friendly and cooperative. The company is one of the largest manufacturers of fertilisers all over the world and use SAP technology.
good,"Great place for curious minds, especially to demystify the agricultural and biotechnology industries. Interesting to see beyond what is typically available in media."
good,"Emploi vacataire, ambiance sympa, belles rencontres"
good,"Esperienza riguardante la conoscenza delle dinamiche di apertura e di accesso al mercato per il farmaco etico, conoscenza di strumenti come l’ HTA, conoscenza degli stakeholder e dei Payor, analisi di budget impact nazionali e regionali. Collaborazioni con associazioni di pazienti, agenzie di comunicazione, enti istituzionali pubblici e privati."
good,Monsanto is in the process of being acquired by another company. The role of security is at risk of being outsourced. During my time of employment I found the ever changing workplace to be stressful with lots of uncertainty.
good,Everyone in the team are so friendly with each other. We all used to do combined team work.The day starts with a daily stand up meeting and based on the work will be completing the tasks and at the end of the day we need to store it in a repository.If we find any errors in the code we will be rectifying it. Some times the client will be changing the requirements  then only it will be a typical work and to deliver the project with in the given span of time is bit tough.
good,"It's a place where you always have to be on your toes because you don't know when you will be on the chopping block.  I use to always love working there but, things have changed and that's ok too."
good,"okay poor manager, manager needs to be more understanding of employees needs. They may wan to send manager to some kind of classes to help with this. Thank u"
good,Hat mir alles sehr gut gefallen. Freundliche Kollegen. Abwechslungsreiche Arbeit.
good,"The company offers great experience, it toughens but teaches."
good,De verdad que la empresa da mucha estabilidad laboral y beneficios tanto para el empleo como familiares. Solo que me retire por cambio de residencia por la situación actual del país.
good,"A divisão de consumo possui uma estrutura enxuta, o que permite se envolver em diferentes projetos e ter um contato fácil com diferentes áreas. A empresa vem passando por diversas mudanças de líderes/processos e com isso, algumas vezes, perde coerência  que nos leva a enfrentar uma dificuldade de manter todos ""na mesma página"". Por isso, é necessário um esforço extra no dia-a-dia para manter a qualidade e efetividade do seu trabalho. O ponto negativo é que é um ambiente bem político. No fim do dia, você não necessariamente é reconhecido pelo seu trabalho, mas sim a partir da relação que possui com direção/gerência. Entretanto, a empresa possui um ambiente bom de trabalho, as pessoas se ajudam na medida do possível e os treinamentos disponíveis são bons. Apesar de ser longe, há feira, salão, academia e outras facilidades na empresa que aliada as campanhas internas de qualidade de vida e benefícios ajudam a balancear a vida pessoal com o dia-a-dia de trabalho."
good,Indeed has this company confused with another company - I did not work here. I worked at a different Bayer. I plan to contact Indeed so they can delete this post.
good,Công ty có các chính sách đãi ngộ tốt và hướng tới lâu dài
good,Great team and teamwork.  Very supportive management.  Training was significant and allowed for development of selling and communication skills.  Travel can be extensive at times.
good,"Positive workplace culture and very supportive.  Depending on territory, travel can be extensive.  Great teamwork.  Excellent training programs and opportunities to continually develop."
good,"Good place to work, this is a product based company...working with people across the GEO, workplace was good and enjoyed team building..I never felt anything typical"
good,This was a great job that taught me discipline. It is very hard work with very demanding hours. The pay really makes up for all of that and it's an amazing summer job for high schoolers looking to make a lot of money in a few weeks at work.
good,"Collected mail, used company database to sort mail, and helped delivery driver distribute mail on campus."
good,"He aprendido un montón y he hecho muchos amigos, era un ambiente muy dinámica."
good,Bayer Healthcare was acquired. I have no information for this company as it is not the same company I worked for many years ago. Blood glucose meters. Ascencia.
good,"The workday is very balanced between being able to work and gain more information through training forums. One is able to interact easily with other departments, if needs be for assistance."
good,This company has a very friendly work environment. They are very much concerned about employees' safety. People from different cultures work here. There is so much to learn within the company.
good,Καλη δεν εχω να προσθεσω κατι αλλο.Ειναι οπως ολες οι εταιρειες
good,"This used to be a great place to work. The managers were amazing, there was always plenty of help when you needed it, and the company really cared. That all went downhill when Monsanto went through their restructuring period and let go a lot of their managers and replaced them with people who don't know how to manage. Information regarding decisions are slow to make their way down the pipeline and it's often relayed too late."
good,The friends I made while working were great! The people were all very nice no matter how hot it was out. Everyone working was always very enthusiastic and were always excited to be working!
good,"Working for Monsanto was a great experience. Unfortunately I was a contractor so I was not a full time employee, but I was not treated as a temporary hire. Great business culture and relatively small internal groups really helped to give a feeling that you weren't in a huge organization."
good,Good people kind and caring folk. supervisor easy to keep happy. The pay is the very lacking for the amount of work asked to do. overall its a fair job.
good,2nd shift allowed working more with operators. On day shift there were more meetings and the process of repairing equipment took more time than what I could do at night.
good,Pude observar el funcionamiento de un laboratorio y así amplié mis conocimientos adquiridos en la planta.
good,"a very good training ground, very strict and detailed when it comes to the procedures and other work processing, times of pressure comes but having a supportive team makes all the work load light. They have a good management, having a friendly surroundings and team."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo en equipo y con productores en campo así como la motivación para seguir desarrollando diversas labores.
good,"utility operation."
good,"As Sr. Production Planner, planned weekly production schedules to maintain sufficient inventory levels of both finished goods and raw materials and packaging needed for pharmaceutical production."
good,"It was a good environment, I liked the way the organization functioned. I learned how work environment especially out on the field was. the management team was very understandable and team oriented. People always willing to learn something new."
good,"Was in charge of 36 acres of canola test plots. Started not knowing anything about canola, left knowing more than i thought I would. "
good,"+ Mobilité interne, développement des personnes, empowerment, entreprise challengeante, internationale, bonne ambiance de travail, collègues passionnés et passionnants"
good,"Le rythme de travail est très soutenu et l'entreprise fonctionne au rendement. L'utilisation d'outils de pointes pour les analyses de biologie moléculaire est un plus et un avantage au niveau professionnelle. Les protocoles ne sont pas complexe à suivre."
good,Monsanto was very diverse and respectful to work life balance.  New ideas and technology were accepted and implemented.  Respect for peers and partners.
good,"Prepare payroll for processing"
good,Very fast paced and dynamic organization but not always the most structured approach. There are a lot of training opportunities to develop skills.
good,"Management style is definitely changing within the company, I was privileged to be a part of the restructuring process within the customer operations department whereby myself and my team members had to draft and assist to implement the new structure, as well as introduce this structure to upper management. "
good,"Empresa america com cultura de relacionamento estabelecido;"
good,Overall is a great company but in the area of work life balance needs improvement. Limited opportunities for job advancement.
good,"Monsanto es una empresa agroexportadora de semillas, un dia tipico ahi es ingresar a las 4:30am al fundo para tomar lista al personal obrero encargado para luego pasar al campo y sacar la informacion de produccion y finalmente llegar a la oficina para procesar la informacion en el sistema de la empresa, mi tiempo alli fue por campaña y generalmente nos quedabamos hasa las 6 o 7 de la noche por la cantidad de obreros y produccion a filtrar pero con un ambiente agradable, buenas compañeras y beneficios, grandes personas a cargo con quienes aprendi muchas cosas no solo administrativas si no tambien agricolas lo cual es nuevo para mi, aprendi sobre recursos humanos lo cual me inclino a hacer un diplomado en ello la cual estoy a punto de finalizar."
good,Me dieron el lugar para aprender y comenzar mis pasos en SAP. Me capacite como consultor y como líder. Excelente lugar para trabajar y la calidad de personas es muy bueno.
good,"Ho lavorato presso il Laboratorio, dove ho partecipato a progetti di ricerca, ed effettuando analisi specifiche per le varie problematiche che si presentavano nel quotidiano. Capacità di lavorare in gruppo o in modo individuale, in sinergia con i colleghi, unendo la volontà di raggiungere importanti obiettivi. Ho avuto la fortuna di stare in contatto con persone di differenti culture e nazionalità, che hanno contribuito alla mia crescita professionale e personale."
good,"Ho collaborato con altre persone dell'azienda, organizzandomi il lavoro sia in modo autonomo e sia affiancandomi ad altri colleghi. Ho avuto il piacere di stare in contatto anche con persone di differenti nazionalità e colture differenti, confrontandomi quotidianamente."
good,Laboratoire formateur pour une première expérience dans le domaine pharmaceutique
good,"I liked working with this company and the research that they did. However, I was not able to fit comfortably with the work/ travel schedule."
good,People are good.  You are treated fairly well depending on which department you are in well.  Good work life balance.  Hard to move up the chain.
good,The typical day at Monsanto's is that you wake up at 4 and get to the bus so that it can drive you to one of the fields. When we get to the fields we go and get assigned a group that we will be with for the day and we get assigned a row that we have to pick. Then after we finish the field we usually have another field to do and then we leave and we go back to the school to get picked up by are parents.
good,"Bayer offers a great place to work with strong ethics and compassion for people and demands a high performance culture; therefore, has top talent through-out the organization."
good,I learned how to do multiple day to day activities in the research and development department at Monsanto. I would be glad to elaborate on any details from my resume if you wish to contact me.
good,"Working with others or individually, doing general labouring jobs. Learning about agronomy and what this entails. Supervisors are willing to show you how to do and explain why we do what it is were doing.The people you work with are hard workers, there is not anything hard about this job if you are willing to work, the weather can be trying at times if it rains as you have to stop and start as the showers go through. I enjoy working out doors."
good,"gerencia es inflexible"
good,Monsanto is a well organized company. Many area's of expertise work together to bring the best products to the market. Monsanto is a leader in vegetable breeding . It's innovative and pro-active

good,"friendly atmosphere: managers are very helpful."
good,worked along with diverse professional background within Breeding; Product Development Testing and Management; Regulatory; Technology Development; Operations and Project Management would allow me to bring the following value to my career.
good,"Bayer is a good company.  The people are friendly and helpful and the facility is new.  However, the organization is very horizontal so upward mobility is difficult."
good,"Challenging and fun workplace with supportive colleagues and management. Builds and trains potential young talents to succeed or excel in the future. A company who is pro people, willing to invest to a deserving individual who shows sincerity and dedication towards work. Territory management was indeed exciting given I had to explore some areas in my given territory, opportunity to meet new clients is very high and building good relationship with them is fun specially in a provincial setup. The hardest or should I say challenging part of the job is when we launched a new product in the market for oral anti-coagulation. The team had to deliver proper and right information regarding the advantage of the new product to each client, present studies to support every claims we detail and to outweigh issues and benefits. On the other hand, we should show a conservative concern regarding the possible side effects specially on the safety side of the newly launch product since it involves possible major side effects causing bleeding or death. Overall, I enjoy working in this kind of industry wherein you meet different types of client and you have to learn on how to please each and every one of them if you want positive results specially in sales targets monthly."
good,I taught computers to kids 3YO to 4th grade. I had to troubleshoot computers. Created curriculum. Nice place to work. I worked part time.

good,"Good place to work and learn ,good people to work and remembered.Professional working environment very nice management and nice facilities"
good,"Work out doors in summer with other crew members. Gather data, manage samples. Foremen are careful about providing breaks with adequate shade and water, and have an admirable focus on safety."
good,I'm very well rounded in the field. I typically was doing rough in's because I requested it. I'd rather be wiring houses as to doing finals. I am a team player and if the company was falling behind elsewhere I'd volunteer.
good,"Empresa na qual ""cresci"" bastante, ampliei meus conhecimentos."
good,Monsanto is a global company and is aimed at creating a great place to work for its people. It is a mature culture. Work is very focused and the company does create opportunities for moving forward.

good,"As happens in many positions, you know when to start but you never know when will you finnish."
good,"•Amazing peers and leadership"
good,"I learned a lot for this organisation, without this platform, i cant prove myself. It's a huge opportunity to me & It's a wonderful experience for me. I never felt typical day at work, why because everyday is new journey & new experience. Management is very much supported to us. I am really thankful to them. I would work like to work with team why because i know the power of team so without support my colleagues, I didn't learned work at organisation, they are friendly to move everyone."
good,"It meets all the criteria for a ""good job.""  Good health insurance coverage, adequate compensation and a yearly bonus of 5%.  Manageable stress level and a strict adherence to procedures is expected from all levels at all times."
good,"very good management, coworkers."
good,A work day would be very busy with testing the samples and analyzing the data. Since I was an intern I had learned new techniques under good supervision. It was very fun to work on the samples on my own for the very first time. Working in Monsanto was a learning process which I enjoyed the most.
good,"Good benefits, Competitive salary including annual bonus.  They allow for training when the job requires it.  Good team building and cross training within the departments."

good,It was eye opening as a FAMU student to live and work in a community totally different from the norm. It was a very memorable experience and I learned a lot.
good,"Stage de courte durée mais formateur au niveau de la com interne et des rh"

good,"I learned  a lot about farming and how corn is grown. The co-workers were all kinds of different people, so it was fun getting to know all of them. The hardest part of the job was the weather being so hot. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with everyone even the manager were fun and easy-going."
good,A typical day usually starts with a meeting.  Then I will go into the clean room where I will be either working on the machinery or running it.  Something that I have learned about this job is that sometimes in order to trouble shoot equipment at your best it is often times better to slow down and think things through before trying to fix the problem.

good,"Good work/life balance"
good,"On your game, quick thinking answers, unpredictable day. Great group to work with. Hardest part of the job is remembering it is a job. I've learned its better to ask a dumb question than to make a stupid mistake. On a site where there are hundreds of employees, the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are one of the first people new hires meet and no matter where you go, everyone remembers your name."

good,My experience as an intermittent temporary employee has been very positive.
good, Es un trabajo muy ameno con buenas oportunidades de crecimiento y con oportunidad a aprender más de los demas puestos nunca conocí a los gerentes o directivos solo mando medio mis colegas fueron muy cooperativos y la parte más dificil es que te digan que se terminó el trabajo por bajas producciones y tienes que esperar 3 a 4 semanas para que te vuelvan a llamar.

Have also been promoted from initial position where I was responsible for one location to providing support to local Occupational Safety person at the various locations.

good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my position as security guard at Bayer, however I did not like the shift-work. I especially did not like working through the weekends. My co-workers were friendly and we were definitely team players."
good,Eu entrei lá para trabalhar como safrista fiquei lá do dia 22/11/2012 a 17/02/2013.É uma empresa bem organizada de se trabalhar.tem muitas regras a serem cumpridas eu gostei de trabalhas lá.
good,"A typical day was to arrive at a customer's location by 7:30 a.m. I logged into the customer's computer and then met with a department manager or associate. I inventoried, front and checked the signage of on hand merchandise. I checked to make sure product was arranged according to our companies plan o gram. I cleaned, moved and made new signs for product that located outside lawn & garden area. I discussed new products and inventory levels with the department manager on hand. I trained associates on product uses and answered questions about the products to the retail customer. I visited three locations daily in a geographic area and left my location at 5 p.m. I learned about the uses of the product and merchandising procedures. I interacted with my supervisor several times a week via the phone. I had no co workers. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training needed to be successful in the position. I enjoyed interacting with the store assocates and being a problem solver for the retail customers."
good,"relaxed atmosphere, free coffee. i would love to work there again."
good,"Work with the controllers in other countries in Europe, Asia and Africa to ensure proper General Ledger reporting. Great to learn other culture accounting practices."

good,"My internship at Monsanto was an overwhelming positive experience. The culture is a professional reflection of working close to the agricultural industry. An entreprenurial spirit inherently exists in the culture and hardwork, team work is rewarded."
good,"A typical day at work would start with a check into Outlook to see if anything urgent came in after I had left. Once that was done, there are contracts to create, which will involve research into each vendor to check vitals of the contracts requested. Constant interaction with the business units of Bayer require a high level of customer service skills as well as the ability to manage several projects co . Problem solving and prioritizing are constant requirements that may be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The company promote a work life balance, every friday afternoon there is a sports day."

good,I only had a seasonal position while working here though the people I worked with and around were great. All were extremely helpful with me starting out. Wished there was more advancement opportunities from the position I was in.
good,Bayer is a good place to work . But with recent lay offs The company needs a new outlook to be successful.Most people stay here pretty much till the end of career so  most people have less other company experience.
good,The management was in disarray.  It may have been due to the recent relocation of this particular center - I thought there was a great deal of disorder and limited coordination on the part of management.
good,"empresa inovadora e com grande diversidade, grande aprendizado"
good,"My job was to troubleshoot instrument and electrical problems, work on analyzers. To work on what broke down the night before, or do preventive maintenance on equipment."
good,The mornings started out fast..due to trucks coming in to deliver the cotton...trucks were waiting for approval from the lab before they could dump the load....we were working as a  team to get the job done...great experience.
good,"A Bayer é uma ótima empresa, fiz grandes trabalhos dentro dela e conheci muita gente boa. Porém com as aquisições ela vem perdendo o seu DNA. Durante pouco mais de 7 anos, tive 5 diretores diferentes e 4 coordenadores ou seja um ambiente completamente instável e de mudança, o que em excesso é danoso a médio e longo prazo."
good,Ambiente stimolante modermo ma  molto volube e stresante
good,Self direct workforce knew what to do with little supervision.  manager would reward good production weeks with a free meal.  Bonuses were usually pretty nice
good,Overall a good experience. For Manufacturing employees a 10 hour workday. Learned a lot about cGMP and manufacturing practices. Learned SAP and other laboratory computer systems. Workplace culture at least in purification was fun but efficient. A lot of good teamwork and communication between techs. Hardest part of the job was the curriculum and training. Most enjoyable was the relationships garnered between shifts and department. Management was fair but sometimes secretive with pertinent information.
good,"I worked as a consultant for Bayer.  I enjoyed my team and working with the other teams at Bayer.  They didn't seem to offer any ""easy"" way to transition from consultant to full time employee.  It just made it difficult if you were looking for a stable position."
good,"Bayer is a large company and as such, it has its share of bureaucracy. You will often need to discover how to get your job done on your own, which is why relationships with the people you work with are very important there."
good,"This is a blue collar job and work is not easy, but the pay and benefits are great.  Do not apply for this job unless you are willing to work.  They need good people here, not the type to sit around and let others do the work."
good,Loved working there.  Wish it was as a Monsanto employee rather than as a contractor.   Loved working as a deskside technician.  Customers I supported were very appreciative of my teams service
good,"it was a fun place and the job was fun but it was destined to fail from the start.  They should have been using drones rather than tractors but apparently they'd already spent a bunch of money on these tractors so, tractors it was"
good,"Bayer helped me develop my career and job skills. The only downside is job security, especially at the Berkeley site. The factor VII market is getting too competitive and I think it is something that this site did not prepare for."
good,This is good company to work for it is focusing on inclusion and re tooling for the future. The only problem for me is the commute. If I live closer to Berkeley it would be a great job
good,A typical day at work is going out to build customer relationships with potential clients. This comes natural to me because I have been making calls on the majority of these customers for the past 30 years. 
good,loved my job and duties at this company. All management personnel were nice to work with. Learned a lot about shipping corn seed to other states. Learned a lot about the security of others.
good,Very collaborate environment.  Focused on improving employee skill sets to create career paths;  however too many meetings take away time from veing productive.
good,its a pretty layer back work place can be stressful and you do work a lot of hrs during harvest and field times but over all its a great place to work.
good,"Productive, fun place to work.  Was only a temporary job through Manpower. I would have loved to been hired on full time!  I loved what I did; Certified Lab Tech, I learned a lot!  I love outside plant work, I and learned so much about soybeans.  I found it very interesting."
good,"Ótima empresa pra se trabalhar, oferece ótimos benéficos, suporte no trabalha de campo, treinamento para o desenvolvimento de seus funcionários."
good,"My experience here has had its ups and downs for sure. There have been fun times where the coworkers and I would play ping pong or just little things like telling simple stories in the lab. There have been down sides with coworkers not getting along with each other and Human Resources had to get involved which made things stressful for everyone in the lab. I enjoyed this job and the work that I was able to do. I am more of an outdoors person, but being in a lab and conducting research was fun for me as well. I am looking for a different job because my girlfriend is going to grad school, otherwise I would stay here a little longer until I was more ready for something else."
good,"Fornece diversos benefícios ao colaborador e deseja que todos estejam felizes no trabalho, porém a gerência é um pouco distante dos demais cargos."
good,"Healthy lifestyle is encouraged since I work in Personal Care where we promote the importance of self care in the products we provide to the end customer. "
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Very bright and capable people working there.  Tough to move from contractor to FTE, depending on the area you are in.  Company is making cuts even though they are doing tremendously from a financial performance."
good,"Reviewing calendar on a daily basis for meetings with Legal, Medical and Regulatory. Making sure all CFRs were submitted successfully to FDR."
good,"1.Good Work place"
good,"1.Good Work place"
good,"A very positive place for you to work in, but with serious problems regarding the management staff."
good,"division plus en rapport avec le business "
good,Very good company to work for.  I recommend Monsanto to friends and relatives.  I like working on the facilities equipment and negotiating contracts with all of the facilities contractors.
good,Management is well organized and understand the vision and mission. Goal setting is a priority to assure productivity and people are team players towards the goal.
good,Great personal development opportunities and benefits.  Company is on the cutting edge of technology.  Great place to get experience in large company.
good,It was a good place to work until they closed the program I worked for.  I enjoyed supervising the seasonal employees.  There were relaxed times and stressful times.
good,"Great environment, fun people to work with. Flexible shifts. Different opportunities to do different things within the work place. Also highly productive"
good,"Bayer was a temporary job as most of the jobs with them are. They hired me to be a lab assistant to set up, complete and report test results for cotton seed. This was a ""seasonal"" job during the ginning season. It was a good job and I enjoyed it very much. I would liked to have hired on with Bayer for full time past the season."
good,"the day was easy to start off, you got 3 hour rotation of different tasks that needed be done to complete the package. i learned about what went into the package, and had to make sure that the equipment in the package was not contaminated."
good,Bayer is a great place to work at. The people you meet every day are laid back and are always up to just chat. The environment is not stressful because of this. The dress attire is jeans and a t-shirt. The day to day work varies but always gives you something to work toward by the end of the day. There are daily standups where even as a newcomer you are given the opportunity to voice your progress and opinions.
good,A good place to work. A good place for work life balance with team environment. People really care about one another a lot. Company looks to providing customer satisfaction in terms of products.
good,Buenas prestaciones a sus empleados pero busco un crecimiento laboral que ha sido difícil dentro de la empresa
good,"Monsanto strongly believes in ethics and safety, ensures that employee do not engages in unethical practices all the time. Its resourceful organization provides opportunities for cultivating skills and resources needed for performing duty. Develops and markets  innovative products that brings prosperity among farmer customers. Management values and respects gender diversity and human rights at some extents. Being nature of agri business, field team has to put extra working hours. One who wants to work dignity and honesty, I think Monsanto stands tallest among the agricultural industries."
good,"From my first day, to my last day at Bayer, I found it to be a wonderful place to work.  The rich German heritage goes back many decades and from the innovation of the Aspirin, it's always been a company looking to make the world a better and healthier place."
good,Was a summer intern so the working environment wasn't the best too hot outside but they provided us with things to keep us hydrated and safe. Enjoyed working there
good,"Managing Operations during the production is an hectic task, but playing a role model and motivating them to do their best is most enjoyable, also supports a lot during business critical."

good,"It is a great company to work for, especially if flexibility is needed.  They try to incorporate a great work / life balance"
good,"Good place to work overall, good hours. Nice people. I worked for the diabetes sectors as a contract project manager"
good,"Great company to start for, but if you are working in a rural location and not St, Louis it is harder to advance, However, management wants you to seek out other opportunities and roles its just up to you to relocate. If your in the field as a field research assistant you will have no work-life balance. Your schedule is always on the fly it changes and you never really know what your going to be doing so its hard to schedule any personal time or vacations."
good,While I enjoy the employer I am working for there is no advancement or opportunity to become a permanent employee. The people I work with are terrific.
good,"Great Portfolio of products, good compensation. Able to get involved and help enormously the patients involved in the studies."
good,"Monsanto is a vibrant facility with a knowledgeable core group of employees who work together to achieve overall satisfaction for the company and business end users. I enjoy the relaxed environment and learning different application functions that help customer's business thrive. The hardest parts of my day are the meetings, but knowing I have a core group I can depend on, I get through my days with a breeze."
good,"Most employees are great, some managers are not so great and feel full of themselves but overall a great place to work."
good,"Bayer is a great place to work as a student or a regular employee. They are open to al types of learners for their summer student positions, working with everyone and bringing the best out of all their employees. The gym on site is an added bonus for those that want to keep active but find it hard to fit a gym visit in their busy work weeks, and it is free for the employees, with helps with reducing costs."
good,"Generally good management"
good,"Not all Monsanto plants are the same or do the same work. However, the benefits package & insurance are a definite plus."
good,"Good people and a nice office environment, though lacked conference rooms.  Open spaces made it hard to have conference calls with others in nearby areas.  Strong core values."
good,"I test all in-process samples, finished product samples and stabilities.  I utilize my analytical skills performing a lot of HPLC and GC analysis."
good,I worked for Bayer Pharmaceuticals for 13yrs but unfortunately the company was reorganized and I could not relocate.   I learned a lot about the Business World and how to organized my day to complete my tasks at hand.  I also learned to use the Microsoft Suite in this job.  I worked with several Bayer Sales Reps and I enjoyed helping them resolve their issues  in a timely fashion.
good,"Excelente balance vida / trabajo"
good,"Supporting management and their team with calendar scheduling, travel and expense, purchasing, meetings and events"
good,Parceria das empresas faz que trabalho se torne agradavél. Rota do dia a dia sempre uma novidade .
good,Busy day with lot of co-ordination alongwith fun activities at workplace.Overall an ideal place to work with lot of new opportunities and a supportive environment for growth.
good,The employees at Monsanto are strongly concerned about safety and well being of contractors who work there. It is a flexible work environment that allows workers to find their niche in the work environment and find ways to advance themselves.
good,People are friendly and help each other out on the line. Need to keep line moving at a good rate. Rewarded for making rates by time off every other week. Ideas for improvements are rewarded as well.
good,"Monsanto Animal Sciences had a ton of opportunity to learn. Analysis of feeds, animal samples, pond water samples, learned about computerized data collection."
good,"Combine art, business, and engineering to make products that people use every day. Focusing on the user experience in creating style and function for a particular gadget or appliance."
good,"Running experiments, had a good amount of working by myself, after being trained. Co-workers were great, probably the best part of the job. Wanted there to be more opportunity to advance. Job could get repetitive and a bit monotonous."
good,"Very good organization to work with,Very systemic,but some people managers are weak in managing their subordinate and thinks they are very professional."
good,"Supported the VP and Director of operations.  Trained in my spare time to become a media technician.  My work is challenging just the way I like it.  As an executive administrator, I supported the VP, Director and 5 Managers of API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) Operations, from Plasma, Media, Small Scale Up, Fermentation and Purification Operations.  I enjoy my work and look forward to finding a challenging position to further my career."
good,The people here are great to work with. My only problem is not being compensated via title and pay for doing the same things my peers are doing. We are a small site at RTP and yet the communication on all levels has not been what it should be for the last seven years. I am glad I have a job but feel undervalued at this time and wish to find employment that has compensation in line with the duties that are being performed.
good,the hardest part of the job is out at the rail road dragging pipe in the winter. other then that it is stress free and a great group of people work there.
good,Company is relocating too far for me. It has been a good 5+ years here. Work is enjoyable.
good,"I worked in the greenhouses at one of the farm sites. I was actually a tempory/contract employee that worked on a large experiment. The team was actually made of temporary/contract employees. The management on site was great. Everyone took their turn working weekends, holidays, and overtime. Any and all safety equipment required for any part of the job was supplied by Monsanto. All in all it was a good experience."
good,"enjoyed working with co-workers, management somewhat difficult to work with, too much travel expected"
good,A cultura da empresa é muito forte e seus funcionários a absorvem em pouco tempo. A estrutura é bem matricial. Em geral é uma ótima empresa!
good,"El área de mantención de la empresa esta constituida por un sector eléctrico, mecánico y de instrumentación, el área de instrumentación a la cual fui designado esta a cargo de todos los secadores de maíz."
good,Management allowed you to use your own skills to make jobs easier
good,"-un día típico en el trabajo: Tranquilo,mucha tecnologia."
good,I enjoyed my job everyday. I had passion for the products and for my customers. I always strived to be at the top of the list in numbers and awards. I was constantly challenged and welcomed these challenges. I have been with them for over 23 years.
good,"From 2000 to 2011 I was a production technichian. Daily readings samples, DCS and Dleta V system controls. Clear equipment / start ups and shutdowns and trouble shoot equipment as needed when process issues would arise."
good,"Aqui sobre todo fue que aprendí muchas cosas del campo y de las semilla, de como se siembra y de como se recogen. Del trabajo de la gente del campo y de mi trabajo en el laboratorio. También aprendí a estar a cargo de gente humilde, donde me reí mucho y aprendí comparaciones simpatiquisimas."
good,"As a 'stagiaire' (trainee) you are given daily responsabilities that require attention and appropriate responses as of the first day. I was required to learn quickly about credit management, SAP software and organisation methods in the work place. My supervisor encouraged me to be curious and willing to do in depth research. As a small team of three people, we worked closely togethar and were able to help each other keep to our respective deadlines when necessary. The biggest challenge for me was to establish a new procedure for credit management monitoring, as it required a lot of in depth research into the existing databases. I certainly enjoyed the experience, mostly as I got along well with my supervisor and her assistant."
good,Monsanto is a great place to work at.
good,"Nice gym & cafeteria on site. Only two issues I had were a family member working in the same department as another family member who was the department manager, creating interacting issues & division & there was a long hiring freeze during my time there."
good,In bayer the usual routine is to take appointment with the doctor and promote the brands.management is protective but sales pressure is high with non moving brands.
good,"Foi uma empresa que me ajudou a evoluir muito profissionalmente, dando a oportunidade de conhecer dezenas de áreas relacionadas a tecnologia."
good,"As an outsourced resource, never had a chance to move up.  For the past few years, it has been all about cost-cutting, and it has ruined what was once a great company to work for"
good,"I would have loved to finish my career at Bayer, but the entire Regional Latin American office was terminated and relocated to another country, so that’s the main reason I’m searching."
good,"O ambiente é muito bom para se trabalhar, os colaboradores se ajudam."
good,Inspiring global organisation who recompense employees very well for their commitment and contribution. Highly innovative with first class tech support.
good,"I have a great mentor to start with, so they make sure that I get all the exposure that I am supposed, s there has been a huge room for me to learn in different departments."
good,"Trabalhar na Bayer tem sido uma experiência cada vez mais gratificante,apesar de ser temporária (safrista) pude aprender muito, tive oportunidade de passar por setores diferentes como produção e laboratório atualmente."
good,"Empresa grande, multinacional com peso no mercado."
good,"Very physical work, lots of downtimes when production is down but tons of overtime while production is up and running. Union workforce environment, decent pay."
good,Management can be a little rough and over the top at times but that's about the only problem I had when working here. A nice and quaint place to work. The clients can be annoying at times but that's about it.
good,"Boas empresas. Na bayer muito alemão com cargos de mando com baixa experiencia e muitas vantagens, o que levou a muitas disputas políticas internas.Baixas possibilidades de promoção."
good,"There is a very collaborative environment and lots of opportunities to build your network and meet interesting people.  Unfortunately, there were limited opportunities to advance within the company."
good,"It's only stressful during harvest months. Other than that, it's a pretty relaxed environment as long as you are able to perform the job. Better management would've been better."
good,"Bayer purchasing Monsanto certainly changed things.  In some ways, benefits are better; but, currently, moving to another role or advancing your career is frozen until all positions are vetted within the new company."
good,"it is nice place to start working there."
good,Overall it was a nice place to work. It was very safety oriented and production oriented. I was able to leave Monsanto as a well rounded and successful Production/Maintenance Technician.
good,"Benefits for full time employees are excellent.  Seasonal/temp employees get good healthcare and savings in pension, but no vacation pay.  This job believes in safety and promotes it."
good,"This is a great place to work especially if you are single, just getting your career started.  This is a high pressure company with heavy demands on production requiring you to take the job with you even when you are suppose to be off.  The WFH flexibility kind of curbs this but you have managers that prefer you come into the office versus WFH (double negative).  The perks are great, the onsite cafeteria is cool , but again, this keeps you from leaving the office and truly getting away for a break.  The constant meetings prevent you from getting any work done in the office thus having to take it home or work through the weekend.  Management needs to work on time management as the meetings are not structured the best and takes up precious time.  Management is based on who you know and who likes you.  You typically don't see anyone advancing other than those you can clearly identify in a click.  Most in the operations department have ben advanced by their friends and it shows as they have no idea what they are doing and rely on their employees to make them shine.  There is a great deal of idea theft.  You must be careful to put your name on all contributions you make or others will definitely take credit for them."
good,"Empresainovadora, dinamica e muito competitiva, buscando excelencia em pessoas, produtos e clientes"
good,"-great management"
good,Some policies they enforce more than others. Pay good. Since Bayer took over health benefits are going up. You have to work with many lazy young people that get away with too much and don’t get reprimanded.
good,It was a good starting point for my career.  Could have been more organized but the atmosphere was amazing.  People were always willing to help out when they could.
good,la tipica giornata è quella di essere utili a tutti e aiutare senza nessuna presunzione dando il proprio supporto al/la collega che ha bisogno di essere aiutata/o senza fare il/la saccente di turno.
good,"people are ok.  the gigantic campus is difficult to work on, fo example your next meetin might be a 20 minute walk. Now I will write a bunch of nonsense words to get out of this form."
good,"Bayer is a well managed company."
good,"Great place to work, however once in you can get ""stuck"".  There is low turnover, don't expect in role promotions or quick advancement.  Not uncommon to see people in the same role for 7-10 years.  "
good,"Empresa excelente de trabalhar, mas muito corporativa com os membros e beira funcionalismo publico."
good,"You can't just be good at your job to advance, you need to be a superstar or have a PHD. If you are assertive with career development, it will happen."
good,"Some departments within Bayer that have a more lax approach to work- able to work from home, etc and others are very strict. Consistency would be nice"
good,"They give many opportunities to learn new skills, but within the my current team it is hard to move up on the ladder. You have to look at other teams to have a better chance of becoming Monsanto employed."
good,"Bayer shut down the Institute, West Virginia site, and provided no transfer opportunities to any employee over the age of 60.  While age discrimination is illegal, it is widely practiced in the chemical industry."
good,"c'est une entreprise qui m'a permis de développer mon autonomie."
good,Nice place to work.  Great benefits.  Assistance with education is awesome.  The people and diversity is acceptable.  Work life balance is like no other.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar,boa equipe de trabalho,boa localização."
good,"Uma boa empresa para trabalhar, ambiente amigavel, dificil crescer na empresa."
good,"One of the best place to work, very silent organization. you may work for entire life. But may not get growth as per current scenario. Bayer is no 1 organization across the world in all business group. I had been selected for 2 International trip. travel a lot for business. Bayer conduct very nice training program"
good,"I was with Monsanto for four years as a seasonal research tech. Job duties varied depending on which department had me, ranging from working in the seed lab to field work and scouting. The work was generally physical and outdoors; nothing too extreme as long as you're in decent shape. Prepare for sun burns, insect stings, and dehydration. Company will provide sunscreen and bug repellent, as well as caps, gloves, water, and sports drinks. "
good,"Desenvolvi um trabalho técnico e de desenvolvimento de novos produtos. Adquiri conhecimentos técnicos, contatos com clientes e habilidade de relacionamento com distribuidores e mercado."
good,Fun and relaxed work environment with manageable workload. Mostly good team members and management who are helpful and responsive when needed. Learned many useful techniques for physiochemical testing and analyses of agricultural products.
good,Poor decision making and a lack of strong management has undermined this company.  People with knowledge and experience are leaving and new hires tend to focus too much on their phones and social media.  No real workers left.
good,I worked in Iowa it was very quick paced and tiring. The company provides you with beverages and gear to wear to protect you from the sun you meet people with many types of back grounds
good,"Morning meetings 8AM everyday.  This is to be up to date on the various things happening within the plant.  Occasional meetings outside of this.  Typically working most of the day on a given project or assignment on your own.  Collaboration does happen, but not often in my case.  Also, can be very tough to work with certain people in the plant.  Definitely workers who are unwilling to change, which is a problem when you are hired to ""improve"" things.  "
good,Performance is based on results and achieved targetted objectives. Employee engagement and leadership empowerment are present. Flexible working time. Environment is relaxed and colleagues are professional
good,"A typical day is pretty much like any other office place - arrive at 8, get coffee, sit in meetings, and then go home around 4."
good,I worked at the production plant for a few months during a summer job and it was pretty slow going and relaxed but also boring at times.  They are very into safety and many rules and regulations are in place.
good,"My typical days are very different, because unfortunately the Firefighting is in place with the machines. I have one maintenance colleague and we solve a lot of daily problems. I build a preventive and planned maintenance part but two people is not enough for the whole site management. I working with some external company. I deal with investment (budget, reasons, request from the management etc) and forklift, building maintenance so every technical issue at the site. I work as a contractor, but my boss promised me that I will became a Monsanto employee. I was not happened so I started to search a job because it is just a temporary contract..."
good,"Nice place to work. Very diverse. It was a great work environment. Great co-workers. There was a lot of on-the-job training, school reimbursements, benefits were top notch."
good,"Usually work from 7-5 outside of seasonal hours."
good,"Typically days were devoted to conceiving, performing lab experiments or discussions of results and next course of action. The most difficult part of the job were unrealistic timelines but this was also an enjoyable environment thanks to some excellent coworkers."
good,Typical work day started at 7 AM and stopped about 5 PM. I learned a lot about the Fire/Security and building products and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with staff.
good,"Handling all system related work in SAP. like- billing, collection, daily reports, MIS, party account statements, collection reports, orders, CN etc."
good,"Fairly paid, good hours. If you enjoy gardening, you will learn a lot. Hourly salary is fair for the amount of work. I have recommended at least 5 people."
good,"I worked at this company for 12 years, during which time it changed titles 3 different times through mergers and buy outs.  I started having several health issues and was also caring for my very ill mother.  My immediate department was very understanding and was flexible with my schedule.  Then someone in my department spoke to someone in HR department & I immediately had a target on my back.  I still completed my work requirements on a daily basis, even with a variable work schedule; however, it was a reason for HR to point a spot light on me.  After struggling for a year to keep my job, they finally found a reason to let me go.  The company itself has a good work environment & most people are very friendly and respectful to their colleagues.  Just don't get HR's bad side and you can find a happy career with this company."
good,I loved it it was only that i had a contract employment so it could end whenever they decided I wasn't needed anymore and with that it's difficult to have real discussions with management considering everything went threw the contract company.
good,"This is a very safe work place, but being a large company, your job security is never guarunteed. Many of the orders received come from people who you may have never met."
good,"Great people, hard working culture with great work-life balance. Excellence demanded through and through. Proud to have been part of their legacy. Great opportunity to grow and learn personally and professionally."
good,The work was steady throughout the day in a team environment. It was a combination of working on emails and phone calls from customers using Bayer OTC products.

good,"Highly professional working culture and experienced staff."
good,"Working in Monsanto was a great experience for me because of the good relationship among the management and employees and the challenges on the day to day work. Better understanding of the company which they provide to the employees. Top management constant communications through meetings and awarding employees for a job well done help boast the morale of the employees."
good,"Es una empresa q propone un buen ambiente laboral, aunque por sus expectativas y cambios a nivel global, imposibilita la posibilidad de proyectar a largo plazo."
good,"Corporate world is very challenging, more and more technology oriented work, world wide exposure, networking abroad, very encouraging, but limited to one area of specialty. No job rotation concept. Management is charged. At staff level Politics of bad nature all over. Salary level acceptable but not encouraging."
good,Only complaint I have is that being in the Union stifles opportunity because they don't enforce the rights of the members to advance.
good,"Challenging but fun place to work, was able to create a good work - life balance when needed.  Best part was working with the people at the site.  Always had goals to accomplish but was able to modify them if needed as things changed."
good,"La mia giornata è un po' particolare in quanto al mattino svolgo le attività di Marketing e al pomeriggio ""recupero"" il mio ruolo di Recruiter."

good,It was a good experience since i had to work individually for the first time. It was something new to learn. I had to manage my time according to the tasks at hand. I had to provide good customer service to users which was a good experience for me.
good,"In meiner langen Zeit im Unternehmen habe ich sehr viele Menschen, Aufgaben und Kommunikationsstrategien kennengelernt. Das Unternehmen seinerzeit als berufliches Zuhause empfunden. Die Kommunikation im Kollegenteam war toll. Sehr angenehme Zusammenarbeit im Unternehmen insgesamt, teils sehr vertrautes und wertschätzendes Verhältnis. "

good,"it was my dream company and enjoyed very with the organization overall it is wonderful company in the world"
good,I liked being a contractor at monsanto.  It was a cool place to work.  The people were nice and took time to talk to you and train you on things that you needed to know.
good,we went out and just pollinate the corn and see if it was the right time to put a shoot on it. They had reallt nice work staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in groups because it made the workers interact with each others and made work more fun.

good,"Opportunities for different roles exist."
good,"A typical day consists of being in the field calling on MS Clinics, neurologists, managed care organizations, pharmacies and any other additional opportunity to drive business.  I learned many wonderful things at Bayer: leadership, further developed strategic selling, business planning, and how to enhance partnerships with accounts.  I was lucky to have amazing co-workers with vast experiences that allowed me to utilize them as resources in certain approaches to my accounts.  The managers that I was able to have while at Bayer were all very smart, professional, dedicated employees.  They taught me many valuable tools in becoming a future leader, how to manage situations, and how to manage people.  The hardest part of my job was the massive infusion of competition when your product is the initial product in the market, an injection when orals come to the market, and seeing good people lost due to downsizing.  The most enjoyable was the ability to see people newly diagnosed over 15 years ago, still on your product, and having a great quality of life."
good,"I am currently exploring new challenges within your organization, I would like to present my resume for your consideration. I believe you will find my over 10 years of sales and account sales management experience valuable, including specific success across wholesale, retail, and convenience distribution channels.

good,I enjoy volunteering for projects to gain more experience. Currently I am on a marketing team to develop a go to market strategy for Bayer’s new SDHI fungicide.  In the past I worked on Diversity Council Project to put together a panel of customers where we discussed Generational Diversity and how different Generations think  impacts their buying decisions in the Specialty Chemical markets.
good,"Safety is first."
good,"A empresa preocupa-se no bem estar e qualidade de vida/bem estar  dos colaboradores. "
good,Monsanto was and is a great place to work.  Always a new challenge that can bring about and produce success stories or success failures.

It can also include process improvement projects to ensure customers are satisfied with finished product.
good,"Bayer has a diverse portfolio."
good,"Trabalho dinâmico, visitando clientes em seus consultórios e ou em instituições para negociação dos produtos para padronização."
good,I worked at Bayer for several years and enjoyed my time there. They are mainly a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility for Factor 8.

good,Une entreprise agréable mais aucune opportunité de carrière est à envisager !
good,"You feel like you are working for a global organization.  There is little contact with your manager, yet the managing of your own position is welcomed to me.  However, there are negatives to everyone being so busy and mostly knowing only their job."
good,"It's one of the best companies in the world, it does not do aggressive sales like most other European or American pharma companies do, which is a reason to respect it more, however this means that salaries and training opportunities of its staff are much lower than the market.  "
good,"A empresa busca adequar treinamentos para aprimorar todos os funcionários com base nas perspectivas futuras nos mercados de atuação. Há liberdade para definição de investimentos e educação médica continuada desde que dentro das normas de Compliance. Em geral, os profissionais são bem qualificados e a gerência costuma optar por promover pessoas internas capacitadas para cargos superiores ao invés de contratar profissionais do mercado. O ambiente de trabalho é bom. A empresa proporciona diversos benefícios para seus funcionários."
good,Learned alot about healthcare industry and FDA regulations and guidelines
good,"Worked daily to meet customer needs and improve patient's quality of life.  From various managers, I was able to sharpen my selling skills and improve territory management.  Inspired and motivated daily by an experienced team of co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was manuevering the managed care landscape.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my customers and helping them make a difference in their patient's lives."
good,Management needs some improvement but overall great company.
good,"Atualmente estávamos focados no treinamento dos farmacistas e aplicação das estratégias do marketing através do merchandising para melhor exposição na categoria. Durante o período trabalhado desenvolvi minhas habilidades no relacionamento interpessoal, principalmente pela atuação no varejo que exige maior proximidade tanto com os clientes quanto com os colaboradores. Como se tratava de uma linha de baixa representatividade nos resultados corporativos, os investimentos eram aquém da necessidade do mercado e dos recursos aplicados pelos concorrentes, o que dificultava em muito a conquista de market share."
good,Amplas vagas disponíveis em diversas áreas;horário flexível de trabalho.
good,"Very challenging to deal with different issues and solve problems as they come along every day. Also to prioritize different tasks and activities, to meet the deadlines and work under pressure has always been motivating."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Bayer. As a brand manager, no two days are alike, and that keeps it interesting."
good,Chego cedo e me preparo para o kaizen (segurança do trabalho).
good,I enjoyed the worked I did there and I had great reviews. It appears to have good benefits of people that work full-time there. The co-workers may not always have the most professional form of communication but workable.
good,"Good place to work with lots of opportunity to grow and develop professionally. Driven, passionate staff. Highly matrixed organizations. Very competitive culture. Best part was working with cutting edge technology and very good technical leadership. Excellent senior management team guiding company direction."
good,"A typical day at work means reviwing tasks for the day, communicating with our marketing agency. communicating with the production plant and ensuring product labels are up to date."

good,"Overall Nice place to work. Good exposure to current technologies. Huge multimillion dollor projects. Contractors have less growth opportunities. Doesn't sponsor Visas. Co-workers are reasonably good. Nice place to work. Best part baout Bayer is, it is in Berkeley."
good,A day at Monsanto typically starts with contacting a lot of companies who you gain a relationship with on a day to day basis. The good thing is that you have the same contact people on a regular. I learned the ends and outs of the company on the import/export side. The management is typically laid back and approachable. They are hard working people who expect nothing less than that in return from their employees. There was no hard part. The enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly people that felt like family.
good,"At Monsanto I was able to employ many of the skills I brought from my business. I received recognition for mastery of 16 skill sets and was working on 6 more, that would have put me in position for a Tech 4."
good,"I worked at Monsanto before it was bought out by Bayer. My employer hired me for two seasons, and was fair, caring about the employees and their wellbeing."
good,"A empresa em é bastante estruturada no que se refere à plano de carreira e formato de trabalho, seguindo metodologias da melhor forma más, possibilitando muita negociação e flexibilização em processos burocráticos e morosos."
good,"I was a contractor, so I can't comment like a full-time position person. In terms of pay and work/life balance, it is a good place to work. They allowed me to work at home mostly and didn't require me to come to work. They trusted my work and project quality."
good,"The largest pharma company in the world. It is easy to become a number in such a large firm, needs discipline to retain individuality, but great growing opportunities."
good,"Während meiner Ausbildung und auch während meiner Zeit als Mitarbeiterin bei Bayer, teilweise alleinerziehend, habe ich das Unternehmen als sehr entgegenkommend im Bereich Familie und Beruf erlebt. Großes Lob!"
good,"Safety and fun environment. People are friendly, well-trained, professional and approachable, especially the HR people and the management. There are so many ways to have work-life balance. They only do not enhance your business skills, but also your individual talents."
good,"Very easy work, not hard at all. Nice employees. The hardest part of my job is working in the heavy rain and cold. And the most enjoyable part of my job is cleaning the machines, working with others. Helping everyone at the factory out."

good,"Journée en horaires variables, peu d'opportunités d'évolution;"
good,"There were a couple of employees who didn't take the job very seriously causing the rest of the employees to have to stay late. On the other hand, it was a great experience to be able to work with some of my friends."

good,"Compañia con excelentes estandares y nivel profesional, que permite aprender diariamente en la resolucion de problemas y gestionar la seguridad como un valor.  Es lenta para las transformaciones y cambios."
good,This was a temporary summer job for immigrants or young adults off for the summer. It was a job that required physical labor in the summer heat. It was a job that also required collaboration of employees.
good,"La seguridad es primordial en esa empresa. "
good,I had no problems doing what was asked it was very very easy work. I liked the job and it my be a job for many other people too I would definitely recommend this job
good,"This job was for summers only so many of my fellow coworkers were also college students. Our supervisors were permanent full-time Monsanto employees who traveled from the main Monsanto plant during the summer. It was hot, humid, and sweaty, and long hours, but it was great money. I was one of the few female coordinators and was treated respectfully. I was assigned to a contractor who had his team of hired corn detasselers, usually high school/college kids. I made sure that this contractor issued proper PPE, water, and restrooms and ensured that it was worn. I also administered safety trainings and reported the amount of work completed to my supervisor each day. This job did not come with heatlh benefits. I suppose if I were looking to get a job in the plant like my supervisors that this would have been a great way to get my foot in the door."
good,great cohesive work environment.  dedicated employees striving to make peoples' lives better through a commitment to better healthcare options.  recommend to friends.
good,Una gran Organización. Muchos años de historia pero en permanente renovación. Duré 15 años habiendo hecho una amplia carrera en Marketing y como manager.
good,Typical day is meetings followed by regular computer work along with meeting with colleagues to discuss mutual projects and efforts aligned with team values and an approach to fulfill the mission of the company.
good,Bayer is een leuk bedrijf om voor te werken. Ik werk er nu met veel plezier.
good,I enjoy working at Bayer Monsanto for the most part it is a productive plant and enjoyable to go to work but it also has its days were you don't know who you can trust and that also includes management.
good,"Legacy company was fantastic, still learning about our new ownership. So far so good. Work life balance is strong, opportunities to prove skills and value abundant."
good,"Empresa com grande oportunidade de aprendizado, gestores sempre disponiveis."
good,Aprendes a valorar las diferencias entre una multinacional y una pequeña o mediana empresa.
good,"Great workplace/life balance, friendly environment. Freedom to operate and grow your skills. A very rewarding career opportunity, Mission focused, team"
good,Bayer provides an open workplace culture.  There is the ability to approach management of all levels.  Communication is open.  There is also a flexible work/life balance.
good,The hours would vary and dehydration was a huge problem for a lot of people working there. You would get paid for the work you did and it was paid by acre.
good,My time at Bayer was a very interesting learning experience with great co-workers and an excellent support system to create a really pleasant working experience.
good,"Company does well taking care of their employees. Enjoyed working for them, but did have tough days as company changes have been underway.  Great team environment and try to set their people up for success."
good,"changing leadership"
good,"Management was questionable at times. Got 15 minute breaks twice a day. It usually was boring and overstaffed in the warehouses, but when the summer would come around it was better because not everyone was in the warehouse."
good,"we like a one big family,Fun place to work with,good co workers from top to bottom.Sad that they relocated to East Coast to save money due to the high cost of living here in San Diego Ca.They helped us doing our resume by hiring professionals,teaching us how to answer job interviews, etc...during the time that we were closing the laboratory here in San Diego."
good,"Most workdays included many telephone conversations in-between customer or dealer meetings.  Managing your time and being able to prioritize are critical skills.  "
good,"Foi uma empresa que me proporcionou uma gama de experiências muito boas, seja pessoalmente ou proporcionalmente, me ajudando a evoluir profissionalmente"
good,Good Company to work for. The culture is is a good environment. Unfortunately downsizing is the reality and the hardest part of the job. The people over all are a god group.
good,"Monsanto cultivates a mindful work environment, with a focus on the mission, attention to the person in addition to the work, and emphasis on safety first. Occasionally, the desire to give autonomy to individuals makes for an ambiguous work environment, but like with any large company, there are opportunities for all types of performers. Also, some areas of the company are highly matrixed, where other parts are not. I learned a lot about people management, goal-setting, and business-sense during my career there. Hardest part of the job: managing multiple, and sometimes contradictory expectations. Easiest and most enjoyable part of the job, availability of resources."
good,Not a terrible place to work very cGMP regulated. People seem slightly stressed depending on what job they have. Employees here are either union or company.
good,"My direct supervisor and higher supervisors were very helpful and wanted you to succeed. Efficiency and attention to detail is a. Must for this job. "
good,Muy buena experiencia por las posibilidades de crecimiento en la Empresa.
good,Been with the company less than a year and Monsanto is about to be bought by Bayer. not sure what's going to happen. That is cause for concern. The merger seems to have put a black cloud over the employees.
good,"Here at Bayer, they try to make it fun to work at."
good,Everyone was so friendly there.  They have a nice credit union that I still do business with.  Used the credit union to purchase a vehicle.  Bayer CropScience is a chemical plant for lawn chemicals so the aroma can be quite offensive at times.
good,"Overall a decent place to work. Pay is decent, but it is a political game in order to get promoted. "
good,"As an employer Bayer has excellent benefit packages. Depending on the position you are in the pay can range from good to bad. Be aware though, a company this large is a very corporate world."
good,"The people made this a great, collaborative, team environment.  When you feel like everyone has a shared purpose and shared goals, work doesn't feel like work."
good,"Rdv titulaire pour faire le point puis formation de l’equipe Sur l3s points vus avec le titulaire et ensuite merchandisings avec création ou aménagement de rayons libre accès."
good,É uma empresa muito focada em relacionamentos internos o que algumas vezes faz com que os resultados sejam deixados em segundo plano.
good,"German company which has quite a bit of red tape and processes.  The process slows down decisions and can be cumbersome.  Discusses life values as critical and important but in reality this is impossible for most positions.  To stay competitive with others you need to put in many hours outside of normal work time. I did like the team atmosphere, good people work there.  Management feeds the line that home and family matters but in reality its not always the case."
good,"Manager and Team-Mates all well-suited with same objective in mind. Quality service to customers and building personal / professional relationships."
good,Avere la possibilità di confrontarsi in una multinazionale come Monsanto è sicuramente un'ottima esperienza.
good,Société prestataire en incohérence avec le site. Le site en lui même reste très intéressant (SEVESO seuil haut)
good,"Monsanto provided me with many opportunities that I am grateful for.  It was a pleasant environment.  However, I prefer not to make an in depth analysis."
good,It's a decent place to work. Very hard to get on full-time but if you do it's worth it. Good benefits and nice people. Depending on were you are in the plant.

good,"O funcionário é muito bem valorizado."
good,"I had a very good job, experience and future at Bayer.I was very disappointed and surprised when they closed he plant. In the end I feel the company was mismanaged."
good,"Depending on what manager you are under, which I guess is true for all companies. I had two good managers at the start of my tenure - very hands-off and trusting you to do the job. The last manager was very demotivating for me, so I was glad I got laid off."
good,"Not the biggest portfolio but fun place to work, overall.  Monsanto merger is putting stress on all other Bayer businesses; having to get by & perform with thin staff during the merger"
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was mentoring new staff and coaching a large project team of business analysts and developers."
good,"Very relaxed , good people to work with ..."
good,"Was a contractor other than it was a good place to work. The projects were interesting. The support was somewhat lacking. However, i would recommend it others colleagues searching for work."
good,"Promover os produtos agroquímicos e as respetivas vendas."
good,I contract at Bayer Animal Health.  There is a long wait in order to become hired as a full-time bayer employee.  I have been there for almost 2 years now as a contractor and no positions in my area have opened up.  some people contract for 3 years before getting a position.  It is difficult to go so long with no paid days off.
good,"very flexible working schedule, generous vacations days and holiday. on-site child care facility. good health insurance and other benefit. company 1on1 matching for donations."
good,"As a contractor, monsanto is a nice place to work.  Most managers are great.  The pace and level of effort on work changes based on amount of work to be done, but even when extended hours are needed, it isn't overwhelming."
good,"Definitely a recommended field of work as the work quotas were not impossible to meet. An easy eight hour working day which required one to work in a team of three to eight personnel assembling different parts of medical machines. For someone who is mechanically inclined , on the job training will come very easily. The culture at the begging of my employment was very laid back. Though it was laid back , it was certainly a job that kept you constantly busy from start to finish. I really enjoyed the work with others learning how to assemble new equipment ."
good,"Excellent company to work with. They work on values mainly like Trust, Faith, ownership and professionalism. Great work life balance. Gender equality. Support and assistance to build career path."
good,"I enjoy working for Bayer.  I like the relaxed environment which is unusual for a corporate environment.  The people are very friendly and helpful.  Perks - Bayer Store where you can purchase their products at an extremely low price. Most difficult part of the job is having to leave. The most enjoyable part of the job is I learn something new every day.  I love what I do and love learning new ways to do things.  However, I am a contract employee and my position will soon be eliminated.  Therefore, I am looking elsewhere for employment.  I would definitely stay with Bayer if I could.  I will take with me a great experience and friends that will remain as such although I will not be there."
good,"I worked as a seed lab technician and it was easy work. The people were nice, reasonable rules.There was always other areas to volunteer in if you wanted overtime."
good,It really just depends on what kind of work your doing.  For the most part I did walk a lot but was on my feet most of the time. We did complete our work on time. The only bad part was the drama that happens.
good,El ambiente de trabajo es confortable para llevar a cabo cada una de las tareas encomendadas y obtenerlas exitosamente

good,"Typical day in work is learning of IL Closures of all the Locations from where we receive samples.."
good,Good company and people to team with. Great products that save live and make quality of life good for the community.  We always did what was right for the customer and took care of our equipment to be in top form.  Good pay.  Many employees overworked though which effected morale for all..

The supervisors are super encouraging and recognize hard work. Because of the nature of the position, the supervisors understand that the job is one where one comes to seek experience and leave (it's temp and seasonal work). They encourage them to seek permanent employment and to use the experience as a stepping stone to do greater in life.

good,"La compañía tiene un portafolio de productos competitivos en diversas clases terapeúticas."
good,"Monsanto's a good company to work for despite the massive amount of negative media attention it gets. Most of that is deeply misleading. Most people who work at the company feel that it is helping the world by helping more people eat better and farmers farm better. It is incredibly compliance driven, drilling into people the company's code of business conduct and regulatory obligations. It is also a very equal opportunity employer, regularly winning recognition for its commitment to equal opportunity. The hardest part about working for Monsanto in Europe is that it is headquartered in St. Louis, where many people just don't understand anything other than the United States. As a result it makes many business decisions through the perspective of red-white-and-blue-tinted glasses that are arguably not in the company's best long-term interests."

good,"Work long 10+ hour days, in which i was in charge of making managerial decisions in a high work flow environment.  Large part of my shift was spent ""putting out fires"" from the previous work group.  Lots of young people to work with (20-35 age group), high demand for workers because of the high turnover rate from 2nd and 3rd shift employees.  The best part about working in this company was the ability to work with cutting edge genetic technology, the worst part was the office politics."

good,"Monsanto offers solid work-life balance except at the upper-management level where expectations are as demanding as they are at any other publicly-traded company. There is a strong focus on employee development, however, because it is very methodical, it sometimes gives the impression that the path of career progression will be very slow even for top performers."
good,Its a great journey so far  and I met with lot of talented people and now am ready to take all my knowledge and implement them in other environments.
good,"Good company to work for. Employee safety, Flexible working, dedicated people. IT and HR need to work to train and provide succession path to employees. HR needs to be little more proactive on people development and training fund. Never get any fund for training.  Don't have a career plan for any employees. Management level is inter-connected and always keep rotating jobs among themselves. providing opportunity to all employees can make this great company greatest for employees."

good,"I have very much enjoyed working for monsanto. The people I work with are great and there is a lot of opportunity for networking. I have learned how to manage many different corn research processes in an efficient and effective way. The management has been wonderful but lately things have been difficult due to the retirement of our manager and the huge reconstruction and organization of the company. The hardest part of the job are the extremely long hours in the Fall and Spring. Makes it difficult to have anytime with family during those months. Overall though, Monsanto is a fantastic place to work."
good,"ambiente piacevole, lavoro svolto in condizoni ottimali con scrupolosoa osservanza dele norme di sicurezza"
good,"Systematic way of working."
good,People are either over-crowding which decreases my performance with huge number or no one is present which creates boredom and fatigue. I was able to increase my interactive skills with strangers. I didn't acquire any managerial skills due to my exclusivity to personal and first-line customer support. Co-workers were encouraging and supportive while providing helpful advises. The hardest part was actually the time where customers were unavailable so my assignment was to wait while doing practically nothing productive. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I managed to support the best number of customers while making them feel welcomed and taken care of.
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Baye/Covestro, but with the recent name change I feel uncertain about the future of my current benefits. For a technician just beginning a career in the petrochemical industry, this is a great place to learn."

good,Monsanto's benefits are some of the best in the job market in my opinion.  They offer their employees great vacation time as well as flexibility to work from home as needed and low cost health/dental benefits.  But the compensation is not the best...I think mainly because the benefits are so awesome.  But compensation is decent and I think it just depends on what part of the company you work for.

Afterwards, we will discuss what we will do for the day and for the rest of the week; how we will allocate our resources and time; what possible challenges that we might encountered to complete the job. Although, every day we would be busy doing our activity there was always a time to have a good time for discussion or informal chat which I think it put everyone on the edge and good understanding with strength of each person that work in this company. "

good,Colegas que ajudam no entendimento das funções e esclarecem dúvidas com boa vontade e disposição.
good,"The strength of Bayer is the quality of their employees.  Unfortunately despite lip service to the contrary, top management fails to fully understand this strength. Bayer tends to think the the pillars of the business are top management and stock holders.   In recent years there has been a tendency to view employees more as a commodity rather than as the pillar of their business that they are.  Hopefully this will change in the future."

The average work day is clear-cut, earliest 8 hours shift. My co-workers and speaking to the clients make the average day faster. The hardest part of the job was work like balance. However, the most enjoy part of the job is the incentives and the cheer during each holiday season. As a result, it a great company to work for, very hands on, job security environment."

good,I love my job at Bayer. If it were up to me I would definitely love to retire from Bayer. Unfortunately they are outsourcing Procurement to Costa Rica. Good Company to work for!!
good,"Worked tons of hours, but this is what I  wanted. I enjoyed it during the summer and while I was a field inspector. Worked for a month in the warehouse and did not enjoy it. The warehouse is not a great environment, solely because of the workers. The managers are very nice and understanding."

good,"As an agricultural company, much of the work is seasonal-focused with high-energy efforts at certain times per year depending on the role and support mission.  The company does, however, allow for time to refocus on the next year's mission once the current busy season is completed. "
good,"This was a company that I could depend on for whatever I needed. the corporate office was located in the same city as all the properties I worked on. the ownership and management could be found on property at any time without notice. this could be a blessing or a curse, but they would give you leadership either way. The CEO would not hesitate to take a walk with you and share anything he might see, and yet take the time to listen to you. I worked under several General Managers and was definitely made stronger by all of them."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Bayer.  They took care of us financially and dis a great job balancing work and life.

good,"Each working day is never the same with the nature of my job. It allows myself and my direct reports to always expect a challenge. Work volume can be low one day, but then spike the next day. I have spent a lot of time training my team so I never worry when those types of challenges arise. It makes it stressful, but fun at the same time. My team is a partnership and we are very big on supporting each other each and every day, this makes work that much more pleasant and they know they will always have my support. I have a great team that I trust and know they will always get the job done with integrity, professionalism and efficiently. They all understand the core values of the company and execute them in the work they do. Being with the company for 11 years, I have seen and been a part of so many changes, but I have never been the one to shy away from change, even if it is a challenge for me. I feel you can learn a lot from change. I actually really enjoy my job and would love to continue to grow and develop on my skillsets.  I have been given many opportunities to grow and develop over the years and I have a mentor within Bayer that helps me stay on track. Bayer is a great place to work for, it is a place that understands the importance of work-life balance."

Culturally, the company is great and working with the people at Bayer is easy and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is enduring the day to day stress. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people and knowing that our company is making a difference in the lives of people across the world."

good,"We worked outdoors seasonally with the pollination crew but I got a pretty good idea of what the ""full-timers"" (as we called them) did too. Overall everyone was pretty good to each other, slackers got fired, dangerous activity was immediately punished, company regulations were followed pretty closely. One summer one of the managers wasn't very kind to me, but she was going through a stressful time and had been fine the other years so I forgave her. We worked hard and long hours but we got through it by having the best team members every year, seriously I had a lot of fun despite how much I complained about the heat/pollen/dirt. I would recommend the summer pollinating position to anyone who is looking for job experience or a summer position. they can take all the help they can get."

Probably the best aspect of this opportunity was that it was intellectually challenging; I got to work with experts across several disciplines during our project, so I had to learn new concepts and techniques as we went along to keep up with the work.  I am very glad that I had this opportunity."

good,"Llegar al trabajo a las 7:30 am, prender la computadora y revisar los correos. Trabajar hasta reunirme con mi supervisor directo para hacer un estatus de los pendientes: como hemos avanzado, que falta, en cuanto tiempo estará listo. Compartir experiencias de las otras marcas con mis colegas. El ambiente era divertido y enriquecedor, ya que siempre teníamos actividades con las agencias de medios para conocer las nuevas tendencias del mercado o entre el equipo de marketing de manera que nos viéramos incentivados a idear nuevas maneras para vender nuestro producto. La parte mas difícil fue lograr aprender a manejar proveedores externos, ya que muchas veces se necesita de su apoyo para sacar adelante una actividad y no siempre se recibe una respuesta rápida. En mi opinión este tipo de dificultades te ensenan a buscar formas efectivas de lograr el apoyo que se requiere, manteniendo siempre una buena relación con el proveedor. Este trabajo me dejo muy buenas experiencias, ayudándome a crecer personal y profesionalmente. Lo que mas me gusto fue la innovación constante que este tipo de trabajo requiere, es un trabajo que te invita a buscar siempre la manera de hacer las cosas distintas para poder lograr los objetivos planteados."

The management listens to their employees and works with you in order to help you succeed. Coworkers are friendly and they strive to create an atmosphere of acceptance and equality.

good,"Monsanto is a good company to work for. Managers in my department trusted their employees, and concerned themselves more with ensuring that we had the necessary resources to do our job than they did with making demands. We were often busy but didn't feel excessively pressured or stressed. "
good,Working at Monsanto is hard work but the management along with the people you work with are great people and easy to get along with. I learned a lot about different kinds of seed grown in the mid-west and how to operate a forklift. The hardest part of the job is probably throwing 70lb. seed bags at 7am. but it is made more enjoyable due to the positive work envirronment.
good,"Bayer es una empresa donde es muy agradable trabajar, desde las instalaciones, las comodidades y facilidades en cuanto a transporte, las personas, su cultura organizacional, hace que uno se sienta trabajando entre amigos y aunque hayan presiones, se hacen mucho más llevaderas."
good,"Assessed information security risks for over 200 Monsanto projects, RFPs and vendor engagements."
good,The job I had varied from season to season and whenever you became tired of a task it was time to move onto the next task. I worked in agriculture and it was generally an 8-5 workday with some exceptions throughout the year. I started here three years ago making $8.50/hr and in a 1.5 yrs I was hired onto a full time position making much more than that. There is 50/50 mix of physical outdoor labor and mental indoor work. The hardest part for me was balancing priorities during the summer. With multiple locations to monitor and maintain priorities had to be established. My co-workers are positive people and promote growth both personally and professionally. The most enjoyable part of the job was the oppurtunity to work with these individuals.

good,"em relação a estabilidade não posso dizer, pois trabalhei prestando serviços a esta empresa, mas é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, não tem descriminação, trata todos os funcionários por igual tanto temporários, quanto os efetivos da empresa."
good,"Era comum eu lidar com frascos de medicamentos, e os colocava por sobre a esteira, para serem rotulados. Outrora, colocava os frascos já embalados, em caixas, para serem embalados. Aprendi como funciona o processo de uma empresa farmacêutica, e aprendi sobre estratégias de produção, através de reuniões que a empresa promovia até então. A direção é muito competente, e de muito profissionalismo. Convivência equilibrada, de pessoas competentes, e todos se prontificavam a me ensinar detalhes do serviço, de forma pertinente. A parte mais difícil pra mim, enquanto trabalhava, era entender e aprender acerca do set-up da máquina, ou seja, o ajuste, no tocante a mudança de produto. A mais agradável era quando a produção fluía bem, sem interrupções, pois se a produção responde o que a empresa necessita, todos se satisfazem, e cobranças desnecessárias são vilipendiadas."
good,"Developing on new Skills and learning new Technology."
good,Oferece oportunidade para todos usufruírem da infraestrutura.
good,"- dinâmico"
good,"Most days were a lot alike, once on task was complete we moved to the next one. I learned a lot about taking samples for research and the whole process of how corn and soybeans grow. Management was excellent. All of the managers were very easy to get a long with. They were always nice and always looked out for their workers. The hardest part of this job were times when we had to sit and wait for a task, such as if a tractor broke down, we couldn't do root digs on the crops for testing. The most enjoyable part of this job were the people I worked with. Everybody got along well and always had fun."
good,"Bayer Material Science's innovative culture, flexibility and global scope make it an attractive employer!"

A parte mais dificil era saber que mais que eu atingisse meus resultados nao pedria contribuir para que a divisão nao acabasse. A BAYER é uma ótima empresa. Indico, recomendo e admiro. "

good,Empresa extremamente agradável e muito boa de se trabalhar.
good,Enjoyed working there. People were very helpful and learned quite a lot. I was a contract but everyone treated me the same as all the rest of the workers there. Co-workers made the rest of the day and work move smoothly.
good,"Each day started out with an entrepreneurial attitude and self-discipline. In each day I learned how to be an entrepreneur in an underperforming territory, consisting of 27 zip codes that had not been taken care of in nearly a year. Everyone else in my district had a partner, except me. This to me was not a challenge, but a gift. With a territory that had a market share around .02% when I started, my hardest battle was not enough time in the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was strategically creating a marketing plan on how best to see those subscribers' in this large territory and seeing how I was going to grow the market share, solo. My manager was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job and will always be someone of whom I recognize throughout my career. Even though he had to give some constructive criticism at times, he always led by example in an inspiring manner. He never put me down, but always believed in me and saw the best of every situation. Because of this, my co-workers, ended up praising me, along with the Regional Director of Sales and Vice President of Sales, for increasing that .02% market share 700% within six months assignment to the territory."

good,"Work usually started at about 6 or 7 am depending on the weather. I learned how to become a helpful team member and how to be responsible with my work. All of the team leaders were very nice, answered every question I had, and always willing to help me in the field when I wasn't fully understanding the task. The only hard part of the job I would say is the unbearable heat while working in the corn. Pushing through the hard parts are so worth it with the amount of friends you make while working here."
good,"Empresa com ótimos salários, dinâmica, ambiente agradável de se trabalhar."

good,"Al ser una empresa que todos posean cascos blancos, lo hace de un trato a los trabajadores mas cordial y sin prejuicios"
good,"Working at Bayer was an eye opening and great life experience for me. It was my first exposure to engineering in a work environment and shed a lot of light on how life as a mechanical engineer in a manufacturing plant would be. Unfortunately, I did not use any 3-D modeling software while working there and thus all of my 3-D modeling experience has been strictly from school. However, what I did gain from working at Bayer was largely troubleshooting, technical writing, and teamwork experience. Not much guidance was given to me when I started working there (by design). I learned quickly how and where to find information I needed. By talking to and making friends with maintenance personnel, line operators, and fellow engineers I was able to complete vague and initially confusing projects before their deadlines."
good,Bayer is an outstanding organization that is extremely ethical and cares very much about their employees.  Over the years Bayer provided me with many opportunities for learning and travel.

I rose from the ranks from being a Medical Representative and eventually a Sales Manager with 6 Regional Managers and 2 Key Account Specialist as my Direct Reports. It is with Bayer that I was moulded into being the leader that I am now. I have met the most supportive customer to the most difficult Doctor and made them loyal Bayer supporters. "

good,"Un día típico inicia con la revisión de la agenda, compromisos y mail."
good,"The site has different positions that will allow individuals to grow within the company."
good,"My typical day at work is usually responding to emails and communicating through emails or Skype calls. Sometimes there are in person meetings but since most of our business is in Pittsburgh, we typically communicate on the phone. The hardest part of my job is probably balancing decisions that are made in Pittsburgh vs decisions made here in Whippany - there is sometimes a disconnect. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"Overall, great place to work.   Good benefits.  Enjoyed the job, but had to relocate due to a job advancement for my wife.  The best part of the job was the relationships with the other employees and growers."
good,it is a good company to  work for because they do take good care of their employees. the only downside about it s not a full time job; it is seasonal.
good,"The long-term, dedicated employees that have been through a few mergers and acquisitions to get to Bayer Pharmaceuticals in Whippany, NJ today are passionate, intelligent, and well-rounded employees. Bayer has it's downsides, just like every pharmaceutical company does, but there are a few shining stars there that make it great."

Work days include interacting with different people and departments to meet production deadlines for packaging changes for medical devices worldwide.  The culture is very professional and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is waiting for responses.  As it is so detailed oriented to be sure all documentation is accurate due to Federal Regulations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great people.
good,"I loved the people and management there, they were very understanding about life situations that came up. Offered up to 50 hours a week, overtime voluntarily. The temp agency (Aerotek) was the main reason why people were aggrivated most of the time because they were horrible at their jobs."
good,"Bayer do Brasil S A está no Brasil há 150 anos foi minha primeira experiência no ramo farmacêutica aonde tive oportunidade de crescer profissionalmente com vários cursos ,treinamentos sou muito grato a Bayer."

The project was my supervisor's that he had been having interns work on for a few years now, and my part of the project was to develop a software to generate reports at any given time.  I learned a lot about what it is like to actually be in the field doing work for a company, dealing with everything such as documentation and changes that come about almost every day.

good,"So elogios, uma ótima empresa que sabe valorizar o funcionario"
good,"I worked for Bayer MaterialSciences for nearly 2 years and enjoyed every day.  I worked in the Makrolon Unit under a great management team and with really enjoyable co-technicians.  The relaxed  and productive atmosphere is nothing more than a reflection of the people who comprise the lab.  I am single and was fresh out of college and willing to work the demanding hours and schedule.  The schedule did not allow for much of a social life but the experience I gained far exceeded anything I could have hoped for in my first professional job.  I would routinely work with GC-MS, FT-IR, UV-VIS, injection molding, wet and dry chemistry practices and other quality assurance techniques that can be used to further any career based in laboratory work. I cannot speak for how other labs that comprise MaterialScience operated since my experience was limited to only the Makrolon Unit.  All in all my experience at Bayer MaterialScience was nothing short of amazing and I would strongly recommend the company to anyone looking to get their foot in the door and build solid experience."

good,"Iniciaba por las mañana acudiendo a un hospital, casi siempre de gobierno para abordar a los médicos especialistas, haciéndoles el recordatorio de nuestros productos  en cuadro básico de la institución y recalcando que son de entera confianza y calidad para sus pacientes, esto con la intención  que los incluyan en su receta. Seguido el trabajo de visita medica, se realiza en consultorios privados, prácticamente haciendo la misma función, pero ahora de manera mas personalizada interponiendo acciones de ventas, involucrándome socialmente a llegar al punto de una relación mas amistosa para que las próximas visitas de negociación sean mas productivas en función de la empresa. Con ello aprendí a ser perseverante, intuitivo, negociador y audaz en relacionarme de manera profesional con clientes, aplicando al máximo cada uno de los sentidos y habilidades desarrollados. La gerencia era el apoyo incondicional para poder lograr los objetivos planeados, con una excelente supervición del trabajo desempeñado, autorizando y apoyando cada negociación lograda. En cuanto a compañeros de trabajo, todo era realmente armónico, debido a la calidad de valores y profesionalismo que la empresa inculcaba. Cuando se refiere a lo mas difícil del trabajo, prácticamente era cuando no se encontraba al cliente agendado, teniendo que regresar al lugar cuantas veces fuera necesario hasta hacer contacto. Lo de mayor gusto  hubo muchas cosas de gran agrado, pero en realidad era la convivencia con nuestros clientes y las actividades grupales que se tenían semanalmente y en meses claves del año convenciones nacionales."
good,Worked there 4 years business closed good benefits package.Team work everyone worked together
good,"A empresa é excelente, os funcionários fixos também, infelizmente a empresa não pode dar vasão a demanda de funcionários que trabalham temporariamente dando-lhes a oportunidade de serem efetivados (o que aconteceu comigo, não pude ser efetivado), a empresa trabalha com picos de produção, para ela não é interessante manter um quadro de funcionários fixos que em determinada época vão ficar parados por não ter produção."

good,"tipico era chegar na segunda feira , e saber das novidades, tirar sarro dos colegas fanaticos pelos seus times entrar no vestiario ,colocar o uniforme e entrar para o setor de trabalho,procurando fazer sempre melhor ,para que o resultado do meu trabalho seja reconhecido. oque eu aprendi eu levo comigo em tudos os meus trabalhos por ex: uma melhoria continua,sempre pode ficar melhor, se alguma coisa oferece risco de acidente nâo fico tranquilo enquanto ese risco deichar de existir, a direção , eles se colocam como mais um membro da equipe, nâo fica do lado de fora só dando ordes aonde existe o respeirto e a amizade, o local de trabalho se torna muito mais agradavel e na Bayer era asim , a parte mais dificio do trabalho é refazer um trabalho ja com tudo embalado é muito ruim a parte mais agradável do trabalho é aprender algo novo, colocar uma maquina para trabalhar 100% onde o produto sai no final da linha com qualidade total."

Un dìa tipico de trabajo es en el que llegas a tu oficina, delegas lo que haya que hacer y dedicas tu tiempo a realizar tus funciones, sin tener un jefe encima respiràndole a uno en la nuca. Aprendì a manejar mi tiempo en funcion de los objetivos trazados y a dar todo lo que pudiera para beneficio de la empresa sin pensar en que me va a dar ella, pues ya me daba lo que necesitaba. la parte mas dificil fue los constantes cambios en la administraciòn y la descriminaciòn en algunos aspectos."
