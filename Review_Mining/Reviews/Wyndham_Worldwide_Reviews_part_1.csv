rating,review
bad,"Burn and turn"
bad,"Management are terrible people. "
bad,Also they dont have enough staff for both laindry and housekeeping so the. House keepers have to do their own laundry but gets in trouble for taking to much time in their normal workday so management will start screwing up their checks. And in some cases u have management that shouldnt even be allowed to still be management due to lack of wollingness to do their job and go do inspectio
bad,"they timeshare you into this job, you sit in mall booths all day long, you don't hit budget due to poor management, they don't listen to the actual concerns of employees, and honestly management sucks."
bad,"RUN far away from WYNDHAM NASHVILLE."
bad,Typical day was 4 1/2 - 5 hours.   Dealing with public/some good--some not so good.  I enjoyed most of the customers.  They were friendly and appreciative.  I enjoyed the early hours.
bad,"Management treats employees like garbage. We are all disposable human assets. Constantly tear you down. They attempt to make you feel special with incentives and prizes, but it’s all just a ploy into keeping you there so you can suffer for eternity."
bad,"This company promises the moon, you will not make it without dishonesty and manipulation. $300‐400/week tops. This could be a class act, but they have juvenile management, biased preferences with unrealistic expectations. Pick a little, talk a little...cheap, cheap, cheap. Disappointing. Waste of my time."
bad,"I worked for them for 8 months, I was never late, absent, or had any complaints from guests. I worked over time when needed and only requested 1 Saturday off a month to no avail. I received several complements from guests and positive online reviews. I never had any money or rooms unaccounted for. I came to work with a positive attitude daily but was reputedly bullied by other staff members and my complaints were ignored.The manager is VERY unprofessional and based her staff off of who was in her favor and who did her job for her. I refused to gossip and do more work then I was paid to do so she had me fired just weeks before Christmas as a single Mom this was a crushing blow. If you are thinking of working for these people I would STRONGLY advise against it."
bad,Very unprofessional! The management is fake and they talk badly about people behind backs in Spanish. The place is disgusting and they reuse bedding for guests. The breakfast is expired and has roaches in the back.
bad,"Poor management, very very unprofessional, poor housekeeping! Managers don’t act as managers and do their job! Employees never followed rules. Rooms were never clean, roaches and smoked filled rooms! The staff was horrible! Please don’t work here or stay in the hotel!!!"
bad,"The head boss is horrible and disrespectful and belittles you, your direct boss is okay. They don’t care who they hire, a guy stole over 30k from the company and is still on the loose. Training  is poor, do not work here"
bad,Honestly I loved the people working there and be a good job but when I worked therr for a year and the GM started hiring people at more money then me and i was doing most of the work was my last straw specially when he came to my house and begged me to take more shifts till he hired people and didnt give me a raise yet hiring people that started making 1 dollar more is so disrespectful and when I asked for raise I got nothing
bad,"I attempted to purchase some cashews, even being viewed by the camera, showing that I took the product up to the cashier for purchase. The next morning I was left a message that I was fired for stealing."
bad,"awful management, over worked. hardly anyone spoke english therefore didn’t know their rights to what they can say no to. 12 hours of work a day expected to do in in 8 hours. poor working conditions (gross clients)"
bad,"Not the best place to work if you’re a minority or a woman. Discriminatory remarks are made and dismissed, sales leadership is greedy and will let associates starve. I worked in multiple locations and departments and it was the worst until my final department. I had an amazing manager and they did him terribly after many years of service and having made the company tons of money  I had to file a charge with the EEOC. I do not recommend this employer"
bad,Never gave a raise was not a very clean hotel the owner was rude and mean never work around your hours he Al's roll over your hours I would never work for this company again
bad,"The manager I had the displeasure of working with was very standoffish. He didn't want to communicate with anyone and chose instead to communicate through a daytime manager who didn't really talk to people. I was left to my own devices 99% of the time, with no prospects of advancement."
bad,"My typical daily tasks as a Guest Representative was to check guests in and accommodating them to feel comfortable in the establishment.  However, that was difficult to do with the lack of support from management and housekeeping.  With multiple cases of different things wrong with the rooms, management nor housekeeping would follow the correct procedures to rectify the situation.  Management would also roll over hours so no one could get paid proper overtime when requested of them.  It was very hard to do my job correctly and with the proper knowledge because the lack and not limited to management worth ethics and culture."
bad,Just be clar with your hours and exactly what you want. Make sure that you are on the same page with everyone because hours and communication where always a mix up
bad,Rude staff and some creepy people. Constantly hassled to complete work. Went to work with anxiety and hated my time there. Staff talked behind everyone's back.
bad,Not a good company.  No communication with management.  Low wages so less ability to keep employees.  Not enough employees in case of emergency.  Skeleton crew.  Cultural prejudice towards employees.
bad,No follow thru...promises made but broken. No room for error. Other staff often on drugs. Management is rude. They tell you how much you are appreciated but they lie  thru their teeth. One day you are awesome and the next day.  Fired! I now have to file a claim with the unemployment office for money owed.
bad,"This job was literally painful. Manager was absent. Owner was inexperienced and aloof. Clients were rude, employees were left to their own devices. It was a two year mess."
bad,"Abusive managers; discriminative and hostile work environment. Insane hours ;"
bad,All Indian owned and operated which means being treated like a slave for minimum wage and no benefits. I wonder if Wyndham realizes that Indians are destroying their reputation?
bad,"the worst job, managers stink. no knowledge. unethical practices. pressure sales. dishonest. pay is horrible. you have to wait for a month to get commission paid. completely unethical and dishonest"
bad,This company is definitely not worth working for. They are not flexible and treat their employees poorly. This especially is not the job for a single mother.
bad,"Worst company ever they have a new training class every two weeks because the turn over is so high they promise the world to employees and guest and 98%of what comes from their mouths is lies ,Commission based with a draw and pay is not accurate or timely so you end up paying them to work here ,they push you to pull credit on people before they even know how much the purchase will be and get mad if you side with the guest on reasons why you didnt .the work schedule changes without notice and the site has more drama than a High School .The pitch sounds good but be fair to yourself and your health and wait for somewhere better !If it sounds to good it usually is !"
bad,"Both the GM and manager were very unprofessional.  No breaks without making sure you had the cordless phone with you, even in potty breaks.  Never had a lunch break, noone there to give you a break."
bad,"How much is your soul worth? Ask yourself that truly and know the answer before you start. Is the money from Wyndham worth selling your soul?"
bad,Do not work here! I regret getting tricked into this place. They lie about how much money your going to make and claim they have reps making $250k a year. It’s all lies. We have annoying pump up meetings 3 times a day that try to make you feel like your going to strike it rich. Also they have brainwashing training sessions everyday about story telling and how to get your customers emotions high. The management is a bunch of low life scum that want to teach you how to manipulate families into buying a garbage product.
bad,"The manager is lazy and the manager tells new front desk employees if customers want a AAA discount you are to give them a higher rate then after the discount you still pay the same rate as everyone else. What really ticked me off was we are supposed to do the same thing for veterans. The Indian owners don’t care about our veterans, all they care about is money. Don’t trust the reviews, they have management employees write about their good service."
bad,Wyndham is not a fair company To work for in order to get an advancement to a different position is about who you know and not your worth ethic. Supervisors are very unfair when it comes out to your annual raise instead of them basing your annual raise on your worth ethic’s they base your annual raise on if you have issues with the supervisor or not which is very unfair.
bad,"Worst job ever.  Hours cut for no reason. Terminated without explanation, management unprofessional. Minimum wage paid for being ""face of company"". Company in chapter 11 bankruptcy."
bad,i was recruited by your job recruiter and which I was not told that orientation was actually a tryout I quit my existing job to do this I found out I didn't make the grade. my bad I guess.. spent $500 for license that is worth nothing and now I'm unemployed. they need to tell you before you start orientation that is not guarantee you have a job.
bad,"This was the most toxic environment I’ve ever been in. Borderline abusive. You are constantly belittled, gaslighted, and used as a pawn. They put people against each other and management has their own agendas. There are many narcissistic salesman types who are allowed to treat people terribly because they bring in a ton of money. Owners/customers are lied to constantly and you will be forced to do unethical things."
bad,"Due to an unorganized Director ,the Discovery Department has gone down hill. There are too many Representatives working, and not enough tours. Only three people out of 34 are making money. The Senior Sales Representatives are allowed to act as managers, and will tell people to go home or mess the rotation to benefit themselves. The director doesn’t care about anything. He is rarely at work."
bad,They snag you in with a higher hourly plus commission then drop you to minimum wage after 6wks.  The management micro manages you and they feed the team conflict.  Wyndham in other locations is great but would never reccomend Clearwater Beach.
bad,"Every job has its challenges, but it is an opportunity to grow as an employee and overall a human being. I was able to learn and overcome many difficulties which made me a more resilient person.."
bad,"Beautiful location place was what appeared to be fairly new. People seem to be nice to each other.  But the lies about everything. Didn't stay long. When I didn't want to take the job they hounded me for weeks till I agree to take the job.  Then just didn't show up on the first day, saw the job for what it really was a joke."
bad,"time share, this is boiler room kind of operation, and every morning they play a cult like gathering playing songs, like ""what ever it takes"" "
bad,"They didn't teach me how to clean the bathroom properly how they wanted them done, and I wasnt gonna let them fire me so i quit. Hardest part was getting your rooms done and helping others, but when they get their rooms done they don't help you at all!"
bad,Had to get people to managers so that they could sign them up for a two hour meeting to sell them timeshare. It was very hard to talk people into coming up to the desk.
bad,"This hotel was garbage, as was management. Anything to make a profit, including risking the livelihoods of staff and guests. They accepted known sex workers and drug suppliers at a discounted room rate, they can't keep housekeepers (turn around rate was one per day by the end of my time there), and forcing staff to take on roles and responsibilities far beyond their job descriptions (I was a front desk agent who had to do housekeeping whilst tending the front desk and the phones.. Ask me how easy that was...... especially when the service for the phone did not reach past the front door). As front desk agent I was also tasked with contacting people for job interviews because the management was ""too tired"" to leave the room they were in ON PROPERTY to make the phone calls. They tried to tell staff they were not allowed to take cigarette breaks at one point? Pretty sure that's illegal. There was also speak from multiple staff of one of the managers and the front desk supervisor liaising inappropriately on property in one of the rooms.. All in all, very poorly managed and very poorly kept. Management even tried to force me to stay after giving my written notice one month in advance.. I was moving across the country to attend university, which they knew about since I did my interview... SO. If you have the option to work here: DON'T!"
bad,"Management sucked. Allowed another person to pick a fight with me. And lets alot of people,  slack off. I wouldn't recommend any one work there. They treat you like a slave"
bad,"Wyndham Hotels and Resorts is an international hotel and resort chain based in the United States. It has locations in China, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Turkey, Germany, the UK, the Caribbean, Indonesia and Margarita Island in Venezuela."
bad,"I was fortunate to participate in Wyndham's first few training classes for this position.  However the mission statement and code of conduct doesn't itranslate over to the site at Depoe Bay, OR.  My reasons for resigning was the fact I was promised benefits after the start of the following month I was hired.  After having a difficult time enrolling and without any help from my manager or HR, tech support notified me I wasn't eligible based on being hire as Seasonal.  That was very conflicting with my job offer that states Full Time.  That means almost two months went by before this revelation.  The marketers here create a very toxic and unprofessional atmosphere.  They try to bully and bait you into situations where they complain to HR about ridiculous allegations when you are following company guidelines.  What management wants and what the marketers actually do are two very different things, but no accountability is carried out do to the fear managers have of the marketers that call HR when the boat starts to rock.  One marketer was very hostile to a guest and then got really angry afterwards, throwing things around and cussing.  The other marketers clock in and out for each other and find every way to game the system."
bad,"The plumbing and appliances are raggedy. Everything needs an upgrade! They don't have enough linen to go around. Holes in the walls, rust stains in the sink, toilet and tub. You gotta clean that the best you can. So imagine my surprise when I call to learned they've fired me because they claim I didn't do none of my bathrooms, which is a lie, cause that's the first thing I do before I do the beds. I do the beds last"
bad,The things the new manager wanted us to say to people was heartless and I could not do it. My pay went from 1200 a week to 134 a week with the new manager. Due to the way he would schedule and I was not comfortable approaching people the w as y he demanded we do it instead of continuing to do it the way I had been and was making money.
bad,Managers show favoritism to employees from old restaurants they worked and bring them to the hotel cut employees that put in hard work cut our hours force us to quit
bad,"Days in was nice to work at until they fire you for no reason and refuses to pay you what they owe you."
bad,"Unfair and unjust. For example, I was written up bc of a room that wasn't cleaned but was labeled as clean n vacant but after I cleaned it, right, the day before. The room was rented out after I was clocked out n gone and the guest then changed rooms 2 more times and nobody went to the room I initially cleaned, to fix what was messed up nor did they label it as dirty. I got the blame for it."
bad,"They started off nice, but, then after 2 months the pressure will come down on you for conversions. Most days the calls suck and no one wants to attend timeshare sales presentations. The call transfers are fully aware of the gig and they are hanging up as soon as you mention the word ""timeshare."""
bad,They were horrible to work for and I would NEVER want to work for them again. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,I honestly wanted to love working for a Wyndham hotel but that hotel did not deserve to be a Wyndham hotel at all the management was very poor they never spoke to any guests the front desk person always had to handle angry guests even if they asked to speak to a manager we were not allowed to let them or even tell them the managers name. Everything the booking sites promised guests were false we did not have a working spa or restaurant and the hotel was infested with bed bugs but the owner would not do anything about it there was leaks in the ceiling every time it rained it flooded the lobby. It honestly needs a better owner and manager.
bad,Unfair work place they dont pay on time the payroll changes clocking codes to less rated pay wages   lots of derogatory remarks are made towards employees
bad,"The HR dept protects the management "
bad,Take my advice and stay as far away from this company as possible. Unfair illegal deductions from paycheck. Class of people that stay at property leaves a lot to be desired (druggies)
bad,"As a Wyndham customer you are not allowed to give potential buyers all the information required to make an informed decision.  The high pressure put on these buyers is incredible..  No one is able to leave without committing to a time share.  Once you are in the room, you are trapped.  You won't be able to leave.  There is always an excuse as they take your drivers license and 40 cash as you enter.  This company is a total scam and anyone would be advised to stay as far away as possible.  There is always a better deal just coming thru the fax machine it just needs to be VERIFIED.  Which they all are and found to be good.  This is the worst company ever.  I don't know how these employees sleep at night knowing that they just took a blank check from a hard working person who doesn't really want a time share and is committing their children and grandchildren to keep paying for something they willl never use as there is never any availability for any trips you would like to take.  Don't be deceived, get out as soon as possible.  I couldn't lie to people who couldn't afford to pay these exorbitant fees and without letting them know that they are stuck in this for perpetuity.  It is so deceitful.  STAY AWAY!!!  you've been warned"
bad,"A typical day was clocking in no later than 10 minutes before scheduled time, get the sheet with signed rooms, stock up carts, start knocking on doors to see if any guest has left early, pull and strip the beds,get dirty towels, carry the back to the laundry room to be washed by an assigned person (when a person was available). Make beds up, put fresh pillow cases on pillows, clean the tubs, sink, put up new shower curtain if needed, clean toilets, put in bathroom tissue if needed,clean under beds, behind dresser, clean out drawers, wipe down bed headboard, telephones, TV, clean out the refrigerator and microwave oven, replace the coffee and everything that goes on the stand if needed, take out the trash, clean the mirrors, and vacuum. Each room is supposed to be done in 15 minutes. BREAKFAST ATTENDANCE: Set up for the customers for a Continental Breakfast, biscuits and gravy, waffles, cereals, milk, juice,danishes and bread for toast. Assist customers as needed while keeping the floor clean and everything wiped down including the tables. The management is somewhat good as far as personalities; your safety was always in danger though. Second day, I worked there, someone came in with a Ozzie with a mask to rob the place. I did not find out about it until 2 weeks later though."
bad,Over worked and under paid as well as unappreciated. Busted my butt everyday to do the best job possible and was left go because I struck a conversation with a guest who considered me a friend. Have never felt so disrespected by a company
bad,"Low pay, bad management, bad benefits, bad schedule, the first amendment of the bill of rights will not be tolerated here. Turnover is high and good employees are not valued at all"
bad,"A lot of favoritism.  No room for growth ,they are always short staffed. High turn over rate because whoever does the hiring has a poor judge of character. You'll be stuck in the same position you started in and there is no diversity.(no black people)The hours suck they'll tell you that you will eventually be full time...well eventually never comes. And after summer your hours will decrease substantially"
bad,Avoid this place if you want to add age to your body and stress. This place by far the most pathetic working environment in the history of San Diego California. Bed bugs fleas rats cockroaches the size of Texas mold just to name a few. The general manager all he cares about is his bonus. The management that's running the hotel it's absolutely disgusting and one of the worst in the county.
bad,Needs new management!!! Owner needs to take control of his business!! They are a bunch of snakes and runs there good workers away. Management is horrible
bad,"Management was racist against other cultures, compensation was very much lacking and if you had a scheduled day off you got penalized for it even if it was WEEKS in advance. Very poor establishment to work for. I would never go back."
bad,The rhinelander wisconsin days inn is the most awful place i’ve ever worked at. there is mold everywhere and they just let it sit there. the housekeepers get yelled at everyday for things that are the front desks fault. you will always be short staffed here because everyone quits on the daily because ITS THAT BAD. i have had over $600 taken out of my paychecks and i have talked to my general manager about it but all she says is that she’s busy and we will talk about it when it slows down but i have yet to see my money. please do not apply if you want to keep your dignity and sanity. this place is terrible and they don’t ever let you leave.
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE! The management is half-assed at best and they don’t care about your mental or physical health. Management tells you how bad you are and pushes you to quit so they don’t have to fire. Soulless humans and liars are in charge of management.
bad,I've worked in two separate departments and both managers were horrible. The lack of training is pitiful! The managers have favorites and do not know how to train new employees.
bad,"The owner, operations of management danielle, and the manager discriminates and does not care about enployees. There is alot of illegal activity going on there including illegal workers, im suprised Days Inn Merced is not closed down yet. Horrible management and people..."
bad,"If you want the worst work environment,  a pay plan that they intentionally alter so your commissions are lowered and to get paid incorrectly and to have to chase the money they paid you incorrectly on for months then this is the job for you.  If you are intelligent,  hard working and have an ounce of common sense DON'T go there.  Ive been in timeshare over 15 years and this is by far my worst work experience  ever."
bad,"Been at Super 8 for a yr and half and the pay is very low, owner does not do insurance or any type of benefits, paid bi weekly in hand written paper check form."
bad,Owners are a joke. Nobody knows who's in charge. Nothing ever gets fixed. Your expected to turn turds to gold. I do not recommend working at this establishment
bad,Worse employers ever wouldn't employ my dog there. The owners barely wanted to pay us. The rooms were barely cleaned because the owners were too cheap to pay the housekeepers.
bad,"I hated to work there because of the abuse from the my managers and other managers, plus the owner at the end he was very abuse...i asked for income taxes information. i called and request them a 2nd time i never received intil 4/16"
bad,They will work you until they find something you can't do and fire you. Do not waste you time with this company. Very under paid and they don't spend money to fix things.
bad,"Dont work there,  high turnover,  dont treat you good. Dont like people that work. Into the lazy person. If you like to be treated fairly,  dont work there"
bad,My manager would go in the room before all house keepers and steal our tips. They guests would leave notes stating there would be tips but there was never any more there. Girls kept quitting and being hired left and right and finally it happened to me one to many times so I just left. The girls that worked there all reported them to LNI. It was great work but the place of work wasn’t.
bad,"-  vacuums  All have exposed wire, mops are broken,  incident reporters not taken. Told to wear only one glove not two, when cleaning washrooms. Etc.."
bad,Horrible maintenance managers and supervisors hostile work environment your not appreciated for Maintenance engineering skills or customer care u provide no pay  No room for advancement in the company they will lead you on and it will never come through to move up or pay raises Favoritism runs this resort
bad,Bad place to work in slow season full time employees would rarely get 24 hours a week or even a 8 hour work day. Very little help on trashed rooms. You get told 29 hours is full time and they do a lot of favorites there. Your friends with someone. You get more hours
bad,"Killed myself for this job, working under a tyrant. Supervisor would allow some girls to be late everyday, call in for a week straight, while short staffed, then be rude to the only person who showed up to work. She would allow certain girls to sit in her office and gossip while one person did the rest of the work. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!"
bad,Management is terrible and they are racist and they try you by giving you impossible tasks to complete without explaining. The employees are complete dummies and hide behind their title but in real life can get these hands  All are liars and selfish ppl. This place is toxic
bad,"No overtime, low pay, poor management, poor training..... management acts like kids, favoritism. If given ovetime Not paid for overtime worked... no matter how hard and dependable you are, you are still treated like garbage. Now this was my experience at days inn in Walcott iowa"
bad,Got hired to start the following day only to be called back and cut because apparently she did not know that they hired too many the day before. Which I know is a load of crock.
bad,I have never worked for a hotel like this one in particular. they put to many jobs on one person and it was very stressful. They did not supply us with proper cleaning supplies or linnen as well.
bad,"I had the worst experience at Days Inn & Suites because of everything here. The payment, working while exposure in sun, health condition and a lot of other bad things."
bad,would never work for this company again. They treat their employees horribly and expect them to work more than 12 hours a day without overtime or any type of vacation or sick time. I called out one time in 18 months and they wanted to terminate me.
bad,"The place was a little run down when I started. Then the rates slowly dropped when newer competition entered the area. The place became shady, and dangerous, fast."
bad,"Lets just say if you are okay lying day in and day out to people. THIS IS THE JOB FOR YOU!!!"
bad,"Horrible place to work "
bad,Great working with diverse cultures and greeting customers. They treat you like family here.I just wish there were room for advancement or than that the place is great to work in
bad,to many people want to play boss other employees worry about what other employees are doing instead of doing their own jobs alot of gossiping about each other like you are still in school
bad,"Really poorly-run benefits department, which could have made up for the low pay.  Had benefits one day, the next they were gone.  Nobody in the benefits department will help you - they just pass the buck.  When I asked to speak to management multiple times - I was told management would call me back - they never did.  That was weeks ago.  Rude customer service over the phone.  DON'T work there!  One good hotel or review in their chain of mediocre to poor properties does not make up for the overall departments that are supposed to help you, but don't.  Remember - the companies that are ""Best Places to Work"" have TEAMS that help you with your life-work balance.  This company does not."
bad,"Management takes advantage of the kindness of it's employees. There is absolutely no room for advancement, they over work you and under pay. They also don't look out for the best interest or safety of their employees. I worked overnights for 3 months, by myself, and had the tar scared out of me by shady people. Before they decided to hire security."
bad,This establishment is very disgusting. after months of working i got bed buggs and rashes. The pay was no where near worth the worth they had people doing. And half of the employees didnt speak english so i basically taught myself how to work their.
bad,"Poor communication within the company.  Mandatory timeclock punch. (old system) Minimal raises can either be .16 or .32 annually.  Many amenities are either taken away or downgraded after employment.  Discounted property stays have been downgraded to ""good will-type furnished"" condos."
bad,The general manager was embezzling from the company and the property was getting ready to be shut down.  This was not known to me when they hired me.  During the transition between owners I was the only consistent employee.
bad,"if your looking to work at a hotel, go for smaller and more personal, then a money-hungry resort that mistreats you, too much drama and its not the stress"
bad,"This internship was severely unorganized and a waste of time. They pretend it is ""marketing"" when really, you are standing on the street selling time shares. The culture and dynamic is terrible. It was really a joke of an internship and a waste of time."
bad,Did not feel safe at this location when working after dark always kept doors locked. Several shooting next door to the property. Maybe a different location
bad,Worst job I have ever had never work for them they don't care about their employees they only care about themselves and they don't pay enough always cut your hours training is nonexistent you can never get any days off if you really need them the breakfast sucks the rooms are always dirty they tell you one thing and do another behind your back work here if you want to be treated bad
bad,"Not enough pay, too many employees, so never get enough hours. Most of the employees keep to self, so they don't really speak. Boss is not friendly to employees"
bad,"Barely pay above minimum wage, and work you till they run you in the ground.  Then just hire someone to replace you.  Many times I had to work over because the other shift would not show up.  Other employees not made to conform to company standards but still have a job."
bad,"They do not have good training, they do not have good communication skills, their management is terrible. If you work the Night Audit shift they will leave you alone with no one to call if you have an issue with a customer or a technical issue, you are to let the problem keep recurring and then get yelled at for it later even though you tried contacting management all night ."
bad,timeshare is a scam. They encourage you to lie and commit fraud. Recruiters lie to get people hired. Management yells and is always angry. Very hostile work environment. Really high turnover. Very poor training program that makes you ill prepared for what actually happens on the floor. Never got an employee room discount. They also still owe me money and refuse to put me in contact with the right people to get paid. Essentially you pay them to work there!! read the fine print.
bad,"How can a place so awful be a part of such a beautiful city? As soon as we pulled up outside and looked at the dirty, holey curtains hanging like rags behind the stinking glass of the rotting windows we should have turned and run."
bad,Worked for Days Inn North in Clarksville. Got promotions ripped away after they were given because employee was manipulating every one in the staff. Pretty sure not everything done was legal.
bad,"In 2008 I was hired as Dept. Head of Housekeeping.  I am well educated and personable, but, it was no match for the dog eat dog corporate culture and local housekeeping staff cronyism.  I was set up to fail, fired and they hired the wife of the long time maintenance"
bad,Absolutely no management. I am underpaid and this just happens to be the only hotel that has no manager on weekends. Hotel needs new management and a good remodel.
bad,"The Recruitment and Initial Training experience were both great. They paint a very nice picture of the company. I do feel that the product is good and they offer a quality experience for their owners. However, I did not find that to be the case as an employee working for them. The wonderful experience ends the moment you leave their corporate offices and their training. As the reality of being an employee at one of their onsite resort sales teams begins."
bad,I do not have a review for Wyndham Destinations at this time. I do not recommend the branch I was located at in Pooler Ga for guest stays or for new hires.
bad,"Not paid properly.  Very shady under the table business practices.  Management always demanding more hours, but not paying overtime.  Very bad working environment"
bad,Stressful work environment. Recognition for employees of the year are not fairly planned out.  Taking time off is not easy to get even if you’ve earned it.  Employee/Employer bullying on a daily basis.  Racial profiling happens a lot.  Raises are not given every year.
bad,The management was horrible .  staff was horrible. the hotel is run down with a constant complaint of bugs in rooms. I highly would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"No communication between shifts. Manager is always gone and always looking to take from his employees. Worked a double this year on both Christmas and New Years, didn't see a dime of it. If you want to get robbed blind with way of fighting it, then yes put in an application"
bad,"Poor management "
bad,worked at ramada hope harbour was put off because of conflict with too many family members working there one girl had been there same age as me 6 yrs jody made my job horrible all because she wasnt pointed as bar manager when i spoke to management about it i was put off.was on salary of 38hrs was doing about 46hrs which is all good but they tried not to pay me overtime but fair work made them so any employees that have worked there overtime just letting you know you can get your overtime i got mine will never work for wyndam again .
bad,hired as ft housekeeper.  was told the maintenance guy was to do laundry rooms  if he had 10 +rooms they would call me in. all laundry done together..
bad,"Long hours, no breaks very unfair managements hostile work environment.  HR offers no help and your fired for filing a complaint  Associates are not allowed to use any of the amenities."
bad,"Poor poor management dont be fooled and waste your time, long work hours 30 lunch low pay drama lies smiling faces do lie you are a number thats it you will struggle"
bad,"I had the worse experience working for this company or the franchise in Sutton, WV. The management did not care if you if you had enough employees and did not pay you overtime even if you worked it. When I quit the other employee who worked with me quit at the same time because she seen how I was treated. We were the only 2 employees working night because they would not hire any more which we were suppose to have 4 to 5 on nights."
bad,Back stabbing from the top down.   Always looking for a reason to write you up so you can't transfer out of the department.   Commission payout to person selling is less than what they pay your supervisor for riding you to make them money.   I was harassed about my sales for the day after work hours to see how much of a bonus my supervisor would get.   Low pay horrible benefits bad management from the top down I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you just want to go through training for the pay while looking for a real job.   Don't trust anything they tell you even HR lies and covers for the management.   I've worked at a few call centers and this was by far the WORST of them.   My advice is to keep looking and skip the Wyndham nightmare it's not worth your time or effort.
bad,i did everything from breakfast to maintenence never got a raise. they dont pay you on time. not a very good place to work. dont fix anything rite either
bad,Not a good place to work and the owner/manger oh he is a mess and i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. I was the housekeeping manger and he wanted me to run the whole hotel.
bad,Horrible Management. Employees drink and smoke on the premises. Employees stay in the rooms. I would not recommend this job to anyone. All of the housekeepers were related and would argue and fuss all the time
bad,"For the most part the staff was very nice and I did learn a lot from them, unfortunately the kitchen manager at this time was young and inexperienced, in my opinion, and there was a lot of things that went undetected"
bad,"The owners seemed to let their employees’ underage children work for them cleaning rooms. Other than that, it wasn’t too bad of a job. I wasn’t there long enough for benefits because it was a temporary job."
bad,"Communication was terrible. I never knew what was going on. I had 5 bosses that all wanted me to do things differently. None of them were knowledgeable, and they would just bicker and throw each other under the bus."
bad,sucks no point of working there supervisors and managers dont care about you only them selves as long as your doing what tell they you to do they get paid hefty and you pennies on the dollar
bad,"I can guess that this is a nice facility and cares a lot about their customers, but unfortunately i never got the opportunity to work at this job. Thank you."
bad,I hated it. The pay was poor. i had to skip school to work. I did everyone jobs. i never got the credit for everything.I couldnt have a day off. i worked 14 day straight. i can honesty go on about everything. you cant live off 7.25 -8.25 I worked there for 4 years never got a raise.
bad,All the initiative that you give in the end turns into frustration. all my worst experience I lived there I feel sorry for having lost the motivation to do good work for the injustices that we received. VacationVillages was the only company that respected and valued its good greeners.
bad,"I was the longest employee at the company with only being there for 2 years. no one stays because the owners do not treat people kindly. they expect everyone to work 50+ hours a week with no days off, no breaks for lunch, the list continues on. not a place to work if you have a family or children."
bad,"During training they never told us that the so called protection plan was mandatory to sell. We're there to book reservations most of feedback that comes back is negative towards the product and not the agent when you want to dispute the call they never find it. Having a manager tell you well as of right now I don't see you improving and maybe you're not cut out for the company it really discourages someone. You'll get write ups if you don't sell their PPP which is 49 per existing reservation you're encourage to offer but what you get from selling it's only 3 bucks minus the taxes that are deducted which is about 2 bucks. They also want you to enforce a vacation on an owner when they don't want to travel. Agents give misinformation constantly, when you tell them they didn't have reservations transactions and that they have to pay you get yelled  at."
bad,"The housekeeping manager is horrible. I have never been so mistreated. The manager would do sneaky sly things like schedule me 6 days in a row, mess up my PTO or paycheck, if I had a problem and came to them with it they would ignore it as if I didn't matter as an employee. Completely unethical and fake."
bad,"the owners closed there doors without warning and never paid there employees. the electric company shut off there power, the liquor store would not accept there checks because they bounced"
bad,"neither one of the managers like me there. my work was never good enough for them. they both constantly watched or hovered over me while I worked. I was not trusted. the manager who lived on the property would call the front desk every time a customer entered a tell my to hike up the price if the customer wanted a room. I was poorly trained and when I made an error due to the fact that I did not know what to do in that situation, I would be fussed at or my hours reduced. no one else received the treatment that I was given."
bad,"This was a horrible place to work. Required to be there early but not paid until shift actually scheduled to start. No overtime. If the next shift is late you have to arrange with them to come in early so we don't have overtime. "
bad,This company had bedbugs and wouldn't fix it. Motel is dated and understaffed. I would never go back to work here if my life depended on it. Working conditions bad.
bad,Low pay and poor management. On a average day I would be scheduled to work as a front desk employee while there I would be left a list of basic needs around the area. Including housekeeping that should have been done and maintenance that was needed done around the entire area. While only getting paid the front desk salary.
bad,walked off my shift because i asked for help and management called me stupid while the owner sat and watched. the owner was the one that told me to ask for help from management.
bad,Nothing nice to say. Not sorry either. Never worked at a place where it would cost me more money in negative commission to show up to work than staying at home.
bad,"I don't recommend working or staying at this timeshare in Big Bear Lake, CA. They have always had poor resort and front desk, housekeeping and maintenance management teams. Also they have always not had the best of the front desk staff there. You will always get someone who's unprofessional and with attitude and behaves this way when a manager is not around and when you point it out to them they don't hold them accountable for there behavior.  They don't train properly on there company policies and they don't give a correction notice to someone that was involved.  The front desk staff and management are a bunch of phonies.  You are lucky if your room is ready by 4 p.m. and if the unit is clean enough. The noise levels are bad because the walls are thin. So good luck if you do stay there, personally I would stay someone else."
bad,worked here for 2 years and they did not take care of there facility or there employers. they basically ran the place into the ground and the room were condemned with bed bugs.
bad,"The managers and front desk staff at the Big Bear Lake, CA location are some of the worst people to work with. The managers favor who they want because they are doing extra work for them. They don't hold people accountable when they are not following company policies. The front desk staff are unprofessional and with attitude if they don't like working with you and will behave this way when a manager is not around.  The turn around is bad and I don't recommend working for the Big Bear Lake, CA location."
bad,"Poor management and the front desk staff are unprofessional and do not display the count on me manner. "
bad,"Low comp plan. I drew the line at having to ask permission to go to the restroom. The transfers are garbage. When your pay is based off of revenue, and you are only getting transfers to sell a $49-$59 package, you cannot make money. Call center smells like mold, worst one I've ever been in."
bad,The turnover rate is ridiculoucly high because they dont value their employees.  Management has been there forever and they only hire temporarily until their family needs a job and then youre out!
bad,"no benefits, sick time off, vacation or health care. work every weekend. business slows down hours get cut. its difficult to understand the boss. nothing is good enough"
bad,This job sucked the life out of me. I've never met a business owner more difficult to work for. You can't keep good employees if you aren't willing to treat them well.
bad,"Open up the resturaunt and set up buffets for breakfast and lunch.Cook on the line, and prep cook, prep for banquets. Also clean the kitchen and unload truck and take inventory."
bad,"This was actually not a great work experience.  Management was inflexible, unwilling to communicate with employees, owners were cutthroat. There was little to no opportunity for advancement, management was never present for employees to communicate with.  Environment was extremely clique-ish.  Training was minimal."
bad,"Selling Vacation ownerships was not my favorite job, I felt it dishonest and the product offered was not a good value, not a good experience..........."
bad,Had a very poor management that would schedule me for days I put down I could not work because I was in school and would call me on days I couldn't be there and yell at me saying I needed to be there since they had no one to cover the shift.
bad,I worked there for almost 4 years and it was the worst job I have ever had.the owners didn't no how to run a business and didn't know how to treat their workers
bad,The company isn't as professional as it states it is.
bad,The loan officers are often not seasoned which creates an emergency on almost every file. There are meetings daily and weekly that promise better and never does anything to improve working conditions. Overtime is mandatory. This is a very stressful work environment. Management is obvious and which is amazing considering the high turn over rate.
bad,horrible place to work everything was bad employees hours condition  of the workplace the environment that is crated and the compensationg is way underpayed
bad,Once again a waste of my time because thise business was sold and is just a privately owned small motel now and has no links with the people I worked for
bad,"Wyndham Executive leadership seems more focused on profits than people or honoring their word. Makes promises and reassurances to the employees and then turn around and do the exact opposite. They seems to be trying to grow too fast & biting off more than they can chew. As a result, they don’t have experienced leaders in place to handle that growth. For example, the VP of Operations who is now overseeing @ 350 corporate managed hotels was in a GM role only 3 years ago. This kind of inexperienced leadership leads to poor decision-making and a lack of solid understanding of what it takes to successfully manage a portfolio of that size & scale. "
bad,"Just a word of caution to anyone considering applying to WVO. Unless you're applying to a street sales position and are fully aware of what you're applying for, stay mindful that whatever position you're applying for will likely be ""filled"" already. You may even get a rejection letter but still be contacted for ""another"" job, which will be selling on the streets for minimum wage + commission. You may think you're applying for and getting an interview for some other position such as management, but what you fill find upon interview that all the jobs they speak of aren't available any more or require you to do street sales before they can consider you for the position you're applying for and what was advertised. This is the time of year in 4 season states where WVO starts ramping up their street sales as the season starts. This is why they advertise positions they don't actually hire for but rather use to get ""talent"" in the door so they can switch them over into street selling for minimum wage."
bad,I was no longer with the company when they took over silverleaf. I would not be able to  provide any feed back towards this company. Anything further.
bad,"This hotel is shut down as far as I know now.  It was bug infested, dirty, Most things did not work.  Mgmt did not care, nor fix anything.  Pay checks bounced and they said sometimes have to wait a couple of days.  Auctions set up all the time to take things out of hotel for no payment on vendors"
bad,If I could of gave a zero I would have this place sucks management has one person that causes drama everyday she can talk to anyone how she wants and still has a job . Then coming to management not anyone of them know what it means accommodating to certain people is bs RULES ARE RULES they shouldn't be bent for anyone that shows favouritism
bad,wonderful place of employment. great work atmosphere. food always available and the people are amazing. everyone should experience having there taxes done here
bad,"This is absolutely the worst job I have ever had. The general manager was the most underhanded, lying cut throat, dishonest human being I have ever met. His lack of any sort of empathy or care for the staff or actually anything other than himself was deplorable!"
bad,"Very poor and inexperienced management. A lot of alcohol and drug use, most of the staff at odds with eachother. If you have any level of integtity...I would suggest not working there...you'll be the odd one out."
bad,"My experience at this place was exceptional. I learned many useful things related to maintenance and working in that field. Management was really friendly ,supportive and was on top of everything."
bad,fast paced and easy going. managent was very helpful and respectable the job consist of customer service helping visors with checking in and put of the hotel
bad,Terrible experience. Very shady. Management didn’t care about you personally. Had management talk bad about me in front of guests. Belittle me like I was inferior.
bad,Worst career move I have ever made. The worst company I  have ever been employed with. Company has a Count on Me policy which they don't even come close to following.
bad,Unless you’re willing to flat out lie to people you won’t make much here. No one wants to give up half a day of their vacation to be sold a basically worthless piece of paper.
bad,The management team is completely dysfunctional. They are very unprofessional and lack management skills.  They do not value or support their teams.  They expect everyone to work for peanuts and be grateful they have a job.
bad,"It was the owners of the hotel not the corp office. They did not respect  women at all. I felt discriminated against and never respected as a equal employee,"
bad,"the franchisee had no idea whet they were doing. no security at all except the front desk person walking the premises. No locks active on doors so anyone, and I mean ANYONE could enter. Shootings, drugs, and countless other illegal acts happening right under owner nose and nothing was done. Unclean rooms, bed bugs. Just disgusting!"
bad,"This was worst job ever and I tried my best to make the best of it ."
bad,Fun place to work.With growth and freedom. The new management is different. But a all around good place to work. Its convienant amd close to everything
bad,"Typical day at work at Wyndham involves heavy management comparing you with your peer staff, management plays huge favorites and never responds to calls or messages on time. Schedule is always late. Commissions are never paid accurately so even when you have a great sales week you feel like s*** because your company has not paid you - totally unacceptable and irresponsible management hoping for high turnovers and no advancement opportunities  for those who try hard to make it in this industry."
bad,They don't pay their staff enough. They are unfair to their employess. If you are good at your job you do everyone else's job. You are forced to work shifts even if your availability does not meet the expectation.
bad,The management there at the hotel was the worst person I had ever worked for. She was the main reason I left. There is a lot of turn around at the hotel.
bad,They nasty they have bugs the place definitely need to be shut down I'm reporting it to the health department  I worked there one day n quite because I didn't wanna risk bringing bugs home😔😔 plus the pay
bad,"Poor management unprofessionally trained staff members that are not friendly to their guests. Underpaid staff and no benefits, housekeepers are overworked and not paid very well."
bad,"the company was acquired by Blackstone and then they went on to sell a majority of the company off.  The new company, LXR was created and I was one of the lucky to get handpicked to join the new company."
bad,"privately owned and franchised. Very poor management at location very poor management from anyone else in the company. Company is built for profit only. I was not properly trained, self taught."
bad,It was a great place to work until Chhatralla LLC bought it and they have no reguard for Brand Standards. They are shady and do not care about their employees.
bad,They do not care about their employees. They over work everyone and don't appreciate their employees. They don't not have any african American managers and have no plans in ever hiring any. So if you are black there are no room for growth.
bad,"Lack of organizational communication and unethical tactics. Director is never in contact with staff and turnover is always expected. Only 2 days of paid training with a supervisor, budget cuts made us not hire a trainer, position has been dissolved."
bad,I don't like the company period. They hire stupid managers and upper management that hasn't a clue how to run IT or how to treat their employees.  Stay clear from them.
bad,"They have no idea how to run a hotel, and they are always fixing the rates. I had always problems of the management yelling at the top of there lungs embrassing other employees."
bad,"Very dull, poor management, unsafe conditions, lack of care for the well being of the building and its tenants, overall unpleasant place to work. I don't know about other locations but Selma Days in was in bad shape when I was there."
bad,Employees do drugs by back dumpster. Chef making out in kitchen with food and beverage manager. My check was always short money. An employee brings her 8 year old to work. Most people working there have a bad attitude.
bad,I was getting paid by the rooms. Sometimes I just got two rooms a day. They was always giving the good rooms to college students. I was better off working at home.
bad,it was stressful all of the time. management was never on board when it came to events and had the servers running around fixing their mistakes at the catered events.
bad,"Was not happy with working here at all.  The owner was not clean, did not clean bedding, there were ants surrounding the food and the manager wanted me to wipe the ants away and still put the food out, which I declined to do."
bad,"Was not Wyndam Management and cannot give you a proper evaluation. When it was MyerJabara, was not paying attention to the General Manager or that particular property at the time."
bad,Utell was not part of Wyndham Vacation Owenership when I worked for them so I cannot tell you anything about this company other than they have nice hotels.
bad,"Telemarking is the worst job I have ever done. Although, I didn't care for trying to push people into buying products that they were not interested in,but to have a manager that was so pushy at how many sales a person could get really drove me away even quicker. I quit the job as soon as possible."
bad,"This Ramada is owned by someone else. Management is not good. Pay is horrible, they need help. Slow going downhill, they need to invest more into employees and hotel."
bad,"Unfortunately this property had very poor leadership.  I felt very uncomfortable working here.  I love the area, I loved the company, but this particular location had young leaders that discriminate"
bad,go in get my board go stock my cart go room to room to see who needs any services done and what not. take a break go back to cleaning then to lunch and straight back to work
bad,My bosses made the work environment not enjoyable. Depending on the ownership of the hotel it might be different for you. But know what you are getting yourself in to when applying.
bad,definitely not what I expected by the job title and explanation they had. the staff decided when they wanted to leave once management left they barely stayed till the shift ended. Was not for me that is for sure
bad,They let anybody franchise with them even if the hotel isn't clean or that nothing is up dated within the hotel and the owner can treat his workers like slaves and never no if your going to get your check or not nor do you no if your pay will change before you receive your check.
bad,"Was not a bad place to work at but not paied enough, also there was not enough benefits to work there, not worth fighting life there . Not a career kind of job."
bad,Great pepol to work with management awful like robots no comon sence or real world experience like being in high school with adults its sad because the company is so large but the people who run it have no idea what they are doing they only care about ratings not their employees
bad,"Location :  Portage, wi  "
bad,"The management was out of whack. They needed to be shut down but, some how manage to stay open. Since we were in the middle of no where we hardly got customers"
bad,Run don't work there. If you are trying to get used to doing a job and sightly get hurt. You have a dr note and they go and let you go. This happened in NC. The managment says one thing does another
bad,The manage at the time was never happy and she treated everybody horrably and I just could not handle it. I believe she does not work there anymore. Very bad management.
bad,I don't know what this place is because I have never worked here before but this is a requirement to get to the next level so I am just letting you know that I haven't worked here
bad,Ownership outdated.  Business model from 1972. Did not like results but would not make any changes to help get different results.  Still used manual system for tracking business and revenue.  Did not trust computers.  Worked as desk agent 6 days per week and expected to be GM at the same time.
bad,Things were not done properly as needed to be done. Hotel rooms where grimy before proper staff to clean short staff and never had staff to cover shift and always had to work later the scheduled
bad,"This establishment is completely unorganized, insanely chaotic, and extremely unfair to their Employees. Superiority is a big huge here so if you aren't in with management you can count on being miserable."
bad,"this job overall is the absolute worst place I have ever worked, the management were two faced and overly incompetent at most tasks relating to working with people."
bad,"NOT AN ETHICAL COMPANY. Frequent errors in commission pay, frequent change in comp plan, a LOT of favoritism, disrespect, they make it clear ""you are expendable"". You could be contacted anytime/hour (midnight) with a schedule change for the following day. Schedule release 3 to 4 days prior to the following week. If you enroll in medical benefits they cut your hourly pay, in addition, to the premiums. Do not pay for mileage, gas, long commute, parking fees, phone service, gas. Not a full-time job. If you decide to accept a position there don't say you weren't warned!"
bad,"I washed,foled, and put away laundry, I also cleaned parts of the hotel , and I took care of the breakfast room. Making sure it stayed full during breakfast and taking things down after."
bad,"You have to work terrible hours for 8 weeks of training while making next to no money. Then they cut you loose without properly being prepared for the position then spend the next 6 months riding you about every mistake you've made even though they don't bother helping you learn it in the first place. Great people on the ground floor at this company but supervisor and up are absolutely horrid. No one is on the same page, everyone is trying so hard to play the political position, no one will give you straight answers, and you're constantly disobeying one supervisor/manager if you listen to what another is telling you"
bad,"The management and ownership were terrible! The owners would tell us housekeepers to cut corners by not stripping the beds between all stays of different guests, thereby creating a health hazard to the public! Also, the owners nor management never made a work schedule. All the housekeepers had to call daily to confirm if they were working that day. Corporate office would never come investigate any claims by employees, even though they were contacted multiple times!"
bad,Not a goodles place to work at all.  Poor and sometimes no training provided with very little leadership and a blame the bottom attitude.  I would not like to work here again.
bad,Wyndham is a very disorganized organization that offers little to no room for advancement.  Work place culture is basically non existent within Wyndham.
bad,"Management can do no wrong, even if you talk to HR, the managers are always right. Timeshare business is very stressful and dog eat dog. No one shows anyone with respect."
bad,"Was sexually assaulted "
bad,"I worked at this resort for seven years, and I never met any high "
bad,"I thought that working with an independent in house security jobs would be great, but I was totally wrong,the place where I worked was owned by an iranian family, the son was running it into the ground, I felt sorry for the people who "
bad,"This job is a revolving door. Your boss's will tell you that you're part of the family, but then toss you to the curb at a moments notice. Use as a stepping stone only."
bad,"Staff was overworked, long hours, understaffed. There were mold in the rooms. No lunch or breaks and the pay was extremely low for the type of work being performed."
bad,This company was too stressful to work for.  You had to call potential buyers to come and sit through a 90 minute time share presentation.  The phone sheets we were working off of was the same ones for weeks on end and people were not interested in coming for the presentation.
bad,"Relocated to Leavenworth for a sales position with Wyndham. Worst job experience I've ever had. The sales director  has zero leadership skills. Allows the sales manager to bully other employees not to mention the pay. The pay is strictly commission.  The guest are pressured into attending a sales presentation and most people don't want to go to them. If the guest refuses to go to the presentation upon checking in, they are continually harassed in their rooms with phone calls numerous times a day. The company is slow at everything from paying you to updating their systems. I cools go on and on. Steer clear of working for Wyndham."
bad,poor management bad leadership building was completely ran down and falling apart rented whole hotel out to swingers parties and didn't really clean afterwards
bad,"Was classified as part time but always work 40 plus hours."
bad,"Management style is terrible, they treat staff poorly and are underpaid significantly for the conditions put upon staff. overall not a very good place to work at all."
bad,Worst mistake of my life even in what I did in the Marine Corp during the wars I was in. As a manager you are not one the system has no room for a manager that knows how there team works.
bad,"The job as manager of a hotel was great, but the owners were terrible. They were cheap refused to pay anyone a good wage. They sold the hotel without even telling the employees."
bad,"this place is very unorganized, very unfair with hours and accommodations. the owners and management are not 5 star and don't seem to really care about their employees."
bad,"Management is horrible, bad atmosphere. never anymore. Management don't respect you, customers are lied every day into purchase a bad product. Don't recommend to my enemy."
bad,The owners didn't care about their clients and didn't keep up with maintenance in the hotel.Plus it was located in a bad neighborhood. A lot of drug use and prostitution was going on with guest within the hotel
bad,"A typical day would include me maintaining the appearance and function of the hotel.  That includes cutting grass, painting the exterior, installing roofing, renovating rooms, hauling new furniture."
bad,"A typical day at Knights Inn can differ. You never know if you will be cussed or accused. You have to fight off drug addicts, dealers, and Street Walkers. I learned that everyone shouldn't be judged even though the location is bad. The workplace culture is one of people telling on others to make themselves look good. A lot of talk of team work but none actually being executed. The hardest part of the job is the spontaneity of the bad things that can occur. There are no enjoyable parts about the job."
bad,"The front desk supervisor is very unprofessional along with the maintenance supervisor. Not a very good place to work unless you have no family and no other important things to do but work. will not help you with days off and they seem to have a huge issue with overtime, oh and please dont be 1-2 minutes late! occurences occurences is all you'll ever hear at that job. If you want to work here you'll need to be the biggest kiss a** ever, forget about any kind of emergencies because they don't care and will make you stay no matter how serious, never try to put in over time, and never ever stand up for whats right because you'll lose and they will fire you before you know it."
bad,"The particular location i worked at the owner routinely hired undocumented workers. Never gave me a raise as promised. At times i worked 19 days straight. In the end he refused to submit information i needed for the government because he was upset that i ultimately resigned.  Very unprofessional, always cut corners, not a good or safe place to work."
bad,I did not know how to avoid this one since I never have worked for them and I don't know want to say about them and nothing about them.  and I don't even now were they are at
bad,This Company is more of to fill up the gaps and to run your own finical stability  for start up the careers or for students that company is great with there school class
bad,"Love working for this company. Been with them almost 3 years and love the employees and the environment. The people are nice, the work atmosphere is good."
bad,can't trust any of the co-workers that you work with. that is the reason why i rated this company of employment so poorly based on experience I have working there as an employee.  the typical day is cleaning up after the guests once they have left for the day or until they come for another stay but in a different room
bad,"It was cold, they gave us personal heathers that barely worked. we got free food though that was nice. i do not have time for this just wanted to update my resume"
bad,"Lack of proper management, co-workers have zero work ethic, low pay rate, unclean work environment. In general, not a good place of employment."
bad,This place was a joke. The supplies were not available when needed probably due to people taking stuff from the supply room. And I do not believe that it was at all the fault of the General Manager more like some of the other employees.
bad,"Don't ever work for Northern Oregon Lodging, LLC or its corresponding company V&W Investments. They will treat you like you are dirt under their feet. They will promise you things that never manifest and then fire you with no explanation simply because they don't have any use for you any longer. I quit the company because of the stress level and they refused to take suggestions on how hotels should actually be ran."
bad,by far the worst employer I have Ever worked for! I would never go back or even re-thing another job in hospitality. turned me completely off from the field itself.
bad,The pay was okay but things were not fair there. It was fun you deal with new people everyday. It's nice to communicate with people face to face you do a lot of hands on.
bad,"Customers were so unhappy with the hotel's appearance, rooms, breakfast, the numerous maintenance problems. The system used was so outdated. I was very unhappy working with Wyndham. Much rather work with Choice."
bad,"Wyndham vacation ownership is not a professional company.They do not care about their employees ,their compensation is not worth the stress and fraustration that you will endure working there."
bad,Terrible management. Terrible working hours. Bad pay. And bad coworkers. Perfect place if you hate life. I moved on. Value my talent somewhere else where sanity goes a long ways. Here it doesn't.
bad,The manager of the hotel was not nice or professional.the cleanliness of the rooms were bad. Tried to bring new ideas to the hotel but they wouldn't accept them.
bad,"Too much change for the worse always taking from the employees, families will constantly struggle to pay monthly expenses. It's a very hard job made much harder by the leadership."
bad,The money was good and that was about it. There was so much favoritism and the management in all departments were a joke. I would never tell anyone to work there.
bad,"I worked there just a short amount of time and during that time I was constantly harassed by the foreigners who lived and resided over the hotel about silly non-sense things. The place was absolutely disgusting. I sat out breakfast one morning and there was bugs in the juice dispenser, there was dried syrup on the floor where no one cleaned throughout the day and when I brought this information to the owners of the hotel they replaced me without my knowledge."
bad,Please  don't  work  this  company  in airport  ne Calgary they  fire  12 housekeeping staff  within  a 3 months the hiring  manager is  good  to  speak  but  the  way  she  makes decision u get  fire stick  with  your  company where  ever  you  working dont  try  to  join  this  company you  will lose  your  job I am not  lying  thats  real.
bad,Teamfähigkeit in diesen Unternehmen gleich null. Sehr viel arbeit für alle. Wenig Freizeit. Langes durch arbeiten bis zum frei.
bad,"The managers in the Myrtle Beach area are the worst people I have ever worked with. NO organization, NO leadership, blame everyone else for her lack of integrity. There are much better hospitality jobs in the area."
bad,I hated my time at Travelodge because instead of doing what I was hired for. the manager decided that I should be doing the cleaners job because the cleaner didn't finish his/her job and because of that I should do the cleaning which would leave me to not be able to actually be at reception and wait for customers at the desk which I would still get in trouble for even thou it wasn't my fault
bad,i didnt like the job they cut my hours and was a very dirty place to work i wasnt happy at all i hated it alot i would never work their again didndty like the pay
bad,"Pay is always reduce , hours are short , co workers are always mean , hardest part of day is during sales it gets really busy"
bad,"Rewiring light fixtures "
bad,"Since this motel is owned by people from India, it isn't run the way it should be. I would never recommend anyone apply for a job at this place."
bad,"loved the part of interacting with the guest, I'm a very people person. I started working at this employment during winter so a typical day would be slow and boring. did a lot of cleaning when it was like that. the hardest part of the job was my co workers. I'm really into customer service and they would be really snobby with the guest and very discriminating against certain types of people. as for management they were the same way"
bad,Low pay and bad people!  I was threatened with a gun in the office by another employee. They had bed bugs and the owner never took care of the property and it closed after I quit.
bad,people will not give you what you deserve is what I have learned working for them I wasn't okay with the management I just disagree with some choices it was a fun experience
bad,"The job seems great at first, but I applied as a part-time employee and worked more than a full time employee. I applied as part time because I am going to college. No benefits for part time. Management is awful. Does not schedule enough people to work and does not give correct hours for payroll. Ive lost money working here. I got paid more for my vacation time than actually working. And oh yeah, dont plan on calling out sick unless you want to get fired. Every time you call out sick, you get an occurrence. Too many occurrences and you get fired. I do not reccommend this job at all!!! Especially to anyone applying to it in reno!"
bad,"nothing to say.  very poor management, they make you feel like you are worth nothing..specially engineering manager.  will never recommend."
bad,"They give you so much to do, even thing that are not in your job description. Yet your superiors are walking around doing nothing. Bad experience."
bad,I dont recall working for this company. Therefore ther is no possible way that i could rate this company. you can not possibly rate a job that you have never worked.
bad,"C'est un programme de fidélisation, avec mes fonctions je n'avais pas directement de contact avec eux, sinon que d'appliquer ou de faire appliquer leurs consignes."
bad,"Management left a lot to be desired. Not only did the owner not allow for breaks but, he also did not allow for employees to take a lunch break. Last time I checked, allowing for a nourishment break is a requirement, and not a recommendation by the Federal government. Plus, this employer also requires employees to work some horrible hours. For example; would be scheduled to work from 4 pm until midnight, and then required to be back at work the next morning by 8 am. That happened at least once per week."
bad,"I was made head housekeeper after two weeks because I had three years experience. The manager wanted rooms done in less time than should have been allowed and he wanted me to send the other housekeepers home even if they weren't done because he felt they should be done and gone. If they weren't done, he wanted me to stay and work without getting paid. The standards at the hotel were way below standards. The girls I hired were good at their job but they weren't allowed to properly do their jobs. We also had to call in every day at eight am to see if we even had to work that day. There was no set schedule."
bad,There was not anything I could say good about working here. It was disgusting. The owner was extremely rude and disrespectful.
bad,"While working at the Days Inn, my job consisted of being the night time auditor. Being the night shift worker left me the responsibility of making sure the hotel was okay as well as preparing breakfast. As I liked the experience for a hotel business, the actives brought to this hotel made an employment opportunity very unsafe."
bad,"Management is very flaky. I couldn't seem to get the mgmt. to work with my full time school schedule. "
bad,"Management is no good, no support for drivers not a nice place to work. Schedule changes at managements will without any consideration to the drivers."
bad,"Horrible Environment, Filthy building, Pests, Pay delay, Doesn't want to give you a check, rather do it under the table."
bad,my typical day is usually overwhelming. but overall I maange to get the job done. the management there isn't the best but I deal with it accordingly.
bad,"Hotels are not up to date, managers don't care about their workers, front desk associates are overworked because no one wants to work there, etc."
bad,"Terrible management, friendships over business, many grey areas in rules and chain of command. This company has not grown from the mom and pop origins and keep employees who choke the life out of the company."
bad,Working here was a challenge because the rooms were not up to par with the price. It was hard selling rooms to people that I know was not worth the money. Company went through so many general managers.
bad,no respect for employees and many of the aids determines whether you keep your job or not. never again will I work for this place.
bad,GENERAL MANAGER IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL .Workplace discipline  is VERY LOW . Co-workers were very nice. Hardest part of the job was to deal with some managers attitude.
bad,"i worked at the front desk. i checked in/out guests, and helped them with any questions, concerns, complaints. i worked in customer relations."
bad,it was a ok place to work. didn't get a lot of hours. but it was hard work and i liked that. the hotel needed a lot of work done to it but they was working on that while i was there.
bad,Management does not work with you and work with your scheduling. They have a hard time maintaining a solid staff. The management in north platte id very poor.
bad,"I did not enjoy the job, working for this company or working with some of the people at this place of employment. I do not recommend it."
bad,There was little scope to do anything other than answer the phone and regurgatate what you had been scripted to say and despite a fantastic conversion the commission was £1 per booking which was abysmal.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone.  My first week of working there they didn't even ask for my driver's license, social security card etc.  That right there was a red flag.  Pedophiles, rapists, violent felons, or anyone could have been working for their company and yet they had no clue or no regard to even know."
bad,Do not know why this is on here never worked for this company so just going threw the motions so here it goes.Still dont know why this is on here.
bad,just want to say worse place I ever worked place was a mess management never remodeled just awful didn't like working there at all never had enough help was nothing there I enjoyed
bad,2 housekeepers for 4 floors was told not to leave till all rooms are done I learned what harassment at the work place is hardest part is being told to get a room done in 15 minutes and then it to be clean there was no joy at the work place some times there was no time for lunch but it was still taken out of the pay I would never recommend for any one to work there
bad,"I was a Receptionist at the Aberdeen Airport Travelodge. I started on the 13th of September and was looking for a new job by the start of October.  I was fired on the 11th of January and I'm surprised it didnt happen before then.  "
bad,"Every day was different because we had to practically chase down the guests to pitch them. Most guests were international, and much of what we gave away for time share tour signers was more beneficial to guests that were also US citizens. Management never was clear on what they wanted, and they made many promises they never followed through on.My co-workers were great people, but, they faced the same music I did. All in all, the best part about any sales or marketing position is always when we get the ""yes"" that we strive for."
bad,"Typical day of work required  20-25 rooms on some days less."
bad,"Not a very good place to work for. Very dirty place! Only people that were coming in to rent rooms were local drug dealers & hookers! This hotel has a possibility of being a nice place, if it had the right owners!"
bad,"No structure"
bad,enjoy different deal and rates wyndham's gives out. nice and enjoyable stay
bad,CEO was a bit shady.  Made you feel inadequate.  Co-Workers were amazing.  Enjoyed the customer service aspect of things but disliked the politics set by the CEO
bad,many obstacles to overcome. learned too do a lot with very little
bad,"A typical day at work starts at 7 pm , I talk with the other manager to review what happened during the day. Then I check in customers , walk around the property , make and take reservations , take care of any customer complaints that may occur . Anything from sewer backing up from the toilet , to heating units all powering down in the middle of a blizzard, electrical fires , pipes bursting , room flooding, bed bugs and customers checking up being dissatisfied . "
bad,"I would not recommend this super 8 hotel. It closed down. They were horrible people to work for, they were unfair and didnt want to hire enough people so that the ones who did work could have off."
bad,not enough business for what I get paid an hour servers make hardly any tips it does not add up at the end of the week......
bad,"do not work here, worst job of your life. bad management, bad pay. do not make good experiences for guests; overall hotel is in very poor shape and not well managed"
bad,This place is boring. It is not enjoyable what so ever. You wont want to continue after the first day of training. Find a good job. Not this one.
bad,"It sucked- management was horrible, the actual job was boring a lot of the time, often had to work double and triples to cover for lousy coworkers."
bad,Hours available wasn't a good fit for my health or family.  Enjoyed meeting the guest and helping them.
bad,"I answer phones, check guest in and out, clean key cards and make faxes. After working here I've learned I like jobs with structure, managers who are professional and more interested in teaching you essential job related things rather then their personal life."
bad,u are the main horse. Have to be housman room attandent and even public. It really was the worst experience
bad,"HR takes care of management, not employees.  You are on your own.  Too much favortism.  They do no foster/support people with disabilities to succeed.  I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND WYNDHAM."
bad,New ownership. Co-workers are great to work with. Guests were amazing as well as old owner
bad,Required to be at work 15 minutes early if you are relieving a owner they leave when you walk in the door but you cannot clock in until it is on the hour. Checking customers in and out of rooms. Keep track of paper work and how many room cards are given for a room. Handle customers complaints. The hardest part with this job was going to someones room after dark because of a complaint they had about the room or getting the owners to do something when a customer complained and the employee could not do anything like refunds
bad,"It was not enjoyable and very unorganized. It was hard to get any work done, and the it was often short staffed due to people calling in sick."
bad,check in and out out guest who would stay at the hotel answer phone call of hotel services.  Management was great with the schedule all co-worker would be on time for their shifts i worked i 11pm -7am and i was happy to see the next shift come in i have worked jobs were no one showed up the hardest part was trying to stay awake
bad,"i love talking to the guest.love hearing all the story the tell of travel.the  hardest part of job is working long shifts,most enjoyalbe meeting knew people."
bad,A typical day was sitting at a hostess stand in the restaurant  for hours waiting for no customers to come and eat. Food was very good but way to expensive.
bad,"I did not like the manager, I really dont think he knew how to run a hotel. He was letting magazine groups and illegal people having woopie for money live there. He would do anything to make money. One time the whole 1st floor flooded and they still made us work!"
bad,a day at work was not very fun. I had to do most of the work and hardly anyone ever cleaned up after them selves. management was lazy and always complained about people throwing away rotten food. this place of business was dirty and since I left working there it was shutdown due to health code violations
bad,"Hanahan high school, was the a job that have good team player, and help each other when we needed help. Management was very sucessful on helping everyone meet they deadlines if we have a function."
bad,"Terrible Management, Constant schedule changes, no benefits, no holiday pay, no overtime. Raises & promotions are very rare. Poorly run. Rude staff."
bad,"Company did not know how to treat their employee's."
bad,family owned hotel. horrible people to work with.  was accused of stealing 3 times (but never fired so obviously they didnt really think i did it). asst manager (and owner) screamed at employees regularly. there were bed bugs in at least 2 rooms while i was there. would rather live under a bridge than work for these people
bad,I am an upper management former employee (thank god).  This company is too large and hypocritically does not care about their individual employees.  After over 20 years in the hospitality industry this company made me decide to change career paths.  Stay away from Wyndham!!!
bad,"I wouldnt ever recommend anyone to work here . the management is horrible , they dont give hours or work with you ."
bad,Owners kept hours cut so they would not have to offer benefits. Job was stressful cause of lack of training and being on own devices. Got treated poorly due to some personal issues. I would not work for them again. Did not receive W-2 in timely manner owner actually told me I would not get it.
bad,all depends in where and what hotel is being looked at and what Management Team understand what is happening in there  hotel
bad,"Free hotel training which was wonderful, you are able to take that anywhere with you. Pragna the owner was scary, rude, awful and just fit the personality of ""The Devil Wears Prada."""
bad,the owner of the company made it hard for you to have a good day 
bad,"I never really wanted to work for Howard Johnson Hotel, however I had needed a job and the manager (my neighbor) was trying to get me in there for a while, so I figured why not? First off, there are no benefits OR any chance of promotion. My grandfather had passed at the end of November, and the hotel's response to me going to Florida for the funeral was ""if we can find someone to replace you for a few days then you can go, otherwise you can't go,"" to which I replied ""whether or not you find someone to replace me, I'm still going"". There was never vacation days off, and I missed most of the big holidays. Plus my shift was always set at 3-11pm, so I never had time to spend with loved ones. On my birthday, which I actually had off because it was a Wednesday, my manager proceeded to call my house, whilst I had friends over for dinner, and told me I did not have to come into work the following day. The place is absolutely scummy, and I cannot fathom how it has not run itself into the ground yet. The owner doesn't care about anything but money, if she isn't making money she does not want anything to do with a situation. The management is extremely unprofessional, the rooms are immensely shoddy, and the whole hotel is just a hellish nightmare. I will say one thing though, the quesadillas from the restaurant are banging!"
bad,"loading carts before work was  hard cause you had to go up a lot of stairs with sheets and towles, things for your rooms, and in the winter the building was cold."
bad,"All sorts of hotel experience: including checking in/out guests, making reservations, as well as group reservations. "
bad,"Meeting of various types of people and cultures, only issue was the boss would drink a lot of crown royal on the job"
bad,"A typical day began by loading my supplies and then gathering my laundry from all the check-outs. I learned to use my time wisely so as to get the most important things done first and to finish in a timely manner. The hardest part of this job was that there were not enough washing machines to handle all the laundry, so that on heavy check-out days we fell behind in making the beds due to having to wait on linen."
bad,"My opinion, I would not advise anyone to work as a housekeeper for this company. You are paid by rooms which is not much and you work harder than what its worth. You get no benefits or discounts as an employee."
bad,"I dont recommend this company to anybody, upper management dont like minorities"
bad,"Big nasty , roach infested place. Horrible staff. Unhealthy place."
bad,Only company that takes care of bad employees. Yell at there boss get a promotion and office cause they cant get along with anybody. Steal drink on job watch sports all day. Other employees walk around for a hour to find someone to pick up paper. So if your lazy steal drink on job like to yell at your boss this place is for you. If smoke you get more breaks and must read paper and drink coffee they will love you.
bad,cleanning alot of rooms learned there are some really dirty people out there mangment good co-workers good
bad,"After 6 years of employment and working my tail off, they fired me shortly after taking a stress leave just as they do with everybody else who takes a stress leave."
bad,"Hated going to work. I learned the front desk but was never appreciated by the owner. The only good manager was also talked down to by the owner, He didn't appreciate his staff unless you would flirt with him. Most co workers were cool but had a few two faced people. Hardest part was showing up everyday. I dreaded it. I enjoyed leaving the most."
bad,"Although I believe in Wyndham as a company, the work culture in the Wisconsin Dells Vacation Ownership area is terrible. I worked in both the frontline and marketing departments, and I have never seen such a bunch of phony people as I did there. In both departments, you are just a number. They DO NOT care about you as a person at all. You are easily replaced. They just keep hiring and firing hoping to find the one ""superstar"". It is just a numbers game. The pay plan is terrible, unless you can make it through the downtimes, such as fall and winter. You really can only make money in the summertime. I have never worked in such a negative, derogatory, suspicious, dishonest workplace before. And this starts with the VP, down to the sales manager, trainer, hiring manager, human resources, and marketing manager down to the woman who has worked in the marketing department for the last 14 years, that they cater to because she is the top earner and therefore the tail now wags the dog, instead of vice versa. The employees there do not welcome new people at all, because the atmosphere is so competitive, and they see so many people come and go, that they do not care. In the marketing department they let the old employees choose their schedules, leaving the newbies, with the worst locations and times. In the frontline sales, the top salespeople get the tours and there are many days that as a new person you never get to attempt to sell. So there is no way for a new person to build any consistency. And there is no way to make any money, when you are not allowed to even do a presentation. It"
bad,"You would have great hours for the first month, then lucky to get 8 hours a week"
bad,"bad place to work, no future,no benifts, nothing.. management was main reason for it being so bad. if it wasnt for her it be ok.."
bad,it was a very stressful place to work and i would not recomend it to anyone else. Alot of things happen that shouldnt.
bad,I enjoyed working here however I did not get enough hours other than by picking up other co workers shift
bad,"I transferred from a 5 star hotel at West Point to accomodate employment from the same owners looking to fix up this hotel, figuring I'd benefit by working closer to home."
bad,for the first 2 weeks i worked 3rd and 1st shift and sometimes i worked 24hrs and off for 6hrs to get some sleep. i sometimes lived at the motel because of the way i had to work and they charged me to stay there 4 hrs of my pay went to paying for a room that i slept in and cleaned before i left. i worked front desk and done housekeeping. and the reason they fired me was because they sold the motel and fired everyone that wasnt indian.. which was everyone there.
bad,"Employees work alone with no supervision or guidance with minimal training. No breaks or benefits. Standing, bending, stooping and lifting for 8 hours straight.Employees rarely know what is going on between shifts due to lack of communication and training. Front Desk personnel are forced to take on laundry and maintenance due to owner's refusal to hire a laundry person and only one maintenance person who works at several properties.No management to oversee employees or assist guests."
bad,The worst employer I have ever had. I didnt learn anything. Owners were horrible. Not very people friendly. When they advertised online they falsly advertised that we offered things we didnt. When customers complained they would hide and make the employees lie.
bad,you basically sat there there was nothing to do unless you had customers staying which was not often
bad,The management was in effective and poorly ran the place. The food was aweful and the kitchen conditions were beyond poor.
bad,"This job is no good for anyone. Very stressful, demanding, and no respect given to anyone."
bad,Before employment with Wyndham I had to pass a difficult real estate exam. They had a sales pitch I had to learn even though it didn't feel natural. Owners would get upset when they were told they were going to an owner's update when in reality we were just trying to get them to purchase more vacation credits. This is the first job I've ever had where I had something negative to say.
bad,the worse company i have ever worked for - they cheat and lie to old people in order to sell -
bad,"I started not know what to expect,  having banking back ground you have to be honest.  With in my first week,  while we were giving free trips, so that people visit the different resorts or are supposed to get free nights.  All the people that get free stuff,  also get a soft credit check and when I asked one of the managers why don’t we tell people his answer was, that’s why they are signing those documents.  Not an honest place you want to deal business with."
bad,Didn’t care for it to much once management got to being dirty and snobby... They didn’t care bout the time it really took to clean a really messed up room
bad,"The people there are petty and immature therefore the work environment was stressful and they are like a click so even if your learning and doing a great job of working, if the few stuck up co workers including the management , your voted out of there if anyone feels threatened or jealous........"
bad,Too much drama for me the other house keepers were not nice at all they all think they are the best house keeper in the world and they’ll let mostly only speak Spanish
bad,"Bonus structures changed, once goals met.  Conflicts due to manager overbooking hotel, after contracts submitted.  Owner refused to hold her accountable!!"
bad,This is a mom and pop Punjabi shop. They have No idea of what hospitality means.  They work you like slaves and to top it off they don't appreciate. Do your search before you work for them.
bad,Most Customers/Owners have been taking these sales presentations for many years and attend because they are heavily pressured and given money to attend
bad,"It's just bad management, expected more work done then the pay.. it's exhausting not good place to work for, there's no discount for employees, lack of communication, no respect for employees, only last Abt 1-2 days an they quit"
bad,"There is a lot of drama and back stabbing from workers there.  "
bad,"If you are going to work for a Timeshare company, you would be better to go somewhere else. There is no job security and the environment is terrible. There are so many other resorts in town that appreciate and reword their employees. Wyndham doesn’t have a clue how to make an employee feel valued."
bad,"The work is unreasonable for the pay and while the benefits are enticing, it does not outweigh the cons. It's  like being thrown to the deep end - there's no help. "
bad,If applying expect lack of communication between supervisor and employees. Judgemental attitudes and to high of expectations for what actually paid and title.
bad,"The managers at Wyndham are terrible- they don't care, you are just a number to them and you can be replaced at any moment. The micromanaging was to a different level and if you don't do what your manager says- there's no room for a conversation. The turnover is EXTREMELY high - this is more of a job and not a career."
bad,"Wyndham Destinations is nothing more than a glorified car dealership. The sales/marketing model is dated, the managers are not qualified or professional, the compensation structure rewards do-nothing managers at the expense of low paid sales reps and I would not recommend anyone waste their time in the time share sales division."
bad,"Better training would allow others to do better"
bad,working here isn't always easy. Management isn't always on your side and it's hard to get materials needed to complete tasks effectively and effectively.
bad,they lie to and are unfair picking favorites if your not the favorite you get fired. they dont provide the required clothing that is stated that they have to by the labor law
bad,"Management at LaQuinta Inn is horrible!!. There is No professionalism in place there. Management's work ethics aren't utilized, upholds alot of confusion. Nothing is confidential. Management herself engages in confusion. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply as long as current manager is there, she has a tendency of finding ways to provoke you."
bad,"I had to work whether sick or not, every holiday and was denied quality time with my daughters. The manager was careless and non sympathetic,  I was expected to finish laundry that was stacked to the ceiling in my 8 hour shift as well as tend the front desk, help guests and keep lobby clean."
bad,Management in Accounting is not supportive. Pay is ridiculously low for the job they want you to do. Job posting was inaccurate. Turnover is significant!
bad,"Started working there with no experience in the hotel industry, took me about 6 days to finally get it but had a few questions here and there. There were 2 managers and one I can guarantee was the best one and if she had remained there as a manager I'm positive I wouldn't have quit, the male one on the other hand spent his time playing on his phone and just having lunch, working here and there but the majority of the time he spent on that phone. If I had a question I'd have to repeat it 4 or times, sometimes he'd never hear it and later on it would come back up into question and he'd question the fact that I had tried telling him before. I would have certain housekeepers give me attitude for just doing my job and basically at the end of the day, someone was blaming me for something. Eventually I just decided to leave. There's no point of treating someone like garbage. I'd say give this job a pass if you want a manager who's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh. And if you like people breathing down your neck."
bad,The entire operation is a joke. No sufficient training. Cold calling and the funny thing they call it leads. The management team don’t care about anything but their numbers. You are only as good as your last sale. The place is a joke. People quit after training (what they call training). The longest person there is less than a year.
bad,"Ex-Manager for the Wyndham South Florida. For anybody looking to work for them as a manager be careful and protect your back. If you do not fit in with the in crowd you will not survive. This from the top The regional VP to the GM at these property. South Florida Wyndham is run like a high school popularity contest from operation all the way to human resources."
bad,"No benefits, career advancement, raises, etc. Management is poor. Hours vary greatly per week. Have to be flexible to work any hour and subject to being placed ""on call."" Not a position to hold long term."
bad,You will not advance through your skills or abilities. Company is very political and sub standard pay. All the money is in the office heads. Experience people will be teaching skills with no compensation in the name of team work. Say anything and you will be passed by.
bad,While working for this establishment my schedule was usually working 10-12 days in a row with one day off in between. there was no time for a personal life or any time to spend with family. There were never enough employees staffed to be able to take any time off let alone have a weekend. If there was ever a need to schedule any time off for any reason it was denied instantly.
bad,The guests are wonderful that stay there. The pool is beautiful. If you are a housekeeper most days are 9-5 so thats not a bad thing at all. Coworkers are all about teamwork.
bad,Wyndham is a conglomerate which values the bottom line vs worker satisfaction/advancement. The associates at the front lines-check-in. housekeeping and maintenance are paid $1-2 above minimum wage.
bad,Management cares more about hiring their friends than they do the customers or other employees. Witnessed my supervisor talk very poorly to and about myself and most other coworkers without concern.
bad,"Work on your own even when it is Race Weekend. No breaks/lunch as you are on your own so unable to leave the front desk. You have to break into a room if the key card won't work on a room, answer the phone in 3 rings..How if you are away from the desk helping a guest? The hotel needs work guests complain about no wifi. Min pay."
bad,brook t gothic chef move card Darien usury Verde finish geeky ferns Ohio deny modern and then I am sorry to bother you again and enjoy rest of the day
bad,"If lying cheating & stealing is your thing than this is the place for you...your teammates are ready to stab you in the back & throw you under the bus to get a deal or somehow get an advantage over you"
bad,"If you are on salary be prepared to work 60+ hours a week.  They say that they reward employees, but when you ask for a raise don't expect an answer.  Even when your outlet gets out of the red numbers and starts MAKING profit your hard work won't be recognized.  "
bad,I will never work for the Lafayette IN again. The new owner isn't very easy to work for & put someone in charge that is even worse then him. There are no benefits. He even let me go after working there for 5 yrs. on Nov.28 right before x-mas.
bad,A lot of favoritism no deversity watsever. If management decided not to like you for some reason they will just throw you out. And I do know what I am talking about.
bad,"All that glitters is not gold.  Nice travel discounts. Several senior leaders leaving. Not sure why, but it's noticeable. Multiple layoffs every year in every business unit. Many staff burned out after years of this (being left to pick up extra work after every layoff)."
bad,Would not ever recommend this company to anyone unless you want to torture yourself trying to make a sale after you receive draw and pay back from commission there is no money for you.
bad,"The only people making money at this company are the top 1% .  "
bad,"Restaurant was/is in terrible condition, trying to get things fixed was like pulling teeth.  Wasn't allowed to adequately compensate quality employee's, got stuck with low skilled employee's with bad attitudes in a kitchen that lacked even the most basic of maintence.  The hotel management at the time was just....bad."
bad,"Hands down, this was the Worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,"I have never worked for a big corporation that treats their employees as bad as Wyndham Vacation Ownership.  There focus is in the ""now"" and about the bottom line.  There is no desire to train or develop anyone in their roles and they have no problem turning over employees.  There is no true long term vision and their employees are taken advantage of everyday."
bad,"I worked for an independent Days Inn, The Days Inn  Burlington East in North Carolina. The managers hired me at 7.50 per hour with no benefits, no insurance, and no chance for advancement. They were often rude and did not make it easy to work there. I'm not judgmental at all, although I did see at times they thought that they were better than the people that they had working for them. There was a large turnover rate in the short amount of time I worked for this company. They found people off of the street to do their handy work and paint jobs. There was mold under the paint that was scraped off of the walls, which proved to me that they only completed the bare minimum to satisfy state laws. This was the dirtiest employer that I had ever worked for in my life."
bad,"I am a positive person and wish there were more reviews to protect me from the move to join Worldmark. So I am writing a review for you to know the inside reality. "
bad,"worked there for many years, started out as a cleaner but due to a skin condition with the cleaning chemicals, I was then put into reception which benefited both me and the business. Had a few managers coming and going because of the workplace and then decided to leave because of the most recent manager. She treated every staff member really badly and tried to take advantage of the less confident people. Really bad management and unless you want to get stressed out I would think twice about working for this company."
bad,i luv workin in the barista and being a people person my comuncationwith meeting new people where great
bad,"Telemarketer constant sales thru out-going calls. I learned that I hated not only telephone sales,but trying to rip people off over the phone!!!"
bad,My typical day at work was this is just a job and i was happy when i was done. I felt that you have to be nice to earn respect and my employer always had a problem with everything.
bad,High turnover with little training. Management is little help to teammates.
bad,"You go in and clean rooms for other people. I have learnded that some people you just cant make happy and it is not you fault. The mangent seems nice but unsure. My co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part was learning how to clean rooms in a matter of minutes. Being able to say ""Hey I did good to day."""
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. It is very hard to make any money without lying to owners about their ownership. Everything they do and say is a lie.
bad,I would not recommend working at Ramada Plaza. The General manager was a involved boss but the Director of Sales had no interpersonal skills or communication with staff.
bad,"Very Stressful and Tense Work Environment! The Managers should never work in management. No Motivation, and Managers did not know how to talk their team with out being condescending!"
bad,"This company has a preference towards immigrants, you must be bilingual, upper management chooses illegal immigrants, over high School/college-educated or current students.. illegal immigrants don't work well with Americans they feel threatened.. but illegal immigrants do stick together no matter from what country.. listing of fake names and fake socials for employees of this company are available"
bad,Managers mostly latino and have nothing but dislike and unkind treatment to others that are not latino. Treated very unfairly even though I was a top performer. They worried more about silly things  that happy customers and great results. I being a past director of customer service would never have let my staff be treated that way.
bad,"Not the best place to work and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. The sales team is always on edge unsure if they will have a job next month and the pressure to sell is ridiculous that it makes it very embarrassing to work there. But, the sales team is really the only nice side of the job. I worked in the office, greeting, checking credit, handing out gifts. It is a thankless job, degrading, and a catty environment. The work is redundant and hasn't seen an update since the programs were invented. Some of the staff show up buzzed or even still drunk. It isn't a positive culture and you would be best to find something more longterm with stability rather than a pitstop, because that's what this place is a pitstop."
bad,"Wyndham doesn't provide enough incentive for employees to enroll guests for their rewards program.The hotel and staff are penalized, financially, if they fail the enrollment standard for the month; which is very stressful and non productive. The Wyndham app is also pathetic and inefficient (guests feedback). At the end of the day, if management had a clue about how to properly run a hotel, it wouldn't be a bad place to work."
bad,"This job started as a seasonal position. I was glad to help. However, I basically had to train myself. There was no one available to train me. Up to this date I have to find answers through other co-workers instead of management. Very disappointed."
bad,If you are a member of any minority group be ready for a rough work environment. Management frequently brings employees to tears with rude remarks. Although they promise you a regular work schedule when they hire they change it at their whim and when you complain they point out that the company has the right to change your work schedule as it pleases. The turnover of employees speaks for itself.
bad,"Poor, inexperienced, sneaky managers that obviously received their positions only by how long they worked there as well as an overall negative attitude toward employees. We've all heard the old saying that one bad apple can ruin a bushel, that fits this place to a T. You are given sick time but when you have to use it they penalize you by writing you up and giving you points. I'm my yrs there it became the worst place I've ever worked. t"
bad,"I got a job here as a second job, the money was ok for what I needed it for. I’m not going to say what I want to say but I will say this, if the people knew the truth about the hotel business, I think they would rather sleep in there car!"
bad,"Extremely disappointed with this company for allowing unfit people to move into management. This has cause numerous employees to leave. Maybe one day they will fix it, and promote actual leaders."
bad,"Management doesn't care about you unless you're an attractive female. They messed up my pay several times, showed no interest in resolving the matter and auto enrolled me in company insurance after specifically being told I didn't want it and that I had other coverage. Since nobody wanted to step up and help their employee, I quit. Now they're not paying me my final check LMAO Wyndham destinations is a joke. I don't encourage anyone to drink their kool aid. Other than weekly pay and garbage management they have nothing to offer here."
bad,"Poor management/owners. Over worked, especially first shift. Not appreciated. Family owned, not a good thing in this case.  Fired every knowledgeable person and overworked the ones that stayed. Expected double shifts because they were incompetent and prioritized their other business. Changed my shift so they could give family my shift."
bad,The Wyndham part of this company is moving operations to other facilities around the world. They didn't even bother to try to give decent severance to the 100s of employees affected.
bad,I don't have a a lot to say about this company. I just would probably never work here again unless it was under new management. They did not pay me my last chack
bad,"Recruiters are terrible manipulators, truth Never disclosed about work/life balance or REAL money being made, everything is always inflated. Promised 8-1 schedule usually 7:30-5 or later. Management teaches you how to lie and will never have your back if you face what they call a “skiff” disgusting leadership. Every sales rep is on cocaine or an alcoholic. I would never recommend this company not even to my worst enemy."
bad,"the worse company i have ever worked for "
bad,"uncaring and no work life balance, great pay if you are willing to give up all aspects of a normal life. Management cares about one thing only and that is making money."
bad,"They are full of beans.  They promise you a huge easy high income and work you like a slave horse.  They pay less than minimum wage and exaggerate their commission structure. They have a tremendous amount of turnover.  They have hugely high standards and constantly push the number quantity of sales on a give and take revenue greed scale.   Manipulate who gets leads and best shifts, and fire you by manipulating those numbers to get rid of many people if they don't want to pay you as much."
bad,"no staff training"
bad,"There is a lack of communication and understanding amongst employees and employer. Do not have access to information, material, or management in time of crisis or to complete job requirement"
bad,it definitely could use some training in the management area and pay according to the hours worked and the state laws put in place to protect employees.
bad,"Should be far more evolved as a company for it's age. But still struggles as if it opened yesterday. Travel is fun this place is not. If you have any drive to see things done efficiently, well, or fairly this is not the place for you."
bad,"I worked at this location for roughly three years. In that time we went through about a dozen other workers and three General Managers. The owner is very disrespectful, doesn't fix things, attempted on numerous occasions to commit wage theft and not to pay earned overtime. All too often the schedule won't be out until the very last minute. Even if you ask for time off months in advanced and are guaranteed you'll have it off, that might change in an instant. At times guests are dangerous and will threaten you, they make huge messes, and half the time are just disrespectful. While this job can be laid back, you'll be expected to do work well outside of your position's purview."
bad,"Very political place to work.  Constant change of management. Salary people must work a minimum of 12 hours. Very cut throat working environment.  Company talks about work/life balance, but non exists. High turnover."
bad,"Crooked management practices at this location unchecked by upper management. Favoratism shown at all levels. Deceptive business practices and undue sales pressure on clients. Very high turnover. Be prepared to be self supporting for at least 6-8 months or you will likely starve. "
bad,Worked there on a pilot project. Started out good until i got sick and missed a couple days. Supervisors seemed nice until you expressed concerns. They will stab you in the back as fast as anyone. Beware !
bad,"This has been one of the most misleading and poorly ran companies. Wyndham is suppose to be the Largest Hotel Chain, however they focus on quantity not quality. Supervisors constantly  disrespect other staff members and Management Continues to allow it with no accountability."
bad,terrible work environment poor management  high pressure sales required. most definitely was the worst work environment  i have ever worked at. do not work there
bad,"So i was pretty much onsite assistant manager with a general manager who never showed up for work except maybe once a week for less than four hours. I was running a hotel with only six staff member that included housekeeping, maintenance, and the front desks three per day shifts, the gm wouldn't allow me to hire anyone else, we didn't get lunch breaks and i was having to work from 10pm to 2pm most days. The manager or owner never understood whyh this was a problem."
bad,"Sales tactics are questionable at best. No respect for the customer and they are seen as rubes. Every holiday and every weekend is a workday. You can make a high income but you won't have time to spend it. Very few people are there long term. No stability or structure that can be counted on from management. Very high turnover."
bad,"not sure if the company is run like this site.  Management has no idea what they are doing.   They do not have enough training to lead people for this position. "
bad,Lots of negative vibes. If you choose to work here and get hired you'll find out for yourself. I loved my position just not the enviornment i  was in.
bad,"The Fairfield Franchise might be good to work for, but the Management Company who owns the property were huge micro managers and expect the local managers to know everything that is going on at the hotel at all times, making the work life balance impossible."
bad,Absolutely the worst place I have worked. They're unfair and very unprofessional. Worst place I have been apart of in my life. I wouldn't recommended this place to my worst enemy. The management team set me up to fail from the beginning. Despite my willingness to learn and growth. The HR director was impossible to deal with. I would go to her help for assistance and she threw it back in my face. No Support structure there at all.
bad,not a very good compay to work for i was one of the best workers there and they realy know how to make u feel used i fixed all rooms in  hotel just to have them let me go to bring in people that cant fix a sinks so happy i left this place
bad,I did not have the best experience working here. I was too slow at the very beginning for the manager. I learned that not all customers are courteous. The head person was awesome and very nice and patient while I was learning the ropes. The person above the head person was not so much. They were rude and very unhelpful. My coworkers were great. The hardest part was being part of a team that wasn't even team like.
bad,"The Wyndham resorts is a billion-dollar organization which has been around for multiple years that provides people with timeshare all around the World their timeshare star from anywhere around $3,000 on up"
bad,We housekeepers had to stock our carts full of linen do our inventory before we start cleaning rooms. we had to make sure the room's was perfectly clean before the inspector came in checked them. We cleaned our stayovers. That's the guest that's staying over. We would have housekeeping appreciation week. On holidays our manager would buy food and we would have potlock. it was a fun experience overall
bad,"Absolutely do not work for this company.  The Wingate is owned privately and there are NO benefits.  No insurance, vacation , sick days.  The GM  is very unprofessional.  Lots of bad language and definitely no hospitality to guests."
bad,"The reality of life on the front line was totally different from the culture they pitch at you during orientation. Marketing constantly produced unqualified tours which you were supposed to turn into sales for the company. Unless you pitched heat this was just not going to happen most of the time. Professionalism was not present when you got on the floor, and fighting for desks to promote a sale was a daily battle. I can deal with a certain amount of guerrilla tactics, but the team spirit/count on me was far from the norm. Floor managers/trainers assured new sales reps that there was not favoritism/honey potting going on but this too is far from the truth. The old saying fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me applies if you plan on committing a part of your life to this organization."
bad,"typical day...dealing with calls off having to do extra rooms"
bad,"Employees are told they can make between 5-30K a month.  I lost money every month, because they take 8hr for you to be there to possibly sell."
bad,I did not like working for this company at all. At first management was very nice and inviting but after a month or so they turn very mean and rude. They sit at home watching you on the security camera all day. When there was a customer complaint or a very upset customer they would hide in the office and tell us to tell them that they were not here and that we were not allowed to call them. The customers would be screaming in our faces calling us bad names and management would be hiding in the office watching it on the cameras.
bad,"HOA Accounting Department-Each accountant is overloaded with specific resorts. No one is  adequately trained including management. You will feel overwhelmed and stressed out on a daily basis. Even if you are being a team player and trying your hardest with minimum training, management will continually to push you towards unrealistic goals. There seems to be a long history of this type of management in the HOA Dept. They will also expect you to work long hours and weekends. And management is very unprofessional they will talk down to you. No opportunities to grow within the department or company. Other managers don't really hire internally from other departments. Management forms clique's like high school, you can be a great worker, but if one manager doesn't like you for personal reason's, your career at Wyndham will go no where! The sad thing is the job is not that complicated if you had the correct training and leadership"
bad,"Owner on site constantly talking down to employees in front of guests creating more havoc than needed. Very high turn over, cannot keep employees more than a month."
bad,"Too many politics to keep up with. If you do not suck up to management they will find a reason to get rid of you. God forbid you try to do your job and go home. Not good enough for management. They make Sure YOU ARE WORN down, Overworked, AND CERTAINLY UNDERPAID. How does management get away with this you ask...it's because HR and management are in bed together and they make a ploy to not keep you in the company but to eliminate you all together. Bad, bad company. If you are thinking about working here, make sure to do your research on why people quit or leave the company first. You should also ask employees around the property what its like to work for this company they will be honest! This is a very unethical company!"
bad,Management was horrible and horrible employees were kept while the good employees got tired of the drama and politics and quit. Pay and hours are not guaranteed. Overall awful job.
bad,"Terrible place to work due to unsanitary conditions in parts of the hotel, alot of drama at the front desk made by 1 person, poor training for new employees, terrible wage rate (not competitive at all with businesses of its type in the area), priorities focused on the wrong things. No repairs being made (all repairs just have a band aid fix including the heating, roof, a/c, elevator, etc.)  Wyndham passed this hotel with a D and all of management and the owner are happy and thinking that no repairs need to be done."
bad,when i worked here i was young and was getting £3.67 an hour and in that hour i had to clean four hotels rooms and after that hour it was soul destroying knowing how much more i had to do for so little appreciation and money it has never bothered me what money i get as long as i liked the job but that i would not recommend
bad,"Supervisors young and not experienced managing people or prioritizing work loads. In addition no consistent schedule sometimes you were working 6,7,8,9,10 days in a row no overtime and if you are new you are the low person in the totem pole always working holidays a and weekends and denied days off even if you request 6 months in advance. Selfish supervisors thinking of themselves and their time off God forbid if you have a life. The manager is clueless of what his supervisors are doing and won't step in and interfere or over ride what they have done with the schedule. It changes 3 or 4 times after it has been posted and while you already started your work week cannot ever make plans you are almost on call. This is a vacation resort guest are here on the wknds the manager works mon thru fri he should be there on at least one wknd day. Nickel raises on a yearly basis after review when resort is 400,000 in surplus for that year and that money had to go in the reserves throw a bone to your employees they deserve better compensation. I have been a manager at 5 other places and was diss appointed in this company. Never in my life have I ever disliked a place of employment so much . I have been in the work force 30 yrs"
bad,I got paid 7.50/hour to be a front desk clerk.  I sometimes would work 3-4 shifts without being relieved.  The manger came and went when she felt like it.
bad,"in my experience, I found there was a lot of unfair and some shady things going on. Such as hours, number of rooms that were placed in your responsibility. and in emergency situations it simply did not matter. In addition, some rooms were beyond nasty.Ill leave it at that."
bad,"This is not a place to work if you have a family.  Management doesn't care if you are pregnant, or breast feeding.  You are expected to work at any time. I have been there over 12 hrs at a time. Not a happy environment.  They say that they are there for you and a family, so after you sacrifice for them, they pretty much don't care. The new manager there doesn't speak to you professionally, she is extremely rude and condescending. I was there for two years and finally was fed up with this lady. I had to visit HR for every little thing.  She gave me a broken chair at my desk, wouldn't let me take breaks to pump breast milk after returning from maternity leave.  This is a TIMESHARE resort!"
bad,Long hours of hard work that would pay triple in other places. Told to go above and beyond normal duties of the job.
bad,This whole place is unprofessional. There is a big problem when over 50% of the employees live on sit and when we dont get paid on time.
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had! Our dept manager continuously made racist comments about President Obama ...and when the HR dept was notified about her also making racist remarks about the time share guests, she flat out denied it. I think the corporate culture at Wyndham is such that they have 99% turnover of staff, but don't fire the bad management.( management enjoys lots of perks: time off, fancy leather goods, great benefits)"
bad,I get unemployment because they wrongfully terminated me.
bad,This place is horrible to work at! I had high blog pressure while working there in collections. Its very political driven if your not liked your life will be miserable. There is high lack of moral a lot of ghetto people working there and nasty managers who have poor leadership skills and ethics. A lot of HR violations occur there. Not a god working environment at all. You are micromanaged and treated as a child
bad,Horrible place to work for. They place accountability on employees who have no control of their working situation and not on the employees who are actually responsible for how well or bad their work turns out. Example: employee A fouls up and employee B gets blamed
bad,"Specifically in the IT department, the management and above have more of a ""rule by intimidation or fear"" mentality. Especially the senior leadership team. "
bad,"They were in the mist of a management and construction crisis while I was there.  Management was not dealing with the construction and the problems it was causing.  Management was also all about support and training right up until you needed support.  Then, if you weren't one of the top salesmen you were on your own.  Sink or swi.."
bad,"Unless you're a favorite of mgmt you will never get the nod, & the Dir. of QA is very prejudice, fires minorities in a heart beat, or forces them out."
bad,"Was age discriminated by GSM so she could advance a certain GSA in my Supervisor position; GSA completed the Leadership Program. GSM did not calculate that GSA sick time in order for her to advance to Supervisor position; GSA called out sick 87 hours in 6 months but it was not calculated properly, therefore GSA never received occurrences for her time out. That's just one example of my experience with this property; many more are documented."
bad,"This place is an awful place to work. I would not recommend this place to anyone I like. They ask you to show timeshare to people that just came in for a free trip to Hawaii and are angry with you when you don't sell it. I have personally had a table where my manager asked me to ""pull more heart strings"" with a person who had cancer. They make it seem like you are going to be rich here when you are here but most people do not make over the hourly salary. You have to work weekends and start at 7 AM. I do not like the management. They are all very fake and manipulative. If possible, I would not accept a job from here."
bad,Timeshare sales is what it is. I suppose mine was no different than most but not all others. Lots of turnover in all areas. Senior management is in the middle of a clean-up from what I hear.
bad,Aight Aight just wasn't a job to my interest that could or would pay for the bills n maintain for a family of 5.and not to mention the pay cut on what we was getting was no where close what the job actually paid.
bad,"Everything about that hotel was bad , in house stealing , management taking advantage of the workers, family ties through out property , bad place period"
bad,"Worst commission structure in the industry bar none. If you like watching your money disappear towards the end of your pay schedule, then this is the right job for you."
bad,"Pay is extremely low for administrative jobs, compared to just about anywhere else. Sales can be better, if you can keep your job, but salesmen are 1099 (full commission, no base pay). Marketing is about the only department where you get base pay and make decent money. Turn over is insanely high in all positions. In 10 months I’ve seen almost everyone turn over at least twice - even management. The entire corporate culture is based on greed and deceit, and they treat their customers terribly, so of course their employees fare no better. Some of the managers are actually quite good, but most have no credentials or qualifications for management. If you sign up for Wyndham, you leave your education, experience, and resume at the door - none of that counts for anything with this company. It’s all about being there longest and politicking."
bad,the company was bought by Wyndham and they got the short end of the stick. Poor local level managment. Mixed messages from the top down. The culture is not consistant.
bad,they weren't fair and weren't concerned with problems I was having with my health. I had someone harassing me at work and they didn't seem to care or help fix the problem and I was 8 months pregnant
bad,Did not enjoy my experience there. The GM was never there and left everything in charge to a guy who didn't know what he was doing and was very rude to not only me and the other staff members but to visitors and others as well.
bad,"The Micro management is very hard there to work and they have hard company policy to follow. They change managers every 6 months, they can't keep employees happy there, so it is always new faces. I feel that they are not a good place to work for because, they stress you out and they make you work extra shifts and strange hours even if you have a family."
bad,In summary they only are interested in the rating on tripadvisor so is exploiting their employees.  they tell one thing when you're in an interview and when you go to work is different.
bad,"Work weekends and late hours"
bad,"Management is really bad"
bad,"A Culture of bulling, Favoritism, Nepotism and sexism are rampant without any control. With no HR representative to represent employees it makes it easier for low life and classless individuals to run the department."
bad,"great money, very competitive  work environment . If you can handle the stress, very long hours. Then you can make a lot of money!!!"
bad,"If you've ever heard that time shares are scams, you're right when it comes to the Wyndham Vacation Resort in Nashville! Sales managers have stood by and allowed sales reps to scam people, particularly ederly people out of all of their money. There was even news coverage about it. The sales dept will do ANYTHING for a sale, even if it means trying to keep the guests from getting the free gift that they were promised. I hated working here. I couldn't wait to find another job. There are far better places to work than the sales office at Wyndham. Run fast and far. The pay is low and the work load and stress is high. The discounts you receive on hotels isnt very great bc believe it or not Wyndhams hotels and sister properties can be very run down depending on which city and state you're traveling to. There are opportunities to move up, but only if you're a snake and you're ok with guests being treated unfairly."
bad,"This place started off as a IHG property. While an IHG Property it was headed in a great direction as far as customer service, and employee appreciation. Soon after selling this property there was high hopes to move in a positive direction. Already a strong culture, it only needed a physical face lift to the property. That is exactly what did not happen. New owners fired 65% of the staff, then began an extensive renovation, hiring past criminals to do the work. Renovation brought on bad customer reviews and the occupancy of the hotel went down to less then 5 bookings a day. Now 6 months later with poor renovation in the bathrooms and lobby area, renovation has stopped due to funding not being available. So more job cuts, and micromanagement by owners who are never on property. No bills are getting paid, and not supplies for day to day office, kitchen, and housekeeping to do their job. A very unorganized, poor General Manager, who is never available or dressed in a suit. Moral of the employees went from being top contenders awaiting a newly renovated branded hotel. To overworked team with less then the appropriate staff, material, or money to complete any task. Overall a poor facility to work at in this time."
bad,i was there about 6 months. never enough supplies. the management treated the guest and there employees rude no respect. i like most of the co workers some were very rude though. i cleaned rooms and made beds. i like knowing that people were coming into a clean room and hear there compliments.
bad,The management were clearly only there to benefit their personal friends with the best opportunities with sales. The manager I worked with had a serious drug abuse problem and used while on shift on company property.
bad,This place is and has been in transition for a long time. Change in ownership hasn't really improved conditions and has created uncertainty and lack of confidence in management.This place is a revolving door with a huge employee turnover and over all seeming dissatisfaction.
bad,The people that work There are very nice the is ok it's it has its good and bad if you don't mind hard work for very low pay if you need money right away this place will hire you on the spot.
bad,"Office location is a main benefit. It is not a long commute except in the summertime with all the tourists. But all in all still not a bad commute. It seems to be the only major company to work for in North Myrtle Beach, there  are not allot of options to pick from with location and hours as it is here at this job."
bad,"If you work at the Super 8 in Paris, TN wear a small camera to work to show video proof that SP is putting his hands on you unprofessional and talking to you unprofessional. Also, use bug spray before you walk into the building because chances are if you don't. You will most likely bring bedbugs, roaches, and/or home with you!"
bad,If I could give them a negative 100 I would. Worst place to work ever. They don’t care about others lives and push people into things they don’t want to do. They pressure people knowing they are already broke and taking money from people who they know can’t afford it and don’t care.
bad,The interview was ok. They informed me I would make $12 an hour and that was incorrect. I started at $11.25 an hr. The department's always blamed each other and the gm never did anything to help the situation. Always putting down me or other employees. When me or any other employees went to hr they seemed to cover for the gm and supervisors. They told me that being quoted $12hr was an honest mistake I wouldnt recommend working at the one in taos nm
bad,"I was an employee for 3 years at the corporate office. The culture is one where you must pucker up to your superiors if you want to move up.  I was mismanaged, mistreated and disrespected by many superiors with no serious justification as to why.  The supervisors and managers have no idea on how to be a boss at this company. Wyndham does not value diversity."
bad,Departments fight over equipment and lack internal communication needed to successfully run business operations.  Expect to be let go based off personal reasons.
bad,I'f you have excellent customer service: I would not recommend applying here. The managers and people are extremely nasty to guests. Unfair towards new employees
bad,"The previous manager was amazing, she cared, she worked hard. The new one however is rude, he has sexually harrassed an employee. He made MANY insanely strict rules, rules that weren't in place before and continuously changed them to fit HIS needs. He has made many promises to change things and fix things with coworkers and each time he has lied just to get you to stay. He also offered me personal money as a bribe to stay??? Who does that?"
bad,Manager thinks she knows everything and is dismissive when trying to make suggestions. She believes her time off from work overrides anyone else’s requests. Watched as company laid off competent and dedicated staff. Human Resource Manager does not return calls when you try to reach her.
bad,"This place was something out of a bad ""Boiler Room"" type movie. Inconsistent messaging during training, one chance to sell per day, commission-oriented job that ate my savings account while I attempted to learn by asking questions to unresponsive managers."
bad,"Energy was fun and vibrant. Team tried to help everyone out as much as possible. Manager always helped the team and worked hard. "
bad,"I worked for Days Inn, very stressful the staff is rude except for the Manager.  You dont get pay raises unless minimum wage goes up. Staff is very rude especially laundry staff."
bad,"If you work at home, you're an afterthought.  Nobody cares about us unless we're not hitting our numbers.  Our job went from purely Owner support with booking vacations, to include a mandatory sales quota for the new Points Protection Program.  This was not part of the position I applied for, and it was muscled in by corporate."
bad,This is an ideal job for a college student trying to make a few extra dollars. There is no room for advancement and working hours are minimal. This job is not meant for someone trying to make a career.
bad,Management sucks! They are very rude. They talk to you very disrespectful and think they can say what they want with no disregard for your feelings. Geesh!
bad,Not a bad place to work if you really don't need money and don't mind lying to people and being lied to by your managers. Otherwise it is fun just really not much opportunities for money unleas it's summertime
bad,"Management is just rude, speaks to his staff as if they where a piece of gum on the bottom of someone shoe. Swore at his staff in front of guests and in front of the lobby. Everything in the Hotel is broken."
bad,"Have you lie to current owners"
bad,Lots of favoritism here.  Several employees are related to supervisors which causes a lot of the favoritism.  Assistant GM has 2 children working here.  Chef is married to a supervisor.  Service Manager has mom working here....you get the picture?
bad,The company is great if you are a favorite of theirs. I worked as a Customer Service Rep.Hardest part was unhappy owners with policy changes.I love the Managers at my work place. Dont care for the Supervisors. The only enjoyable part was working at Home
bad,"I was hired, and trained for a few days and told by a manager ""We like to give people a chance before we let them go."""
bad,Don't work for this company in a sales role. If you land a non sales career here don't tell people what you do for a living the majority of the customers are conned and hate wyndham.
bad,"Found this company not great to work for, very poor culture where focus is more on self promotion and trying to show off as opposed to real interest in growing the business"
bad,Horrible experience.. Total con job for employees and clients. Very little that is communicated is actually true. Lots of pie in the sky in terms of compensation.Customers are flat out deceived all day everyday.
bad,I really do not like reviewing my former employers. I think it is tacky and unseemly. It was also many years ago. Ownership has probably changed. The culture and management has most likely changed also.
bad,"Would never work in Hospitality again, the rules were always different and of course not everyone has to abide. Certain people are favored, of course based on sucking up and if they have kids, I didn't so being able to work all shifts was not to my benefit."
bad,A typical day at Days Inn Norton was good. Interacting with guests was the best part. I had no problem at all with the various duties.I enjoyed the interactions with my coworkers.
bad,"employees always quit due to poor management and too much micromanage. Managers has trust issues and always short staff adding more work to your CURRENT duties without compensation, no appreciation and no work and life balance. Poor scheduling."
bad,Its private owned. The Owners are not customer friendly. They are indian and racist against blacks. They are rude and don't know how  to talk to their employees.
bad,Great job if you want unclear expectations and to lie to people on a daily basis. Bad culture. The only way you can make a buck is by taking advantage of people and making them angry. This company doesn't do anything good for anyone in the world if it doesn't benefit their pocketbook.
bad,The job it self is not bad it all management. Your direct coworkers are great. The rules change based on managements feelings for the day. The rules make your paycheck. They have no respect for employees and HR is a joke.
bad,Bad company no organization at all the people at office fill like they own the company. To many boss walking around filling to big for they position. Left after 3 days. If they want the people to work there they need to come down and adjust to the workers.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for in hospitality. HR and corporate policies are laughable. Absolutely zero support for managers in regard to disciplining employees. We have had three different employees sue us while working for us. HR will protect the worst of the worst employees while throwing managers under the bus. The HR department is inconsistent at best,"
bad,"Loved my team, but manager and director are horrible, tried to have fun environment, couldnt exist. If you want to laugh and smile, do not work here. You will be fired for being  'too loud'."
bad,Typical day was standing at the front desk only time it was busy was weekends and having to deal with bad management was let go for saying have a good one to a guest. worst job i ever had.
bad,The only way to make money here is to book a lot of timeshare tours.  This isn't the job for everyone.  Management has favorites and do not support staff only those who books tours and make them money.  The co-workers are good and bad.  The hardest part of the job is getting people to commit to timeshare tours.
bad,You wanted to go to work to help guests enjoy their stay. At the end of the day you felt like you accomplished something
bad,"Worked there for 4 years and got all together raise of $1.71.Last ""bonus"" for passing all the requirements I received was $25.That will give you an idea of how much your work is appreciated in Wyndham."
bad,"Working indirectly and directly with different guests all day everyday, and helping was the best part of this job."
bad,"Worst place ever.  I hate that I left my job thinking I was advancing my career.  They basically make you stalk tourist & locals forcing them into seeing a hotel or property to force timeshare down their throats.  They make it seem like you'll make all this money but in the end you may get $7.00/hr. Waste of time, don't believe the hype! They need to total revamp EVERYTHING!"
bad,I love making people feel home away from home! Ive learned the Opera System inside and out! Managment sucks bottom line! The company has no true values or Culture and they dont believe in Job security or Advancements! Ive been stuck in the same position for 2 years and work more hours than my supervisor and manager put together! I feel I could run the place! I do already just dont have the title or the paycheck to prove it! The hardest part is dealing with upset customers but for me its easy due to the fact im a great listener and thats what they want is just someone to listen!
bad,I was fired for not personally liking someone in management. When brought to the General manager she did nothing but gossip and ignore my claim. This was one of the most unprofessional places I've ever worked at.
bad,"The Marketing Department is a toxic work environment. You are set up to fail, not to succeed. They don't want marketers making any money. If you start bringing in decent paychecks, they find new ways to bring down your numbers and change the comp plan. Workplace culture is toxic and negative, its like a shark tank, and your management team is not there to help you succeed. You are under payed and overworked. You have people making $300 a week meanwhile putting 15-20 nonowner tours in the door. How are people supposed to live off that? If the lobby got busy, you could easily go an entire 8 hour shift without a break because they wont let you leave for coverage. Its impossible to make money without stealing tours, getting strings pulled by admin, and other shady tactics.  It is the most stressful, negative, toxic, unethical work environment I have ever been in."
bad,"It was okay for a temporary job. We got free tickets to shows in Myrtle Beach so that was a bonus. I spoke with ppl booking reservations, so most of my callers were very pleasant to speak with."
bad,"12/hr to be houseperson just wasnt okay, No family time, you gotta be there before and after housekeepings, If you clean 8 rooms to help them finish in time no one does your job so youre stucking doing your own job after helping them out!"
bad,"The company has changed tremendously since I last worked with it. The training theme is “the people you see are stupid.” Management applauded reps who would tell customers their credit would not be affected by checking it because there was a government shutdown. The company no longer pays for insurance. The insurance you pay for is subpar at best. In years past top reps were rewarded with a free trip to a 5 star resort with their peers. Now, after returning $2,000 is taken out of your commissions to pay for your trip."
bad,Stressful work environment with little opportunity to advance. Leadership has no experience in many of the departments making the evaluations subjective. Communication is poor until they need to assign blame.
bad,"I gave it a 1 star rating because there is no option to say minus 10!"
bad,"The management at the wyndham in Panama City Beach was awful. They all play favorites and real down the team a lot. They can't keep a front desk team at all. It has been always disorganized. It was nice to have somewhat consistent days off but the stress was always there. They will tell you one thing and then do something totally different. You got breaks when you can. They would a lot of overtime and then make you come in the next day after working a double and the advancement in the company was not there. They would place people in management positions that they shouldn't and still should have done. The lack of a team spirit and feeling appreciated isn't there. You come in, work, and leave. They was alright and the vacation time/Medical, dental and vision plan is great. So if you can deal with the above and lazy management with that then I think you can make it."
bad,This organization treats their employees like robots and numbers. They have no respect for the owner of their timeshares or who they sell them to.  I could not have the respect for a company like that. it did not matter how much they paid
bad,I didn't like this job because I didn't get properly trained and the owner treated me like dirt. He talked down to me like I was animal and I wouldn't refer anyone to work there.
bad,"I can only say great things so far. Everyone has been great, but the job there has no future in the field that has a direct interact with the customers that's why there isn't much business there."
bad,"Not a great place to work due to the people you work with and how they cut corners in running the business. Extremely unfair in pay and benefits, especially when they are a franchise."
bad,"the Super8 in stockbridge pays their employees 7.25 per hour. The manager is rude and disrespectful. Plus, we can't ask for time off. They also get on us about over time. The turn around rate is extremely high here."
bad,not the best or most comfortable environment to work for co workers was pretty nice management was to strict to the point you couldn't even have coffee at your desk
bad,"I did double shifts for like 3 months didn't get any recognition, except the same person that did absolutely nothing kept getting nominated for the Alex award, then the manager had nerve to change my days off just to show me who was boss, after all I had done for the company I was treated like I was nothing in the end, but the other people that work here are great, just not housekeeping"
bad,I worked for travelodge for 3 months. As a cleaner at amesbury. They had recently changed management so that the hotel could be improved. They provided no training for cleaners like they said they would. I got my fire safety training 2 days before I left which wAs when I first found out where the fire assembly point was! They not once provided gloves for cleaners at any point whilst I was there. They unfairly treat staff and favouritise over certain people. Racism and discrimination is high in amesbury travelodge and wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. The new manager is far the worst I have known in any occupation I have had.
bad,I learned how not to run a business. Vendors were never paid. Best part of working there was leaving.
bad,It was our job to invent a problem with our timeshare owners portfolios and then convince them to buy more points to fix the imaginary problem. The company woud continually tell us not to lie while all the top sales people told us that we had to lie to achieve enough sales to keep out jobs.
bad,"This company’s has poor time share techniques and prey on the weak. The training process is an interview for 2 weeks , where you memorize lines . You are sold big promises . Where managers come in with flashy cloths and try to sell you of the lifestyle to convince to to stay"
bad,"In the beginning with this company was a dream job. It had everything you could want, good schedule,pay, management was professional and personable. Work culture was fun, engaging, all about team work.  Typical day consisted of checking in guests, answering phone calls, dealing with customer complaints and getting anything the customers might need. I stayed at that particular site for 2 years. "
bad,"Training associate timed me my second week of work, comparing me to her  that she has 2 years experience. A task that she does in 3 min and I did it in 5 was not meeting her criteria"
bad,the owner only cared about his money not the concerns of the employees when we had concerns he said that he would take care of it but it never was taken care of
bad,"If you enjoy lying to people every single day, then this is the place for you!! Management trains you to lie about how the programs work.  You will have 2-3 meeting every day. And if you dont make a ""sale"", get ready to role play with your manager so they can pick apart everything they think you did wrong (in front of your entire team)"
bad,"When the recruiter for Wyndham called me, they didn’t state how the actual job will be. they absolutely did not say my hourly pay will deduct from 12.50 to 7.75 plus full commission. and in order to stay at the job and actually earn your money, you had meet there goals of touring no less than 4 ppl! Everything they did not tell me over the phone until i quit my previous job and started working for them! i stayed there no less than 4 days! they are rude and selfish! i hated those 4 days of training!"
bad,The start pay is good for the area but that's because they have such a high turn over rate because of the bad management. One manager gets promotions from his friend the higher up manager that he is not qualified for. Hours have a start time but no end time. Could be 430 could be 9. If you have a family don't even bother.
bad,"The pay scale is terrible. Out of pocket expenses for health benefits is outrageous. I honestly dont think the company pays a thing. And the doctors in the directory are terrible, second or third rate doctors. Urgent care coverage is ridiculous. You would feel better if you died."
bad,"The title says it all, the Springfield location is great, supervisors and local management are great and the local feeling is good. However the corporate office started and heavily enforced sales which was specified is what not nor would it be part of the job. Corporate is stuck making policies that don't make sense or make doing your job harder. The company split and so did their concern for front line agents."
bad,"Really poor management and not fair workplace I have  work 3 year in housekeeping they give me really hard time never Appreciated  your hard work only complaint for such a stupid things which I haven't done, they only care about their fav people. If you can't  be fav of then your kicked out from there so guys don't west your time"
bad,I was a supervisor on the property and there will always be so tight on budget that it will affect work flows that creat even harder time to make unique experience with the guest. Also with such low budget they laid off over +30 managers and supervisors in Southern California alone including me.
bad,Great bunch of people to work with but timeshare sales is not for everyone. Be ready to have at least 6 months of living expenses ready before taking this on
bad,"It's a good job to work on customer service and answer phone calls. It's a challenging job to work with housekeepers, front desk clerks, maintenance, and manger."
bad,"outside sales is a toxic environment, it turns team members against each other, its too aggressive in most cases. The people who have been there the longest are usually the most mean and its no secret why."
bad,I was lied to from my first interview to my exiting the job. The manager routinely lied in order to make himself look better. I did however enjoy most of my constituents.
bad,I worked hard everyday to accommodate the guests best of my ability. It was a hard and stressful job but I loved the guests. I was trained well and had all the resources I needed to do my job.
bad,"Overall working for the company for three years was enjoyable. Great benefits and a decent bonus package for the management team (GM, Sales and OPS Managers only). At this particular property corporate has overlooked a lot of turnover because the General Manager was making money by cutting corners and running a skelton crew. There were many times we were without necessary supplies for housekeeping, engineering, and even required breakfast items. This property was rarely adequately staffed. Repeatedly rooms were taken off market because they were dirty and returned to service before audit was completed so corporate was unaware of the lack of houskeeping associates. With the correct leadership and proper staff this would have been an excellent place to work."
bad,"I been working a year and 5 mo for the Super 8 in Dalton Ga, I got started out at 7.50 i got my first raise 5 mo from my hire date.  I have not got a raise since then. I am dependable and always on time.  We do not have insurance. I think we should atleast get paid 9.00 and hour so we employees can make it."
bad,"The hotel is very cheap. The management team was horrible, often we had guests coming in with rooms with roaches, and bugs. Also, the general manager would never want to talk to the guests, even in a more problematic situation, for example, dirty rooms that were put in the system."
bad,"Negative work environment, and management prefers the iron fist technique, and breaking you of any value. Cutthroat environment and management does not listen to their Staff Accountants, or recognize their expertise to use for training new hires.  The reconciliations and entries which should be automated, aren't.  This creates more confusion, frustration, and leaves you vulnerable and unsure of the procedures.  Everyone reconciles differently, making training is a waste of time.  Fear of being terminated or targeted, and staff fearful whenever management closes doors. Management will change the rules, send confusing messages, and waste much needed time on 'team development', but will make no effort to develop THEIR TEAMS.  Managemet believes they are better than staff and does not comprehend that their staff are the ones that make them look better.  Classes are a waste of time!! Especially if aren't going to bother to train your staff!!    Our deadlines never change, but staff does!  Veterans do all the work while new people are given antiquated training methods from managers, only to be left with severe anxiety at month end, confusion, and frustrations!   Management will not help or admit their mistakes, but are quick to document!  Training is not a calendar and promise of time, without any time!  In other words, If you have a great attitude, and are a positive, energetic person, management will take your essence, and then fire you! Run"
bad,"I enjoy being a leader. as a team leader it is important to motivate others to challenge themselves and do the best job possible. That means I did the best job possible,"
bad,I just love working with different peoples just doing something to help folks
bad,I have a wonderful manager and get along well with all my co-workers. I have learned a lot about the hotel business. The thing I like so much about this job is meeting people from all over the world.
bad,provides basic services but managers do not co-operate with hospitality compliance training codes much competition and internal politics is illegal and unethical
bad,"push owners and non-owners to participate in the Wyndham workshop presentation. "
bad,I never recieved anything  benefits  that was promised  to me .I was a dedicated  hard worker I can say I made some great  changes  whenever  i was there ... GM  would hire anyone and let them come In or leave  when they wanted..clock in And you never see them (employees) all the good one he let go and kept all the lazy ones that werethat never worjes
bad,"While working at Days Inn- initially was great, until new management took over. I taught them the ropes for 3 months, familiarizing them with every aspect of Wyndham hotels. Core beliefs, fair pricing, as well as competitive prices were an integral part of my training the new managers. Once they learned the ins and outs- they started just doing things their way. Which in most situations would be effective, yet they were copying id and cc's and that is illegal. As they were not telling the patrons, nor did they destroy the information after the departure of said patrons. "
bad,"Wasn't the right fit for me. Don't get me wrong, the money is fantastic if you're good at it and by ""it"" I mean pitching heat. You better be ready to make a sale within the first 10 tours though."
bad,Since I first started working at days inn there has been new ownership of the building which resulted in no managent and poor work flow nothing seems to get done and somehow I ended up training the owner .No health benefits and it has turned into a poor working environment for me after just a few short month with the new owner .
bad,"I was so excited to work for Wyndham. I have extensive proven sales experience. The 7 page sales pitch for new hires has to be memorized verbatim. This was very difficult because of my learning disability. Combined with the fact that the trainer did not hide his dislike of me. To be able to sell, we have to pass the memorized test. After 2 weeks of training and learning the very long script it was my turn. The trainer intimidated me so badly that I froze, couldn’t remember anything.   He used me learning disability against me, instead of to help me. It was awful. There is no retakes for test. Two weeks of my time wasted."
bad,The job is straight forward. Sometimes things happen and it’s  unavoidable. Don’t be rude to your peers and try to get along. Be ware of rude guest as always.
bad,"I have been working for WD for 7 months. About 3 days ago a corporate HR representative flew in and handed me a piece of paper that stated my job was being eliminated and I had to leave the property immediately and I would receive one week of severance pay and the 86 hours of vacation I accrued is void and I would not be paid for it. No previous corrective action I was a very dedicated hard working manager. This company claims to be people first then profit its printed on everything and a very bold lie. "
bad,It was noce getting to know the customer more at the front desk housekeeping u really dont het to talk with the customer like front desk u get to know them and why they are in tje area and staying with you
bad,Not professional or family oriented. Theydo notcare about the employee. Or when empk2have emergencies. No matter how hard you work they do not care. Don't pay overtime.
bad,a typical day at work would be busy . I learn different things each day . management is ok gotten waaaaaay better over the months . my coworkers are great . the job isn't hard at all besides guest accommodation and the most enjoyable part is meeting people from all over the world
bad,I was never employed there. i think my information got mixed up with someone elses.
bad,"AGENTS please becareful when applying for the timeshare positions. They hire every month its not a stable job. IF SOMETHING SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE think twice the prey on agents because they know they dont have jobs"
bad,on Sunday is typical day at work
bad,"Its run down with lots of problems. In the rooms the walls are stained yellow from cigarette smoke. They smell of smoke even in the non-smoking rooms. They allow pets. There are bugs(fleas, spiders,etc). The rugs are stained and old. I've never seen any vacuuming done on any of the floors."
bad,They lact on a lot of things there proflism is not good they treat.  The workers bad and they don't give you chance I was a hard worker ....it was ok but it could been better
bad,"I worked for the old owner. It was a good place to work for the most part. Very steady place of work, would have it’s busy moments but other wise pretty calm"
bad,"I watched as they lied to the owners, took advantage of elderly clients, bullied the clients, were rude to anyone who walked in the door if they didn't buy.  Lied, lied, lied, lied.  They should be arrested or sued."
bad,"As a company Wyndham Destination was a great place. The GM was amazing, I felt like he cared about his employees. The housekeeping management was TERRIBLE. They showed favoritism by moving certain people up in the company, giving certain people extra days/ paid time off. Managers was also having close relationships with some of the co-workers outside of work. The manager at the Austin downtown location was very rude.(She always threaten to fire us) I didn't feel appreciated at all and I know for sure i was good worker. They tried to work me for 14 days straight without my permission. Their protocol steps of termination was never followed.  It was fights in the retort rooms all the time. Overall the Wyndham Destination at downtown Austin need a whole new housekeeping management team."
bad,I like the work i did and i was good at it but i didnt like the way i was treated and how they refuse to pay me. When before i came along that place was falling apart and i got it back together and then they did what they did
bad,"This hotel poorly ran by GM.. Always a problem with rooms,reviews from guest experience was terrible not because of the food, bit cleanliness of rooms and rude front desk staff, when I left because I couldn't bare working there, my position was filled by a person , let's say their past could be of question, but apparently they are doing a great job! Myself I wouldn't recommend to work there, not stay there."
bad,"Company constantly turns over ""management"". Expect unrealistic goals while not providing proper training nor the materials to properly perform your job. Refuses to discuss raises when asked to perform another job (for an extended period of time). HR and the GM will make sure to keep ANYONE they like, even if they sleep on the job. HR is always noddin gbn off in meetings. General manager likes to micro manage and likes to make you feel inadequate.  Overall, avoid this place looe the plague!"
bad,"It doesn't pay enough for the drive, management doesn't honestly care about anyone but themselves. Their turnover rate is big. Over worked and never given credit. Pay days are on a friday but it could be a week before you get a check because even though you give them your deposit information a head of time they still mail it out. You get wrote up for everything enough though you told your supervisor and yes they will throw you under the bus to cover themselves. They say one thing and do another."
bad,"Nice property and great staff to work with. Owner is an absentee.  Manager had no previous hotel experience.  Made new ownership transfer very difficult."
bad,The Days Inn that i was employed at was ran very poorly and have actually lost their franchise with wyndham so I guess I should not say this is a bad place to work due to the opportunities I had were extremely limited.
bad,no place to work if you are trying to get ahead in life. no benefits no paid vacations low pay very few hours to cover a shift.. only worked there because I had no other means of supporting my family at the time...
bad,"For the short time I worked here; I was paid unfairly, put in an unsafe and negative environment. The owner was rude and sneaky. Cut hours and hired people underneath you. Wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"I would not recommend this place. at the time I worked there the management only cared about the money,  not the employees. Pay was the minimum. The other employees were great"
bad,"I would not recommend this employer to anyone. The majority of franchise owners pay you little to nothing but expect tons of work out of you. No benefits, overtime, raises or room to grow."
bad,"Over 90% of the training class I was in failed training due to poor teaching, then a supervisor came and yelled at us telling us we were the worst class he has ever seen, I managed to pass and stay on only to have another supervisor treat me poorly then when making the most sales on my team i was not payed a bonus due to them failing a call for ""lack of product knowledge"" and when listening to the call, that claim was laughable if it wasn't so tragic on the wallet. If you don't mind having your check messed with, treated like your of little value by hot headed supervisors, and constantly being micromanaged and underpaid for good performance, this company might be for you."
bad,Employees don't come to work so you gotta work their hours as a manager to assure the business can run.  The pay is very low so it is difficult to get self motivated people.
bad,"I was over worked and underpaid to the max, recently pulled a 19hr shift with no break at all and only had 5hrs until I had to be back for my normal 10hr shift."
bad,I love cleaning and helping guest but this hotel had a horrible bed bug problem and did not take correct percautions when dealing with the issue. This is where I begain my customer service skills.
bad,"enjoyed my time there until new owners bought it. normal days consisted of getting carts ready, getting room assignments and cleaning said rooms. supervisor was totally great to work for/with."
bad,"Worked independently. Good staff to work with. Maintained building and property. Did sheetrock repair, painting, electrical repair, plumbing repair, and HVAC repair/maintenance."
bad,That place was so messsd up liars and two faced managment. No raises unless u have good behavior that place is very stressful and housekeepers ars know as the lowest pieces of trash there
bad,This place i would never work for.  there ae horribleness and not friendly what so ever.  if you want to work for someone who steals things and says they never did
bad,"First of all this place is a trap and mind playing game, they make you do what they call stand up every day at 9am and all they do is talk about there scoring and how u as employee have to make the place better?  Isn't that the resort managers job and you as employees maintain the place working in a proper way? Well after they finish there annoying meeting the make you say '' A great place to work ''  what a joke believe me if you plan to have a future in this place u better be prepared to be disappointed!"
bad,"great place to start work for. and i learned alot and meet new people that are fun and out going, so i still do talk to those friends.. they have a beautiful job ethic."
bad,"Never heard of this place. "
bad,"I work directly with store manager to ensure that all client communication is accurate and timely documented. Organize and maintain productivity, attendance, and budget reports. Answering switchboard phones for customer service issues and data entry on daily activity"
bad,Typical day would be handling all administrative functions for the entire Corporate Communications & Marketing Department.
bad,"Could not do anything to fix a hotel that's falling apart if owner is constantly taking maintenance away to his other properties to work there. After that I got the blame for not keeping things up. Even though I would explain to the owner that I needed maintenance to help things fixed up. "
bad,Management didn't care about the employees.  The guests were mostly trouble makers of the lowest class and always had the local police called out.  To many drugies and dealers and partiers trashing and damaging the rooms.
bad,"Work wasn't fun, we only got paid $.50 a room, and on an average day we only got 13 rooms and I was only allowed to work weekends."
bad,"During my time, i found multiple illegal substances in guests rooms, "
bad,"Does not pertain to the Wydham group, but the actual owners were horrible and did NOT treat the employees very well"
bad,make sure that the guest was happy make sure there guest room was ready to be rent out.
bad,"One star is generous!  From management to training this is the worst company to work for!  Perhaps it is only the location in Williamsburg VA... I'm not sticking around to find out!  Nine months was enough.  They constantly talk about culture... What culture?  I didn't see a shred of ethics or integrity on the sales floor or marketing side at this site!  Lies lies lies!  Management might have a high school education at best!  If you are educated, use your talents elsewhere!  40k is a generous salary there!  It's like a horse race with no finish!"
bad,"Working at super 8 taught me alot about cleaning and hotels, but working there wasn't fun or interesting to me at all. I found co-workers were always complaining about everything they possibly could. The managers were great except the housekeeping manager, very rude and demanding. I always put my full effort into my job. I always got everything done on time no matter what but when it came to me asking for proper equipment to help me work it was always a hassle. I haven't found one person who likes there job working for this company. Also no one liked working as a team like we were supposed to. Super 8 would be such an amazing workplace if alot of people didn't bring personal problems to the workplace and if things were delt with maturity. I found that things were never handled properly. Sundays we would have a full day check out 82 rooms? we asked for one of us to be able to go around the hotel and strip the rooms so that the laundry could begin, but the only way they allowed us to do that was if we had a co-op student because they were free, then when are co-op student decided to leave they told us that if we still wanted someone to strip rooms we would have to take time out of each of our rooms with is close to 30 mins per room  so add that up all day each girl and we have to pay her with our money. confusing yes. but isn't crazy?"
bad,Company wants you to work hard and take on extra responsibility but they don't want to compensate you properly
bad,"Responsible for house keeping and maintaining a clean facility, also assisted guess with customer service and room service as needed."
bad,No chances for advancement; very low morale among not only the hourly workers but among Management as well.
bad,The hotel management and ownership are very inconsistent with the business.
bad,"I actually liked working here except that I don not think there is enough emphasis for safety. My bosses were not even sure where they kept weight belts , etc. I was injured three times working here and was made to drive myself to the hospital each time."
bad,great potential to make money. You must be ok with minipulation. The job requires you to minipulate the clients in order to get deals. Not for everyone. If you have any morals or care for others its a rough job. But if u dont thdn theres lots of money to be made
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"it was fun and it is great being part of the team and also working as a team work. Helping the customers what they needed, showing them around the hotel and feel them that they are at home, service them their foods when they are at the hotel."
bad,Wal Mart will take you very far in life if you just stick to one department and grow from there
bad,Just Face - Palm. I've never met a more disrespectful group of people. Infinite work place drama and unprofessionalism. But hey... At least they work with your schedule...
bad,"Didn’t have a contact the whole 3 years I was there, got paid 10.83. Used me all over the hotel but would not make a position or hours for me. Not well managed , short staffed and under appreciated staff covering multiple positions"
bad,The company did not care for the welfare of their staff working 12+ hours per day despite numerous complaints to HR and various management departments.
bad,Housekeepers would fight over carts and how much linen they were able to get we had to purchase our own cleaning supplies. The owner acted like he didn't care about his employers
bad,toxic and unhealthy working environment Ramada hotel Bangor Maine. that's all I have to say about wyndham in bangor very poor management and a lot of stealing going on by staff.
bad,"Poor pay, hard labor, stressful. Very rude owner and daughter , not very nice people to work for. They promise promotions and pay that never happen, cheat and steal housekeepers tips, management as well. Be ware of the Ramada by wyndum in Bettendorf Ia, 52722"
bad,I was under constant scrutiny and never given adequate time to adjust and better myself. I had a class coming up and they refused to work my schedule around it even though they said they would.
bad,"i do not wish to write a review on this company, yes i worked for them through super 8 but anything else would be unfair to say about them at this time"
bad,"Comence a trabajar con la administracion anterior, todos nos sentiamos en familia mucho trabajo pero la Gerente General nos trataba con respeto y cooperaba con el trabajo, nos señalaba los errores pero nos enseñaba la forma correcta de hacerlo para cumplir con los estandares y exigencias de la empresa."
bad,"Clean place to stay, co-workers always willing to help.  Place is up to date with everything.  Owners really care about what customers think of their business."
bad,If manager doesn't finish her job she makes you do it the owner comes to the desk and harasses the guest and then you have to try and calm the guest down after he calls the guest stupid and screams bulls**t to the guest face.
bad,"Try not to lose your soul selling ridiculous time share products that most people will be to clueless to understand how it works or even how to book a vacation. Sales reps who act like they do a bump of coke every hour on the hour. Basically, a big ol [white] boys club."
bad,"I have worked at 4 hotels/motels owned by someone with the last name of Patel.  This place is one of the worst.  The GM is very condescending and dismissive.  The guests are always wrong, and even thrown out if they don't agree with the GM.  There is no communication between management and staff.  Staffed very poorly, no one is professional in their appearance or demeanor.  The facility itself is falling apart and not maintained well.  I have never seen the pool cleaned.  There was virtually no training.  This place is low class."
bad,Working 29 hours a week with 1 day off in order to receive minimum wage. Sometimes my bosses would schedule me to work 11 PM- 9 AM then go back in at 11 AM-4PM for a few days in a row with no break. Cleaning with an old mop and hot water with no cleaning liquids.
bad,Management very unorganized poor communication between staff and management..Will not hire entire staff always bringing in temps never held accountable when shift approaches.
bad,Nice place to work. Know previous owner so hard to see the different. Friendly staff. Nice pool area. Work was always fun something new to do everyday
bad,Horrible place in Bangor Maine. I was ment to do things they should've hired contractors for numerous times and treated like a slave instead of equal
bad,"Another great place to work, wages aren't the greatest but the company has some perks. Some owners aren't the greatest and cause the hotels to fall apart and bad for cutting hours after thanksgiving."
bad,"Management talked badly about every employee using crude and rude language. If you ask for a day off l was yelled at.  Watches the security camera and calls you 20 plus times a day over nothing having to do with bad service. Speaks bad of owners who are very nice, won't follow your schedule just assigns hours out of your scope. My tip is don't work here, never in my work career have I worked with such bad and unorganized management."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job at all. The managers were terrible, the hours were always changing. Nothing was ever done about problems. There was no sense of team or of achievement."
bad,"Management and training need some help. Its hard to find good employees and when you do find them, they don't take you seriously. Which then can look bad on business. If you have a booked hotel make sure you have enough employees to help your quest check-in and make sure they are satisfied with their stay."
bad,"in work place there is no team work,no good management they do what they want do care about us employees, worst place to work, everything that comes out of management mouth is a lie they say they are going to improve in areas and that never happens"
bad,Hard work because the hotel was run down. The rooms had fleas and  so the customers would complain and leave and not come back.
bad,"No room for advancement, poor pay, none flexible hours. I do like my co-workers, and I do like that I get to associate with people daily."
bad,"The duties of being a front desk clerk included checking customers in their rooms, answering phones and making reservations, making sure customers were content with their stay, and nightly audits"
bad,"not an equal employment company at all, other employees of a different race than me accused me of things that were untrue"
bad,Didn't get full time work and they didn't treat anyone right
bad,Not a dream job. This is for someone that needs the money real quick. It is however a nice place to network. Show some that you have outstanding customer service and they you might end up finding a better job somewhere else.
bad,"During a typical week I am calling the police on a guest for disurbing behavior, or I'm running the whole front desk alone while trying to help complaining guest and there every need with the few supplies I have. Since working here I have learned to be nice, but as well as aggressive. I managed to learn how to run the night audit as well as booking a room for guest, and shuting down the fire alarm system. The one thing I have enjoyed working here is the guest that check in. I have heard so many personal stories, and talked to a bunch of colorful people here."
bad,Hard work. Fun at times. Management needs a course in dealing with employees.
bad,"I was not comfortable with a lot of the sales strategies. Compensation was 100% commission, and this was a very tough job. "
bad,"building falling apart, leaks every where, management only cares about bonuses, they repeat the same thing over and over again.  holes in office wall covered with plastic but no heat so you might as well work outside."
bad,The time I worked there in 6 months we went threw 5 general managers the owners liked to belittle all the employees make them not feel appreciated they need to let the managers run it and not interfere
bad,I enjoyed the day to day challenge s and different task .the past however is not nearly sufficient in respect to my skill level and the plethera of different task that I effectively produce on a daily basis.
bad,Only two workers work there me and my sister i work front desk an house keeping. My sister works house keeping. They barely trained me did not show me everything that i needed to know on front desk they do not do taxes right i have nothing against Wyndham or days inn just this days inn is poorly ran
bad,I really liked the job at first but once I found out how it really is run I didn't want to work for a company that doesn't care for its employees. This place was all family so when you had an issue with a person because they weren't doing their job nothing was done about it because of it being family .anyhadto deal with it. I never planned to quit but I couldn't keep doing their job plus mine and seeing no change in the future. They do not give raises
bad,"Would go into work around 8:30 to about 12pm, no later than 4pm."
bad,Holidays and events are horrible. It's always to much laundry and not enough workers. Its hard to do your work and other employees work. The pay is to low for the job you have to perform.
bad,"poor management. demanding management.underpaid. never a set schedule,never praised for doing a good job,never a break,not even to eat free meal but cant eat it     understaffed so you have to do other jobs plus your own."
bad,I'm sure the company as a whole is great but I work for a private franchise. they're the worst people I've ever worked for. There is no life to home balance and they expect me to be on call 24/7. I experienced a death of a close personal friend and they had the nerve to try to reject my request to attend their funeral. I don't think much more needs to be said after that.
bad,"çok yoğun tempo ile yetersiz maaş verilmesi "
bad,The night shift comes with lots of problems with locals. drug activity and prostitution. this makes it hard to determine who to let rent. The manager is always trying to get you to take money under the table and has no respect for women or minorities. No Job security. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers that have an existing relationship with the Manager/owner. The best part about working there was meeting so many new and interesting people from around the world.
bad,"Poor management ,no longer in bussiness.Needed up dating on rooms an guest services lack of employees.Needed to pay more an keep more steady employees."
bad,"From the beginning of my employment time there it has been where management goes for the outward appearance of the person rather than the abilities of the person and how much you suck up to management and not how much you do for them or how much effort you put into your time there. I have been there for a long time and I have been passed over for advancement even though my qualifications, experience, abilities, and skills are much further than the current manager."
bad,"While, cleaning isn’t fun, the main issue is the owners of this particular hotel, Days Inn. Unappreciative and find any reason to let you go after the 3 month probation period."
bad,"A typical day at work us overly stressful, offering no managerial support and regularly understaffed due to budget cuts. The culture needs an overhaul and I must say that there is a clear lack of management. The mounting responsibility does not lend itself to a fair wage at all. Actually this is one of the lowest paying and thankless jobs I have ever witnessed."
bad,"Working at this job was very disheartening, a day at work consisted of maintaining the dining area and cleaning tables as soon as patrons left. Business was slow and the hours worked were minimal."
bad,"As an associate be prepared to be ignored, used, written off and verbally abused by tyrant bosses. The utter lack of respect for anyone under wyndham management is absurd. The easily disregarded customer needs are countless. This company does not care about there customers just the money in there pockets."
bad,"i like working there its just that people at the job think they can abuse their power and that is how it is at that hotel,and they had me doing alot of things for low pay as well like i was front desk,housemen,and also a housekeeper,and a maintainece and would not getr paid for the different jobs that i have did"
bad,Everyone only cares about themselves. Management is only there to receive a paycheck. They only advance there friends the qualified aren’t a priority. This company does not give you the tools tone successful. If you are not of a certain characteristic you will be ostracized.
bad,"It's so so. Only thing is that they will send you a w-2 but won't send your proof of employment to the IRS,  then what happens is the IRS does a audit on you while having you jump through hoops to provide extra info before they charge you with tax fraud then wait 9months after you file to receive your refund. Each tax year will me hard because of super 8"
bad,"i enjoy housekeeping.but $7.25 an hour for my experience plus doing 20 rooms a day with no elevators,and rooms being outside  and just a lack of appreciation for his employees.at all times you should appreciate your employees.this property is individually owned."
bad,not good at all they do not care about guest satisfaction. Or their employees. There is no job security he is always looking to replace you with whoever will take less money
bad,"Over time unpaid (you gotta work for free)."
bad,"Really enjoyed being around our guest hearing the great comments you heard, How well you did your job, by the cleanness of your area you worked.  Needed more team worker working together."
bad,"By far the worst job I have ever had. Workers that steal, lie, and never show up are rewarded and the ones that come to work to do their job the right way are punished. Management is a joke. There is no such thing as an ""open door policy"". You will be reprimanded for anything you do that involves HR. It's a terrible place to work for. The commission is only great if management likes you and places you in a high volume area. Otherwise, you're doomed to make minimum wage. Whataburger treats their employees better. Just don't do it."
bad,"short staffed, not any hours, not enough pay. Dealing with grumpy customers and sometimes the coworkers are in bad mood. running short on things . Most enjoyable is seeing smile on customers face helping them"
bad,"typical day at work was stressful, managers/supervisors would call/text me at all hours of day or night when I was off the clock.  "
bad,"Rather not make a negative review. I would keep looking if I were you. Just that simple. If you want a team player environment, this is not the job. Very micro-managed."
bad,"I will never work for this company again. I have worked for 2 years 7 days a week, no benefits, no vacation, no raise. I have given the management a schedule of days I can and cannot work and they throw it away"
bad,During my stay at this job I learned how to use synexus system . My co-workers and I have great teamwork skills. In my opinion the manager needs more communication skills
bad,The day start out with checking guest out from previous night. Making reservations for guests as well as checking guest in and out of the motel.Working with friendly co workers everyone got along. The hardest part of the job is having that one dissatisfied guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet a variety of people from all walks of life
bad,"The first week working at Baymont was stressful. I was getting told two different things when cleaning the rooms. For example, one of the trainers told me I had to clean the carpet with a cloth then one day the Manager said I didn't have too. The staff had a of of drama and would talk nasty. No one was organized, the laundry lady was too busy flirting with one staff member and caused to me to get off of work late. Later that day I quit."
bad,Always busy no time to take a break the service wasn't always what I expected it to be. it felt like some employees would get more than others. Co works would try and walk over you when they had the chance.
bad,Would like at least 20 hrs a week.. I usually  get 15 hrs a week.. Work schedule is for all employees to call every morning to find out who works.. Normally only 2 out of 6 employees  work each day during week.. All employees is to required to work every week end.
bad,AL ways look for positive things in your life. Accept Challenges be more professional no matter what stops you.Working with best companies so far some time you feel like others are not that professionals and compatible in business. i like being myself and give my 110% but as long as your management have faith in you.
bad,"Owner was a major control freak, calling every hour to ask if everything was ok. No security. You are the only one working your shift. Got very lonely and at night could be a little scary given the area. "
bad,"Working there I was disrespected, talked to like a child. They did not value their employees. I will not be working there again."
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs Ive ever had possibly the worst.  trying my hardest to find another job"
bad,"The job is easy but the management is terrible. Being a front desk clerk, does not include being a maintenance person. When I accepted the job, I was told I would be expected to run the front desk, but after I took the job, I was told I had to clean the pool, put vents back on the side of the building and fix various items around the complex. On top  of that they wanted me to work up to twelve hours a day and not pay any overtime pay, I was not on salary, I was paid hourly.  They did not offer and benefits at all. The best part of the job was the co-workers and the customers."
bad,"I would still be here, however I was not able to work the audit shift any longer and I was always stuck working it due to current employees not showing up or calling off, being as though i was the manager i had to cover."
bad,I spent most of my time cleaning up after the manager. I worked 7 days a week more often than not and rarely got paid for my overtime.
bad,"N/A"
bad,My coworkers were nice people. But it was difficult to go to work in Little Rock from Conway. The pay was only the minimum wage. I was taking the job as a practice before entering the competing world.
bad,Typical day at work consisted of cleaning motel rooms and keeping up with the laundry. I learned to appreciate the management department in the company you work for. My co-workers were lazy and unpleasant. The hardest part of the job was lugging the linens up two flights of stairs. The most enjoyable part of the job was being alone to work.
bad,Not a good place to work. no room for advancement. They over work you. Not lunch. Horrible experience. I will never work for this company again. and people were quitting from left to right
bad,"register and take reservations for guests. register walk ins. complete balance of credit card reconciliations, prepare manual reports for night audit.  help other workers with their work that could not get done during the day. management was pretty much non-existent. "
bad,This in general was a terrible place to work. It seemed as though working night shift made you about as good as dirt with very little pay if the checks were done correctly.
bad,"During a day of work at the front desk included cooking breakfast, cleaning and folding laundry, answering multiple line phone, making reservations, providing customer service, and managing any inconvience. I learned how to deal with the unexpected and prepare for a full house. Management was terrible. I didnt know when I was to work till the eight o'clock the night before. The owners were very unorangized and rude, My co-workers were nice but some could speak little to no english. The hardest part of the job was the odd schedule. Some days I would work nights then be called in at eleven the next morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was the please customers."
bad,"Typical day included cleaning mess, while trying to make the place look decent with ratty towels and sheets."
bad,"Wonderful environment, great people, hard work. lots of advancement oppertunities."
bad,So many things I tried and wanted to discuss and voice my opinions and matters as an employee and it seemed just to be a waste of time and energy.It was only there way or your opinion didn't matter and it was treated more of an abled body to fulfill a position that needed to keep the company reviews up and never appreciated by the manager.Definatly appreciated by customers and general manager though.
bad,Difficult place to work everyday and learn more about the way they want you to do things. No routine. Favoritism definitely exists there. New people do not last there. It’s like they use you for a bit for there VP visits and VIP tours then stop appreciating there staff.
bad,"A sweatshop in corporate , decisions by people who don't plan, some people are nice. some departments are happier places. many days it is cirucs, lots of layoffs."
bad,Poor management very rude manager HR department doesn't help with the situation they gossip a lot talk down to employees favoritism discriminatory told african American  unorganized .Cross training at this company will not get an raise
bad,Management does not really manage and it takes up a lot of time. There are no repercussions for people being late and the job culture is that of unorganization.
bad,The current site needs a lot of changes to be successful. The clients that are seen aren't always what they make it seem to be. Turn over is very high and the culture is bad as far as trust is concerned. Pay is great when you can get paid. The hardest part of the job is when the things you can't control affects your sales. Its very hard to sell to a homeless person.
bad,It not the best job it a lot of drama we only have 4 housekeeper everyone quitting people don't clean right you have to go behind others and clean they rooms if they don't do them
bad,She acts as if she is a nice lady at first but she really just a good actor. She doesn't know the first thing about running a business and she is extremely rude.
bad,You work alone and you dont get help or have any support so when it's busy you run around bring people things trying to get the phone booking in people doing reports making breakfast your always on the go and you can't mess up or keep people waiting it's hard work and can be very rewarding in tips youlllearnreally fast
bad,"The people you work with are like family, everything else isn’t worth it. Upper management couldn’t care less about their employees. The hotel itself is outdated."
bad,"Great learning experience, working here can make you lose hope in humanity. There's several meetings a day and you are taught that no matter what people say they are lying and trick them by any and all means into buying a timeshare that they really can't afford."
bad,A full time job that is this easy is hard to find. I worked for three years and begged for a ten cent hourly rate increase. I'm no better than the person who now has my job. I'd more happily find better pay somewhere else than work for $7.25 an hour. My manger actually said he would pay me less if he legally get away with it.
bad,"The Wyndham itself is a great company, however once the hotel no longer used the Wyndham that's when things begin to go down hill where you could see the decline."
bad,What’s an OK place to work app not something I really enjoyed I prefer the medical profession did not pay well at all scheduling was posted on Sundays and your work week started on Monday call usually they would change your time
bad,Not the place you'd want to work at because of the poor management! Very unprofessional no doubt! Lots of favoritism and discrimination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,training was rushed and did not prepare me for the job. Assistance was missing from the floor. Processes were done in triplicate. Phone system dropped calls. Too many passwords which did not work on a daily basis. systems constantly shut down.
bad,"First two years working there , were great , till they know you as an ""excellent"" worker they throw more to your work load for your basic minimum wage."
bad,"It was a good job if you like working alone, in a fast pace environment.While working there I definitely learned time management, which was needed to finish your rooms."
bad,Working the overnight shift isn't hard. Best if you're just looking for something to do overnight. Make yourself clear about your hours and what you are expecting out of the job so there will be no further misunderstandings.
bad,typical day consisted of mowing the lawn and or cutting down trees as needed. also consist of setting up banquets and tearing down tables. afterwards would wash all dishes until finished but no overtime was given.
bad,"Not a hard job, but back to back calls with only 2 short breas and a short half hour lunch and you can't be 5 seconds late.  No relief from the stress, just do better next time.  I liked my supervisor and my fellow employees, but this super stressful job which included selling products that I think should have been free was not for me.  I raised six kids and I would do that again before I'd work in another call center"
bad,"Low pay, bad training, low moral, limited to no over time opportunities. You can work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week and still not be able to make your ends meet. Promotions are non-existent if you're not kissing behind. Don't be late or you will get an occurrence that fall off every six months! if you get three you get put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)"
bad,"No respect, lying to applicants, unhappy customers because of lies and misleading information. Making agents job more difficult. Attendance policy is unforgiving. Pay is pathetic. Supervisors unhelpful .. no advsncement."
bad,Management was never on site or available for assistance unless to dictate regulations and policies to be carried out. Manager would ignore calls and emails regarding employee misconduct.
bad,"I liked working at the hotel  mainly because of the guest. I'm a people person and like meeting new people. The owners/management of the hotel were horrible. Work you to death and only get paid 4.00 a room. Didn't want to give days off. Would work two weeks or more before getting a day off. No insurance, no overtime pay, no vacation, and no raises."
bad,"This job seemed like an absolute dream at first, everybody was welcoming and willing to help. Then I guess my grace period was up. The CMA's and CMA supervisors were wonderful however my supervisor was not all I thought. I was having to preform duties outside my job title, things that I was not even allowed to be doing. I had to make sure people didn't see me pulling deposits from a secured area that I technically should not have been in. I was hired under the impression that in my down time I was there to assist, and I'm fine with that... but assist here an there turned into doing half of my supervisors job on top of my own job. I would be made to feel guilty when I didn't have time to get everything done. Made to feel guilty for running a few minutes late when my supervisor was on her own schedule, showing up and leaving for work whenever she wanted and writing her time in. Leaving to run personal errands on the clock. the pay was not nearly as much as the work was. I was blamed for mistakes made that I had to keep checking to see if I made because I found that 90% of the time the mistake wasn't mine but was someone else's and nothing was said when I brought it up. I felt that I couldn't ask questions because it seemed if I didn't get it quick enough my supervisor got impatient. All and all I truly just wouldn't recommend it. I'm just not good at dealing with that kind of stuff, I believe in equality and working just as hard as your employees when you are a supervisor. The CMA supervisors absolutely did, just not the administrative side."
bad,"Sales environment is wild, loud and too pushy, down right offensive to potential clients. There was a shouting match that ensued after a client refused to purchase TimeShare. Shouting should never be acceptable."
bad,"The manager was rarely there, most of the time a guest had an issue and wanted to contact a manager, one was never available. The hours are great in the beginning until they decide to cut them down without a reason. The job hours aren't the best and is a little hard to balance out with a normal life w/ children."
bad,"Don't work here if you have a second job,children, or even a job!! They will NOT work with you for availability!!! And will intentionally try to make you dependent on Wyndham. They will tell you they have to have all associates on rotating schedules but other departments don't. VERY VERY high turnover rate. Only work temporarily if needed (summer season or holidays) not for a career."
bad,"Its an ok job just starting out in the field of hospitality, owners were very reckless at this location. The owners wanted us to charge more for the rooms that werent even up to par."
bad,"My manager was having an affair w the director. Very uncomfortable situation. People getting written up and suspended for odd things. If the manager didn't like you she would fabricate issues in order to make you look bad. Very hostile and condescending attitudes from trainers and managers. Very unprofessional. Hours were much longer than I was told and I was also expected to work every holiday, which was not disclosed through the hiring process."
bad,I worked for a wyndham hotel for 2 years and the management was the worst of any place i've ever worked. The shuttle van was constantly breaking down as well as the elevator. My manager would talk negatively about his employee's and his guests behind their back and would do nothing about problems regarding the hotel or employees. Would not ever stay at the hotel i worked.
bad,"Worked overnights- 24 hr shifts for flat rate of $120 a day. Could not have a home life due to always being ""on-call"". They refused to hire another front desk person to split the work with. Would work 3 or more days at hotel, 24 hour shifts, it was like I lived on property. Paid minimum wage, no raise options or advancement options. Had to do the jobs of housekeeping and maintenance as well. Most enjoyable part of the job was hotel discounts."
bad,"Worked their (Briefly) for about 3 months and man oh man, Manager did not properly train anyone, Employee's were very much rude and the Hotel was not properly maintained and would essentially be falling apart. Customers would come down about pets being in NON-PET rooms, Cigarettes littered the rooms and rooms would have mold in them. Overall, for my experience I didn't enjoy it, others will have their view, but for me it was not."
bad,"soon as you go in straight to work a very good company to work for"
bad,"I worked here in high school, they did an awesome job of working around my schedule for school, prom, and graduation, I DO think they could do something about some employees being racist and sexist against people."
bad,"Poor ownership, management,was taken advantage of my time and hours i put in over the summer working 65 70 hours a week all summer long . everything was in poor shape when i started at the hotel. Very poor service everywhere in the building. The Vip that hired me to try to revamp the food and beverage, Was forced to resign. Very sad Place !!!!"
bad,"It's like being on the Titanic. The people are great, the atmosphere is amazing, but in the end, you're still on a sinking ship."
bad,"As a contractor your input is not valued much.  There seems to be a rather large restructuring so your management changes often.  Many tasks and/or departments are outsourced, job prospect low."
bad,maybe if i was in a different location it would be great but this hotel does not offer benefits and the general manager is not what a general manager suppose to be. i love this job because i love dealing with people the downside for the job is dealing with rude guest but you still have to keep a smile on your face.
bad,To be fair this hotel was franchised to someone who cared nothing about his employees or his customers but the job and work environment were terrible
bad,"Not given the supplies needed to do the job."
bad,"I went in with high expectations and promises of advancement, but was stymied at every turn. Almost everyone under 30 and with little or no experience were promoted time and again over me. I don't think it indicative of the entire company, just the one property."
bad,Mainly high school employees. The owner was never around to help fix problems.  Employees were not able to get problems fixed in an efficient time for customers.  Fun place to work and great food.
bad,The hardest part of the job was co workers were committing fraud and management knew and did nothing about it!
bad,"I do not like being employed at Days Inn because it's too quiet. I like interacting with people and building bond between co-workers. However, at Days Inn, I am by myself for eight hours with about two guests per day. There isn't any room for advansment or raises. I'm looking for a place where I can apply myself and actually work."
bad,"I decided I would have appreciated it greatly if someone had made a review for me to read when I was looking into this position as a Community Marketing Agent. I worked for them for a year, ending June 2013. I am going to be straightforward. "
bad,This was my first hotel job. I'm taking what I learn here to apply to better jobs.
bad,"I did every thing from washing linnen to cleaning rooms, to cleaning front main commen area."
bad,This is not a reputable line of work. this job requires a great amount of dishonesty and immoral behavior to make any money and I would not recommend it unless you are this type of person.
bad,"i learned a lot from the old chef, cooking different styles and food creations."
bad,"Work with my company was pretty good until new management came in , horrible experience"
bad,"""its not for everyone"" is what they will tell you. They couldnt be more accurate. It is a cut-throat ""dont hit your numbers and your done"" ...heck hit your numbers, and you still might be done. With ties to upper management I saw it all....the twists, the lies, the business practices.... Now the resort side / hospitality might be ok, stay away from sales and marketing unless you can sell your soul and be a blood-hound. More power to you if you can, but its not for me!"
bad,"Small company not qualified to build $10,000,000.00 project."
bad,"Once I arrive at work, I would check the computer to see the occupancy. Check the breakfast room, and check to make sure all the doors are locked. I work alone, so I would sit around in silence awaitng for someone to check in or someone to call and make a reservation. Not a fun working environment, but very laid back."
bad,This job was not so fun. The hours were good but for each room i cleaned i got paid 3.25 that was not fair. The managers are nice and understanding but the pay is not fun.
bad,I wouldnt work there if i didnt have to they always had trouble weith checks and cops and the bounced alot of the payroll checks.plus they was always employee drama
bad,I wouldn't recommend getting too comfortable in this job. The management doesn't care if you are sick at work or even if you are a great or poor employee. You are completely disposable.
bad,Great way to get started in the hotel industry. You will learn to work with a variety of people and  staff. Work environment is nice and everyone work together.
bad,"My manager that hired me was very professional, but other employees were not, I did any and everything she asked , it was sad for me cause when she retired , thats when I lost my job . The  hotel is going down , the owners don't want to make any repairs.."
bad,If your not making money the company doesn't care about you even if your in administration which helps the whole process. Horrible hours no flexible schedule
bad,"Every floor seemed to have fun except for the HR department. You really are walking on eggshells when working at the corporate office. Working at the resorts is less stressful. For HR ""managers"" its a joke, they just put in requests online for everything and another team handles it.The ""discounts"" they offer are a joke, you can get a better discount on Expedia. Only pro is leaving early on holidays."
bad,I learn to pay attention to detail manage my time properly and efficiently. How to spot any damage in a room how to clean and make beds in rooms. Clean bathrooms put supply that is need in room.Management was not great. Did not have organization..
bad,"Could be a good job, but there is a strong lack of training and assistance with management after first 30 days, and in closing. They pick their favorites and ignore and avoid helping others so that you will fail. A very diverse company on some areas, but a strong lack of equality and integrity in others."
bad,Was told I would be making $25-$55 an hour I make $7.75 an hour although its commission based you never get the opportunity to make the commission unless you've been working here more than a year currently only 2 employees have worked here for an extended time the other 15 are brand new and come in and leave constantly dont waste your time they make you think you'll make good money but never give you the chance dont waste your time digging yourself into a financial hole.
bad,"Overall my experience there was highlighted by my supervisor constantly making me feel useless. I wasnt trained well. She was cruel and disrespectful towards me. One time she made me reclean an entire bathroom because she found a hair (i swear it was hers placed there intentionally) and another time there was a shadow in the tub. A shadow. After cleaning it again, I had to ask her for a flashlight to prove that the tub was clean so she'd see the shadow disappear in the light. It was rediculous. I complained in tears to our manager about her many ways of mistreating me but it didn't resolve. I wasn't treated well and I really tried my best. The other staff were okay but i was never a guest there so I'm not sure how customers felt about the hotel. I'd get in trouble for just speaking with them casually anyway. There was no hope for me there. I dreaded it."
bad,"While there is a small amount of potential to be successful it is exactly that; SMALL.  No room to grow and no real management. The VP was fired as was the DOS while I was their and as far as I am aware from friends who still work there, they have not been replaced.  The work expectations are insanely unreal, and the pathetic semblance of ""management"" there is plays favorites and will FIRE STAFF ON A WHIM."
bad,"You can achieve raises, so people stay, but it doesn't serve you once you leave. Just use it as a stepping stone, acquire your own transferable skills."
bad,False promises and poor VP leadership. Lack of support and proper training. Deceptive sales practices endorsed but hidden by VP. VP not qualified for the position.
bad,"Horrible pay (minimum wage) to do everything under the sun and let’s not forget about the pimps, crackheads, and drug dealers that constantly rent out the rooms. I didn’t feel safe working here and the manger knew about the activities and purposefully turned a blind eye."
bad,This Days Inn tried to sell itself as a family brand. This particular hotel was not in the best of neighborhoods and we frequently has issues with drugs and prostitution. I and other staff made suggestions to how we could stop it but the management did not seem to care.
bad,I was suppose to be trained by a female that was very negative. Information i was provided was always incorrect.  I was asked everyday to borrow money from one of the other employees. The position was perfect but the people surrounding the  intimidate position were awful and hateful..
bad,"i would never work at this place again. not my ideal, friendly work place. ive done housekeeping for a long time and this place was a joke! Not dealing with certain situations made me leave. i could not handle the way management works and how they treat their employees."
bad,"It was a fun job to have, but I love the front desk life so it's just my opinion. If you enjoy the hotel life, apply. discounts apply and if you are a people person its just the job for you."
bad,"Very little appreciation. Wouldn't think twice about keeping us cleani g from 8am to 11pm midnight, and then give a disciplinary action for coming in a few minutes late or calling out of work. We worked like this for literally years because of harsh management and high standards it was hard to keep a full staff. We did still keep an extremely high standards and passed all the company's harsh as audits. So, to thank us for all our hard work we all got the shaft, yes they fired us, management's phony tears and all, so that they could outsource our jobs to an even less caring, more abusive company than even they were. Thankless job with no hope of ever advancing unless you are in good with manager(s)"
bad,"Initially I trained at the sale of timeshare properties during the peak season. This taught me to work with different personalities and be flexible with my schedule.  Then, during the winter months, I moved into the marketing side of the business where it was my responsibility to go out into the field and book tours."
bad,"I had a horrible experience at this place. The manager was inappropriate, used foul language,  and took poor care of the property. keys were constantly an issue."
bad,"Starting your day consist of cleaning restaurant, setting up your station and helping out. Usually managers just sit back and only come out when things are getting crazy. Oer all the severs and server assistants are super friendly and great coworkers."
bad,"Management could careless about their employees. The systems are very old, and consistently shut down. The call queue is always extremely high. There is a lot of favoritism as well. The turnover is ridiculous, new people are in and out. There is no room to move up the company. One positive thing about this job, would be if you meet your goal you do get a nice commission check. Overall, I would not recommend this job to someone."
bad,"A typical day here was stressful, you cleaned 20 to 30 rooms a day sometimes and the pay sucks. You get fussed at if it takes you to long and you could help others but when you needed help you didnt get any."
bad,"the guests were wonderful, I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them to have the best experience they could. I learned that upper management did not like to pay their help, therefore  they ended up with a lot of kids right out of high school that didn't really want to work. Unfortunately in the short time I worked here we had 3 different managers, and it was very confusing trying to take orders from OUR hotel manager, and the West Branch hotel manager. I felt that the Guests were suffering because of it and I quit this job."
bad,Was a good job but the owner of the hotels that i worked for was not a good owner and did not care about his employees.he wanted his employees to not have a life outside of work. He did teach me how to run a hotel and how not to treat my employees.
bad,"This place was, umm, not that great. I usually worked the breakfast shift, and was told to chat with everyone while they ate, and also told to ask everyone what room they slept in. I considered it an invasion of their privacy, so I wouldn't do it."
bad,"I had a terrible time at wyndham El paso airport the management was terrible and very unprofessional there was no room for advancement, there was no sense of a team ."
bad,"You start your day training with your team.  Your manager is either going to congratulate the team on the previous days sales or your're going to get reamed for lack of sales. You literally sit in a room with your team and manager until he or she is done berating everyone.  I've been a top producer for over a year.  However, the lack of qualified customers coming in for the past two months has resulted in an overall decline in business.  Therefore, the opportunity is not here this time of year.  "
bad,"Very friendly co workers who will assist you in any way they can."
bad,"This company does not provide opportunity for internal growth. The work environment is not positive, there are a lot of people that have been there many years and are very unhappy and can't seem to move."
bad,"As a house keeper for a hotel you have to clean so many rooms by a certain time so the new people who are staying have their rooms ready for them by time they check in.  Its under new management so I do not know anything out them.  Hardest part of job is having to carry all of your linen up stairs, no elevators.  Enjoyed most was being able to keep what ever we found left in the room if it was under $10."
bad,I worked there a few years ago. The left hand didnt know what the right hand was doing. Stress level was thru the roof . Management had their proteges that could not do any wrong. Job training was poor. Had to work extra because people in orher departments constantly screwed up. I would rather clean public restrooms than work there again.
bad,I did not really enjoy working in this establishment. I felt like I didn't fit in and I held no contribution. I stayed in the hotel there in the staff accommodation and it was rather small. Luckily I wasn't too far away from family.
bad,"Fun to go to work at a matured atmosphere . Supervisor was caring. Enjoyed working hard to get quotas completed."
bad,"I loved this job however, the money just wasn't enough for the drive down.  I had a lot of responsibilities which I handled very well.  I did work 24 hours a day due to issues that would arise at the property.  I did not get paid for the hours I worked from home and the salary they were offering was ridiculously low for the amount of time I would be needed.  Overall if I could have made more money and was allowed an assistant I would still be working there."
bad,"the workplace was very productive, could take a break when needed and manager worked around our schedules as needed. small work environment."
bad,"Simply put, if you are not part of sales you are second rate.  There is a lot of issues with leadership and HR where priorities are questionable.  But if you like an environment where you understand this type of leadership you can do very well."
bad,This is just a job. Not what a person would stay long term. Management horrible. Employees just run over him.
bad,The general manager that managed the hotel when i was there was all about who she could be friends with. If she didn't like you then you got the hours you weren't originally hired for.
bad,"Sit around all day answer calls and let people in"
bad,"clean, dust, vaccuum, wipe down mirrors, clean the washrooms, clean the breakfast area , and keep rooms ready for room rentals"
bad,"I have worked her for over a year and there has rarely been an onsite manager on staff and when we did have on they didn't last very long. They are severely understaffed in all areas. The front desk is responsible for laundry and any and all maintenance issues that arise. They also act as breakfast attendant during first shift, and service the pool during second. Housekeeping has always been an issue and it causes constant complaints. The schedule is very accommodating and the owners are very nice. This business has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it feels like no one is willing to improve it."
bad,i experince stocking and i dont interest with that job cause i dont match it ...
bad,"I have enjoyed my time at working with he hotel. It has previously been working for me simply because of scheduling and part time was all I really needed,  as time passes its time to move forward with life the pay is minimum wage with no benefits or possibility of advancement."
bad,This was a time share sales position. It is definitely not for everyone. There was alot of arrogance on the floor among the management. You gave tours of the resort in hopes that you could sell them on buying vacation ownership. Co workers on my team were great. Hardest part of the job was the sales pressure they expected you to put on people as well as the urgency to get them to buy. There was alot of just sitting around and waiting your turn for a tour. Not a whole lot of this job was enjoyable.
bad,I took this job thinking it was a good strong company . WOW was i wroung. From the first day it was shaky i am glad I moved on and will not go back
bad,Provided above and beyond exceptional customer service to all owners.
bad,Very hard employer to strike a good work-life balance. Sacrificing much of your personal life is almost expected and required. I missed my grandmothers funeral because of them. Management is often rude or unforgiving from the very top down. Human Resources works with management to stay on their side on issues. They will low-ball you on salary and expect you to take a lower salary because they give health benefits that you have to contribute to every paycheck. You can get them to compromise after much back and forth.
bad,This review is based upon one of Wyndham's branch offices. Experiences at the main corporate office may be completely different.
bad,"I only worked there for 3 months and during that time I learned a lot about being in hospitality. The position itself was great, I enjoyed greeting the guests and check-ins were fun. However, the owner of the complex was strict and not very friendly. I won't work for a company that is family owned ever again, unless they are fair minded and friendly."
bad,"Depending on any particular day, you can be the hero of the day or the victim of management. Management is not particular on giving positive feedback to employees."
bad,"Working for the Super 8 Motel is something akin to slavery. Low pay, almost no opportunities for advancement, no benefits and very little respect for their employees as human beings."
bad,"I do not enjoy working for this company anymore because they don’t pay enough the owners are very rude, they do not respect their employees! They don’t give raises NEVER, they don’t have any accommodations for the full time employees nor do they have any benefits no matter how long you been there"
bad,"The manager manipulates staff with hours. Managment uses the benefits to make us work more shifts. Constant fear of being held at, or corrected in public."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed my immediate team during my time at Wyndham. Outside of that, I was generally uninspired, confused by the brand and what it offered, felt like it was most important to ""make a sale"" (by the organization) rather than correct and provide an amazing consumer experience, and was completely unimpressed by leadership (or lack of). There was also a noticeable lack of skillsets by many people within the area of the organization where I needed support and to drive forward to meet the competition."
bad,I like the laid back and it’s a good Atmosphere. In about to just get my day started and there is Minimum Supervision everyone works at their on Pace and does their own job
bad,Communication between departments seemed to be a real issue.  There were units I would try to inspect only to learn they were not ready despite a specific time they had to be done.  Use of own vehicle and no gas reimbursement.  Poorly managed for the volume expectations
bad,I work there 4 years and only made $8.75 an hour. Also was promised a front office manager position 4 times never got it. But did do the front office manager duties for 2 years without the pay. Then hotel was sold and they couldn't afford to pay me any more so got let go. My GM was great to work with I have no real complaints there. She was great.
bad,Owner unprofessional and doesn't want to pay theifery was an issue working there and it was management taking in bulk breakfast supplies when I told the owner they said maybe I was doing this umm no the reason I addressed this is because I don't like stealing and I was in charge of stocking breakfast and noticed things were missing it was ridiculous
bad,Not a flexible schedule at all.  Was stuck in a very small office with two other co-workers.  One of which was not professional at all. I  ended up quoting because of this individual.
bad,"I was lied to about how MUCH over flow there was for tours every day, how are you supposed to sell to owners or prospective owners when you have no owners? A lot of deceptive and dishonest selling techniques used to make the customer believe they’ll never have the same opportunity again. Commission pay outs were never on time and not as much as they were supposed to be."
bad,A hostile environment is one that has horrible negativity and you are treated literally as a number. One day you are recognized by everyone a week later you look like a stranger. Literally a job that I don't recommend to anyone.
bad,"I worked only 2 years but they are not strong as choice hotels or Best Western. I don't' remember too much about Wybndham, maybe I needed more time to know them a little bit more."
bad,"It's easy to get in when they're short on housekeepers, but once you're there you're pretty much an outcast. They don't like to keep people they don't know outside of work, and if they're going to fire you they try to do it in an unorthodox way that doesn't make them look like the bad guy to other employers."
bad,Management favors employees they choose favorites your hours get cut for no reason management sucks an are mean to employees too much gossip as well it's horrible
bad,Great job when you love people however co workers didn’t do their share of daily tasks and I had to do them all. Very frustrated and was told I would be assistant manager and it was given to another employee. No accountability or communication
bad,"The woman were nice at first, then turned real snooty, everyone was very very picky about how things were done.  Hard to do with so little employees. The work is extremely hard on your back and you have to stay on your feet and going otherwise they will fire you. Hard to keep up."
bad,"management was poor, and treated you unfairly. They were unprofessional and skipped around requirements of themselves within the law at their hotel. Cut corners anywhere they could."
bad,"For a company that makes acquisitions its primary focus, there is a horrifying lack of communication. No one seems to know what is going on at any given moment."
bad,"It use to be a great environment, management was good for the most part. It started going downhill after management changed. Employee turnover is now frequent which is not good. More and more employees who have been there years are now moving on due to many problems such as: our health insurance is now trash (deductible plan), management doesn’t really care about employees (no breaks, leave you to figure things out on your own when you really need them, they’ll listen to suggestions but don’t expect anything to come out of it), pay is awful for what the front desk has to deal with, advancement opportunities are slim to none, scheduling is terrible and Inconsistent, there’s no work/life balance. it’s turned into a toxic environment. "
bad,Good seasonal job for the high school or college student. It was fun yet very stressful because every homeowner in the community was a manager. Management changed hands often.
bad,Although Wyndham compensated well - the work/life balance was non-existent and I found myself burnt after only two years of employment.  Competitive work environment.
bad,"After being employed with loyalty with the copy , I had finally gotten over not given any chance to move up in position or become full time . The fact they would give more then equivalent amount of work Id be asked to do countless times. Had unprofessional staff and management"
bad,Had a lot of responsibilities.  Was at the same pay rate for several years.  No insurance or paid vacation available.  Manager was nice but was not professional in the field.
bad,this was a nice job with flexible schedule that changed every week if I needed a day off I could always trade with someone else. the staff was great to work with. I have made friends with them while employed there.
bad,"I learned a lot working at Steamboat Resorts. I had very little real life, hands on experience before working here and now I have the skills to land me a fantastic job."
bad,"The Stress level ranked an all time High."
bad,"I would say the pay rate here was unfair. $25 per room which I wouldn't say is a room more like 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen stocked with dishes, 2 bathrooms and a jacuzzi all had to be cleaned in 1 hour. Then some days I was scheduled 1 room to clean and I wouldn't get home from work till 7/8:00pm so I wouldn't recommend anyone that doesn't own a vehicle to work here. There is a van that takes you there and back but there Is also 8 other people getting picked up and dropped off and the bus doesn't leave till the last person is done with all their rooms. So you can be there to clean 1 room and be done by 11am but wont get home till 8:00pm I forgot to mention if you live in Springfield, its also a 2 hour drive."
bad,I worked in the sales department. The other employees lie cheat and steal to survive! When I first started I was lied to about the training I would recieve.
bad,poor work environment and compensationfor work and hours required. verystressfull and not a family friendly environment to work in. would not recommend
bad,they have ownership of the place so its depend what you got from your owner of the place. that's way its hard to say they have each place with same environment.
bad,"normal day was waiting for guest to leave, cleaning out their rooms, changing bed sheets, and preparing them for next guest. job just wasn't for me. not a bad place to work but not desirable either"
bad,There was a constant revolving door.  The office space was terrible.  The hardest part of my job was working with cut throat management.  I learned that I do not want to work for another hotel nor do I want to work with people that aren't able to speak good english; it's a hassle.
bad,"A typical day at work would be cleaning up to 25 rooms either in teams of 2-3 or by yourself on top of maintaining the pool area, folding laundry, vacuuming the hallways and entry way. I learned how to clean a hotel room while being under a lot of stress and pressure. The management could've been more understanding. The workplace culture was rather tense. The hardest part of the job was cleaning a room with two queen-sized beds and bathroom by yourself in 20 minutes or less. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I would work with."
bad,They say that Wyndham is one big family. And that Count on Me! is of utmost importance. But you cannot count on management. Ever. Would never recommend this company.
bad,"Worked there for 1 year. The worst job I ever had. CMA (Community Marketing Agent). In other words, flag down & harass couples to attend a timeshare sales presentation. They want you to lie to the people & say it is a 90 minute presentation when it is a minimum of 3 hours+. You are expected to work in adverse weather, HOT, COLD!!! Work nights, weekends, & holidays!!!! Forget about your family!!!"
bad,Timeshare used to be a good company but now is not so good. Poor management and desperate hiring of under qualified associates is all Wyndham is about.
bad,"Chew them up and spit them out sales approach relying heavily on sheer volume to make numbers. Newer agents get the worst tours, making it difficult advance. On the upside, there is constant sales training which definitely helps those new to sales develop the necessary skills and tools."
bad,Was a good job loved working here restaurant was closed down so i lost my job although pay was not much i recieved tips and worked as a dishwasher at night or days that i was not waitressing or hostessing
bad,"Don't expect upper level management to change, extremely micromanaged. Raises are very minimal and employees are not appreciated for their hard work. I would highly recommend working somewhere else."
bad,"I assume this about working for Ramada? "
bad,Got along great with customers and learned that I could advance in my position by working hard . Management wasn't very good. My co-workers were okay for the most part. The hardest part of my job was putting days off in months in advance and getting them okays for them and then management turning around and saying that I shouldn't take those times off and that they were mad at me. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was working with the guests.
bad,Has all the rewards and risks of timeshare.  Travel benefits for employees represent the greatest benefit; and I have had the opportunity to travel to many great places.
bad,"making sure guest were getting professional service at all times"
bad,"This is a company that has grown tremendously over the last 10 years.  Unfortunately, mid level  management and above is determined by who you know not what you now.  Especially in the Corporate office of Las Vegas.  I have watch over the last decade friends get promotions rather then the best qualified individual.  Please do not let their ""count on me""  slogan fool you job title is everything. Those below manager are not worthy."
bad,"Really fast paced environment. Management is ok, but not very understanding when emergencies occur. Co-workers were good, lots of team work. Liked meeting new people from countries overseas."
bad,Working in a Call Center is always challenging but can also teach you a lot about human beings.  Each day was something different.  The hardest part of the job was the different personalities of the members you worked with.
bad,"owner is not very nice with employees and staff, makes us go in height situations that are truly unsafe pay was ok and got hurt on job and was very nasty and wanted to fire me after not very proffesional"
bad,Paid the bills when I needed work.  Taught me to multi-task and still keep the hotel desk running smoothly.  The managers were family members of the owner who had no idea how to run a hotel...but they did work very hard to keep the hotel in operation.
bad,Co workers were extremely helpful but management didn't understand our workload.  We were able to rely on each other to be productive and to keep up with the workload.
bad,Reported to work on time in proper uniform and ready to work.Job was to clean rooms in timely manor following the guidlines. Recived an average of 15 rooms a day job was to strip clean and prepare room in professional fashion in timely within 32minutes of time. Report clean rooms affter the job was completed. Also had to give customer service to theguest on the floor while completimg the task
bad,I never like to say anything bad about a job but this job did not give me any job security I worked 3rd shift doing night audit running paper work I also checked customers in as well as made reservations. I was robbed at gun point but was able to get away and they did not provide any kind of security to agents that work night shift no panic button no nothing so for that reason I had to leave that job
bad,"Started out as a place I viewed as home, but once management changed over it went downhill. Very unfortunate, but it was a great learning experience."
bad,"I typically worked 3-11 pm shifts, but was occasionally called on to do all shifts. As I started on the Night Audit (11-7 shift), I ended up knowing how to do more with the front desk duties than the new manager that began in October of 2013. "
bad,"I would go to work, check guests in and out of the hotel, make reservations, talk to people on the phone, etc. I learned good people skills, organization, computer and phone skills. The management were absolutely terrible. They did not care about their employees. Very greedy, extremely rude to employees and guests. Did not give their employees any breaks. My co-workers were great, very helpful. The hardest part of the job was working full 8 hour shifts alone with no breaks, 5 days a week for minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the great customers i got to deal with everyday."
bad,"I did it all light maintance, housekeeping, landscaping, van driver, and front desk as needed. most difficult part of working there was working with very difficult people and very poor communication. all I can say is it was a job."
bad,"Wyndham was a great company to work for several years ago but after a million re-orgs over the last few years sparred by the original 2008 economy collapse basically, it is a shell of what it used to be. Sad really for loyal employees who expected to make it their home long term.  After working so hard for the company they cared about, the company didn't care back"
bad,"A typical day at work would involve checking in the guest, inputting all the necessary information, and following up with the guests to make sure the start of their stay has had no bumps. We also carry a small amount of cash to provide change for guest in the event they would need it. "
bad,"A typical day went by with one to two basic problems, learned how to become a responsible decision maker.  Management was somewhat professional.  The most challenging part of the job was the unruly guest.  the most enjoyable part of this job is the customer relationships that I built."
bad,"The entire industry is not ideal. If you can live with yourself by making a living lying, taking money from those who have little to begin with, and filling your days with falso promises, then maybe consider this type of sales."
bad,"Working at the front desk required most weekends and left very little time for a personal life. Company boasts about how much personal time one accumilates working there, but yet most of the time refuses time off requests."
bad,This place started off ok. The benefits right away was great amtthis resort if you weren't Mexican you got treated bad. lhe resort manager has no business being in the place and position he is. They don't care about employees well being or time off. Workers comp is a joke and the company that deals it is even worse. I did meet some awesome coworkers while there. No job security or availbitly to move up what so ever. After being hurt I was told I was being found another job and was laid off without knowing. Just be careful I've heard some are good but my experience and at this particular one was horrible.
bad,"Would come in assign the housekeeper the roomimg list, make sure they have a supplys they need, make sure laundry is caught up& inspect rooms"
bad,"when first becoming acclimated to wyndham, it was a fun and joyous experience. now after a year of employment, i have never witnessed such poor management skills in my life. to have a resort manager and an asst resort manager , that know nothing of their job title, to miss a majority of the work week, then unload the managerial duties to under paid front desk staff on top of their assigned duties, is enough to make you want to quit in itself."
bad,-Greeting guests
bad,Met with customers face to face and gave them a tour of the vacation resort and tried to sell them time shares.
bad,Worst place I ever worked. Had a owner that fled to another country when he couldn't pay taxes. Bad place to be a manager when you can't get supplies.
bad,"Some great people! Management not in sync. Associates overworked -Depends upon the department. Change management is challenging as is IT resources/support."
bad,I've learned a lot as a housekeeper and working at a hotel can be stressful when you have people not respecting the property well also when its time to check out and on a time limit to clean each room
bad,"Stay over rooms, are pretty easy. Just replace towels,  change the bed linen , take out the trash, clean the bathroom. Check outs can either be horrible or not bad at all."
bad,Taking request from desired rooms.. Giving back what is needed to help with there stay and travel be more at home .. Provide breakfast . along with a workout room
bad,"The workplace culture was competitive, fast-paced, and aggressive. Far more weight was put on competitive sales rather than on seeking customer satisfaction. The hardest part of this job was seeking to fulfill role as a customer service supervisor within a atmosphere that valued financial gain over employee, and customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people from all over the world on a consistent basis."
bad,I was asked a few of the normally expected questions and how skilled I was at using the Super 8 hotel software. I was also asked how much customer service experience I had.
bad,From day one on the field it was a struggle I worked in a very loud mall downtown that contributed to most of my failure. Had to yell very loud to get any ones attention to pitch them. After 45 days you get paid 7.75 which was near to nothing. There was not really any team work it was every man for themselves. Paying for parking was horrible.
bad,"A plus was that a few months at the end of my career at Wyndham Destinations the company made a room for relaxation for employee's. Massage chairs, foot stools and dim lighting for rest on breaks. Very high stress level and demanding job."
bad,This job is Repetitious. Meeting new guests and seeing regular guests is a plus.  The hours are not regular and difficult to get time off. That is the shift work life.
bad,"No work life balances at all, in order to be successful at this job you must be a great liar, the product is a scam however the pay is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Stressful, competitive"
bad,It’s an okay environment. Management isn’t very professional. Front desk does housekeeping laundry. Spiders and roaches at the hotel. Sometimes some of the rooms have bedbugs
bad,No es un buen lugar de trabajo en invierno porque es fuera.
bad,"Atleast for the timeshare side you get vacation time, sick time, and you will recieve 40 hours a week. But, if you want to advance they only choose ppl who will sleep around, or suck up to the managers. It's completely full of managers who show favoritism. If your looking to move up or make a livable wage then you will be disappointed."
bad,Not trained well in management. Decent co workers. Hours are very flexible for kids. Got discounted rooms. And usesage of the property. Discount ts for the restaurants.
bad,"This use to be a great place to work, fun environment, good management, and made good money.  Over the last year it has progressively gotten worse to now unbearable.  The management has become terrible, the sale leads are terrible, no longer making a good pay check.  Management has no idea what they are doing and they want more from you, you are working harder then ever before and making less money.  The comp plan is terrible and needs to change.  Their is constant merging and restructuring of the company going on at the top levels and, with every change none of them are to benefit  the agents who they really don't care anything about.  Wyndham is constantly hiring new people now more then ever, they don't last so its a huge turnover rate.  Long term dedicated employees that have been their for years are now also leaving because of all the problems at Wyndham: the terrible lead sources, the low pay checks, and the poor management .  It has turned into a negative environment .  It turned into everything negative that it wasn't .  Building smells like mold."
bad,"The initial Guest Services ""management"" is seriously horrific!! You are overloaded with a work load and then never offered any help of any kind! You are told to ""figure it out"" if you are given a task you don't know how to do. You are constantly belittled and talked down to on a daily basis. Upper management is not much better! Instead of seeing the issues in the department they continue to turn a blind eye. There is a reason why the turnover rate in the guest services department is so bad!!! Everyone ends up leaving due to issues in the so called ""leadership"". As of early 2019, nothing is worth working in this department!!! Wyndham as a whole company is great and as long as you are working somewhere else besides the ""Emerald Beach"" location you should be fine!"
bad,"I loved the paperwork and the staff was amazing that was about it. You are the only one there on your shift and I was night shift. Had a lot of creepy stuff go on during my shifts, cops were sometimes involved. Had to kick a homeless guy out of ice machine room, some lady stripped in front of me when I went to fix her tv, had some lady try to do an exorcism on me, and many more stories.  pay wasn't worth all the troubles."
bad,"This was a lovely summer job.  The owners were great to work with, it was a bright happy place to be.  The cottages and café were loved by all visitors"
bad,review the summary in order to complete the survey. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen vcxzgbfahgs
bad,The organization had a lot of employee retention type programs for the benefits are good and generally employees respect each other. Not sure why you couldn't work from home. IT was a good to place to work but the Release Management Team made it very difficult to do your job.
bad,"Currently employed - no further details to elaborate on while operating under their employ. In order to ensure financial security until new employment can be attained, no possibly identifying information can be provided."
bad,The turnover rate is abysmal for a reason.  The Analysis department got a new director that has never been an analyst and a manager that doesn't know allocate resources properly.   Promotions and rewards are based on who your friends are not ability or quality of work product.  Having to spin up multiple phase 2 and 3 projects to account for the poor execution of the 1st phase is considered a good thing so none of the contributing issues are addressed.
bad,"There was no advancement, poor management in almost all aspects. No organization or true follow through of their sequence of service and you are often over worked because they are short staffed. Not worth the time it takes away from your everyday living."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Days Inn because I was able to work at my own pace with cleaning. I was able to work alone, and clean the way I wanted to as long as it met their expectations on how the room was supposed to be done."
bad,"Someone really good fun people."
bad,"Management needs improvement, workplace very competitive and stressful most times.  Very demanding and sometimes demoralizing.  Also discriminating at times."
bad,Managers were very lazy and unprofessional. Very quick paced and unwilling to slow down the pace of how quick we would clean rooms. Rooms weren't being cleaned properly. No breaks. Very strict on times the rooms had to be done the time limit to clean one room was 20 minutes for any room no matter how dirty the room would be.
bad,"Place was okay for working at that time due to being new to work environment, manger during my time was very cooperative. They ownership were bit to controlling, checks on everything."
bad,Horrible owner / manager. Wouldn't pay for overtime or even all worked hours. Building is falling apart around patrons. Total disaster. Never experienced anything of that caliber.
bad,Do not wish to write a review. I have worked here long enough and am ready to change jobs. Some days are stressful and the hours are not the same all the time or shifts change.
bad,The job was far to understaffed and over worked. Days were slow and a little to no foot traffic was very common. Events were the best due to more foot traffic.
bad,"helping elderly with assisted living ,dealing with sometimes not so nice people,some teamwork there ,alot of individual  allocation ,bi weekly pay no benifits"
bad,"When I first started working for Wyndham I enjoyed my job every day I went. I would run the front desk and greet all guests. After working there for so long there was a new owner that came and changed everything. Like, most new ownership there were lots of changes. Eventually those changes turned into losing really good staff and more work put on only a few people. When things became too stressful to deal with I left. "
bad,"The issues between the under-qualified management and underpaid staff stem from the lack of corporate presence in maintaining the standard sold to the vacation owners. ""Everything comes from the top."""
bad,Days inn hotel - is a family run family staffed hotel - and that if you are not in your are not in.  Management is more interested in the time clock then they are in guest services.
bad,"I enjoyed working here because it was a slow paced job and relaxing, but the management was all over the place and they didnt know how to take care of their employees"
bad,I never worked here so I can't really tell you how things are in this workplace. I really do not know all that they do or anything. I really cannot remember what happened at this workplace.
bad,Upper management were rude and supervisors very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was being disrespected by under trained employees in customer service.
bad,This Job Was The Worst Job I've Ever Worked..Only Because The Management There Was Terrible. My Co-Workers Were Awesome But The Managers Were And Probably Are Not Still Up To Part
bad,"It  was a low paying job with the promise of good commission."
bad,nice place to work just needed more hours and days it had slowed down so hours got cut had to get a second job but everyone was nic i love to work here again but just needed more hours and days the mangers was nice i help fix and remodel the hotel last year then it got slow
bad,the first thing they tell you is about all the hours your going to have to work. then after you work your first week they start to cut down on your hours.
bad,"This  company is only out for self, yes they shower you with opportunities to win cool prizes but its a smoke screen. The customers are completely misled and it is your job to fix it. Oh not to mention, they will fire you quick over these exceptions. ridiculous"
bad,There was a lot of opportunity if you knew the right people and wanted to play politics.   Be very sure that the person that you are replacing is gone for good.  In addition do not work a contract position as they treat contractors as second class citizens.
bad,"High rate of Formality in day to day activities . "
bad,Employees were often filtered through quickly. Not many were dependable. The workplace was often high-stress environment because of the constant new undertrained employees. The pay was poor.
bad,"There is no reality of any compensation for a sales associate.  Sure there are some who do well - but that is not the norm.  If you are a seasoned time share sales professional, you have a chance.  Not a good place to figure it out."
bad,This job has good benefits but the pay is not good compared to all the work you do. and the goals are not realistic. They expect you to work your butt off and then do not pay you like they should when you go above and beyond. it is a very money hungry company.
bad,"Assist in guest inquiries, ascertain guest satisfaction, and help solve guest complaints.... Check guest in - out=== Turn over system for next day......"
bad,The people i I worked with were nice and helpful. You got to work at your own pace and listen to music. Also if you got done early you could go home or help others.
bad,Always had work to do.  Lots of balance sheet reconciliations to weed through every month.  Management micromanaged what you did on a daily basis.  Constant meetings so that work couldn't get done during the work day.  Had to work nights to stay caught up.
bad,"Although the financial opportunities were excellent, the company culture was toxic.  I loved the job itself, yet the work environment made it difficult to reach my full potential."
bad,"The company was growing, and is seasonal at best with regards to income. It is unfortunate that being a seasonal worker was not an option. The position says Marketer, but you spend a majority of the time outdoors, pitching strangers who are not interested or on vacation. The company offered no warm contacts, and your bonus is at the mercy of a sales department. I wish I was able to complete the sale with my client myself, many of them complained the sales rep was rude or inappropriate."
bad,"Advancement only available if you know your management personally, managers will turn the other cheek to prevent a future supervisor from getting in trouble or lose the opportunity at hand."
bad,not a good place to work not worry about their employees or customers take to many shortcuts to save money and don't consider how they harm clients and workers
bad,Was a 150 room franchised hotel. Learnt the hotel business and franchise arrangements. Handled the business for the owner of the hotel who was a doctor
bad,Coworkers are easy to get along with if you can keep up.  Not hard work if you don't mind getting sweaty.  Not much room for advancement. Pay and hours could be better for the people who work behind the scenes.  All in all if you need work its a good place to start.
bad,"I worked here for the summer as housekeeping, and it was not one of my favorite summer jobs. it was very difficult to get all the rooms cleaned within three to four hours."
bad,"The owner was terrible and unproffesional. Extremely racist and unethical. There was an incident where bed bugs was a problem in one of the wings and the manager knew, and still continued to sell out those rooms to unknowing people.."
bad,"Job advancement is attainable if you have friends in the right places."
bad,"As a resident doing security where I lived caused so many problems."
bad,"The job was very easy, sometimes stressful but mainly very easy to accomplish.  There was a lot of downtime which was nice. Overall a good place to work."
bad,"I greeted, registered, and assigned rooms to guests."
bad,My supervisor was a wonderful person. I really enjoyed working at this facility. I learned a lot as far as customer service was involved as well as how to meet state inspections.
bad,"The coworkers and training are great with this company, however it is in a high stress environment with little certainty on the scheduling on a daily basis. The management is going through changes and is causing confusion among the entry level workers."
bad,"Use high pressure sales tactics and super high interest rates  to finance a purchase of a timeshare.  In addition, very expensive annual fees and don't always get the resort you want unless you book 15 months in advance.  Timeshares are  impossible to get to rid of, and very expensive for what you get.  I have a very difficult time with the ethics of working for this company.  "
bad,"Cleaner Inspector are synonym of RoboCopy. One needs to perform all duties of a cleaner  inspector and also small maintenance issues such as secured lose screws on furniture, changed lights bulbs, glued  broke items, etc. High pick season is extremely busy."
bad,This is strictly and outside sales position no marketing what so ever.  Co-workers don't stay there long. Management team could be a lot better. The hardest part is asking people for a credit card this is a time share and located in NYC the locations are not the best.
bad,"A typical day is anything from slow to very busy, there's really no in between."
bad,"This hotel began as a great opportunity, as a general front desk associate I handled the daily responsibilities assumed with the position."
bad,"very hectic, little support from corporate managers, pay not the best, little to no benefits, supplies needed were not provided, very little communication"
bad,"I really dont know what is doing in wyndham vcation ownership"
bad,"Management is friendly but their business management can use major improvements. Primary responsibilities consisted of checking guests in and out, collecting payments, and filing records."
bad,They only really cared about what you did or do for them they could care less how you feel or if you need something. They literally made me hate my job.
bad,I don't know about this company they need better people working for them. you work to hard and do to much for the little pay.
bad,"Owners do bare minimum to keep the doors open"
bad,"While there is opportunity to make some money, it's not as much as they want you to believe.  New hires get very little training and after only a month you're thrown into the deep end and are expected to meet the same requirements as other marketers that have been in the business for years (some have transferred from sales to marketing) so it's pretty much sink or swim."
bad,"Great discounts on hotels etc. "
bad,This place is owned by a man who lives on the property. So he micro manages everything. The pay is minimum wage. He expects you to be on call at all times to come in and work. Other than that he was a great boss to work for. I truelly enjoyed him and his family and I learned alot.
bad,i got lied to and was told job was going to be full time and it is not. i left a better paying job for less hours and did not know it until it was too late.
bad,"I disliked most everything about working here. The job itself was difficult, you are toggling between checkouts, information, cold calling future reservations, and guest issues.  Logging EVERY call and its purpose.  And making sure you are following all rules- including the terribly uncomfortable uniform (its a suit).   Get ready to have two of these uncomfortable suits for 5 days a week so you'll be doing a lot of wash.  The most exciting part of the day was when management forced everyone to go to the meeting and read over company facts and figures.  About check-in time, you are swamped with assisting also with that, and I remember it was like getting ready for a marathon daily- people yelling and mad, because of the different 'status"" - they weren't VIP members, so they were mad and didn't understand why they got in first...etc.  OH, and you can't give anyone extra coffee or other usual hotel amenities because its not a hotel ""its a timeshare"".  Also if you were late over 1 minute it was an 1/4 occurrence.  2 people got fired for that who were excellent agents."
bad,Will be able to handle entire Front Office Operations in 5 Star Hotels.Totally more than 6 Years of work experience in 5 Star Hotels in Front Office Departments.
bad,"I worked as a dishwasher, cleaned restrooms and broke down empty boxes and took out the trash."
bad,"This is has overall been the worse place i have worked for. They will not fire anyone due to unemployment, doesnt matter how much a guest complains nothing happens. Employees make up there own hours. Managment is also very rude to guest.They believe everyone is out for a free night stay or want a discount."
bad,"I found out that working here was not the best of places to try to work at.  The employees  that I worked at, once I found this job, were working there for so many years.  They should have tried their job for so much longer.  They were definitely bad coordinates in this field of housing.  If they were lucky, they could have had a fine home in this vicinity.  They made more than they could have ever hoped for.  I feel out for these families.  If i had the money, oh, what would I do without doing the most i could for these families.  "
bad,I liked it at first till the management team true colors were revealed.
bad,Deceptive Sales and Marketing. Management is the poorest I have ever experienced. No communication between various managers as well as other personnel. Never having appropriate calateral
bad,i went to work. Break my back and sweat. to go home to a horrible pay.
bad,"It was a chill job just didnt like how every time you make a mistake you get yelled at and threatened to get fired.. Some workers are cool just dont like the snitching going on, you cant breathe without everyone else knowing. lots of bad customers"
bad,Boring place and not busy enough. Staff would not change sheets regularly which resulted in having to deal with customers saying they had hair or blood stains on their pillows or bed
bad,"Every morning you'd clock in on the computers, eat breakfast and fill your cart with everything you need from your clipboard. Each person would get assigned anywhere from 8-35 rooms on one floor. Clean each room, vacuum up the hallways and clock out. It wasn't good communication between many co-workers and supervisors considering they couldn't speak any English and the managers were always gone. However, I did like getting in, doing my job and getting out. I always made requests on changes and they would just shake their heads and not been seen again for a month. Even when I got my phone stolen from work by someone staying in the hotel, underage, they didn't want anything to do with it and did nothing to help me get it back."
bad,I disliked working here. I would not recommend employment here to anyone. I left because I found a better job.
bad,"A typical day is very busy.. We are in the computer from morning till the time we clock out. Edits, e-mails, calculations, phone calls & so much more."
bad,good starting job. only worked during summer.  cleaned room.  taught me to pay attention to detail.  but most other staff not friendly.
bad,it was fun know all the properties i learned where i can travel too and co worker are hard workers it was fun
bad,"A typical day at work was greeting customers giving directions on how to get to their room, answering phones, and inputting information into the computer. "
bad,"The Ramada in Yuma, AZ did not care about its employees at all. They didnt care about the property either "
bad,"Eighty e-mails a day; dozens of dead lines a week; emergency situations to manage every day; work scheduling and scope definition subject to continuous revision. Busy, challenging and rewarding construction environment."
bad,I know that a lot of changes have been made at the Canterbury location in terms of management. There really is no life outside of the 2 days off and no room for advancement if you are in guest services. The tips are the only thing that made the job enjoyable at the end of the day. We were only allowed 30 minute lunch breaks and we worked every Friday through Sunday.
bad,Needs better management team unorganized employees are not satisified and underpaid not enough hours there is not moving up
bad,I didn't like the job cause i felt like i wasn't wanted. it was ok at first but it's hard work
bad,"I had a bad overall experience.When i relocated for the position, they told me I would be doing something completely different. It was like they never cared about the employees."
bad,Working at the Wyndham was a very exciting experience.Management was very responsive to employee needs.Work was easy because skills exceeded job demands.Job was part time.
bad,"Unprofessional, unfair, bad employee housing, personal problems brought into workplace"
bad,"This establishment knows how to hire extremely personable lower level staff. All of my co-workers were very fun people, and easy to get along with. However, some of the management staff could have been more involved in their departments. Things did not always run smoothly, and often times, things were overlooked that employees did not do properly."
bad,"One of the call center supervisors is a complete Douche, and its all about politics. I left once I figured all this out."
bad,"Check ins, Check Outs, I have learned how to check people in out etc. co workers are great, management is terrible, Dealing with management"
bad,I loved the co-workers but the motel was nasty with bed bugs.
bad,i got out just in time... they changed flags and ownership. All the rules and benefits changed on employees.
bad,A typical day at work is doing all the daily chores and watching the desk. I learned a lot there as in computer skills and customer service skills. I think the management  could of been better. The hardest part about the job was probably learning all the computer tabs.
bad,Movie to Georgia and job paid rate was to low and work to hard for not that much more but everything bout job I love and wish pay rate was a Lil more ..
bad,"Pretty good people, they will train and help you. But they think they own you. I quit/resigned because I was paid $7.25 plus commission and not making any commission. While others are making six figures. Strange that there would be a avoid in pay like this. Otherwise opportunity is there for some but not others. Seeing that placement according to management has no effect of performance in turn pay. But those top performers won’t work the locations that the low performers are stuck working. Ask Wyndham about that... also about my PTO and why only certain employees can use benefits at the five star resorts while other employees could only use benefits at two star hotels."
bad,"I worked in the Orlando corporate office as a owner services rep. When I first got hired on it was great. They put you through a training class for a few weeks which is good . The atmosphere at the office seems lively and “everyone” seems to love there job. In fact you’ll constantly have people popping into your training just to tell you how much they love wyndham . I really thought I found my job until the truth & reality set in. Shortly after being hired , they implemented a new role for my department . We had to sell “ppp” that’s there points protection plan. If you do not sell there quota each month it’s a write up that will lead to termination . I wasn’t even originally hired to do sells but they force that on you . Even if the customer declines to purchase . They force you to ask several times and get several no’s before they consider your attemp valid. No matter if your getting yelled at or cussed at by the client they don’t care. They don’t care about there at home agents . We are basically forgotten about . Besides your coaching you will have with your supervisor every few weeks where they listen to your call and point out all the bad you did.  VERY stressful job , & not what they paint it out to be. Only pro was taking time off is pretty easy ( which you will need dealing with there RUDE owners) . You can work with your schedule and discounts you get for there resorts are amazing . Other than that . Don’t bother"
bad,"Been with the company for over a year. No raises, no career advancement. Just sit down and do your job. No breaks, if you want to eat your lunch you have to eat it in-between guests. If a guest walks in while you're eating you have to put down everything and attend the guest. No other employees will cover for you if you are sick or if an emergency comes up at last minute.."
bad,"The Super 8 I worked at was old and falling apart. Keeping things stocked was a nightmare. The owner would do the grocery runs, and that worked for the most part, but it was frustrating when we were out of supplies, like sugar, and it took 3 days to get it."
bad,I was required to work 12 hours per day due to shortage in staff. My body couldn't physically handle it. Besides the lack of help and long hours it was a decent place to work.
bad,Co. need to require the managers of there properties to give time and half for working holidays and require pd. Vacation for worker after one year. Need to require cost of living raises.
bad,"Good company, bad management. You need to have friends inside the company in order to grow and have a better position. Too much Favoritism on people. It's not what you know, It's WHO you know!"
bad,"SOME of the staff was probably the only enjoyable thing about this job. Management constantly had a difficult time getting the people they hired to come to work, the hotel computer reservations program they made us use was only a TEST PROGRAM that was only given to about 200 other properties and it CONSTANTLY either broke down, freeze, made 'phantom' reservations (ones where the system somehow made up), offered rooms to many guests that we did not have on site available and even deleted guests payment info by itself. It was completely terrible and endlessly frustrating. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE."
bad,"I don't know about all the locations, but the one I worked at was not a healthy environment. They put you through a one week training class, which is a joke. Upon ""Graduation "" they put you on the sales floor, GOOD LUCK. You're there waiting for a qualified leads. However the marketing team sends anyone in with a pulse. If you can't close the lead regardless how bad it is or was, it still counts against you. You're scheduled from 8:30 AM to 3:30 or 4:00 PM. Even that is not consistent. If they don't have the leads they expected you will be sent home as early as 11:30 AM, and remember you're only being paid $11.00 per hour. With everything I've listed, you probably already figured the turn over is very high. My first month, half of the sales team either quit or was terminated. Lastly, if you can't sell or have sold but customers rescind their contracts you will be asked to quit so they don't have to pay you unemployment."
bad,Wyndham has great benefits but the pay isn't enough to access the benefits.  The discount program is good.  The job isn't hard but can be boring at times and it 's difficult to advance while staying at the same location.
bad,Wyndham Vacation Resorts in your typical outbound call center. The potential to earn commission based off of the work that you actually do is a plus. Expect a lot of change at the last minute.
bad,Whole department was shut down and had to be restructured. The company provided a great compensation package which really helped. No idea how things are now.
bad,Great coworkers unfortenly management wasn't so great. Favoritism among staff. If you didn't score numbers then you wouldn't get placed with those who were on the top board so basically setting up employees for failure. I truly believe that this location could've had a lot of potential but as far as having completely New managers who didn't have a clue on what they're doing made it for the work environment .
bad,I am not providing a review on the company. This shouldn't be a requirement so you should reconsider having this field as required. Just wanted to provide feedback
bad,During the past six years the work culture has evolved from a great customer focused operation and a great place to work into a place where the bottom line is the primary focus.
bad,"Completing the end of day reports along with checking guest in and out in a timely manor.  This hotel catered to the distressed passenger, so there is always a high turnover of guest. There are few to none repeat guest. Busy place that included lots of meeting space and a bar."
bad,"it was alright there. Nothing to write about. Went in set up station. Wash dishes all thru the shift. Help Bus tables, take out trash. Sometimes prep food. l helped with banquets, and then clean pots and dishes,...OK?"
bad,"Typical day at work is slow at this hotel and not truly challenging to me. I have not learned anything that wasn't taught to me at my previous hotel."
bad,"commission base no hourly after training period"
bad,Management was absent most working days. Lack of integrity & sincerity from various employees. Very selfish & greedy environment! Most days ended early with no opportunity
bad,"Wyndham is overall not a bad company ... but the management SUCKS !! they are very petty and immature.. coworkers was fun, Pay was horrible Benefits was great"
bad,"Constantly pressure to increase your stats, by the end of the month, most people leave within 90 days, the company is in redmond and if you live in the south end you will b stuck on I-405, if you live in the north you will have to deal with I-5 south or 405 south, if your stats are low you will be working every weekend, that's not fun!!"
bad,Management didn't have any interest in their supporting staff. Continued to pile on additional job responsibilities without compensating financially.  Resort manager constantly out of town on vacation or at home and unavailable to discuss issues. HR dept offsite and very bias almost harassing of middle management for no cause.
bad,"Lack of advancement. Management is narrow minded."
bad,"The company used to be a great company to work for then they got to big for there pants, changing everyone's pay plan, the owners are unhappy because the availability has gone"
bad,took the building from poor to excellent in ratings manager was promoted new manager came in and asked me to resign one month before bonus came in of about 8000.00 so then maintenance expenses went through the roof and owners sold the building and all management were fired
bad,"Generally I found some nice people, but for me there were just too many liars.  Not only liars, but lying about lying. Hard to trust anyone in that kind of environment.  Therefore, I trusted myself and got out. It is a tough industry since the prospects are enticed with gifts and coached to lie to the sales reps.  You don't have to lie to do the job there.  Yet it was common practice.  The environment was like a car dealership. I suspected management was pushing small deals for its new reps so that the seasoned reps could upsell the big deals later.  When I spoke up, retaliation.  It just wasn't worth staying there.  Too bad because there were some good people.  The product is decent.  You do learn alot about sales, but very few reps last long either because they are not making money or because of the culture.  The most enjoyable part was the independence to do your own tour and use your sales tools to get people to see the benefits of the vaca ownership experience.  The worst part was the lying and the jaded reps.  If you want to make big money doing this it is possible."
bad,"The job itself was a fun job but the management was shady and would not work with your hours. That being with school, more or less hours. Owners were very rude."
bad,Leave your integrity at the door!!! Worst management I've encountered in 30+ years in hospitality!!  the HR dept. is a total joke. They are only interested in protecting the management. This was the most toxic environment. Total lack of concern for employees which creates a culture not conducive to providing good customer service.
bad,"This is a hard company to work for on the west coast.  They are based back east so may be better there, but in Southern California it is the worst.  High pressure management that doesn't care about workers."
bad,Hectic job environment with little appreciation to workers. Supervisors are not readily available to staff. Have to work all weekends and holidays. Management is authoritarian and shows little appreciation toward jobs well done.
bad,"There are not very many good things for me to say in regards to my time with Wyndham. I spent most of my time waiting to start my job then actually staying hired with the company. I chose to leave due to the fact that the company lied about several details prior to my employment. Management encouraged an unhealthy competitive environment that started to affect the nature of my work. Management also did not treat everyone equally which made the work environment very uncomfortable. I chose to leave, because the job was starting to take a personal toll on me as it was becoming very financially and emotionally draining. I would not recommend working for this company as a community marketing agent."
bad,"8 am Business Review meeting every Monday to Friday.  Made Sales calls to grow business, guided a team to do the same.  Did site inspections with clients and ran their events once booked.  Handling all billing for entire department and worked as part of the Executive team."
bad,"Too much favoritism, unfairly treated, bullied by management. I feel bad for whoever still works here. Great compensation but not worth the stress of the workplace."
bad,Very good temporary job. Fast paced job at times. Pay could be better and management could treat their employees better.
bad,"The office is extremely understaffed which lead to a Large workload"
bad,"I love my job but it was very disapointing about the staff there ...People quit so much ..The everyday hustle there was impossible to have a good day the managers there start problems with different people disclose personal information,, favoritism..Lack of support and job duties"
bad,"I understand that the Wyndham franchise allows independent buyers to own their hotels. This creates some inconsistency. The owner of the Ramada I worked at was horrible. He threatened my job frequently for making minor mistakes, he was condescending, and over bearing. He ran an illegal parking brigade out of the hotel which caused city wide attention. He did not maintain the rooms properly. There were several reports of bed bugs as well. A typical day at work would be me taking guest complaints and trying to fix them, monitoring the efforts of housekeeping, inspecting rooms, making reservations etc. I learned the Wynguest system quite well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and poor scheduling. My co-workers, however, were wonderful. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the guests."
bad,"Answered the telephone, made reservations, checked guests in and out, ran nightly and monthly audits, various cleaning duties."
bad,"This was my first housekeeping job so everything was pretty new to me. I learned a lot and is a fast learner so it wasn't longer before I became a supervisor pretty quick. The hardest part of day there was when we under new management and the manager at that time would have all the housekeepers clock out on a busy check out and "
bad,I enjoyed the guests and employees of my previous position.  The higher up managers from corporate were very cut throat and vindictive.
bad,"No communication, bad leadership. Treated horribly by both guests and supervisors. There is no accountability. Co-workers were ok, mainly there until they found better employment."
bad,Management can do better to encourage growth of existing staff. Internal promotion should be valued more than hiring supervisors and management from outside.
bad,i had lots of fun at Days Inn learning the basics of housekeeping and becoming a good member of their team   however the work ethos was not great lots of drug addicts being employed which is fine as long as your willing to support their addictions   the hotel quest and management were great so i stayed for almost 1 yr   and have learned i like and love working housekeeping in a busy hotel
bad,"Disjointed management across the country, rival internal factions throwing stones defending their silos, no cohesive architecture across IT unilaterally, plus I simply felt entirely out of place there as the only person on my team in the location.  I usually say, worst jobs in IT are for companies that IT wasn't and isn't their focus, like most treated IT as a burden, and there simply was no strong leadership I could tell that cared otherwise.  "
bad,After two months on the job I was the only member from my training class that was still on the job.  The deck was stacked against junior sales people to benefit the senior sales people
bad,I learned how to check in people and check out. I get to know the customers and co workers. The hardest part was dealing with customers with attitudes or remarks that'll upseet me. but have patience and help the situation. I loved just having a job. I am an independent person. My manager was great but my actual boss had problems with communication issues which means.. she couldn't tell me she had to let me go because of business being slow. took her a week to let me know while I was thinking I was still employed. Which I think as a company you should let all your employees on employement. I was in training at the time.. I only worked one week and hd to wait 2 weeks for payment and as a check.
bad,"Worked for this company for over 6 years, not a bad job but never got any pay raises in the time and tried my best to be a model employee, we just never had enough employees and because of that I had really strange hours (having to work 3rd shift then come in to immediatly work 2nd shift on a weekly basis.) Also never got any vacation days or sick days, if you ever had to call out because of an illness you had to make the time up by either losing an off day or pulling double shifts. And although not all Knights Inns have security problems the one i worked at constantly had criminals everywhere."
bad,If you like being on the phone then this job is for you. I don't feel like I accomplish much working in Telephone Sales. I don't feel challenged enough and felt like i was bothering people.
bad,"Created reservations for events and rooms "
bad,"Though I did my best, which I was told was very efficient, the time limit for each room to be finished was just really unrealistic to me. I didn't learn much more than I already knew. Management listened but ultimately it was more about finishing quicker so the employees would be paid less, since it was by the hour. My co-workers were very friendly & helpful. Even though it was grueling physical work,the hardest part of the job would be the time constraints. The most enjoyable part was feeling accomplished after a hard days work."
bad,cleaning rooms and doing laundry staff was really friendly and always making sure rooms were clean
bad,"The extremely high turnover of sales agents in this place speaks volumes. In fact it's a bit baffling that they don't do anything to invest in the employees they've trained. It's a revolving door of warm bodies who come out of training excited to sell, sit around the first few weeks after training doing nothing,  get daily pep talks about success and sales, sit around for another week with maybe 1 or 2 tours, pray for a chance to prove themselves, get the chance and then make a sale. Then, that momentum lasts a day or two and they are back at the bottom waiting around for days on end to get another chance. You're at the mercy of management's subjective favor. Keep in mind that all the agents are all people who were hired because they are personable and easy to like, but I saw at least a dozen people either quit or get fired before me, while the attractive sales agent who had invested in her own ""enhancements"" get both the immediate attention and favor of the management."
bad,a typical day would be your normal hotel room cleaning. i only got 2 shifts per week if i was lucky. they let me go because i became pregnant. people were miserable all the time.
bad,"Nice People - just didn't fit with me."
bad,"Management is a joke, they chose to not hire from within and go to outside sources. They promote you and then they give your job to someone else and demote you."
bad,This is a good location easy to get to but definitely horrible management and moral in the work place.
bad,i didn't work there really long it was ok..but something really bad happened there and i chose not to keep working there
bad,"loved everyday, i had fun finding new ways to clean and deal with all kinds of people"
bad,"Purely commission position - if you don't sell something you don't eat. They pay minimum wage for the hours you work and then subtract it from any commission you make. People leave all the time - voluntarily and involuntarily. Great reps make great money. Many just squeak by. Many don't make it at all. No matter what you're told by anyone there (management, recruitment, employees, trainers, etc.), you have three weeks to prove you can make the numbers."
bad,its a great hotel to start out at that gives you many opportunity
bad,"I would come into work with little information on expected check-in's. "
bad,"A typical day at work consists of selling prospected tours vacation in a very short amount of time. I learned how to find and overcome objections, how to ask the right questions in order to make a sale, and how to establish trust quickly. Management could be better. Workplace culture is great. Hardest part of the job is selling a customer, but the customer most likely doesn't have enough money to purchase. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
bad,"I worked for this company for about 3 months, thinking being at the concierge desk and sales I would make money. People didn’t want to buy the product and I would get 200$ in week. I worked 85 hours in one week. I didn’t have any social life and I couldn’t take time off, because I planed a trip 5 months before I got this job and they told me. Oh well that’s your paid time off. The workers tried to make me quit and it was just a terrible experience."
bad,"You can move in this company very fast if you are built for timeshare. Their is constantly the ability to make money here but you must work to your fullest extent to do so. Marketing is very stressful, and for some including myself, mentally and morally taxing."
bad,"Not very friendly, helpful, and/ or supportive group if co workers. Micro managing was the none supportive management. Angry at the slightest error. ...  ......."
bad,I enjoy working for them and feel like they treat there people fair if they had better benefits such as paid holidays and insurance and 401 k it would be a great place to be employed at
bad,making money is what matters most.  employees are numbers.  huge culture change from what it was. very top heavy.  too many chiefs not enough indians. must play golf to move up the ladder.
bad,"When Wyndham took over the hotel I worked at, they took all perks away, increased hours for salaried workers. They became demanding and the negativity spilled over onto staff."
bad,The management was AMAZING ! The owners however .. just horrible. 3 years with them and still NO raise. I was making MINIMUM WAGE ! I was not able to pay for my college books or anything.
bad,Timeshare business is very cutthroat and you may not get any advance warning of production numbers before just being fired. It was a real shock when I got fired with no notice.
bad,If you are a person who has previous marketing and sales experience in realty or vacation rentals then this is an opportunity to make good money if you have no expectation of managerial support and training.
bad,this job was a long time a go and it was just a stating point. I just got of the army and i was not very happy with this job.I was to young and i did not know what i wanted at the time.
bad,"When I started to do housekeeping job, and I learn a lot of benefit from our team because I  did the housekeeping job of first time in my life.  my co-work gave me how to do it, and how to services different "
bad,I generally like my job. I enjoy greeting and conversing with the guests. It allows me time to work on homework since I am enrolled in school. It can be slow and quiet which makes for a long eight hours.
bad,"so, when i worked at the super 8 in ringgold, i really enjoyed my job.  they pay was low though, the manager sucked, no other employees would do their work load, and i was left to do everything.  the reason i loved my job was the customers, no other reason."
bad,"Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Nice employees, but very low pay for work load,  hospitality is a thankless job, guests can be very rude and unforgiving, but employees are still expected to smile and take it. Wyndham is #1 in Vacation ownership and has many great hotels, but don't compensate their employees properly for what they are worth and what they are expected to do.  The cost of living in Florida is not cheap contrary to what people believe and the salaries are much too low."
bad,Wyndham is a good place to work.  It is mainly commissioned based so prepare yourself for the slow times.  I loved meeting all different types of people and helping families make dreams a reality.
bad,"They promise you the world, but the leads they provide you is terrible. You're better off working at Hilton or Bluegreen. Take your license and go somewhere where people have actually heard of."
bad,"Their reservations system is pretty old so it's not easy to learn plus it is a lot of information, their training is good but the last month of training you're going to be proven on the phones with a manager on the other side, if you fail one question, that's it, they escort you outside that same day after you spent a month and two weeks of training instead of helping on whatever you failed and give more coaching, they very unprofessional just take your badge and bye bye. I passed everything, written tests and how to navigate their complex  systems, but I failed one thing, and that was the end of it."
bad,"This is a good company to work for, great benefits but there is no sense of loyalty towards its employees and there is no consideration for its salaried whether salaried or hourly."
bad,"Wyndham Worldwide is the largest hospitality company in the world. And they have deep pockets to show for it which is great for employee pay and benefits and company growth. However, what that creates from the vacation rentals business is a very clunky and, at times, misguided business. They buy successful companies then make rather unsuccessful attempts to integrate them which can nearly eliminate the business all together."
bad,"I cleaned hotel rooms. Job was easy but u do work hard. Employees were nice to work with . Place is clean and safe. It has a very physical job"
bad,"come in clean building , do midnight audits , checking in guests , cleaning rooms, bartend "
bad,"This job was a good job as you got to promote the falls "
bad,Most positions will require long hours and weekends away from the family on a frequent basis.  Management has high expectations for your serviceability to the public.   The difficulty of the position is the changes in ownership of the company may bring about changes in assignments and personnel.  Primarily means a reduction in staff.
bad,"It was wonderful and a great experience meeting all the new people coming into to town, make sure that they have a great experience and stay with our hotel."
bad,"A typical day at work would be ensuring that sales reps get 100% of support from the Contratcs Department. The Contracts Department are to make sure that we can run all paper work. (credit, pay pal credit, and wyndham rewards) these are tools the sales reps use in prder to get deals. Everything must be entered in the sysytem accurately down to detail. I learned alot about all the systems we use and to pay very close attention to detail. Manangement SUCKS!!!"
bad,"Stable work place, your guaranteed your job but there is no room for advancement. I didn't receive a pay raise out of the time I was there."
bad,good place for high school and college students to find part time work. Not much room for career development or growth.
bad,I worked various shifts didn't have a set schedule so I couldn't have a normal home life or sleep schedule. I went from house keeping to front desk and then to auditor with minimal training. I enjoyed working with customers and improving there visit to the area by giving directions to fun attractions or fine dinning. I also worked in warrensburg super 8 to fill in there auditor position. I worked doubles on no notice.
bad,"Working here was fun at first, but being new there, there was a lot of staff that didn't make you feel welcome at all. Management did have something to say but very little. When approaching management for more hours in different locations of the hotel I was granted more hours as they needed people. I put in around 60 something hours in one week working from 10am-3pm then 4pm til 2am and getting a phone call at 6am to come in cause they need help. This happened for a couple days. My hard work went unrecognized especially for being called in on 3 hours of sleep. After my full week of work I took my two days off and was told I was to go back to my regular schedule that they had hired more guys and I wouldn't be need there anymore, making me feel like I was taken complete advantage of. One other instance that comes to mind is the executive lounge attendant. I was told the pay would be 11.50 an hour for only a few hours and I was okay with that. Management did not tell me that it was 13.50 an hour before and they changed the rate. I can see why they didn't but that was too sneaky for me. I didn't like some of the management for different reasons. Other management team members were very accommodating and made you feel part of the team, other management team members I felt took your work for granted. The free meals was a great perk and the fast pace of being a banquet server kept you on your toes for ANY restaurant job. Kitchen staff was great and easy to get along with. Many of us had multiple jobs and it seemed contradictory for management wanting us to be there at let say 4pm for"
bad,learning and typical day at work :
bad,"all my jobs in my life have been very busy, lots of hours, met many great people.."
bad,"I was good at my job as a housekeeper, was quickly promoted to head housekeeper. Other employees gave me a hard time and made it look like I walked off the job."
bad,"They have swinging door, in/out every week training classes; plus team rollover is appx 90% loss their job. You are rated on even those who are not qualified for the program you are signing up clients for weekend packages."
bad,This company has great employee benefis. The work-life balance needs to improve. Favortism is a huge problem. You don't always advance based upon performance.
bad,"Wyndham Worldwide as a whole may be a great company, but the timeshare marketing side of it is not very professional and lacks proper management."
bad,I found it hard to accomplish my personal sales goals due to lack of support and also the environment was not a very friendly one. Pay is so so… They didn't seem to care much about their employees and their lives outside of work.
bad,It was a very stressful place to work and they treat workers unfairly. If you had a medical condition they made it nearly impossible to continue to work there.
bad,no specific comments to give about this company at this time. basic info is that I worked for this company from 2009-2018 in a call center environment. very good annual reviews for all of the years I worked for the company. stopped working for company in June 2018.
bad,pay is low compae to haul of duty  managment could improve. favortism of certain empolyees. and some employees are over worked and under paid very little employee appreciation from owner. but coukld be a  nice pkace to work
bad,There are very high standards and forcing from higher ups. everything is not as it seems with this company. you'll find yourself doubting yourself and becoming paranoid because the bosses always think too highly
bad,"This is a great company to work for with great immediate benefits but the downside is there is not much of a work/life balance. You are hounded with the ""business comes first"" concept when in reality, the mental health and well being of your employees comes first. The managers only like to be around for the accolades instead of actually putting in the man power. Most of the resort employees are overworked and underpaid"
bad,"A normal day is 7 AM until whenever sales closed.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to plan things because your work schedule is not defined.  My favorite part of my my job is the people I work with.  I enjoy my team very much."
bad,I like working there but management sucks!!! Work environment is good but so many rules with bad management and everyone is confuse. But the money is great and they have good benefits.  Just my honest opinion for working there and being the top performer for 3 years...
bad,I still remember the day when i gave the ideas to my gm of bulk sms and sales tricks and after that in staff party he announced a maximize talent award to me .. Really that one is best moment of my life.
bad,"The culture is great. The environment can be fun. But it's stressful as far as work goes. It would be considerable if commission goals were a little more fair and if the commission we made on bookings went to us, the people who earned it, instead of the company. I learned a lot and liked the weekends off but that's about all."
bad,"I've been with the company for 5 months, I'm told there won't be a raise or any benefits at all offered.  I feel that the pay is despicable, how can anyone live off of $660 a month? Don't good employees deserve recognition?  Why is there no raise offered after 90 days? I enjoy interacting with the public and I'm a faithful employee who feels unappreciated by the company she's employed by."
bad,"If your considering applying for a sales or marketing position, then consider it all a gamble going forward.  You'll feel better about yourself in the end and there will be an end. Ok, I will be nice and say an end for most. "
bad,It was nice to meet new people. The people was there help me as a team member. My coworkers were nice to me. We was working as a team. We was working.
bad,Very difficult to move up in the company. Need more support with the company in regards to customer related problems. People stay in the same position for years.
bad,"I cannot put my heart and soul into company where I am just a number. This company is strictly about numbers. I have shown production, but I do not feel like I am part of a team. I am looking for a company that I can grow with."
bad,All of my coworkers are friendly and helpful although it can become very busy at the front desk with there only being one front desk agent. The best part is all of the friendly new faces you see. You learn a lot about the travelers and where they are originally from.
bad,This place was ok to work at. The best part was going home early the worst was the jacuzzi room
bad,"this place was enjoyable, being a hotel you met a lot of interesting people from out of town, the workload was easy and management was fair."
bad,Its an ok place to work until you find something better. I did learn about doing security at a motel. My co-workers were good. The hardest part of the job was keeping cool when dealing with belligerent people. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free food for the front desk from the surrounding restaurants.
bad,any day could be different a great salesman could see no possible sales opportunities. If the structure enabled a fair share of the potential clients it would have been great
bad,"I worked at one of the Wyndham call centers. It was an awesome job at first. Really easy: you sat at a desk for 8 hours a day and made hotel reservations. You were paid a base rate plus incentives if you met goal for that month. Which wasn't hard to do! I did this job for about a year and a half, had an awesome supervisor, and awesome coworkers. I was one of the top agents at the center, and I enjoyed my job very much.  But, I became pregnant in February. Soon after that, the company was unwilling to work around my hectic schedule. Between school, doctors appointments, and calling into work due to being sick, they began to harass me for my issues. They were unwilling to work with me on what hours I wanted, even though I was still willing to work. One of the supervisors told another supervisor that my face was an eyesore and I needed cream for it after I had popped blood vessels due to morning sickness. Another told me that blacking out while driving wasn't an excuse not to call into work (I was half an hour late calling in and sitting in a hospital bed..) When I had to leave early for an appointment or just because I wasn't feeling well, the women supervisors would sigh dramatically and make a bigger deal out of it than what it was. Then, the coworkers began to harass me. One of them said that I was cheating to get my stats as good as they were. Another asked how I was still employed after missing work so much due to pregnancy. My supervisor told me that it would pass, and to call in so I could file my maternity leave. Wyndham, however, wouldn't let me file it. I tried 3 times,"
bad,I learned the company has many tools for the guest to earn points and receive different rewards through the Rewards Program
bad,"I Love the people I  work with, management  needs work(  in some departments need to pay  more."
bad,"Usually at work the first thing I do when I arrive at work is clean the office, then check computer for reservations as well as check the notes from the shift before that, after that I complete other tasks given to me from my manager as well as wait on costumers."
bad,"a typical day at work would be cleaning around 18 rooms, helping in the laundry and so forth."
bad,"Panama city Fl Beach Resort I worked in Two different departments , the worst people you could ever work for . Th Company is Great but the Management is Horrible. Favortism , Racist and More. They dont care about you are no one else."
bad,i enjoy working here but i couldnt wait to advance whih i did but i have no complaints i was there to do a job and i did exactly that
bad,"Checking in customers at night, getting breakfast ready in morning and checking out customers in the morning.Owner and co-workers are great. This job is not hard at all. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people from all over the US and abroad. Pay is only minimum wage and hours are only part-time. Not the job for a female working alone at night especially on the weekends, but I have to work."
bad,"the work is fun and out going, help people change there life is something I like doing. the people at work are fun. your selling Vacation so the only thing is to do is have fun."
bad,"I worked as a vacation counselor for just under a year for the WorldMark division.  The training was lacking and did not prepare you for the job and how things really worked.  As soon as I got done training, I was then taught how to ""play house"", or in other words, lie to the owners.  I get it...we are trying to make a sale.  But it was flat out lying and I didn't feel comfortable doing so and with out it, it was almost impossible to make a sale.  "
bad,A typical day at work is getting the right food to the right guest and making sure the right food is packed and prepared right for the guest. Management is known to help out and to get things right! The most enjoyable part is that we all work as a team.
bad,i went through three managers at my time there and each one had a different agenda.  Wyndham as a whole did not know anything about food and beverage and are in the infant stages of developing one.  Their solution to the problem of not getting the numbers they want is to get rid of everyone.
bad,"Very pushy sales culture, it was supposed to be 95% customer service and 5% sales but in actual fact it was the other way around"
bad,"A typical day at work was getting your cart ready and going to any assigned room that you could get into. I learned great guest service skills. The Management wasnt that great. My co-workers were ok to work with. Some were better than others. The hardest part of the job was cleaning rooms that were really trashed, which take up alot of your time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the tips guests left."
bad,"The job was messy,since I had to sweep cigarette butts off the parking lot..Also,I had to occasionally mop the men's bathroom."
bad,love working in the morning ....i learn no matter wat the costumers always rite
bad,the people there had good attitudes and I just love being in the atmosphere but want to move on to another different job cuz I love the restaurant for you cooking prep cooking
bad,"It wasn't a train wreck but it wasn't overly fantastic either. Management changes and the environment changes. It was the hospitality industry, some days were great, some sucked, thats what ya get."
bad,"• Execute sales, service and customer experience initiatives with Owners/guest"
bad,"Supervisors did their best, unfortunately section managers were replaced with people that had no idea how to relate to the employees. They tell you what to do and you do it, or else. This resulted in a 180 degree shift in morale. No more fun, motivational contests, no more surprise gifts to all, just go to work and do what you're told. I was the last to leave in my team, because the immediate supervisors were trying to insulate us and I felt bad for the turnover rate. The final straw was when they started tacking on duties of other departments, like timeshare appointment sales, so they could trim other departments to cut costs. Now we were expected to do the job of other staff that had been paid twice or hourly rate with bonuses, and we weren't paid a dime extra.. We were expected to meed goals or face being written up or let go, for a job we weren't even hired or trained for."
bad,"No one seemed to care at all this location. I'm not sure what else to say. No training, you just got thrown in and were expected to do it right. But the people I worked with dont work there anymore so who knows"
bad,It wasn't the job rather it was the management team that made working there stressful and frustrating.  Be prepared to make a lot of independent decisions and their consequences.
bad,"Very unhygienic, management  is  unorganized. Limited  hrs of work.  Very little room for promotion ok discounts management favors employees  gives no notice for layoffs"
bad,In a nutshell they only pay you $10 per hour...the turnover is super high...also you have to pay out of your own pocket $450 dollars to get a timeshare sales license. If this company is making all this kind of money why can't they cover all the license fees and pay a fair starting wage of at least $20 per hour. During my interview...they were blasting rap music loud while the employees were trying to take phone calls. How unprofessional. Don't waste your time.
bad,"This was a nice job at first and very laid back. Then my daughter had gotten sick an I thought management had understood. However due to the health issues of my daughter I needed to request multiple days off for my daughters doctors appts or needed to call out due to random outbreaks of her sickness. I would always have a doctors note anytime I was not able to be there. Due to my requests off for doctors appts NOT my call outs I was getting my shifts taken away. Management did not care for the reason just the amount I had asked. My next shift I came in an still received attitude for asking a question for a guest who was not happy for the lack of communication so later that day I quit because I did not feel happy, respected, and understood at this establishment."
bad,Decent work environment depends on managers you are working with. When you get into upper bonus hurdles pay is great but if you don't sell the draw adds up and you must pay company back
bad,"No benefits, no overtime, no room for advancement, underpaid and have plenty of experience. No pto, no vacation or holidays off. No 401k no sick days."
bad,love the company but job was temp. mangers was awesome and the staff was great. had a wonderful experience learned a lot about the company and the services they offer
bad,"Great place helping guest daily making sure that they have everything that they need to make there stay one of a kind."
bad,"they needed more employees but didnt want to pay anymore besides that and i feel like i was cheated by not clocking in and out i would work there again if i had to , tina patel was a great supervisor i love her"
bad,Its a good place to start off. Not somewhere to be for the rest of your life unless you want to be in management or sales. Strange dynamic. Fast paced most of the time but definitely some down time.
bad,"In this role, I was always working to keep accounting up to date. There was a lot of prior records to review and collect on.  I did collected a great deal of direct bills from different airlines, and provided ample documentation to ensure no direct bills were missed in the future. I worked closely with the front desk team to ensure a paperwork trail, even trained front desk personnel on advanced settings and operations."
bad,"I worked with Wyndham through private property ownership as a hotel manager. I do not have much experience in working with Wyndham directly, only through the Days Inn flag."
bad,"It's never a dull moment there, and i miss working there! The phone calls, the insurance contact, helping customers with their issues and concerns. It's just a great environment to be in."
bad,I really don't know what to say.  Super 8 in Branson West is no longer a Wyndham property.  They are now known as the Lake View Inn.  They dropped their association with the Wydham brand.
bad,"how do you treat people with so much disrespect and expect them to continue showing up, the floor managers are ok, unit managers feel like you are dirt."
bad,"Front desk associate, on the third shift, I was the only employee on duty. Could have used support staffing at busy periods, also security personnel would have been appreciated."
bad,Very unorganized and the pay was poor you had to sell in order to even get some type of pay. All they cared about was you selling thei stuff and buying their products the ones you had to sell to make presentations with. did not enjoy it at all.
bad,This is the worst company to work for.  The manager is very rude and acts like nobody is smart enough to book someone in and out of their rooms.  She would watch the cameras the whole night and if you was with a guest and she couldn't hear everything then she would call and ask 20 questions.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,They provided great benefits however the overalll sector that I was working for had a high turnover and wasn't fully representing the product. I wouldn't recommend this company to many people .
bad,At home work.. Set up at home with computer and phone .. Must pay for your own internet .. Minimal raises.. Low base pay.. High customer servce expectations
bad,"This job was very difficult for me, not because of the work but because of the people I worked with and the people in positions above me. The manager and owner were not in sync about alot of things, leaving myself and my coworkers flapping in the wind alot. I was responsible for making and filing guest reservations, filing other paperwork and answering business phones. Assisting customers as well. That part was easy and great. I learned from this position that I love doing clerical work and would love to work in that type of position from now on."
bad,"Typical night consisted of checking our guests in and out while making reservations for them as well, balancing of the days postings, and emailing the daily reports to management and ownership"
bad,You are by yourself most days so it can be challenging to give customers the best stay. You meet and see people from all over the states and get to hear about their travels.
bad,"Pay is poor, work is repetitive, and store management is left to be desired. Customers also can act entitled more than they should"
bad,hotel would be better once remodeling is finished guest complaints on rooms and housekeeping front deskcatches more slack from guest on this and when reported to management nothing is done due to being family members working housekeeping we need a supervisor over housekeeping to clear a lot of issues with the rooms. The owner is very nice to work for but need to follow through with the changes he states he wants to make with management and housekeeping
bad,"Customer service and guest relations, checking in guest and making sure they were comfortable as well as filing paperwork."
bad,"the typical day at work can vary day to day, just like it can job to job. my last job my typical day would have been making beds cleaning bathrooms and vacuuming and light dusting"
bad,Fun place to work but timeshare sales just wasn't for me. Great friendships established though.
bad,"I travel "
bad,Was trying to run motel without the manager around. When they started training me they had other workers try to train me instead of the management.
bad,Not a very friendly company to work for. only worked for this company for about a year part-time.
bad,"Waited on customers, served there food, took payments, and cleaned tables."
bad,"I worked for this hotel before Wyndham bought it and turned it to a Super 8. Granted, I still work here, but it's not the best. Management is completely ridiculous. I had a great relationship with everyone before they took over the hotel and weeded out every previous employee to be replaced with their own. The whole place is just a hoard of people who have no idea what they are doing. Pay here is bi-weekly now, which I hate. I am currently on leave for remodeling and have been for two months. Nobody from management has called me to let me know anything at all. I do NOT recommend working for this employer. Not in Madison, at least."
bad,"This job was very boring. There wasn't a lot of business at my time of emploment, the owners had just taken over the business. Overall it was ok. I had to leave due to the hours."
bad,"checked in customers, handled issues, checked out customers, collected payments, made reservations"
bad,"I would scan,fa, email, make reservations, book rooms, do check in and check outs, flod laundry, set up breakfast if on midnight shift."
bad,The work days are extremely long. We are understaffed in the pool area. We work ever single weekend and it is a struggle to get time off. Depending on the weekend and the manager depends on the rules that we have to play by. The customers often complain at the lack of control in the pool area and there is nothing that we can do about it because there is not enough people to staff the pool area. Co-workers have negative attitudes because we are all so severely underpaid for the work that we have to do. Not to mention we never have a manager there on Sundays when most people are checking out.
bad,"Cleaned rooms, low pay for work load expected per person. People were ok to work for, co workers were nice & friendly."
bad,"I have mixed feelings about my time working at the Hotel. We had a few different owners of the property, it didn't seem very organized or structured. Perhaps it has changed."
bad,"As an employee I enjoyed working with Wyndham, however I did not feel supported with my career advancement goals. It felt as if they were content to pay a supervisors rate for the Assistant Manager duty's, and they removed the position that would have been the next level of advancement from one department, citing budget, while simultaneously adding secondary assistant manager position in another department."
bad,Overall it is a great place to work if and only if you fit in their company image and get along with management.  Also poor guidance from management does not help your cause to advance and learn.  Daily work can be monotonous but many positions tend to be that way.  The hardest part of the job was not having the right chemistry in the department I was in.  The job did have great benefits and pay was descent.
bad,"I typical day at work began at nine in the morning and most of the time I ended my day around  four o'clock in the afternoon. I was very fast and time aware, so this made me work at a level that got the rooms done faster and adequate."
bad,"very fast paced environment, learning new things everyday, went from housekeeping supervisor to manager within 6 months. great opportunitys"
bad,"Management Sergio Garcia is great I just didn't like the pay for all we did its too much work with little pay."
bad,It was just this location and its not called this. It was called the Ramada Inn. And it was the owner and their son. They did people dirty then lied to them. I don't believe in renting rooms with bed bugs and I would close those rooms only for their son to re open and rent them to guest. He took money from people. Charged them more then policies spoke. Just was rude to people coming and going and I don't believe in that. So I left
bad,Wyndham is a Billion dollar company that’s only motivation is to make more money. They lack care and safety precautions for their employees and often keep contract administrators in the office for 10 to 12 plus hours with no warning.
bad,I loved the people I worked with however the owners of the building and wyndham alone need to realize that they have to keep up on the rooms to not always get bad reviews. Hearing gues complain about the toilets and the beds and the sinks is not a good thing. Espceially when you have no controll over any of it and the owners dont seem to have any desire to fix the issues. Plus you only get paid 3.50 per room and you only really make money when you are fast at doing rooms and get more rooms done in a hour.  Part of working in hospitality is you get laid off every winter or more less on call because you cant claim unemployment because the owners wont allow you to get it. you dont really get any benefits except for discounts at other wyndham hotels.
bad,"My job consisted of Stripping the linens from the room into an industrial sized basket. I also had to removed all the leftover food and garbage from the room, You'd be giving 8 rooms per day and 8+ if someone didn't show up to work. Time management is key if you want to get all the rooms stripped and your dirty linens back to laundry room before you leave work."
bad,"I've been in sales quite a bit, timeshares is a sensitive topic to try and sale because your dealing with thousands of dollars a sale. It's warm leads, but you really need to have good experience to puul off a sale."
bad,I love working for any place that I can do housekeeping cuz I have and always loved to do cleaning they have good workers and they listen to everything that u need help with if u want help or need it
bad,I enjoyed the work I did along with my coworkers and supervisors. I got to know some of the owners on a first name basis and it had a family atmosphere while working there.
good,I worked over nights as a auditor and was only paid $9.00 an hour. Staff was rude and disrespectful. Manager was ALWAYS condescending. Owners nephew was constantly high and or drunk while on duty!
good,depending if its a privately owned hotel or if its actually ran dirrectly with whyndam is really what it comes down to. if its ran by indians ima go ahead and say poor pay no benefits no sick days and job wont be secure
good,I worked for a super 8. Of course for a front desk manager I didnt make the pay I was entitled to. Its a ok job if you like customer service and dealing with people
good,You have to cleans rooms 30 minutes or less. It is a fast paced job. You would get your chart of rooms and never know when your shift is over. Must work every weekend.
good,Overall the company is a good company.  Pay is reasonable to take care of monthly expenses.  Customers were mostly pleasant.  Staff workers are polite to work with.  Work scheduling isn't fair as it should be. And managment doesn't help. Always a new manager.
good,"new management cut all hours, demanded i work even when i had requested off in writing a month in advance, then threatened to fire me if i did not work."
good,Everyday I do the same type of work. I clean rooms and bathrooms. I am trying to do my best. I learned how to work in a team. And I improved my language. Management at this hotel is polite and helpful. In summer time I have a lot of work to do. In winter time i have only about 10 hours per week and it does not make me satisfacted. My team is very nice. I like to work with some of them. In the hotel there is not hard part of work. The most enjoyable part of the work is that I help customers and i talk to them.
good,constantly on the move i learned how important it was to make sure the rooms were very sanitary. worked alone the hardest part of the job was not knowing what or who was left in the rooms. i really enjoyed my boss having lunch with us and helping when we didn't know what to do next.
good,"As an on-site general manager, there was never a dull moment nor a moment off work. I enjoyed my work and my work family, we had a great working relationship. I learned how to balance enormous responsibility and lead a team in accomplishing goals. Seeing our hard work come together for the betterment of our company was my reward."
good,"Most days started out by finding out how many rooms was needed to be cleaned. You only get 30 minutes to clean a room. Not enough time when the room is filthy. No weekends off on busy times of the year, and you might as well be dying if you call in."
good,"Enjoyed working nights for the first month or so , the low wages and lack of staff made it impossible to enjoy the job, also the place lacks in organisation and no one seems to care or do anything about it."
good,It was an everyday job. But very difficult as well because bosses and headhousekeepers only care about themselves and want to only help themselves to succeed.
good,To much work to do for no more money than you got payed. Hotel needs some improvements. It was to much walking up and down stairs.Didnt like having to work your first day of 8 or 9 hours for free.
good,"If you are a loyal employee and never call off or are late you get treated terribly and taken advantage of versus someone who does the opposite. You are treated like you are stupid and talked down to all the time. If you say no then you are ""punished"" for weeks. If your duties run past your scheduled work time you will not get paid for working. The environment is extremely hostile. You are made to do duties that belong to others including management with no compensation. Your education does not matter to management...you are not utilized to the best of your abilities. I have stayed and tolerated to get the necessary training and skills to be able to go elsewhere."
good,"Fair"
good,"It was not a great place to work, no raises were given for long periods of time job was in danger for asking for a raise.management was very absent. There was no back up for issues with guests."
good,"Phones constantly ringing off the hook, while supervisors and leads are playing around and having fun.  MIcromanage employees and was mislead about advancement opportunities."
good,Just couldn't get a raise to stay there left me no choice to quit I cleaned rooms and worked in the laundry room strip rooms kept my girls busy
good,work was hard management didn't care and costumers can be rude
good,"long and hard day.how to work in a bad place and make the best woth what you got."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking reservations, check in and out customers, cleaning lobby, taking complaints, helping with anything i could to make a customers stay the best."
good,"too much to do and not enough time; co-workers were nice, but did not care for the job itself."
good,"A typical day at work for me involves checking in the guests, setting reservations, and handling guest issues as they arise. Overall I enjoy being there for the guests."
good,"I like to work hard and there is plenty of that in a hotel, you learn something new everyday, and there is a lot of diversity in a hotel atmosphere, workers were friendly."
good,"*Greet all guest checking in or out. Take payments, make shift end deposits if cash has been received, preform the night audits closing of day, set up the breakfast bar at 5am.  Handle all incoming calls, book reservations. Deal with guest complaints and solve issue if at all possible or turn over to the manager. "
good,"Management needs to improve. They can’t be bothered by anything. "
good,I worked there for 1 year and never received a pay raise. I was told during the interview process that I would get a raise after 90 days but I never got it.
good,The management wasnt experience or educated enough to have become manager material. I believe they had no one else willing to fill the job and they put them theee
good,"The position is not hard to do, however they constantly push you on the sales and if you are not meeting the goals you get coachings. The pay is not equivalent to what most customer service positions pay."
good,"All I've got to say is that the pay is horrible ( barley enough to live on, some months NOT enough ) and trying to get a shift covered is a real hassle because there's never enough people hired there to make a difference."
good,Training is minimal.  Top producers are given preference over new sales reps. It is difficult for new reps to improve. Turnover is very high. Senior Reps try to become involved with new reps sales to split the commission.  Managers ignore the sales reps.
good,Made to do more than job description. Did things above and beyond my job. Was never appreciated for the things I did. When a situation was taken to management. Was going to keep the offender on the payroll.
good,it was a fun place to work. not stressful at all really. i enjoyed meeting new people everyday. i went on leave to have a baby and when i came back my position had been filled by my bosses brother and his wife. i was then offered an overnight position which i couldnt take due to having a new born baby.
good,"It was a laid back work atmosphere, management really wasn't there to help out when needed the help. No problems with other employees. Pay wasn't well, for night shift."
good,"Front Desk at any Hotel you work very hard with little to no appreciation from the ownership, you will do many task that should require more then one person to perform."
good,while my time working at super 8 the management was new and the job was very easy very slow and very boring. not many customers would check in and all i had to make sure i ran the audit overnight. and set up breakfast and clean the lobby.
good,"The only reason to work at this hotel is for a paycheck. There are not any benefits such as vacation pay, bereavement pay, sick pay, paid time off, etc. And after working here for almost 5 years, I still only make $9.50 an hour even though I work 3rd shift. The only advancement in position is for me to take the assistant manager position which would require me to work 2nd shift, and have less time with my family."
good,"Very nice working with people with kind heart .No work pressure  , less stress , Flexible working hours but poor management , no growth ,nothing to learn much ."
good,"A typical day at work starts with drama and negativity."
good,Management was horrible lucky they have hired a new general manager since my time at baymont! long hours no training at all glad to be gone
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that all my fellow employees liked me a lot because I helped them a lot with their duties so that we can increase speed to get the job done and also help our guest who need anything. I loved my job.
good,"As a young adult I've learned that it's ok for someone to tell you what to do, you need that sometimes. I've learned to be more coherent from this job. I love the fact that I can work alone and get more of my work done"
good,"My day would start after dropping kids off at school then work cleaning 16 rooms sometimes more, efficently and in a timely fashion."
good,Uncomfortable place to work at. A lot of bad things were going on.
good,"Not my most favorite place to work. Previous management was awesome and fair. New management was demanding and mean."
good,It was slow and easy for the most part. You were left to learn on your own and hope you were doing everything right. The owners of this particular store were not in it to help customers and did not treat customers or employees very good at all. my coworkers were great and they worked hard. my manager was a very hard worker and made sure the customers came first.
good,"Worked for a roof over my head "
good,"A typical day at the hotel would include meeting, greeting and talking to many kinds of people along their travles. This was my most favorite part of the job cause im a people people and i love talking with people. I learned many ways to better myself and handle my stresses in a very professional manner, the least favorite thing was there was no communication and no one was ever on the same ""page"" with what the rates were at certain points and it made it very stressful and unenjoyable."
good,the people who know how this place runs are never willing to help  and leave new people in dark.
good,"A typical day consisted of me checking in guests and running the nightly audit reports. I also did laundry, cleaned the lobby, and ran the morning breakfast. My manager was great. Very laid back and flexible. I didnt have any co-workers as i worked nights and was alone. The hardest part of this job was the third shift schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the different people from all over the world."
good,"Night audit and first shift customer service agent. Check guest in and out, set up and breakdown breakfast handle any complaints by the guest. balanced the books. I learned how to communicate with people, and work in a hotel. the management was just there. no hard part to the job"
good,Loved my co workers loved to work anytime loved the people that would come in.
good,Working at the Wyndham has been a pleaseure. My only problem is that there is no room for advancement and i really would like to improve on all my customer service and operational skills.
good,"The owners live there with there children, the little kids come out bother you well your trying to work, they yell at each other a lot. Break time is the time that your not doing laundry or desk duties. You have to ask for your work schedule although they will change it last minute threw out the week anyways and tell you that its changed they never ask because their life matters they act as though you don't have one. I got yelled at once for telling them I couldn't work the Monday coming up due to a out of town doctors appointment, I was yelled at for not telling them sooner even though I'd told them four days before and they hadn't giving me a schedule to work around for making the appointment, they wouldn't give me it off and made me work until the last possible minute that I could leave to be on time assuming traffic was perfect, I was 20 minutes late to the appointment. I was told I would have every third weekend off been working there four months and haven't had any even after asking, Ive had them tell me after showing up for a shift that they decided to go to Niagara falls to marine land for the day so they tell you instead of 11pm (when i should be off) your going to have to work until two am, you cant argue this cause there is no one else there and there already gone. the other desk girl that we had they had issues with so rather then confronting her them self's they would complain to me and ask me to deal with it, they are the owners and management, I am a min wage desk clerk so this isn't my job to deal with those problems me and this girl were of equal level authority"
good,assisting customers
good,"cashier, customer service with ex-change and return, go on the sale floor, assist customer in the fitting room."
good,it was great work place meeting people from around the world.
good,"nothing was in order nor organized, bar was closed, restaurant was closed, supervisors and management was hardly there."
good,"I checked in and out guest, made reservations, light maintenance, light housekeeping, daily audit with daily deposits. I really enjoyed meeting people from all over."
good,Schedules are such that time with family can be very limited for those that actually do their job.  Job can be extremely stressful for those who do the work.
good,Didn't last long loved the boss she was an awesome lady it's just a lot of favoritism a lot of gossiping going on a lot of talking about people is like you had to really go to work on your working on your pins and needles to try to make sure that the day went by without somebody all in your business
good,"While working here i have come to known my other co-workers some have the greatest work ethics and other not as much. But the moment someone has a chance they will throw you under the bus to cover their own bottems, as well as let other influences effect their job. But other than that the pay was inconsistent and was underpaid to be 24/7 maintenance"
good,Work currently for one of the brands under wyndham Destinations. I really have nothing to say cause it is one of the franchises where I don't know if they are fully responsible for what they do.
good,"Working by myself in the laundry room was good, allowing me to keep it clean and organized. Working the front desk was good as I was able to provide excellent service to guests. The pay was ok, the management had their own issues they needed to work on. Overall it was a decent work experience."
good,"The job was cool and productive for the most part, the pay was average and most of my co-workers were amazing and easy to get along with but it can sometimes get stressful."
good,"Didn't receive any benefits, the manager couldn't make her mind up and would forget what she said to do then yell at you for doing it. Other than that, it was my favorite job."
good,I worked as a night auditor. The general manager made me cry because I wasn’t “dressed properly “ I had worn something that I would as if I were still in cosmo school. I also got my hours cut. I asked if I could pick up more shifts. It never happened. I also gotten extremely sick from working night shift cause I wasn’t able to sleep.
good,A typical day at work with customers was great. The management sucked. I learned alot about customer service and really enjoyed it. Management was horrible and would punish you even if you almost died and were in the hospital so had to take time off. Not understanding and would not pay correctly. We would not get lunch breaks because they said most of the job was sitting waiting for customers.
good,"Whatever they tell you during the interview process is completely different from how you will actually work. Please be careful if you decide to work for this company. Keep all records of anything you sign. Keep all records of any wrongdoing, because it does take place in this industry."
good,"Greeting customers, retrieving their reservations, assinging them rooms, helping them with any questions about our city. Learned how to meet professional people and keep their visits quiet and private. Management was not optional for part-time employees. Workplace was secured, nothing hard about the job, enjoyable part of the job was meeting celebrities face to face, getting their autographs and keeping their stay quiet."
good,"If you are a Vacation Planner it is not bad, the bonuses allow you to make pretty good money. However, if you move up in the company you are screwed. You lose the ability to bonus for a minimal promise of high $/hr rate, personally I lost a pretty penny each year by moving up, and I moved up from a tier 1 position to a tier 3 position. If you do move up it becomes a dog eat dog world where everyone (mgmt included) is just waiting for the right moment to stab you in the back so they can either advance themselves, or advance who ever brown noses the most. Management is never on the same page, no one ever knows what is going on, and you can get 4 different conflicting answers from each supervisor."
good,The hardest part of my job was trying to be the best that I can be when the best of my abilities simply was not good enough. they had a very strange way of handling things.
good,Empecé muy bien en este trabajo cuando nos pusieron una manager nueva y en menos de 48 horas la mano no le tembló para ponerle warning (corrective action). En menos de 3 meses saco a trabajadores dándole terminación en su puesto de trabajo para poner en sus lugares personas aliadas a ellas. Se me hace mucha falta de respeto puesto que esta señora saco a personas que llevaban años trabajando para la compañía.
good,"Basically cold calling all day long to sale 5k-100k timeshare its good when your making but can get boring if you don't always have something to buy, basically this job is meant for the person who cant seem to keep money in their pockets or always has something to buy or extreme spending habits"
good,"Hourly wage is barely enough to support yourself on your own, pay should be increased especially for night auditor. I do enjoy my job, I really just need better wages and room for growth."
good,"A typical day is counting money drawer, cleaning lobby area. Checking in guest and answering phone, Taking reservations over the phone. Making sure guest are comfortable,all needs are met. End of shift report is correct, If working night shift making sure night audit reports are ran and credit cards and cash are correct for that day."
good,"It's never enough . "
good,"The company itself is a great company. "
good,Working for this company was a learning experience for sure. It was a clean and safe place to work. The management at this location could have been better. A typical day at work usually went very smooth. I had so much experience when I started this job that it was pretty simple. The hardest part of the job would have to be the hours because I worked all night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the day would have to be the mornings when I had the opportunity to meet travelers from all over the world. I met some very interesting and amazing people from all over.
good,"At Wyndham you are paid on a pay that you have to pay back when you make sales. It is strictly a commission job when it comes to pay.  Most of the time they would tell us not even to clock in. You are not allowed to make your own marketing, and that can really stink.  If they do not have enough tours for the day, you may of just wasted your time even coming to work."
good,often i was the only person in the whole hotel working and my manager was mean. also there was another employee that seemed to make her entire life about making me feel worthless
good,"I say that this place is good to get your feet in so that you can obtain the experience needed to go to a higher star rating hotel. The hardest part of the job, is dealing with the constant complaint of how the rooms are. You were never sure if the guest you checked in room was good. The place is busy since it is a pit stop for guest catching an connecting flight or going on a cruise."
good,"Not enough man power."
good,"Like any job, it had its ups and downs. Management didnt pay based on hard work, drive, adaptability, but getting the most for less. One great part of the job was the networking."
good,"Be ready for unpredictable working hours, unpredictable management, and lower pay. Your co workers are great. And always willing to help.. every shift the whole resort has to attend a event called ""Stand up"". It where they fill you in about what's happening around the resort.. It get old really quick and childish. Most people don't care for it at all. Be ready for all the audits, QA Audit, LP Audit,and  one more. I forgot the name of...be ready to put your life aside for the needs of the resort. Snow, low staff, meeting etc. also there is a high turn over... most people going to other jobs that value family life. Just consider this, working at a resort you are at the mercy of the guest, because you get paid by the owners, the managers that leave on time every day and not consistent with anything but wants to create a Count on me culture. I figured out 7 months into this it was not for me. Maybe my 16 year old sister."
good,This company was okay to work for the pay was not very good and the management did not really seem to care for employees the hours were not very good slow season ppl hours for cut back a ton witch alow season was holiday season so that hurt us a lot
good,"I love working in the hotel business, I get to meet new people and make their stay wonderful. Been working for this hotel for over 20 years, again love the family ran business part about this hotel"
good,It  was ok working with different people and to be able to provide great customer service. The hours were ok and the pay was bi-weekly.
good,"found nothing special about tis place, I was the only one who went above and beyond his job title to please the guest. We usually catered to contracted groups do there was usually noise complaints form the family groups that were staying with us, because there was a strip club right nest door."
good,"When you work in the customer service industry, team work is everything. A typical work day included taking care of clients, review accounts information, answering calls, multitask,  review and make reports."
good,My co workers are amazing. Management does not appreciate their employees. No chance of advancement.The managers do not appreciate their employees. No breaks. No set schedule. Pay is low with raises being given seldom.
good,"Lack of management support"
good,"it is nice being able to travel around the country and stay at wyndham hotels for 40% off...."
good,Did my job correct and in a timely matter. Very little communication and always short staffed. No appreciation from management or owners.
good,"Assisting guests with billing questions. "
good,Very stress full even for entry level positions and never given necessary materials. management cant pass standards review blames others.
good,"I enjoy working for Wyndham Vacation Ownership, and appreciate having an employer that recognizes my professional capabilities, and lets me utilize my skills on a daily basis. The only down falls from this employer is the salary and that there is no room for advancement or growth."
good,learned how to deal with multi cultured people and language barrier
good,"Easy money, slow calls, easy shifts, bad environment...Bad Managers..."
good,i learned how to be systematic and enjoy working with my co-workers.  They are helpful.
good,Enjoyed meeting new guest from all over the world. Management was  not supportive of advancement. During my time working for the company I have seen many employees and management behave unprofessional on the job.
good,"I would clean rooms help others, I how would usually learn a different method of cleaning. It might easier and more useful. My co-workers were great we all got along and did a great job. To clean all day and many rooms, then realize it's 6pm and you still have another 10 rooms to go. When all the rooms were clean you who they were clean the right way."
good,"A typical day at Days Inn consisted of working at the front desk and helping all the guests who needed assistance. I learned how to use a company email, put breakfast out for the guests, and how to clean in a very efficient manner. The management was so bad there, my manager barely worked with me when I needed him to although I was always there when he needed me to be. My co-workers were very nice and fun to work with, but most of the time I was at the front desk alone. The hardest part of the job was to help the guests when I worked overnight, because there was no 24-hour maintenance person and I had to do a lot of tasks which I was unsure how to do. I got the job done and satisfied my guests in the process. What I enjoyed the most about this job was the close interaction with the guests."
good,Typical day is long and hard on your body. Learned a great deal about working with the public. Management is good if you work hard for them. Co-workers are great.
good,I find myself coming to work for the people I work with and not the company I work for. I was hired on as a reservationist which over the years has turned into the complaints department. I am overly stressed by people who feel they were forced into purchasing a timeshare and the repetitive job of answering phones all day. I make sure whoever I am talking to is getting absolute customer service and the most out of their timeshares.I make it my personal goal to make everyone happy and feel appreciated by Wyndham Vacation Ownership.
good,"the pay is excellent, if you can handle being in a work environment that only respects you when are producing great results and not care then this is the place for you. The pay is amazing and the benefits they just need better management."
good,"Training is done a little at a time. We have been promised more money and it hasn't happen and no benefits."
good,The management would steal your tips and they couldnt keep housekeepers ever. They rarely had enough laundry and even tho u had assigned carts people would use yours or steal from your cart.
good,it was a fun place to work but not enough hours and the pay was low. no insurance that would get offered to you. They dont offer anything else no discounts for anything. the drive wasnt worth the pay.
good,Its was good its was a good job. The managment sucked at the time so it didn't last. I would love to go back though.when I work there there was a skam the front desk  clerk and housekeeper would pull with the tips so that sucked cause it was a rip.off with throttle but of pay you get for the job
good,"The current marketing manager at this location is not professional about his job, nor is he willing to learn new programs. His lack of leadership and decision making makes it very difficult for all the staff in our department."
good,"It was a very good learning experience. Not to let small things get to you, especially when you deal with lots of people a day that stay at the hotel."
good,The property needed way to much work for what was put in to it. The job/life balance was nonexistent. The staff needed a lot of work and my level of trust and authority was too minimal to make necessary changes.
good,Work environment unfairly setup and not evenly balanced for team environment as a whole. Boiler room type arrangement wher they pit employees against eachother to ry and produce more results. Good pay opportunities but either are ont the top or the bottom w8th no middle class
good,"Enjoyed the work, but needed better management. Housekeeping had alot of problems, and employees need better training. Work load was to much at times due to other employees not doing their job."
good,"Very competitive, high volume sales, very aggressive, working long hours till I basically ''sell something"". The good part is that I had an ocean right in front of me"
good,"As long as you are producing god results and don't rock the boat at all, you'll be fine.  They will make promises about income or work conditions, but from my experience, that is all they all - promises."
good,Management was not ideal. Hours were not flexable. Other co-workers were impossible to get along with and had horrible customer service skills. No benefits offered
good,"A typical day consisted of receiving calls from clients to make payments as well as outbound calls to clients, to achieve payments. I gained experience in that aspect and that was about it. Management was very closed off or not present most of the time and often left the long days to leads or assistants. "
good,"It was a job. I went there worked, got my check and that's it. The managers were weird. Kind of got a bad vibe off them but i just kept to myself. I will tell you this through the owner is VERY cheap instead of buying new vacuum cleaners to clean the hotel rooms with he had them sweeping the hotel rooms out with brooms."
good,"It's an alright company. I'm sure my location and management make a huge difference in my work experience. I feel that if I was in a better location with proper management, I would enjoy this job a whole lot more. Being part of Wyndham is nice as far as employee discounts go as long as the other hotel offers them. However, the pay sucks, insurance is way too expensive to afford, very limited vacation time (and only after being employed for a year). It averages the days you work. So, if you have a boss like mine that only schedules you 4 days a week to ""avoid overtime"", you only get 4 days of vacation after a year. That doesn't include the fact that you work anywhere from 10-18 hours a day in those 4 days."
good,"Management in my department was always in chaos."
good,"If you dont have kids you get screwed with mandatory overtime. Never a set schedule.  Hours sucked, was not hired for graveyard shift. Got stuck doing it anyways."
good,The culture at this particular location was poor. Competition is welcomed but you are almost getting screwed by the people who are supposed to be helping you the most. Lots of unqualified people being sent in and deals being blown up to protect others numbers. Can go weeks without seeing a qualified tour.
good,It  was  a  nice  property.    No  employee  parking  or  meal  programs  or  discounts.   Very  stressful  with  minimal  pay  and  too  many  hours.
good,Not the greatest company to work at. There were no benefits and the pay was minimum wage. Other than that loved my job. You had no paid time off or benefits. The work environment was great. I would of stayed if the pay was better and my hours were guaranteed.
good,This is a timeshare company. Your expectation and  of the company performance and promised delivery are completely aligned with what we know about timeshare industry.
good,"Overall, I enjoy my work experience. If the opportunity for advancement is available, I will stay employed. Unfortunately, I fear that opportunities are slim."
good,"Typical day is very fast pace.  No training.  Gossip and drama.  Benefits are very good.  Insurance not so good, but typical.  Management is ok.  Good discounts."
good,"This review is in regards to working at Days Inn or Travelodge North of Downtown Seattle. My experience at Wyndham showed the company is run at a different standard than Marriott or Starwood brands. They typically try to minimize customer interactions; so agents are left with very few opportunities to make a lasting impression on guests. If up to standards, a Wyndham hotel can be an efficient and lucrative venture."
good,Everyday was different there were challenges each day that needed to be sorted out. THe culture was very different then what I was used to working at. It has alot to offer if it was located in a different area. The most enjoyable thing about the job was creating the culture and having the rights to the entire establishment.
good,This place has so much potential but the management is horrible so it makes it hard to keep staff interested in staying motivated. Management often times lacks empathy for employees.
good,At Ramada Plaza Resort there wasn't much place for advancement and there isn't very good pay at all.I switched jobs at that particular time because I wasn't getting paid much. However I did like my managers.I was fairly treated and also got along very well with the rest of the employees there.
good,"Enjoy chatting anfd helping guest and co-workers, Mostly work alone, feel a part of the team even though I work alone, learn something new and interesting majority of the time. co-workers from all different departments are really friendly, great experience in the hospitality field, good at situation problem solving, fun helping guest with: sight seeing information, boarding passes, any information they may need, working in diferent resorts in Newport, ,"
good,Very inconsistent hours and workloads. Pay is not adequate for amount of work done.  Supervisor is not consistent. Very segregated a d show of favoritism.
good,"This is a very easy job for anybody with good interpersonal skills. A typical day includes checking guests in and out, taking reservations, and handling third party (Hotwire, Travelocity, Priceline, etc.) work while also dealing with guest complaints. You'd think angry guests would be the hard part of the job, but no - the hardest part is dealing with the unwillingness of management to spend a single penny on problems. Room maintenance is non-existent, and most complaints aren't addressed or fixed, so they reoccur continuously. The best part of the job is the diverse group of people you meet: travelers, businessmen, lovers, students. As you work alone on most shifts, this job is best for somebody who doesn't need a team atmosphere to thrive."
good,"In my opinion you do what you have to do in order to provide for your family. But it would not be my 1st choice for employment. I want say I would never go back, but hope I never have to."
good,"The franchise department of Wyndham Hotel Group is a mixed bag, if you are at a flagship property, you have nothing to worry about - however if you are at a smaller property the amount of hoops which have to be jumped through in order to get anything done (MAYBE) is asinine.  The support offered by Wyndham to their Franchise Hotels is pitiful at best, and criminal at worst.  "
good,"As much as i hate writing reviews upon past employment."
good,Management was not the best there. employee appreciation was lacking and turnover rate was high due to that fact. multiple shifts available and management did work with you the best that they could when it came down to managing your schedule
good,"I enjoy not having someone hover to tell me the things to do, I am a good independent worker"
good,"I was always busy, and was always doing a different task. Some days were very busy, yet some were a bit more laid back. I got to meet a lot of different people, including famous people."
good,Typical day there was overload of work and strict time line to complete. I learned skills in Customer service and how to adjust to very strict guidelines. the management could use a lot of work. The hardest part of the job was not having enough materials to complete the task at hand and having to go back every day for an hour to put items that had been left out. The Most enjoyable part of this job was being able to meet the demands of guests.
good,The job was great the company sucked.  You rarely works less then 12 hour shifts.  I go mandated almost every day I worked.  They were not fair with ho they mandated.
good,it was a hectic work place. the management could use some work. it could be a great place to work but it wasn't just at the time.
good,Some of the management are very rude and have bad attitude. when I was working there I loved it but I couldn't stand all the favoritism and mean coworkers.
good,"It has been very stressful, have been overworked and understaffed. Management is a mess, since we got the new manager. Supplies are scarce and so is linen along with the linen service damaging our products. Overall the hotel itself has not been the best for the past couple of months, have had way better positice reviews from our guests when we were with the older company and brand. Most of the housekeepers get up to 20+rooms and are given a timeline to finish 20+rooms. Never get a chance to eat lunch due to the amount of rooms and hours we are expected to finish by."
good,Management is not very good at scheduling. Not very willing to work with employees needs. Only one person per shift. Couldn't get enough hours
good,"Work independently on specific resorts. Co-workers not adequately trained and management does not have any training skills."
good,"Every store is different, however my experience was not that amazing but not horrible either. They would hire not to many brilliant people which made it a challenge but then again it tough me a lot of patience and customer service skills."
good,"The job is fast paced at times and can be very fulfilling. Enjoy the guests and meeting new people daily. Hardest part about the job is dealing with those guests who come in the door already not going to be satisfied no matter how good the service is or what you do to make it right. The best part of the job is when you have a guest thank you for the little things you do for them that to me was just being a good person, like listening to them when they are having a bad day or telling them how nice they look today. Management does not communicate well with each other and does not abide by it's own rules. Also they do not apply the rules to all employees across the board. They play favorites and let rules slide with some employees and are strict when it comes to the rules with other employees and don't follow their own rules themselves but expect the employees to follow them. You have to lead by example."
good,Coming in to a day of work at Days Inn always had me anxious. I never knew what was going to happen when  I walked into the door. I am hoping the visitors had not left complaints that I had to handle. It was nice to get to know a lot of the visitors for their reasons were to stay and get treatment at the Mayo Clinic. I mostly enjoyed that.
good,"While I worked here, management gave almost no feed back or critiques on work quality, work was often distributed unevenly among workers. Difficult to completely clean each room in allotted times.  A lot of gossip among co-workers.  Almost always little work on slow days. Also the pay was low."
good,"I worked at this hotel for only 3 months and typical shift would include the usual duties involved with being a Night Auditor, along with all the duties that come with being a cook, maid/house keeper, front desk associate, manager and security. Being the only employee in the entire building can be extremely exhausting; causing you to be the sole person who has to take of EVERTHING. Assuming you have the time to take care of all of this, as you spend most of it tinkering with the outdated technology that simply wouldn't work half the time, causing you to mess your entire job up some nights. "
good,The owner is cheap and refuses to hire me some help. I currently put in close to 200 hours every two weeks. He takes complete advantage of his employees.
good,"Worked here at Super 8 while I was a college student.  Honestly, this was one of the easiest jobs that I have ever had.  Moved to Texas once I graduated.  The manager, however, had no idea what she was doing.  I'm still trying to figure out to this day how she managed a hotel, but she was VERY inexperienced and rude to hotel guests."
good,overall the pay was decent and the hotel was nice. guest complaints were low but the management was terrible and there was no security in the job. your hours varied from week to week and there was no chance of advancement.
good,Poor money for a lot of work. A change in management has meant we are managed top down which isn't very pleasant.
good,i was happy with my job here but not with the management they couldnt run things smoothly and efficiently
good,"A typical day was usually pretty good, minus the occasional head bumping and not being able to show my full potential as well as be shown all I needed in order to advance my learning. Management...well was fluent and knew the business, but I believe became lost and no longer able to do their duties as a manager, trainer or a leader."
good,"Not a clean place ...,Do all kind of work..Room is dirty,,,basement is a real mess ..Water on the floor"
good,The timeshare industry has always had it's struggles. Working for wyndham worldwide has proven no different.  
good,"a typical day at the Travelodge would be checking in and out guest. Document cash and credit card transactions. Answer telephone calls and make reservations. I worked by myself at this location, it was one employee a shift due to the Hotel being at a small location. I did enjoy working with the co-workers when I had the opportunity to work with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customer complaints but I learned how to deescalate the situation when it became out of hand."
good,Not to much to say other than the scheduling is based on giving a person no life if your hired be prepared to be on nights for the duration of your stay 
good,They treat their employees like family but leave no room for advancement. It is a family run hotel and they have a staff of 3 people to run the front desk including the manager. This makes it very difficult to get time off. I do enjoy the clients and the staff but I am at the point where I need a career and not just a job.
good,"A typical day at work I greet guests as they come in the door, check them into their room. Make sure that their stay from the start to the end is just as if they were at home. Also answer phones, take reservations and enter them into the computer system, send confirmation emails and faxes. Calculate and enter housekeeping hours. Its a very fast paced work place and time goes by quickly."
good,Worked satisfactorily and passed the three month trial period.
good,"This company is known for a high turn-over rate. The owner is not very involved in the running of the business, but the managers do well without him. All-in-all, this is not a place I'd choose to work at again, but it was a good place to start my working life."
good,"Enjoyed customers and co workers. Was able to meet people from all over the world,"
good,"A typical day is making sure all the hotel is running smoothly with the staff members and getting the job done with all the rooms, common areas, and guests services."
good,"Manager was more interested in being friends with employees and using rooms for free. More worried about partying and bringing guys to unused rooms for personal grain. Instead of hiring people to actually work, hired her family and friends to hang out with and pay them when they didn't even show up to work..Make other people work harder."
good,"I receive and reconcile the monthly RCI and Interval International Exchange Company membership invoices. I also receive and process the CWP Point’s Conversion audit reports and the Wyndham Reward Points Redemption audit reports. Verifying that the credits have been applied to the member’s accounts, creating and mailing out letters to our members advising them of how these credits will be used. Reviewing member’s accounts, submitting refund requests for overpayments due to credits that were applied to the members accounts. I work as a backup for the following areas within the CWP Accounting Department: Refunds, CWP Accounts Research and Maintenance Fee reconciliation."
good,"Ramada is a great company to work for, but the hotel I am currently is has alot of improvement they need to make. Our reviews online are not so great which makes my job trying to sell the hotel harder. There is no benefits they offer to us. I learned alot about the front desk before I came here, and I already knew their systems because they used to be a holiday inn. I learned in sales how to sell meetings rooms with food and beverage and how to make a proposal and contract for companies with long term meetings. My coworkers are wonderful hard working people, the management is ok, our gm is always here and always willing to help, our sales director works from home so we do not get alot out of her. The hardest part of this job is selling due to the lack of staff we have and the poor quality rooms I have to sell as well as the guests reviews online. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we are all almost like family here, management understands when you personal affects in your home life, and everyone tries to help eachother help in every department."
good,Enjoyed my job but was hard due to having to carry supplies to the second floor without assistance of an elevator. Carts were heavy and facility only had one vacuum to use for the whole hotel.
good,They didn't have anything together. unhappy people to work with.
good,Fun environment was not very organized. People where amazing.it just seemed like most people where there to collect pay and leave
good,I enjoyed working there. Got to work alone. Enjoyed my regular guests. No benefits. No job security. Enjoyed a consistent schedule. Consistent off days.
good,When I worked there super poor management people would sit in the rooms they were suppose to be doing the management would make people that got done quick stay there and basically do an entire extra list  managers would also go sleep in the break room for hrs
good,Wage was not competitive.  I would only recommend this type of employment for a second job or for short period of time until another full time job is available.
good,The company and ethics and policies and culture that is advertised throughout the site and blasted via email and even conveyed to you by your Senior Management based in Australia is amazing and inspiring. It's a shame that local management only follows this at face value.
good,"A typical day would be receiving my assigned rooms for the day and go about cleaning. I have learned the required standards for room cleaning and strive to achieve them.  Most of the Management are nice.  The only problem is with the winter , your shifts are cancelled at the last minute and you don't get paid for that day."
good,my job here was unsatisfactory under the manager who i worked under  long hours and very small pay. attitude and outrageous expections. 135.00 every 2 weeks cant survive
good,I worked for days inn and Ramada. I loved the owners of days inn. Family owned nice people would give you the shirt off their back. Ramada was owed by a Indian we never saw him and we didn't get any benefits. He did give us a 15$ gift card for Christmas which was actually nice.
good,"You have to give it your all to work for them .Dedication is a must. Phone experience a must and patience. If you don't have a life before you work here, it becomes your life."
good,"Show up for your morning meeting, take your tours in waves, and at the end of the day you do some training. You greet your guests, grab them some food, sit down and get their vacation commitment, go over objections, ask for the sale, end tour."
good,The job was at times very rewarding at other times it was rather difficult.  The upper management did not always know how to motivate and energize the sale force.  There was always drama surrounding the sell floor.
good,a typical day at work was crazy it would involve going to a guest room to clean up something then i would be running to make something then i would be running to fix something
good,Being a night auditor would work late nights being a mother I was having a hats time balancing life with work fun place tho work met some really neat people
good,"mixed feelings abut it, was a job that payed ok but lots of stress and bare minimum staff on hand. some co workers were alright most did not know what they were doing."
good,"Baymont Inn and Suites was very convenient at the time the hours of 11-7 allowed me to work my full time job in addition it. "
good,when its good its good when its bad its bad. Be ready to weather the storm and take on challanges that are out of your control that will affect your paycheck monthly
good,"Hours are fairly flexible, direction is lacking, management is secluded, culture is very tenuous, no explanation for ""downsizing"", IT department lacking."
good,It was an average place to work. Hours were not flexible and the customers were sometimes very difficult to please. There were a lot of computer issues.
good,"when I worked there front desk staff were required to do laundry.  I understand now that they have regular staff to do that job, it was very hard on a busy night to keep up with the laundry and the customers."
good,"its not a bad job there is no policy and procedure guide to follow. the job itself is not hard but the guest are very rude and  threating at times, if everyone was on the same page I think that would stop."
good,this place is very nice. if you want to do on vacation this is the way to go. never will have any isssues of stress. The company is very professional.
good,It started out really good at first then you were able to  move up and grow with in the company and when someone else brought out the company things started get tied up in management holler hoops
good,Management was understanding. When work loads increased the work place became more cooperative. A environment of professionalism was protected by management and emploies were listened to.
good,"I loved my job! But the assistant general manager, that is to be the person of interest in a any type of situation, was constantly inadequate for her position. That place DESERVES a better manager and that place is going to fall apart because of said manager. Not a great place to work because of her."
good,"Min wage part time, I come when I'm called in for a shift.  I tend to work Night Shift auditing the day's transactions I also tend to fill in when another coworker requests a day off"
good,"It's a fast-paced, get rich quick environment with good benefits, decent staff, and crazy work hours. This timeshare environment should be perfect for fresh graduates and car salesmen/saleswomen that have the hunger of hustling."
good,"If you obtain a sales representative role be clear that certain customers only use the sales presentation you give as a complaint session about the product, website and are strictly only at your office for the gift they receive.  This is important if you work 5 days per week and see less than 5 customers in your given work week.  You are handicapped with limited ability to make a sale and the compensation plan requires at least one sale per week or it's not worth the effort."
good,Depends on your ethics value of your job. The HOA association differs from property to property and the HOA manager is a great influence on how an individual will exceed or fail. The HOA association will either give you the tools to succeed or fail.
good,"My daily Activity was housekeeping or Room attendant. In order to satisfaction to Customers it has to be open Face and more Welcomed. Sometime when  I Found Anything in the room Customer left, I  was Reported to the Management Right away"
good,The company was fairly decent just had a issue with the huge workload and low pay . The manager was really mean to me and it was hard for me to stay because of her attitude
good,poor management results in high turn over. They promise room for growth but nothing ever happens. Absolutely no advancements and the most important thing is theres NO benefits
good,"The staff and the clients are awesome to work with, there is just so much more that is outside my job description that is being asked of you. Many responsibilities that seem better suited for departments that are here to do these things."
good,"Could be an outstanding company to work for."
good,"Too much drama......very slow process to grow........favor certain groups of people.......high school mentality.......management runs by bullies........I was working in a wrong Industry........promote  greed, hypocrisy, drama, manipulation, deception....and other negative thoughts......Sorry I quit..... not for me .wasted my time in a wrong Industry."
good,The owners of this hotel are horrible.  They treat everyone terribly.  There is no place for job advancement.  Unfortunately bad bosses make great employees quit!
good,"Interesting people to work with."
good,Wasn't a great experience. Took over a month for pay and after would take me a week later to get my check after everyone already received theirs it wasn't a great experience.
good,Worked in Fresno CA and San Jose California Both offices closed down due to the lack of customers therefore it was hard to make sales. Nice management.
good,A typical day at work consisted of trying to talk customers into buying into a timeshare anyway you could.  I learned that some people will do anything to make a sale.  Management had their pros and cons depending on the day and their mood.  Pep meeting were very encouraging.  I truly enjoyed the people I met each day.
good,"Typical day was just depressing. Feels like your working for a huge corporation that doesn't really care about you. I learned a lot about sales and how these sort of huge companies do business. Management did their best but my experience consisted of mostly disorganization and confusion. I'd work here again just for the money though. It's a good deal, but the product wasn't really worth it in my opinion."
good,Management are only concerned about their positions with no room for advancement. I exposed many flaws in their DR and BCP plans which were sent under the rug.
good,"when i worked there it was good fast passed day, independent work, my co-workers liked to complain a lot but you can get that anywhere the hardest part of the job would be getting called in 15 minutes before your shift starts and it takes you half an hour to get there."
good,The lobby was always clean as were the rooms. I liked meeting people from all over the U.S. that stopped to stay there. I learned how to answer multi-line phone and how to use the fax machine.
good,"the managers at Days Inn Rutland, is dishonest and a huge fan of putting her employees down to make them more subservient. there is no compensation for overtime, there is no holiday pay, there is no incentive to do well in any position. the american staff was quickly replaced with indian ""family"" to save money by having them work off the clock if not for free. i will never work for an indian family again if it is going to be anything like this."
good,"I enjoy working with my colleagues and we all work together. Ilove meeting new people in this business. There really isn't any hard parts to this job, as long as you stay productive and have things in order you should be fine. There can be some rough days when we are sold out. The only disadvantage is that you can't move up or further your career and no raises"
good,"En tant que barmaid-réceptionniste au sein du Days Inn, je devais voir à la satisfaction des clients autant du côté du bar que du côté de la réception car sur certains quarts de travail, j'étais la seule employée dans tout l'hôtel. Ce qui m'a permis, entre-autre, d'acquérir une bonne gestion du stress. Le poste de réceptionniste m'a aussi donné la chance d'améliorer grandement mon anglais car environ 60% de la clientèle était anglophone, tandis que le poste de barmaid, m'a quant à lui, beaucoup appris sur moi-même comme étant une personne calme, dotée d'une grande écoute, dévouée, de confiance et qui adore plus que tout aider et travailler avec les gens. Voilà ce qui me passionnait dans ce travail que j'ai effectué pendant presque 7 ans. Par contre, les horaires de travail étant de soir/nuit (17:00 à 4:00 a.m.) devenaient de plus en plus difficile à vivre au quotidien et le fait d'avoir aucun avancement dans cette entreprise m'a remise en question face à ce travail."
good,"worked well with housekeepers, helped when asked,  enjoyed helping guests when asked for directions, good food establishments"
good,Long hours make for a dreary day. Very little support from management with little to no room to grow. Very demoralizing environment.
good,"I've learned a lot from my work, especially from my manager and from my co-workers, sometimes it's hard especially if there are lots of reservations."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers. The work is light, I learned a lot about preparation of food and customer service. The hardest part is managing the serving of customers in cramped area. I enjoy being able to provide quality service and compliments on the food."
good,"I went to work not because I enjoyed it, but to earn a paycheck. The management constantly would pick arguments with staff. Not a very stable work place. They would expect you to do things that were not described in your interview for what you would be doing on a normal work day."
good,"I have been working with the Super 8 for 5 years now I love my job and I am very good at it. I have to say though I have not got a raise in 2 years and I have been getting very rude unprofessional notes on my time card. I love working with people and doing paper work I do enjoy that part of my job. A typical day for my shift is I come to work I answer the phone, I keep the lobby neat and as clean as I can I also run our nighty paper work around 2am and I also set up our Super Start Breakfast every morning from 6 am to 9 am but I usually have everything out by 5 am as we have contractors and they get up early. I have learned so much at the Super 8, I have learned to improve my people skills as well as my computer skills. Management here can sometimes be very unprofessional as I said I get rude notes on my time card as well there is a notebook kept behind front desk with very rude comments in it. I do enjoy working with my manager though we learn a lot from one another my co-workers do the best they can everyday we all do and we grow and we learn new things from one another and we all try our best to work as a team but every job or company has there ups and downs. I really do not have a hard time here just some drama every now and then which I ignore and go about my work day and or night. I look forward to interacting with our guest that is what makes my day so much better they are almost always chipper but you do get some guest that are not happy but you try to make the best of things and greet them with a smile and usually talking to them in a calm voice can make any guest switch"
good,"The work environment is laid back, and it is an easy place to work. I cover for multiple people because they call in for various reasons. The manager is one of the main people who do this. He also doesn't like to do any extra work, leaving everyone else to pick up the slack. The owners are very nice people, however, they do not want to hire anyone if they do not absolutely have to. There is nobody for maintenance, so if there is someone at the desk who knows how to do it, they are asked to do it. The front desk clerks are also required to do laundry and check rooms, because there is no head-housekeeper. There are no benefits, insurance, or raises. everybody starts at minimum wage, which is $7.50. That makes it hard for anyone who is a main source of income. Overall, it is a good place to work. There are not many issues between the current staff, or even with guests."
good,"Work ethics were atleast undesirable, not too mention, poor higher management!!  Love working with the guests!!"
good,"In door pool excellent plus"
good,"The management was in flux, training was poor, sometimes instructions wasn't clear."
good,I liked this job because this is where I got a true sense of multitasking. We all did our part to make it run as smoothly as possible and to keep one another motivated.
good,"This company is great for someone just getting on their feet and needs a job with health benefits from an administrative perspective. If you want a job for compensation working in the Sales and Marketing field is great a little high stress just like any job, but you will love what you do and have a great time doing it. Also the rewards for Sales and Marketing are great."
good,"See below, great experience, loooooong hours, difficult owner, but invaluable experience and fun people."
good,very organized. management was fair. the staff made my time there enjoyable.
good,"work there many yrs,got good pay in beginnin,lots of hrs,fun ppl to work with,but the mangerment kinda sucks,the place get sold all the time in it just gets worst"
good,"All the manager did all day was facebook...and play on his phone. He would give free rooms to girls he liked. He would never deal with an irate guest, would just tell us to get a name and number but he would never call us back. We would get cussed out on a regular basis by irate former guest. He would never see to it that any problem was ever solved."
good,Experience was worth it. It taught us how to value an employment and treat it with much care.
good,Its good but I have worked for almost a year without a raise or anything related
good,Management was great everyone felt at home like a family pay was not good and sales were hard to get even coming from a rep that has been in sales for 6 years
good,lack of management in every area due to new company. Need to take more management class's.
good,The managers were not good at all. There were way too many people fired. If the salespeople could not sell 20 percent they were given one week to do so or be fired. Everyone I knew was fired. I decided it was not the company for me when the managers began to lie.
good,The job was ok accept for the long days and no extra pay I would work 80 plus hours a week and only get paid for 40 hours no matter the time I would work
good,"This is a fun environment because of the guests and coworkers to work in, but if you're not one of management's favorites, it's next to impossible to meet your weekly quotas. They schedule the heavy hitters (favorites) for prime time check in and leave those who are struggling to make their numbers to their own devices. It's clear that marketers are only numbers. "
good,It's an ok job if your just starting off in ths workplaces but the pay and hours doesn't match the hard work and what it really takes to clean those rooms. Your forced to get off the clock and expected to clean rooms well. Other than the pay and hrs its not a bad place to work especially if you like staying active.
good,Stiff environment and high stress at times. Most co-workers are nice and amiable while a few are a bit difficult especially when it comes to relating shift notes from one shift to the next.
good,"Wyndham is a huge corporate machine that if you succeed, will make you great income but usually only for a short time. Easy to move up in management because of attrition but unfortunately it means you have no real job security. The biggest asset in the company are the employees and the ground level. Executives are not to be believed, let alone trusted, with their information."
good,"Expected to be robots and you are worked in to the ground. No work life balance and you can feel bullied by senior management and owners."
good,"Job security was horrible, Managers not there for you. Your numbers matter on sales...if you don't make your sales. They are not happy. Favoritism among agents."
good,"Typical timeshare sales job. You can easily make $100k+ every year if you are a top performer every single month. The other 80% of sales reps struggle to pay bills but one good month of commissions can change everything. Statistically, 97% of people don't last more than one year because of how demanding it is."
good,"Laid back, yet busy environment with mostly fun , understanding Guests. Management is respectful of life/work balance. There is some room to grow within the company, just depends on which property you are wotrking for."
good,"If you are desperate and you need a job, its fine for the first two months. After that, you're thrown to the wolves. The staff does not really care for your existence unless you produce results. Sales practices are unethical. They are used to people quitting fast. They will motivate you to trick people into debt instead of assisting them. They will also convince you that you will be fine if you stick with the program but most salesmen fail. Never going back."
good,"Could be better, exspecially when it comes to benifits and time off.  But if you like the hotel business good place to work.  Hours can be long but fun"
good,"Unfortunately, Wyndham Destinations has run into a problem that several large companies have had for years. Wyndham will not pay you the money unless you are a Manager or above. They talk about career development and how they encourage you to grow in your role but in truth....if they will block people from move up the ladders when they want to keep people doing the grunt work. They are NOTORIOUS for posting job ads for open positions when they have already identified an internal candidate just so they can say that they provided everyone with an opportunity to apply, fully knowing that they never had any intentions of considering any else. There have been cases where they have had multiples of the same positions open and will make some people jump through hoops to get a role but then turn around and offer a different person the same role without having to interview or anything. They also love telling people who aren't in sales/marketing that they can't have or want to do anything because the company is doing so bad but they always find money around to take all the sales/marketing people on luxurious all inclusive vacations to international locations to give them awards and bonuses."
good,"They don't give enough hours to their employees. Making it so you can't survive on enough money alone. They don't offer benefits. But they give you free breakfast, so you have plenty of energy for your shift."
good,Stay away from this company. They give you no time to truly acclimate before they drop wages to below living standards. 6 hour days are great at first.
good,As a housekeeper you have to be able to work in a fast pace environment. And have to be able to take direction an criticism. Also be able to meet specific time deadlines
good,Wouldn't  recommend working there enjoyed my co-workers but low pay rate some days we'd have 25 or so rooms to clean 20 minutes each room.did enjoy pizza days.
good,Fun work environment selling vacation ownership however dont think your taking many... vacations hard to get approved. marketing that brings tours in Lie just like any other company when they dont need too... Good ppl to work with and work for.
good,"working for howard johnsons hotel was very stressful, manager was always upset and late for shift, guest were always complaining on poor management and upkeep of hotel. manager did not like or greet most guest and gave poor customer service."
good,"During my time working there I was cut hours, the management was great but the coworkers would butt heads. By the end i was only working the weekenfs and that just wasnt enough."
good,"Didn't like having to deal with children running rampant and also management wasn't the greatest."
good,Some of the people are cool there they need to do better with the communication with employee's on calls and conversion money good if u make the sales but if u dont ten dollar's an hour is no money
good,A typical day at work was a little busy and there's always a lot to do. I learned a lot of administrative responsibilities. Management was nice but corporate was not safe to work for. The culture with my coworkers was the best part. The hardest part was working weekends.
good,I was hired for fixed days and time. When business slowed up he told me I had to be flexible or he was letting me go. I couldn't due to babysitting issues. He also let me go while I was on vacation and in a text messages
good,the day was typical of any hotel the reason i left is because i was offered a better position with better pay and i was able to relocate other than that it was fine
good,Management lies to customers to get them to buy. They expect you to do the same. They spend more time blowing there own horn then helping there employees to learn.
good,"While I have to admit Wyndham as a company has taken very good care of me as an employee through benefits and especially during the Nashville flood of 2011, the leadership at the site level leaves much to be desired when it comes to motivating and moral of the team as a whole. Those who work hardest seem to be leaned on the most, while nothing is done to coach those who don't pull their own weight."
good,"As a experienced travel professional, small potato's in the travel world. Cubical job with not so great hours that never get changed. No where to move for upwards growth. Management needs lots of help. In-depth GDS Apollo system training and product knowledge for destinations is where is company excels."
good,This employer is a great person but chose to put personal in the way of being professional.  I feel the staff does as much as possibly could be done and they doesn't get paid enough.
good,This would be an ideal job for a young adult looking to make extra money but would not recommend it if you need benefits and a livable wage. It's a fun place to work and the people who  work there are fun also.
good,"during the summer it was busy during my shift which I enjoyed. winter and fall were slower but there was usually laundry to do, and always other cleaning. Management was good, she was flexible with the schedule if you need time off, such as coming in an hour or two late, or requested time off.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from all over the world and telling them about local history and sight seeing places.  Hardest part is getting very large groups to check in unexpectedly."
good,Manager was very diffeicult to deal with.. i enjoyed working with our guest and being able to help make their stay as pleasant as possible. very physical work.
good,Not enough pay. Loved the job itself. Owners are friendly and caring. Owners listened to concerns and fixed what needed to be fixed right away. Wasn't enough hours for me.
good,"very bad brand with Ramada i need to find anther job any where  glucose "
good,It's not a horrible place to work and the stress level is low. But advancement is limited and management (at my branch at least) was not very good at communication.
good,"It was okay for my first job, however stressful. Not very flexible and high paced and very strict. People who called were unfriendly at times. Learned about property rentals."
good,"I worked 3rd shift so the pace was kind of slow. I learned how to do night audit, check in and out's, online reservations. I was able to meet a lot of interesting people. There were no raises or insurance."
good,"they treat owners bad and employees worst. Compensated little for the non stop calls and multiple functions you will have to perform, the only good thing is not having a supervisor breathing down your neck if you are lucky enough to work from home"
good,"The workplace culture was not very strong. I was not properly trained to do my job. But, I did gain experience in the hospitality industry. The hardest part was not knowing how to handle situations because of the lack of training."
good,"checking daily in house customer taking new reservation follow up on group reservation and daily account checking."
good,"Its a good place to start off when you're young and is easy work. As far as advancement and raises, its just not going to happen. The company owners did not care about the employees."
good,"What I learned was about time share and the travel industry. Also, that I can relate to customers, I says this because this job was direct contact with the potential client."
good,"It was a small front desk with a little restaurant next to us. All of the staff was very close, it felt like working with family. This motel no longer exists."
good,At the work place whatever position you are hired for is where you staff the entire time you are employed there. No room to grow or move up. Management is definitely there to make money and don't care about their employees. They do not go by regulations. Work place culture was manageable but not right.
good,Working here has its pros and cons just like any other job. The pros is cleaning doing my job. The cons employees doesn't stay because of front desk manager terrible attitude towards everyone.
good,Good for students in high school or retired. Not for workers looking to grow. Job atmosphere can be enjoyable and extremely stressful at times. The best part is meeting people from all walks of life and flexibility in shifts.
good,"It paid the bills but there's no long-term career advancement there, unless you desire to be the bestest customer call center supervisor in all of Orlando."
good,"•	Effectively manage daily Front Office Operations including staffing and co-ordination with other Departments. "
good,"I learn to communicate with different department of the hotel. Learn great deal of Customer Service. Working with different co-worker with different background such as nationality, culture, etc.. I learn a lot from the  manager. The manager train me everything from how to deal with customer to co-worker in different department"
good,"Hostile Work Environment, Pay is not great, work hard for little pay. Management talks down to employees and not a very friendly enviroment."
good,"First let me say I worked at Wyndham at a very bad time.  I have had relatives that have worked for the company and have done very, very well.  My experience was not a very good experience for me, but I do have a buddy that hired on the same time I did and he was very successful.  The managers, all but one, at the time I worked there were not very helpful at all, but Wyndham has done things to change this and those managers are not there anymore.  "
good,I'm not comfortable putting things online about my current employer especially since all Wyndham's are not the same. I do enjoy going to work.
good,"Working for Wyndham is more about peace rate employer then an hourly employer. You have more days off then on. Pros of working for Wyndham, you get to meet great guest from all over the world."
good,There is no typical day which requires flexibility and the ability to deal with ambiguity.  Since working here I've learned more about the financials behind the machine (operation).  The most challenging part of the job has been finding creative ways to acknowledge and express gratitude to the workforce with limited resources.  What I enjoy most about the job mentoring and seeing employee growth and development.
good,"meeting new people on a daily basis, working around diverse cultures. Great managemnr team and awesome coworkers. working late hours durong bad weather conditions but good on tips for extra cash. lots of down time and long periods of breaks."
good,My co-workers are like an extended family however I am extremely under paid and their is no potential for advancement or a raise. I work grave yard shift and need day time employment so I can be with my family.
good,"This job was fun while it lasted, they did not pay enough but I stayed because it was a stable job. This was alright, they had some benefits but not enough for my child. Now I am looking for better opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work depends on how everything runs, sometimes things break down and need to be fixed so we are down for awhile, could depend on how long it will take for it to be fixed, sometimes anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. I learned how to be patient, how to inspect chips and what they should look like, how kettle chips are cooked. Management is good. My co-workers are good to me. hardest part of my job is standing in one spot for a long period time and dealing with the heat. the most enjoyable part of my job is break time and when the shift is done."
good,"Getting residents up and dressed for breakfast, assisting with feeding, and taking them to activities. Also passing medication to the residents in a timely manner."
good,"needs a major upgrade, no chance for advancement, Nice Owners,"
good,"Greet all guests "
good,It's a great job with lots of experience available but little to none job advancement. It is a great stepping stone for someone trying to achieve a better future.
good,"My typical day at work starts at 12am-8am, and I perform the night audit during those hours. I work by myself during those hours. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the restaurant and hotel money intake balances out. My co-workers seem to be very nice and helpful when asked specific questions about problems I may have."
good,"Easy work place, providing customer service to guest. Learned to communicate with different people. Different coworkers all the time. Best part of the job was interacting with guest, hardest part organization of employers."
good,"As an AHA - I would receive an average of 100 calls per day.  These were existing owners who want to book their family vacation."
good,"The hardest part of the job was lifting out, and making the sofa beds. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. I learned how to make hotel-grade beds, and how to fold sheets to hotel standards."
good,Come in. Work with guests on activities and monitor pool/ guest area. Help with other departments. Organize activities and prepare for weekly events. It helped me a lot with meeting different people. Helped me develop good professional relationships with guests. Management was slightly difficult. A lot of people come and go so it was hard to know who wanted what because it changed often. Co workers were like family. Very friendly. Hardest part is pleasing everyone. Working in hospitality everyone wants a personal experience so just making sure you treated everyone like they were special is very important. Best part was also the guests. They love when they enjoy their vacation and making their time special means a lot.
good,"Working with my staff to resolve issues was the most enjoyable part of my job. In addition, I completed several conversion projects with our existing A/R system. I and my counterpart in IT converted over 72 nonprofit HOA Associations."
good,"i worked here for a while the guest where awesome. but the management WAS HORRIBLE. and the pay was ever WORSE. they wanted you to put out breakfast,clean the lobby, work the night audit, no cameras over night, all for 8.25 an hour"
good,"As soon as I arrive to work I sign time clock, and begin counting my drawer to be sure their is $350.00 to begin my shift before previous shifts clerk leaves. I then take over in customer service getting any guest, if any present, checked in and settled for the stay. Once lobby is empty and all guest are happy I complete my list of chores for c-shift. At 3 am i begin cashier drop and night audit, print all reports, and double check in house checklist to be sure every thing is in order. I set out frozen breakfast foods to thaw. around 4 am i begin preparing lobby for breakfast , and around 5 am I begin preparing the food! 6 am doors open. From 6 am until 8 am I maintain breakfast and cleanliness of my lobby, as well as check out any guest ready for departure! At 8 am my relief arrives, I go over any significant details from my shift, wait for her to finish counting drawer and then I sign out on time clock."
good,"Days can be pretty busy due to the fact that there is not much help warranted.  That being said it has helped me a lot in improving my multitasking skills and problem solving skills.  Co-workers when present are all very helpful and seem to be good people.  The hardest part of the day would just be lack of help and lack of communication.  For example when issues arise that I should be made of aware of prior to starting shifts, it makes it a difficult process to solve.  Had there been more communication, I feel like things could run smoother.  The most enjoyable part of the day is just getting to work with all different types of guest throughout the day; just learning about different cultures and unique personalities that I can look back to for reference later in my working life."
good,"Management was poor, no advancement in pay, no room to grow.. Handled laundry ,Front desk, maintain cleaning carts and supplies."
good,"More concerned about perception and not enough emphasis on logic. Pays very low, and has extremely high call standards that are critiqued on a weekly basis. They make these standards almost impossible to reach because these evaluations dictate their compensation program."
good,"only worked a few hours a day but got to enjoy chit chat with happy go lucky customers in the mornings, would help keeps breakfast items stocked and clean up afterwords, the hardest part was not making enough but did enjoy having the ability to go home after shift if not feeling well"
good,Your benefits are not the same as other employees. This is not explained to you upon hiring. There is a 90% of no with this type of sales and 10% as a normal.
good,I enjoy working here as it allows me to use my self-management skills.
good,"Having worked in hospitality industry for 30+ yrs I was sorely disappointed in the corporate environment that permeated every hour of every day. I believe my resort manager had the best interests of her hourly employees at heart, but with point based discipline/attendance policy, standards set in what are called ROPs and DOPs (both determined by corporate) the most common phrase I heard was 'my hands are tied' . The pay is minimal, and while the sales staff is able to earn extra ""bonus"" rewards, the front line for the resort has no such incentives, and in my case, even verbal acknowledgement of customer service comments was non-existent. Over all I believe the sales crew was/is much happier with their circumstances in this company then anyone with any real experience could possibly be in the guest service side of things."
good,"Wyndham is a fast paced real estate sales company. With a culture that is sales focused, Wyndham usually forgets about their admin team. We often have to operate without the proper resources. Poor middle management on admin side."
good,"be able to multitask and be attentive to guest needs, I've learned that I'm able work well under pressure and be able to handle a problem and solve it. my management is great i love it and my co-workers."
good,Great for a sales environment on a temporary basis. Fun while you hit your goals.....Enjoyed the learning of vacation timeshare programs
good,I first starting working as a room attendant. I would clean the guest rooms and building where as needed. I then began to work at the front desk as the night auditor. I learned how to multitask efficiently as well as build my customer service skills.
good,"My nights would consists of balancing out daily credit card transactions, and printing out daily reports for the next shift. I learned the importance of paying close attention to fine details, and sharpen my multi-tasking skills. Management wasn't to consistent nor hands on. Other co-workers rarely arrived on time, or completed their job duties in the 8 hour time frame they are giving. The hardest part of working for Baymont inn and suites, would have to be the overnight hours. The most enjoyable part of my job were my off days."
good,"Sales sales sales, if this is what you like then this is the place."
good,Days Inn was a great stepping stone for me. It provided me with my first opportunity to work at the front desk of a hotel. I learned a lot from the manager that was there at the time. Co-workers were wonderful and fun to be around.
good,"All workers gathered every morning to discuss the days duties. Its was a joy to see every ones faces every day. We all learned to work together and have team work. My self as a manager to the other workers was a joy, I got them to get the job done but still had the respect from them. All co-workers looked up to me and my nick name was mom. Hardest part of any job is trying to please people and make them happy but in some cases there are people who just never are. Enjoyable part of any job is getting along with everyone. makes for a better work environment."
good,enjoyed job but required to perform tasks not a part of job description which limits time to do assigned tasks.
good,"typical day at work was answering the phones and putting people on vacation. "
good,"One person worked the entire hotel running on 12 hour shifts. It was a very busy atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was being alone late at night. I cleaning the lobby, hallways and staff area. I folded all the hotel laundry. I prepared and served breakfast. I checked in guests and answered any questions regarding location and locally offered services. I completed nightly audit reports."
good,Enjoyed working at hotel having customer service contact. Data system did change or was updated too often. Taking on 3 positions alone on 2nd shift not easy for the wage being paid. Very challenging which i didn't mind . Pleasant people and atmosphere to work in.
good,"Working there was fun. Easy going environmental. Learned how to deal with many people of all ages and backgrounds. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of this job was the management. I worked for them for 2 years and never was i even offered a raise. I called in sick one day, and they showed up at my house, really weird. Plus they told me if anyone were to cause any trouble, just pretend to call the police. My managers also took my hours and ""moved them around."" Claiming i would be getting paid the same if they did not do it. When they did not stop doing this on my paychecks, this was the first job i had to quit without a notice. Other then that, it was a fun learning experience."
good,"sweep floors mop floors, clean restrooms clean brass, buff floors vaccuming empty trash"
good,"Coordinating exceptionally friendly, professional and efficient reception,"
good,"Typical days go by fast, as there is a fast paced environment. I learned to be concise and caring with my guests and owners of the product. My co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job is to get a guest to commit to several thousand dollars within 1 hour, but this may also be the most enjoyable part of the job. The adrenaline rush is amazing."
good,Would check people in and make sure their rooms was up to standards. Would keep the lobby and bathrooms clean. The management was rude and sexiest towards women and made it a uncomfortable place to work.
good,They will keep you on your toes when i worked there no one was there but just me doing laundry cleaning rooms basically everything it was easy hard working by the end of the day but didnt mind it
good,Need improvements in employe relationships. Flexible hours and somewhat good management. Friendly environment to work at and relaxing job overall. Good as part job
good,"Nobody is on the same page, one of the new managers abrasive and rude, condescending. Favoritism is big with those doing well when you're doing well. Managers stop helping to help your success after a couple months"
good,"It’s an okay place to work. The pay isn’t great, they don’t even pay extra for working holidays. There is really no room for advancement. I honestly feel unimportant in my job."
good,I was only there for about 9 months and was doing two jobs - business development and marketing with three supervisors telling me what to do.  During my time there I actually went through 6 different managers. Horrible management organization.
good,"You stay busy for sure! Ramada is a half service hotel so front desk has to do laundry, breakfast, and make housekeeping schedules. Checking guests in\out. Making reservations."
good,Ok low pay but benefits. Shift bidding twice a year makes it difficult to have family life and schedule vacations without concerns. Managed asks for input but does t act on it
good,"Everything you would expect from a timeshare company.  The sky is the limit when it comes to income opportunities, but there is extremely high-performance standards. Also, I loved the competitive environment, but there was a lot of unnecessary drama because of the marketing structure.  "
good,Working there the employees were more concerned about others people's jobs instead of their own & I wish the pay was a little more for a housekeeper but overall I did my job & did as I was told until I no longer was allowed to work do to complications during pregnancy.
good,"Wyndham as a cooperation is great. However some of its franchise owner do not hold the standards of the brand. Some of them take advantage of their employees by paying lower than minimum wage and expect their employees to work day in and day out, seven days a week, while refusing to pay overtime to their employees. The best part of working for Wyndham  right now is the guest that you meet."
good,I enjoy the people that I worked with but the job overall has changed since I first started working there wish is normal for a big company but specifically in my department. I really enjoyed my job in the beginning but the hours changed as we once honor all holidays as we are financial services but now we are open on specific holidays although banks are closed when payments are processed so they won't be processed until the next business days. I could go on but this is my own jaded an opinion because I have been working for department too long and not sure there is a department I want to work in that will give me a great opportunity.
good,"Told them at interview process that I was in the middle of a custody battle, also informed them a week before summer of part of a custody situation that I have to follow that they are not willing to work around because their business is more important then their employees. They say they work with you. But they don't keep to what they promise."
good,"I absolutely loved working there, and my co-workers were also my good friends. Great work environment, except we worked very very hard for only minimum wage, forever. Never got a raise."
good,"Job itself is easy, but there is no advancements and my particular branch does no offer benefits nor anything more than min wage. The owners are referred as to cheap. If your okay only ever working min wage then this is the job for you. As for advancements... sure if you work for a bigger hotel elsewhere you might get somewhere higher but a job here is a dead end."
good,"It was fairly easy , custodial and time management skills are needed requirements for this type of work. I loved the work besides treating rooms for bed bugs."
good,"Great benefits at this company. Opportunities to make money but management is not the best. A lot of promises that never happened. Overall I really enjoyed my time working at Wyndham, lots of things to learn from them"
good,"Lugar muy tranquilo, el trabajo es sencillo y hay libertad de expresión"
good,It is pretty similar to a family business. Everyone is connected to everyone somehow. If you like drama but want an easy job go for it. Manager and Supervisor are amazing but if you are looking for something more than a 9 an hour job and dealing with drunks and being unable to unlock doors then this might not be your bag.
good,"Too stressful.  Love my supervisor and fellow employees, but other supervisors interfered frequently without offering the kind of help you needed.  The pay was good, and it would have been an easy job if the software had worked and was easy to use but it was not."
good,Overall the manager is a great person to work with but the hours are not guaranteed the owner cut the hours due to the pay raise there for can't depend on anything can't afford to keep working here even though I really like my job
good,typical day working at days inn is completing my assignments with check outs or stay over rooms providing strong customer service and helping customers with solving problems answer phone calls for assist from front desk i learned working at days inn is not only cleaning rooms for customers being able to assist customers and make sure they are satisfied and also helping other co workers too the hardest part not being able to satisfy all customer i enjoy cleaning the rooms and helping others at the same time it make me feels happy inside to see others happy
good,i don’t want to talk about this company considering the fact that i currently still work here and do not feel comfortable sharing any private information
good,"One of the enjoyable thing that I experienced is managing my employees. "
good,"Clean place, guests were always happy, management could of been better.. employee appreciation would be ideal or maybe valueing employees would be great"
good,"Repetitive task. Other departments are very helpful when it comes to learning and growth. The hardest part of the job was the lack of relevant communication. I will not talk for any department I have not worked for, but my department suffered from low morale. Understaffed department, job security, scheduling issues are some of the examples of low morale. Note, this is not a company issue, but multiple departments do have this problem."
good,Job was under paid with no benefits except vacation time which had a cap on it. Not fair to some one who put in many years there. Job was very stressful as hospitality is a stressful position
good,The average day at this site would consist of finding people to sell to. Each agent would have to observe those who walk by to figure out if they might be a good candidate for our offer.
good,"This property was fairly nice however they have converted it to a Holiday Inn Express and it is now beautiful."
good,"Very specific training. Tons of video training you have to do. Cookie cutter culture. Okay pay, might be higher some places than others. Where I was  the management sucked."
good,overall my experience with Wyndham was very positive. Wyndham definitely opened my eyes up to the world of sales. I believe the skill I learned there will help me tremendously in my future sales endeavors.
good,"I appreciate the experience I received from 9 years with the company, but am looking forward to taking my knowledge to another company that is more professional and accepting."
good,"The job itself was fine, typical hotel work. The people who came in to stay were another story... as well as management was pocketing money under the counter. Stressful to deal with."
good,"Started my job with high hopes that this was a great career move.  I was wrong.  The pay was great, the opportunity for advancement was great IF you played their game.  The negativity in my department was paramount.  the manager was great but her hands were tied to improve any issues in her department, mainly disgruntled negative employees.  Wyndham is a great place to work but choose your department carefully."
good,When I first started I had no experience but it seem like a good place to work so once I started working and found out what a housekeeper really does I figured I could do this and I did for just over a year it wasn’t too bad it’s a lot of work a lot of hard labor that you would not expect and surprisingly long hours almost every day the pay wasn’t the best for as much work as we were putting out but I would go back If I needed.
good,"When it's busy it's better so the day will run faster than the usual routine. A very challenging place to work. Overall the best part is the the chance of meeting people from pleasure, work and business trip where they share stories and you can make connections."
good,"Night audit, long 10 hour shift. The job is repetitive management is changing old management is awesome new management is totally new. Nothing hard about this job. Most enjoyable part about this job is Im off the weekend."
good,I missed the birth of my granddaughter because my time off request was not approved. I haven't seen my other daughter in 4 years but when she came to visit a month ago I was not given time off when I asked for it......got to spend 4 hours with her the whole weekend. They should learn to be more family first oriented for their employees.
good,It’s not ao much the people but the work environment. It takes a huge toll on you as a person because it’s extremely fast pace. Training is extremely short and not at all in depth. Management sometimes think to highly of themselves to help you and rely on other workers that are below them like supervisors and regular employers.
good,"I learned a lot of dealing with different nationalities, getting to know different personality and give more patience how to dealt with different situation ."
good,"no insentive and favoristm from Managers to employees "
good,I don't like the fact that they hire managers who lead the team with ZERO work experience coming from a different field. Bad decisions. They need to provide a busy work environment. That why nobody stays. High turnover.
good,Management was too busy to help anyone who actual needed it. Management will work you to death. Constantly giving too much work that has nothing to do with your department
good,"fun place  to work"
good,"A typical day at work is listening your not professional supervisor "
good,"drove people to and from the airport, helped with luggage and to their rooms, swept, mopped, changed lights, helped in the kitchen, served breakfast to the customers."
good,Obtained good reception and customer service skills while working here. Checked guests in and out and ensured they were enjoying their stay. This type of organization will be helpful in a kennel setting as well
good,"Is a very competitive environment and you will easily find coworkers willing to put you down. Management will take sides and be totally blind, so you have to be able to sell yourself adequately if you want to keep your job."
good,Not a bad place to work for. Very relaxed. Communication between employees is terrible. Most shift workers do not do their jobs for their shift and leave the other shifts to do it instead. Manager hardly trains new employees.
good,"I liked the job, just not enough hours. check vehicles that were towed in from snow emergency routes, prepare cars for auto auctions. Inventory. Secure the gateway."
good,"Friendly people; "
good,"I have worked with Wyndham for many years and have many friends still employed there. I applaud the company's mission statement and the opportunity that is offered. However, with constant changing of shifts, working on public holidays and being out bid on many times vacation opportunity for family events, this company fails on many fronts."
good,Ready to make more more money and eventually move up. I'm a great leader. I would love to build a team and help others grow. I love this industry. I am looking forward to expanding my horizons!
good,This company is disconnected from reality! They put profit before employees all the time! Their words aren't congruent with their philosophy of famil.
good,It was hard work and long hours. There was a large employee turnover there. I believe it was cause most of the employees were UT students and quit after school was over
good,A typical day consists during the summer is quite busy and stressful. There is no chance for advancement. New hires typically are hired from outside the company. Guest service agents are not paid enough for what they are asked to do on a daily basis.
good,I am going to tell my past jobs everyday and feeling bored and lame hoping having a better one by trying working at hospital kitchen and keep looking for a great job online and get paid.
good,If the managers actually cared about their employee's then it would be a great place to work. You learn many useful skills while working there. Mainly customer service and hospitality. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day from all parts of the world. The hardest part of working there is dealing with the managers.
good,Staff and co-workers very nice.  Working at a call center a bit tough based on the time breaks.  Learned quite a bit for the travel industry. Always available to assist as if you had questions or needed retraining.  Salary was a bit low for market.
good,Checked motel guests in and out.  Made Motel Reservations and assisted Housekeeping Department.  The hardest part of the job was trying working with an unhappy motel guests.  The best part of the job was meeting all kinds of nice people.
good,If you have a family emergency they don't want you to deal with it. They are only wanted themselves to look good. They will have you do all their work while they sit around on their cell phone or computer playing games.
good,"I workex there for a few short time management just took over so ever thing was out of order. "
good,"Not really sure what to put here since it's been awhile, I can't really complain about the job, it just isn't what I wanted to do and I needed to finish school"
good,"Pays not bad as all centers go."
good,Front desk agent at the Days Inn. Its an ok place to work i can use skills i learn here to advance in a better career. There is material you can pick up here and begin a lasing career in administrative and office work
good,I just left because there was no hours to work and it was very slow.  One day I went to work and my supervisor had called me 10 minutes prior for me to start and I felt like that wasn't a very good thing to do you should call an hour before so I would know and not drive far to get to work and have to go.
good,very busy short staffed and bad manegment. wouldnt want to work for them again. needs more organization. no breaks was given.
good,"I worked with this company for a few months and finally decided to call it. They take away you requested days of (ones you made months in advance), blame you for the multiple problems, blame you for rooms that another housekeeper cleaned. Management was rude, and didn't assist in fixing problems with harassment. Not pleased"
good,It may have been the particular resort manager I worked for but I highly doubt it judging from the amount of help wanted advertisements in the local paper. Corporate was always adding more responsibility and work load with out adding more hours to the day or additional staff. Time was rushed and quality had to be maintained. I felt like I regained 10 years to my life when I was wrongfully terminated from the job. Heavy burden of stress was instantly lifted from me.
good,I loved working there but in the end it was hard to work with management due to poor management skills. I learned that management was not open for new ideas. My co-workers were good at what they did and took what ever advice I gave them into consideration. The hardest part of the job was bringing problems to the new General Manager that was not trying to listen to anything that I had to say. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the guests.
good,Great work at home gig if you're unaware of the timeshare industry & how it works. Otherwise this company's customers are being lied to by sales people and taken for a LOT of money!
good,"I enjoyed the days where it was slow and there was not much to do, because the worst thing about them was that it was boring. On busy days it could either be great or a disaster depending on guest behavior."
good,Liked the coworkers that I worked with. Got work on customer service skills. Learned customer satisfaction skills. Got done in a organized and orderly fashion.
good,"It was basic hotel work with no benefits other than salary. "
good,"Family own business, in Elizabeth near Newark, NJ. Not so good people. No schedules, and many false promises. Always forced and push to get more revenue, and all rooms were dirty and old , though they know building needs renovation. Embarrassing and fussy locality. Dangerous to work at night."
good,Loved working as a front desk specialist. Loved meeting new people on a daily basis. Loved the staff and crew that I worked with. Everyone got along and treated each other as family.
good,work is work but its a very shady place and you never have time for family or yourself. The money is good but not worth it if you cant spend it management is a piece of **** Only current managers are very cool the rest watch your back.
good,It is very clean and awesome management. Very friendly. Needs more amenities. Very pet friendly. Needs different uniforms and not scrubs.
good,I did not work for Wyndham. I worked for a company that took over the Super 8/ Ramada when the owners lost it. We kept it up and running until it was bought by someone new.
good,"Hardest part of shift is all the downtime when not with customers or doing work chores, isn't a fast paced job unless is a busy night."
good,"Worling with Wyndham hotels (Days Inn) was very exciting, I had alot of fun meeting new people on a daily bases. I enjoyed my fellow coworkers an employer but most of all enloyed my job working to accomidate the guest an make them happy. I take pride in my work regardless of what it is an enjoy a challenge here an there."
good,The job itself was fine. Pay was good with monthly bonus. Management kept changing as well as the work environment and standards of the company. Enjoyed benefits and weekly pay period.
good,I love to work with people and I work well with others and I also work great alone. I loved the interactions I have with my guest and how family like the company was.
good,Overall Wyndham need to retrain all management personnel with some form of core guidelines on assisting with advancement and growth within this company. Being that we are short staff at the moment Wyndham should implement a cross train so that management can help out with business demands. Majority of management only knows delegation roles and no knowledge of how to perform everyday jobs.
good,"Very knowledgeable Management Structure but very poor Management oversight... a environment of unaccountability "
good,"customer service is everything, no matter what make your customers happy within your job position, answer phones answer questions, fulfill to the customers needs to the fullest of your abilities. updating spread sheets for activities in the area."
good,Decent place to work if you're looking for very little physical labor. Does not require to much training to learn the checking in system. Management is very friendly.
good,Official title is marketing manager but the position is strictly a sales job. Strictly going of numbers and performance for each quarter shows your company worth. Hours are not looked at and vacations are never given. The company is great with benefits but look down on you for using them. If you are looking for a sales position and work off of pure adrenaline this is for you.
good,Staff is small. Rules and policies are in place but are only enforced when with some team members. Management is present but not consistent with rules and polices. Little supervision so that you can get a rhythm that works for you.
good,"My profile was to check and tally the complete day transaction that took place  that particular business day. Checking Inhouse Guest and check out guest folios thoroughly. All credit card settlements and cash payments have proper backup has to be tallied. Making invoices for the company.  Also, to process change of business day i.e. closing the present day transaction after completion of all work and opening the new Busines day. Dailywise food costing and giving daily and monthly reports to the Financial Controller and to the Front Office Duty Manger."
good,"Too many chiefs , and communication problems , also uplink is not considered. Could be more productive , too much time wasted .."
good,"Very high pressure sales, managment is somewhat ok."
good,I started out as a HVAC contractor. did that for about six months then the maintenance supervisor left and I took over his position. job duties are included on my resume
good,"I love meeting new people and making them happy however i can.  "
good,"Learned a lot working here, friendly staff but lots of work and long hours."
good,"didn't mind the work..actually enjoyed being a ""housekeeper"""
good,wyndham was a nice company to work for but i feel more comfortable in my field .
good,"I enjoy being in the hospitality field very much, work for me is pretty busy between answering phones, emails and faxes there is never a full moment. I work two rolls here one being reservations and two helping the sales office out"
good,"Constantly changed the schedule on less than three days notice,they don't appreciate hard work or loyalty!"
good,Hands on training and criteria gave me a better look on how the medical work force actually was like.
good,enjoyed my time with co workers but not my bosses. never were on top of anything and never were on time
good,It gave me the chance to understand how the kitchen works at a hotel.
good,one day at work i learned to be patient with my customers and listen sometimes you can learn new things and i think the hardest part is reputition every thing is timed and so much paper work but I still pushed through and get all my work done
good,"I would come in and sign on to the computer first thing. Then count the drawer down to make sure it was correct and ask whomever I was coming in after if there was anything I needed to know or of any special guest coming in. Then the housekeeper would bring me there sheets and I would check the rooms in the system as clean or out of order.Then guest would start arriving and I would check them in."
good,"I had tried over the past two years to move up to the next level or even to another department and was stonewalled by the management team in one way or another. This is a great place to work and the employees are great, it is just a matter of getting past the management team."
good,"The company has awesome benefits, perks, etc and just ran poorly.  Bad choice in leadership, management, etc.."
good,"I was recruited to this position and it did not apply to my education or background. I was not in the position for a long length of time. The pay fluctuated with the number of clients you could schedule to attend sales presentations. A very aggressive person is required for this position, one who refuses to take no for an answer."
good,"you go into work clock in go get your list for the day, start gathering your cleaning products and than go to your destination. i learned to take orders, how to clean the motels and cottages how they wanted them. management was very poor. The co-workers were very negative. the hardest part was listening to someone telling you to do something and the other telling you not to. the most enjoyable was getting to ride the rides for free after work and feeling productive about the way i did my job."
good,"work is excited as well as challenging, meeting deadline,good team work, management could be more efficent , i enjoy meeting dead line at the end of the day, hardest part of the job is not have the tools to work effectively"
good,"It was always a great day and night working here. I would check in and out guests, asked if their stay was pleasant and greet them with come again. The front desk was always busy and challenging. Making sure rooms are available, cleaned and customers were satisfied with their stay. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied guests and making accommodations for them and they would ask for a manager to discuss there issue. I enjoyed my job, we had a great staff and they were all pleasant."
good,"Interacting with new hotel guests and meeting people from different areas through out the US is amazing. Learned how to run Credit Card reports, the task were very repetitive and easy to adapt to. Overall great experience."
good,"Truck Parking Security Guard."
good,"Morning meeting for about half hour. Got list and keys, got clean linens for most of the day. Began cleaning vacant and occupied rooms."
good,The company has good benefits.  The managers are good at their jobs and my co-workers are nice.
good,"Need to update their properties."
good,"At the front desk I assigned unit to owners, collected annual fees and provided customers with their every need at the resort and in the area. Assigned duties to departments according to customers needs. Received countless customer service trainings to better relate to and communicate with any situation in a productive and positive manner. I really enjoyed working with and helping to provide an great experience for all our timeshare owner and potential owners. Management changed to often along with co-workers but enjoyed them while they were there."
good,"Busy from the moment I start to the moment I leave. "
good,"Wyndham can be a great company to work for. It is, however, a very stressful environment. You can become very close with your co-workers because you practically live at work. The hardest part of the job is that fact that we are quite often under-staffed in the places we need the most help. Don't ever think about calling in sick. The employees on commission are constantly recognized for their efforts and receive bonuses on a regular basis. Hourly employees get nothing of the sort. I love the fast-paced job and the experience I have obtained."
good,"Typically this is a very slow paced environment to work in, not very challenging as it is very routine with nothing new to learn. The management is admirable and the co-workers are exceptional. The hardest part of the job is when franchisees expectations cannot be met, and the most enjoyable is when their expectations are met or exceeded."
good,"repeatitive, this business closed down. no advancement no raises."
good,"I have work for Rodeway Inn since July, 2012 to present date, after transferring from Ramada Limited Inn. These, and many other, businesses are family owned and my employers use me as an asset to fill long-term vacancies as needed."
good,"A typical day at work is greeting and checking guest in, light cleaning, answering phones and making reservations. I have learned that sometimes it is hard pleasing everyone but with a little patience and a smile, most guest will understand even the worst situation. Co-workers can be difficult at times but there again patience comes into play and things can be turned around. I have a really good boss and the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet all different types of people from all over the world."
good,"I was lied to about the job... I was led on to believe that I was going to tend bar, but instead was primarily stuck being the cook... I had to work night hours during the week, but then had to be at work at 4:30 am on the weekends. I was lied to continually, but because I did a good job in the kitchen, I was not even considered for the bartender position as they went through 3 different bar tenders within the 3 months I worked there. I knew it was time for a change and I moved, leaving the job behind me. One of the worst jobs i have had."
good,"As an overall view its not the hotel its self i have a problem with its the Management and the way in which the hotel is run. Constantly understocked, staff undervalued and underpaid, harrassment issues not followed up or any action taken whatsoever."
good,"It's all about production. They are constantly hiring and firing. Good money if you are a good closer. Don't believe anything they tell you in the interviews in regard to training classes and opportunities for learning and coaching. When applying for frontline sales in April, I was told we were the last training class until September...then they brought in additional classes in May, June, July, and August, watering down our sales opportunities. Classroom training has almost zero application to the sales floor. When hired at the call center in August, was told that they only needed 5 people, and then watched them hire and fire new agents on a weekly basis."
good,I love sales and marketing jobs and i love my job but being there for almost four years and i have been in 3 dept that they have closed down i didnt feel like there was stubility at all that is why i decided to resign and move forward with my career showing what i have in slaes to another company..
good,"i enjoyed the daily work that i did very much, i learned more about computers, loved renting out rooms and making reservations. i loved meeting new people every day and seeing re-occuring guests as well. management was a little cooky and i believe my specific hotel was poorly taken care of, however my overall experience was fun. my co workers were wonderful, it was hard to book rooms when there was always something wrong. either missing remotes, or tv didnt work, rooms were out of order and no one would know why, or rooms that should've been out of order were being rented out for cheaper, it was fun but very scandalous"
good,The hotel was a great establishment to gain my fledgling sous chef years.
good,The management team is not the best by far. But the job itself is easy just get in get your work done and go home he will clean those rooms like you would clean your own home and you would have a problem
good,"Management sucks, low pay, good for people that hasn’t worked in a while, the hotels were kinda icky, low pay wish they would’ve paid a little more, I don’t know what else to say about it."
good,"Salary 10.16 per hour for 54 hours a week, however many more hours were worked making hourly pay much less!  Worked in very cold conditions in winter due to not being allowed to turn heat on except for gas fireplace in dining room, which was supposed to heat clerks working area.  Summer worked in extreme heat due to being told not to turn a/c below 78, which only cooled dining area. Pictures were taken of winter temperatures and summer temperatures.  Guests even complained about temperatures.  Employees complained that the proper payroll taxes were not being withheld according to the forms they filled out and when brought to the partners attention they were chastised! One employee was even let go because he insisted on having his taxes withheld according to his wishes.  The partner leads with intimidation"
good,"Revisar los trabajos de recepcion, entradas y salidas de huéspedes, Cuadre de brazaletes, reportes de costos, revisar el efectivo y las ventas por tarjetas de credito."
good,You work hard and do your job but its push push push . Always being watched on their camera system even while your on break or lunch which is against the law .  Then you get caught in corporate cut backs  and get layed off to be told to notify HR and that they have your names and waiting for your call and 20 minutes after your cut you make the call they told you to and no one in the HR knows aaaaaabout
good,"Everything was about making the sale but when you were busy getting ""tours"" was a lot of fun. You were dealing with high end clientele which is always positive."
good,"Management is Great, just not full time hours think pay should be more. Fast paced work it's great also get discounts for staying at hotel if you ever chose to"
good,"Working at this place was nothing amazing. They have a good presentation of their company policies, but often they tend to become overly too strict/demanding. That said, I perform to exceed expectation so I ended up working harder than most. For the amount of work required, pay should be closer to that of other resorts with similar ratings, not minimum wage."
good,"An alright job but not for the long run. There is quite alot of favoritisim, making it difficult to advance. They don't have a scheduling system which is unprofessional in my opinion, you wouldn't find out your shifts for the next week until the day before the week started for example."
good,"I have really enjoyed working at the Wyndham so far, I have learned a lot about maintenance. Even though the managers and owners don't really know the quality of the hotel or the issues we have with it, I have been able to grow a lot as a worker."
good,"The job was great alot of interacting with the public on a daily basis, which can help better your people skills. I would probably still be employed but the business was sold."
good,"it was great working there, i got full chance to show off    my skills, the hardest part of the job to satisfied the CEO,  its friendly culture to work, the enjoyable part is they celebrate all employees cultural days"
good,"I enjoy the overall atmosphere outside of my department as it is very welcoming and fun. However, my management  team is not very organized and the lack of real opportunities, as well as low pay compared to similar positions outside the company, makes me not enjoy my time there."
good,"I actually liked the schedule as a housekeeper there because you clock in at 8:55 a.m. and depending on how fast you clean your assigned hotel rooms you should be off by 5 p.m the job was part time for 6 days out of the week. The cons were the time limits they give you to clean each room. They expect you to make a queen sized bed in 5 mins and clean the entire hotel room in under 40 mins. It was difficult being rushed while cleaning and the more your rushed the more likely you are to make mistakes in a room and that ends up in a ""write up""."
good,"Very good exp with maint. at a resort at Edisto Island. obtained good skills with team work, facility maint. and equipment maint for grounds. over all a good job."
good,It's just a job with little to none hours the pay was weekly was the only reason I liked it no discount on anything which was crazy just a waste of time
good,"Worked in almost every job in the hotel. Driver, cook, house keeper, laundry room, grounds keep, maintenance and front desk clerk. Helped the GM with special jobs."
good,"Very relaxed. No pressure, except on very few days. Routine working. Not challenging. No future growth. A little freedom in working. Respected. No safety at work place."
good,"Contact each employee as a check in on their day prior"
good,"Go in, do your job, go home.   Sometimes work from home."
good,Wyndham Destinations was a fair working environment.  Company culture is wandering and lacking.  Top down seemed a bit red-neck mafia style (self proclaimed as well).
good,Business has its slow and busy season. During the busy season overtime was not mandatory or approved. Over worked and under pay. Company has a huge turn over rate.
good,Honestly i don't know. I have thought that the company is a good one. Learned a lot about being a boss.I think alot of people can learn from the company.
good,Quick paced environment that is very cut throat and competitive. Training is minimal and you must take it upon yourself to train and educate yourself about the products and succeed to performance that is require from the job position.
good,I learned a lot working the front desk. I learned how to book rooms and check guest in/out. The guest were the best. I loved my regular guest. I learned how to balance my drawer as well.
good,"I enjoyed working and attending to the needs of the guests."
good,"I worked at the super 8 in Groton. The hotel was)is a miss. The owner doesn't care about anything but Money, he will not keep staff that knows that's they are doing, he allows ""favorites"" to disrespect guest as well as staff. Manager wouldn't do anything either. Over all not a good place to work but would love a font desk job at another property"
good,"A typical day at work will range 3 to 8 hours a day.  This company gave me the best training within sales in general.  I learned many different types of sales tactics that I couldn't learn anywhere else.  The selling of TimeShare is a hard sell.  There's nothing to touch, smell or feel.  The hardest part of this job is being happy of what you are selling.  The most enjoyable part of this job is going to be the money."
good,The frontline employees and most of the management are top notch. Upper (corporate management - off-site) management has a hard time running this location. Their company culture is very well defined but they do not apply that to the day to day running of the offices.
good,"Go in take reservations over the phone, or cancel them, set a rate for the rooms that evening, give key cards to people who needed hotel rooms, help some customers to their room, take towels to rooms and or ice, roll away beds, cribs, etc that the customer needed.Go back to lobby to get counters fixed for complimentary breakfast, also had to clean doors and windows."
good,"Overall, it was not a bad place to work, it just wasn't a great place to work. I didn't agree with some of the policies and I didn't feel comfortable in some of what was asked of me. I left due to personal reasons."
good,no room for advancement. Overall a fine place to work. This was a temporary job for me until I found something more stable with more reliable hours. thanks
good,Employees are paid minimum wage and work by themselves with little or no contact with management. There are no benefits except wyndam discounts. I absolutely do not recommend this company.
good,This was working third shift (at may request). Helped to check in customers at night. Watch the front desk. Run the night audit each night. Put out the morning breakfast food each day before guests arose.
good,"If you like to stand outside for 8 hrs every day in any weather condition, and talk to people this is the job for you. Its a good job. The manager will be on your back. Other than management, the job is pretty relaxed."
good,I like that I could go in and get my list of rooms and get them done and be done for the day. However I was not overly pleased with the owner and his treatment of his employees.
good,"a typical day at work involves speaking to a lot of people about directions, attractions and vacation ownership. i learned how to better handle rejection."
good,"Dealing with costumers is not easy but if you get to figure their needs and keep them satisfies , yo wont have any problems. "
good,"My job as a housekeeper was to clean each hotel room to standards, greet guests, make sure hallways etc were clean and maintained, stock pool room towels, and assist with laundry. I was a very fast and efficient housekeeper. Very rarely did the supervisor have to send me back to a room for forgetting to stock something or miss something while cleaning. I enjoyed the fast paced environment because the work days always went by fairly fast!"
good,"Moving parts, days run together, enjoy training and mentoring, do not enjoy the hours and stress. after many years, I have worked in multiple resorts and held many positions. It's a challenge and fun as long is the money is there."
good,"Great job with pay except for management  who likes to gossip.. either thru like you or not. The best part is benefits, tedious job sitting with an unmbilical cord... endless call after call. They do treat employees well with food,"
good,"fun to work , but pay is never correct . it takes them between 3-8 weeks to correct your pay . they almost never come through with what they say . people are late everyday and no consequences . you show up late and call off often and no one is held accountable for there actions."
good,"A typical day included scheduling staff, reserving rooms by phone, walk-ins, and internet. It also included payroll, daily deposits, ordering of supplies, and marketing."
good,"Face paced, environment. Need to multi task and be cross trained in some departments. Some departments are small and it can get stressful when co-workers are on PTO, sick, etc..."
good,"Long hours, but great benefits. You get to work with great people, but management can play favorites. Paid time off, but working on most holidays are required."
good,"I worked as a housekeeper for Days Inn, and while I loved the people I worked with, the job was beyond frustrating. Some weeks I would only work 5-10 hours and other weeks I would work 20-25 hours. The work is mundane and makes for very long days. When you'd get your paycheck, it would always feel underwhelming."
good,"Now this is my first Hotel job, so I will forever be thankful for the opportunity and the skills they imparted to me during this year experience. And at first it was a wonderful place to work at, friendly co-workers, a General Manager who is eager to watch me grow with the company, etc. However, over time, things have began to go rather sour. All my teachers (co-workers) have left, management has been changed a few times, each with their own goals in mind (and not keeping the employees in mind). "
good,"Great place to work but management was poor, constantly lied to by superiors , but great pay structure. Bonus levels were good and made a lot of money"
good,You can make a lot of money in this industry if you have a good manager and can handle the roller coaster of success. Very high highs and very low lows. One month you can hit top level bonus and the next you can rack up a whole lot of draw pay.
good,Ok place to work for! It is hard work! They used to have lots of bonuses but I hear they quit doing that. Don't know how the pay is any more for housekeepers they used to get peace rate. I hear now it's hourly.
good,At the time the owner and his family were operating the hotel. This created confusion because there were too many people who thought they were the boss.
good,"Wyndham is a great company if you are motivated by career growth potential.  However, it is such a large company that it is difficult to feel like an individual rather than a number."
good,"The best part about working for Days Inn and Suites was the people I worked with. They are funny, smart and enjoyable people that deserve a lot better in workplace benefits than what they get."
good,A typical day working as a housekeeper for the Wyndham Hotel consist of getting the items you need to clean the rooms assigned to you. You mostly work by yourself.
good,"• Supervised the pool area, made sure everyone with a wristband could swim."
good,"Typical day at work would be making sure the lobby is clean, Making sure everyone checked out in time, housekeeper assignments were assigned, taking calls and making reservations, and overall making sure each guest is content."
good,"Days at work can either be busy and stressful, or not busy and relaxed - although there is always office work to be done.  Management and coworkers are very reliable and hardworking.  I enjoy working there."
good,"Loved the people that i worked with.  Loved the challenges that each day provided.  Making guest happy is what i loved."
good,"Exciting industry to be in, sending people on vacation.  Campus is great with a lot of benefits.  Work-load is beyond a 40 hour work week, but co-workers are great."
good,"The job itself was easy enough, but management had other ideas. Lack of communication and tact made a simple job less enjoyable and the owner seemed to have more important things to do."
good,"Low salaries that are not equal to the demands and expectations of the position. Very high work-load demands. Typically do not offer breaks in my position. No review process for regular raises."
good,Tough environment for a newbie. I'd recommend sharpening your teeth on front line sales then migrate to in house. They tour their clients every 2 weeks!!!
good,"The hours were fantastic. 5-6 hours, 5 days a week. The compensation was fantastic until the company made various changes to the pay structure. Management provided little aid to the CMAs and seemed to care solely about the needs of the company and not the needs of the employees."
good,"Very Low pay,not organized under bad management, owners did not care. not very clean. Never gave proper wages to the employees. had to ask for pay"
good,I did not like this work place due to the management it could have been way better and they could have listen t our problems and tried to help with them if they could.
good,a typical job with collections challenges and people. There are constant changes and micro management makes it difficult to do the job you were hired to do.
good,"Stressful work environment, understaffed. Hard to work as a team with the amount of stress. Transition in management was hard for staff to adjust to."
good,Compensation and benefits should be more to show employees they are appreciated & valued for being with the company for a while.
good,"-answer phones                                               "
good,"Wyndham is a great place to work with great commission structure.  Management should treat all employees with respect, and not show favoritism - it destroys morale."
good,"The coworkers were great to be around, worked around my schedule, enjoyed getting to know different paople that came and stayed in some of the rooms,"
good,"Had bug problems , High turnover rate for GM and Managers every 90 days they would get rid of all Management so they didnt have to pay out Unemployment, I got hired in the middle of a change to help clean up the hotel of all negativity and past old employees. "
good,"Price too clean a bed and fix is low should be more.  The workwasgood had fun making beds, wish the job was longer than a seasonal.  Wish I had my job back. The overall experience was great some staff members too pick up the pace,  as well as favorism.  Is amongst the ones who worked longer,  pairs is highly recommended. Thats all."
good,"Corporate structure for Wyndham is excellent, they need to review the individual franchise owner on a single basis. "
good,The company as a whole is wonderful and they provide wonderful benefits and career advancement within the company many. The management tend to be somewhat rude and seem to pick favorites.
good,"It was a very fun job for my first job but it was too much drama for a work enviroment. Nobody really got along like a crew should at a workplace, all the ladys talked bad about eachother."
good,"Extremely high paced work environment with long hours. I found the job to be exciting and fun however the company owners were not as involved as I would have imagined them to be,."
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job is, seeing smiles on peoples faces  as they tell me what a great place an there stay was. As they complement our front desk . As every place has its difficulties , the hardest is turning a  guest away when we don't have any rooms left, or if theres something wrong with there room, an we couldnt get them another on, an they leave. that is the hardest. As we just got a new manager , hes great! Kodi, goes over an beyond to try to do what he can to make customers happy. There's a lot to learn working at a hotel, yes most of its easy. Doing night at different places has been an experience , as I am thankful of being able to learn . "
good,"I had fun working for Wyndham. "
good,"•	Prepared spreadsheets, reports, financial statements and letters."
good,Typically I worked alone at the desk. I became proficient in the Opera property management system. The guests at this hotel were generally repeat customers and I got to know most of them very well.
good,"Shift change, check for reservation and Guest checking out. "
good,"We were always made accountable to the main Wyndham office out of NJ. The reports they sent were very rarely on time. There were frequent audits, which led to a stressful work environment."
good,"Needs some system modernization, the way to do the accounting is much updated. Much time is lost in paperwork which otherwise it could be done easier and more promptly with the software being used by more updated companies"
good,"My favorite part of the job was meeting people from all over the world and growing with the ever changing travel industry. You are one of the first to gain advance knowledge of major developments and events in the local area helping you stay active with the community and surrounding businesses. As an employee, Wyndham perks include hotel discounts throughout the franchise but benefits and holiday/vacation pay can lack depending on the individual property owner. Business hours are 24hrs a day 365 days a year so this job is ideal for anyone that needs flexibility. Good place to work if you like a corporate structure but a small business environment."
good,I liked the job. Supervisor was helpful and made a impact in each employees work. I wished the job payed their employees more. Coworkers always helped when needed.
good,"My job was to schedule reservations, check customers in and customers out of  the establishment. Render service in anyway needed. Accept payment for services rendered."
good,"A typical day at work would start with me clocking in and doing security walks. After doing the security walks I would login to the system and do the IN-HOUSE check and ARRIVAL check.  After I was done with that I would check people either in or out depending on the shift that I would work. During my down time I would clean the lobby or do laundry. I would also have to do 2 other security checks through out the night.  At the end of my shift I would close out my drawer and clock out. "
good,The short time I worked for Wyndham was very nice and enjoyable. I would work with the same management team I worked with at the property at a moments notice. I learned a lot of valuable information from the current General Manager that I will take with me to the next chapter of my career.
good,"Supposed ""Count on Me"" atmosphere, however when you're ""on tour"" it's every man for himself. Management is lacking except for a couple exceptional examples, otherwise it's ""go on a learn for yourself, that is until you make a considerable amount of sales, then we'll work with you""."
good,Great potential for experience individuals.  Need to be a self starter with the ability to take lots of rejection.  Very little support could be frustrating at times....
good,"My very first day, they praised me saying that I was a natural. Required little training. The General Manager and Assistant Manager were very professional and yet fun to be around. However, I felt that they needed more security equipment from all angles. Shortly after I started working there, a fellow employee helped his friend steal the company safe. He was a very unstable young man, that I felt was participating in other activities besides smoking cigaretts. However, those were only my observations of his personality and actions."
good,"Considering its now called something else. Things improved a bit but its all the same, advancement isn't really an option not in Corcoran."
good,"Check in guests and process checkouts"
good,"I worked at Days Inn and even put down in my online resume that it was Days Inn so I don't know why they are calling in Wyndham Vacation Ownership. So I will review it as Days Inn."
good,No benefits; no advancement; not a whole lot going on at night; decent job
good,I enjoy my job.  Getting to assist the guest gives me great pleasure.  I enjoy interacting with the guest. Most of them are friendly. I get along with the rest of the front desk staff and other staff that I interact with on occasion other that the manager. The only issue I have is there is not room for advancement.
good,"It was a nice place to work, got to meet a lot of new people and talk to them about travel and there next travel plans, I liked it when we was complimented and how much they like the surrounding areas and capital reef."
good,I did like the fact that I was working by myself. You did not have to depend on anyone else to get their work done. There was down time in between checking in guest. The weekends were busy but the time went faster. At times I would have to fix a problem with a guests room.
good,it was a alright place to work but they never kept people and we had to work very late to keep it a float till they found people to work
good,"The co-workers were fantastic, but management was often lacking or overwhelming and very inconsistent."
good,"Typical day at work- first need go to receptionist to sign in and get list what you need to clean..go for equipment and go to clean rooms.."
good,This was jjust a 3 month temporary term job. I worked decent hours from 7am-3pm. There was no room for advancement and no job security or benefits.
good,Contact customers via dialer system for timeshare accounts and contracts. Provide customer service for incoming calls.
good,"Running night audits, checking in customers "
good,"I am currently working for Best western Maypole Metro Hotel as a housekeeper i used be a head house keeper but it was for a temporary bases the duties i used to carry out when i was a head housekeeper were: Supervise senior members of staff , stock checks, Serving continental Breakfast in the mornings to guest , clean  rooms etc."
good,this is a place for highly motivated people to express their desire to sell vacations for timeshare.
good,"Good days at work, enjoyed my job, like to talk to people. Management was good, hardest part of job was having people hang up on you, but you just go on to next call"
good,"poor management, poor salary. Had to wait for text messages to find out when am I working next."
good,its been a great experience working with many customers people around the world 
good,"A typical night at work would consist of cleaning, checking guests in and out, answering phone calls, assisting guests with any issues, doing the night audit, at times solving problems with troubling guests.  I learned how to deal with different types of people, a bit more about how a hotel is run and many of the expenses.  My managers were very easy to get along with, very friendly, they would just tend to procrastinate on certain things.  My co-workers were great, especially towards the end of my time there.  They were all very dependable and friendly.  Honestly, dealing with some of the difficult guests (i.e.; guests that would tend to get rowdy and at certain times the cops would need to be called out) and the night hours tended to get difficult because I had trouble sleeping during the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the freedom I had."
good,"People is great, systems are a bit old and limited opportunities to grow"
good,Loved the customers that came in on there travels. Was really interesting to see people from all over and hear the accents that would come thru.
good,"- Work as a front desk, housekeeper supervisor, and breakfast attendent."
good,Gained plenty of knowledge regarding the hotel industry. Ownership limited the potential of this particular hotel.
good,The most exciting thing was when most of the guest would check out i would get great reveiws on how nice my smile was all the time and what a great time they had stayind in our hotel.That they would come back again whenever in town. All the staff was nice to each other and very helpful at all times.We all work as a team hard everyday and went home heathly safe.
good,"A nice company where you can make your career, bringing to Guest a wonderful experience."
good,-- Making sure to do everything down to the last detail so you don't give someone a reason or way to try and back stab you and try to get you fired.
good,The company is always pushing employees to take on more work with fewer resources.
good,"The hospitality business can be rough, but it benefits with the daily encounters of both problem solving and customer service. I learned a lot about both myself and others through various situations you are put in as well as the change of scheduled hours."
good,"A typical day involved preparing a housekeeping room-servicing sheet for daily cleaning of rooms. Performing 'bucket checks' in order to physically see how many rooms were rented and vacant. Check-out guests before noon, update room status on computer programs and coordinate with housekeepers/maintenance dept. on any issues that might need additional time to clear. Calling up third-party companies on past payments and informing them of their due dates. Drafting correspondence, emailing, faxing, copying, providing directions over the phone to driving guests from local airports, etc."
good,While working at the Days Inn forest park I mainly enjoyed my co workers making the time roll by during my shift. We had each other's back when the hotel became busy.
good,you never knew what was up or what was scheduled. you have to roll with whatever comes down the pike
good,If you like working by yourself great place to work. As a housekeeper you clean rooms and have little interaction with others.
good,"Overall, a good place to work.  Not much advancement within the center, but lots open to you if you are willing to relocate.  Good benefits package and hours are reasonable."
good,"I love my job, but the pay isn’t the best, minimum wage for us. However it works around our daughters school hours so for me it’s worth it. "
good,"Job is typical for this type of industry. Not paid very well and no benefits. High turn around, no change to advance in company. At the property alone 99% of the time without a supervisor or maintenance worker available. No working security cameras available, so working environment did not always feel safe."
good,"I have been working here since 03 months only, it's a good hotel to start your career. Colleagues are very supportive and helpful, very cheerful environment."
good,"Fast paced, have to deal with mean people and you can't leave your desk you need to order food and don't have breaks."
good,It's a good working environment if you like a slow paced job. It's friendly. Just not enough hours for me and no overtime is allowed. No paid holidays
good,"Sales was very stressful, and expectations/achievable goals unrealistic with certain circumstances and counted again you. "
good,"Good job and OK pay only reason for leaving was of medical problems around that time and my car. Mostly doing rooms, cleaning, and dealing with all types of people"
good,"It was a nice place to work. I just didn’t make that good of money. I made 7.25/hr, which wasn’t enough to live off of or get what I needed to get. They have a new owner now and pay more and have a better management and work environment."
good,"As a housekeeper we were paid by the room, not the hour. To make minimum wage you had to clean 2 rooms an hour, which was VERY DIFFICULT at times. There were hot tub rooms, and cleaning a hot tub is time consuming. Plus if the guest trashed the room there just wasn't time. If you cleaned less than 2 rooms an hour they had to make up the pay so that you did get minimum wage and that upset them."
good,Can be a hit or miss depending on which your manager is as some of them are very unprofessional and arrogant. Training is good and they will pay you training pay plus commissions for 2 months andafyer that  it's all commission. There is potential to make a lot of money but at times it is looks that sell rather than skills in this business. Also managers are just bad and a lot of favoritism.
good,My favorite part of the job was the Co workers I worked with. Everyone had a great attitude and we all believed in team work. So whoever got done with their rooms first we would go help the next person until every room was ready. The inventory I did every Tuesday was very simple the hardest part of working there was if someone didn't show up for work it put us in a very bad situation but we understood people get sick it was also a very physical and demanding job
good,"There are only three measurements that tell you nearly everything you need to know about your organization’s overall performance: employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and cash flow. It goes without saying that no company, small or large, can win over the long run without energized employees who believe in the mission and understand how to achieve it.”"
good,I would recommend this job to someone who is not in need of a high salary or benefits but who wants to acquire experience in the hospitality industry.
good,Not a bad place to work just really slow during the winter season and I feel the owners amd manager are really looking out for their older employees that have worked there for a while
good,One of the better jobs on the beach but that is not saying much as I made more money in another state over a decade ago. Usually guaranteed 40 hours and the benefits are good and not many places where you get almost 4 weeks of paid time off a year. Hours are generally not steady and that can be hard on the body and mind as you may work 3 different shifts a week.
good,"I enjoy my job to the fullest. I love being able to make a difference in a huge company like this. Only reason I am looking for something else is due to my position being cut due to the corporate team saying there was too much leadership in the company so it was ""Too top heavy"". I was placed under a manager that has no idea what to do or how to do it. So now I am training them as my replacement. My workload stayed the same if not grew more, for a lower position."
good,"I really enjoyed working at a Wyndham Destinations.  The attmosphere was great.  The pay was low due to the fact that we recieved tips.  Tips were shared by the servers but the Manager/Owner kept 25% for himself.  Alot of the staff left after they found that out.  I left because i was moving out of town and would have probably left when I found out that he was keeping tips that the servers worked hard for. Being a banquet server was something very new to me, I enjoyed it very much."
good,"Co workers  and  benefits  are  what  made  it  enjoyable  to  go  to  work  each  day.  Company  provides  excellent  travel   benefits.  Some  issues  with  upper  management, often  not  understanding  of  daily  responsibilities  of  front  line  staff."
good,"Initially, I started working at Days Inn just to make some cash. I ended up staying longer because I knew they needed the help. However, some days I would would come into work and they would send me home, saying they did not need me that day. It would not have been a problem, had they called me the night before or a few hours before it was time for me to come in. This not only happened once, but several times."
good,"An irate customer complaint about stained sheet was accommodated respectfully and left very happy and also returned several times. "
good,"great place , great owners, horrific leadership at a regional level, director of sales for myrtle beach at the time doug montgomery was a nightmare of a leader."
good,When I first started it was a great job with benefits. After my first year they got a new manager and the work environment became hard to work in because of his racial preference to white individuals.
good,"Excellent company overall, treated employees and customers well. Abundance of locations, nice place to work each day, friendly staff who encouraged learning for success."
good,"As a Customer Service Representative, I need updated information on the products I support. The databases for information about the resorts I was selling missed some vital information and was not updated the entire time I worked there, and management didn't seem to care. A CSR should have all the necessary information within easy access while attending to the needs of the caller. Instead, I often had to check 4 or 5 different sources and even had to call the resorts to ask them for information while conversing with callers.  I cannot fathom how keeping their information about the very product we are selling would be difficult or even expensive. This, in and of itself, shows a deep corporate culture of lazy unproffesionalism that I came to despise about this place. In my opinion, this company is a good example of how the ""bottom line only"" approach to capitalism has gone so far as to be self-obstructive. "
good,You meet plenty of people and learn different things. Your work environment changes by customers. The hardest part about the job is keeping a customer happy.
good,Depending on who your manager is you will have a great amount opportunity. I was blessed with a few really good managers and climbed the ranks pretty easily. I left due to a manager that was horrible at his job and didn't recognize good employees.
good,"Your typical hotel with regular amenities include. I learned the basics of cleaning the hotel, health and safety hazards. They have standard security that drives around and also it's located in a calming atmosphere."
good,Just be one of the stars and you are good. Otherwise you will not make much money in New York City because this is not a good place for people to buy timeshare.
good,I loved the job itself and management but my co-workers were jealous of my room list not taking into consideration I also did breakfast in the mornings then right after dived right in to housekeeping
good,"Overworked, underappreciated, and underpaid. We often had too much to do and not enough employees. Management didn't seem to care and they paid less than what was average for the area."
good,Some very good people; environment and culture always changing; the future is very exciting but as they roll out as their own company.  So much to learn and great being part of a hospitality company.
good,The job can be somewhat demanding sometimes people call in and you have to work there shift . The pros of this is you can get plenty of overtime. Also management are really laid back.
good,"there decent hotels, customer service people are very nice and helpful & try there best to help you with there situations. Nice employees they have and great positive attitude make you feel welcome"
good,"recently laid off; a lot of changes taking place. Nice place though. Friendly people, interesting project work. Good work/life balance but pay was not competitive."
good,The Wydham Garden Duluth taught me a lot about relying on oneself usually the role I was required a lot of team which was not always provided by the staff. I believe once the staff and some remodeling happened the hotel could be a wonderful place to work.
good,Good company but for them to be the #1 resort /hotel in the world they need to seriously pay their employees more the pay sucks so bad they need to most definitely increase it and high turnover rate
good,"Everyone has a different opinion about jobs . I would advise that you try them for yourself and see what you think."
good,Check in and Check out customer. reservation handling. Answer phone calls. Reporting for daily activities. team working place. very friendly place. enjoy working with all different department.
good,I was a sales rep it was really a fun experience I ran into all types of people. Some people who didn't want to be there and others who were generally interested in vacation ownership.
good,"operational position"
good,No benefits. Minimum wage pay. Discounts to other Wyndham properties. Opportunity for advancement is slim. Standards and Practices need improvement for hotels to suitable work or hotel stays.
good,"It was reliable but low paying.  Typical employees are overworked for far too little pay.  This seems to be a consistent problem across most hotels, sadly."
good,"Management is still new so it was hectic.  Veteran employees were given priority over newbies, however the people were nice.  The hardest part was that it was slow paced so it was hard to book tours.  Great benefits for full time employees.  Events were fun but taxing on the body since you are not allowed to sit, most of the time your are standing."
good,The people are good but it seemed like they had more people than they needed and there wasn't enough work for everyone. Need to give more people a chance to prove themselves.
good,Was OK at first but after a year in it i noticed that i started making dramatically less money but was getting the same tips from people as i always have maybe even more. i told a couple of my customers about the situation and they helped me identify what was going on. The management ended up was taking my tips and pocketing them so i had to leave.
good,Sold Time share to vacationers.  This was my first time selling time share.  It is a high pressure sales pitch where the customer has practiced saying no prior to sitting with me.
good,"I worked at a Ramada location for approximately 5 years. Overall it is a great place to work, and the management team is usually more than happy to work with college students and their schedules."
good,Decent job while in college 8 hour shifts but only 4 hours of work so I had time to work on homework. Weekends could be hard when you are the only one there and you had a full hotel.
good,"Good job for a fixed schedule"
good,A typical day at work was the same every day. I learnt something new everyday i went in. The head boss was a great guy and always worked with you. The boss below him however was very backwards and aggressive towards people. Hardest part of the job was getting all the meat off the machines and parts. And the most enjoyable was working by yourself but also all other employees were easy to get along with.
good,"Learned a lot about building my Personal Brand.  Management for the most part do try to build the agents up and help them to improve their performance and build their skills. "
good,"Went in for work and started setting up for breakfast/ brunch. "
good,My favorite part of working here is talking to guest and finding out where they are from. Finding out things they like to do on vacation or in their home state.
good,"Dealing with drunk unruly people who tend to cause trouble is what takes most of your work day up. Besides that there is considerable amount of downtime waiting for specific email. Auditing is generally easy."
good,like the fast pace work. If it was full time employment higher with the opportunity of having weekends off once in a while would be great.
good,"If you like to be pressured and like problem solving this is a great place to work at. You will get numerous calls due to heating, cooling, water, drainage. etc. I learned a lot about being hands-on. This isn't a job you only do what you are assigned to do. If you can do it, you do it. Management was difficult due to every 3 months a new manager would be hired. The co-workers help you in every way possible to not lose it. The hardest part of the time was to do things on your own even if you weren't taught, but when employees do have time to teach you, they will."
good,"Typical Day- Head housekeeper assistant  get a sheet of all rooms to be cleaned, strip the rooms of the dirty linen, supervise housekeepers by checking the rooms after they cleaned and make sure done right keep up on washing laundry by myself or help laundry person if assigned one that day. Housekeeping days clean and stock rooms with fresh linen and supplies in a timely manner and stock stay over rooms with fresh linen and supplies, and any other cleaning duties that is requested."
good,Being a housekeeper shown me how important to have people pleased. I learn how to take my skills in to much detail. My management did do a great job having communication with each other. Hardest part is dealing with really rude people & most enjoyable part is meeting no people from different locations.
good,"Signed on to computers, logged into phone system and started speaking with customers about purchasing vacation packages at discounted rates. Learned better sales tactics. Management was considerate for the most part, however still had many issues. Co-workers were great people who always wanted to learn and better themselves. The hardest part of the job was the amount of commission earn due to loss of quality clientele. Most enjoyable part of the job was the lessons learned discussing ways to better ourselves."
good,"Days Inn was a hotel that needed progress. The rooms weren't the best but they tried to make it as best as they could. The management was poor, I was not particularly trained so i trained myself. Warm, welcoming people in general but the place itself needs improvement."
good,"Opening up the restaurant for the days business any where assigning the waitress stations to cooking . I had to learn to balance the money that the restaurant took in for any given day,"
good,"Checked guest in and out. Handled guest complaints. Replied to online reviews. Responsible for the handling of cash, credit card payments, and refunds. Did Audit at night. Prepared the daily deposits from the safe for when they Operations Manager took them to the bank at the end of the week. Keep lobby clean. Setup Continental Breakfast when there was no more than 25 rooms. Closing the pool and game room every night. Do bucket checks to make sure we had all registration cards for every guest checked in, for if an emergency was to arise. Checking cash drawer at the beginning and end of shift."
good,"Typical day involved greeting arriving guests, helping with their luggage and maintaining a friendly environment amongst guests and workers"
good,Typical day at work would be checking in guest and running reports. Daily cleaning and setting out food for breakfast. Making sure guest are comfortable and satisfied with their stay with us at days inn
good,Hotel work is different than any other job you can ask for.  You see so much from guests.  I love working with people so the guests and I always got along.
good,Gives me plenty of time to study since I work the night shift. No opportunity for a career here. Its good for students who like to balance their work/study environment.
good,"As a night auditor I don't feel safe working , but over all the job is very easy and not a hassle at all. My typical day would consist of answering the telephone , checking guest in and out, handling payment methods which included credit cards and cash. "
good,"We had many airline crews on a daily basis. Very close to the airport and Port of Miami.Many overnight stays."
good,I worked at a Super 8 Motel -- a pretty casual place to work. No matter what job I was doing I still interacted with guests on a daily basis and handled money. Coworkers took breaks together and the whole setting was just laid back.
good,"•	Customer Services "
good,"I sold the meeting rooms and conference rooms. Managed meetings, and banquets.The hardest part of this job were the different hours I would need to be on property for events. The most enjoyable part of the job was when events were over and the guest were happy."
good,I liked the people I worked with however it's nearly impossible to get all the work done on the property when the some of my crew are not doing their jobs thoroughly.  What I have learned from this job is to do your job the best you can and if it's not enough then it's time to go elsewhere where my expertise is appreciated
good,"Wyndham is a great place to work because of the people.  While I did gain a lot of corporate experience and knowledge of an array of audits, there is little room for advancement."
good,The older staff members are slow to change to more efficient practices. Communication between departments was sorely lacking.
good,not a bad place to work pay was just to low and the only shift open was the weekend graveyard
good,"In a day to day basis we need to solicit prospective guests in hotel lobbies, booths or other designated locations while providing signature concierge service. To qualify them to assure that they meet the guidelines for the sales presentation; if qualified, invite them to attend a vacation ownership presentation at a variety of Wyndham Resort locations in the area."
good,"Very intense selling and great place to refine your sales tehinique as most clients are there for the free weekend trip and not to purchase a time share that cost $20,000 on the spot."
good,I enjoyed working there felt a real purpose but that all came to an abrupt end.  Letigation between owners and property managers cause for us to lose our job with out notice.
good,"this was an enjoyable job but no room for advancement, no benefits, provided me the opportunity to learn and grow"
good,I enjoyed my job at the hotel but when I needed off for jury duty they told me no.
good,Our managers and the co-workers were the best thing about the job. Everyone worked hard to try to please the higher ups. We not only had to make sure that our customers were happy but we also had to make sure that the restaurants had clean napkins. All of us worked together to attain that goal. We also had alot of potlucks and parties.
good,"Working at the front desk alone."
good,You learn time management and how to deal with problems by yourself.
good,"Days Inn Chesapeake was a busy hotel with 96 rooms. It was the last hotel from Chesapeake VA to Nags Head NC, and we saw many travelers on their way to Nags Head.  I started as night auditor, and worked up to acting front desk supervisor.  There were many components of the job, that were made easier by the implementation of a computer system for check ins. I find it interesting, that Indeed put this as a Wyndham property, however if you call Wyndham, they have no number for this Days Inn, on Battlefield BLVD,  but they will tell you the only Days Inn in Chesapeake is on George WAshington Highway."
good,"The franchise was run by a family. Assisting in running the front desk, take reservations, assist customers in a hotel setting, money handling, auditing, etc. Due to the family running three hotels all on separate payrolls, it allowed them to make you work overtime without overtime pay. No insurance. Long hours, little enjoyment."
good,From one day to the next it was an interesting experience based on teamwork
good,"Friendly people. Way under paid. No elevators, worked outside all season long."
good,"I have been a responsible customer service representative with 7 years of experience working in fast-paced environments. I’m a solid team player with great positive attitude. I was a hardworking customer service representative for five years for Lowe's and  Fairfield Resorts. My job was to schedule appointments for the company, daily data entry, giving great customer service to all our clients, motivated customer service representative in a fast-paced environment, filing paperwork, and I took daily inventory on cash, gift cards and etc. Everyone would come to me when they needed something done because I would get it done!"
good,"I did enjoy working for the company, but they lacked security for the hotel. There was an attempt robbery twice, while I was working there. Overall it would be a good place to work for, they just need security."
good,This is a good company to work for but they have very strict requirements for the number of sales that you must achieve each month that you are learning their systems plus dealing with cold calls each day.
good,"I would start my day out viewing the gift shop as a whole to figure out what needs to be done as far as stocking and cleaning. Then I go to my to do list to see what items need work in the computer from purchase orders, ordering from vendors, or weekly schedule creation. I would break out my coworker for luch and restock the store before the end of the day."
good,"In der Ausbildung zum Koch habe ich den Umgang mit Geräten, Lebensmitteln und Kollegen zu schätzen gelernt.Hier konnte ich meine Kreativität ausleben, es war eine harte aber auch informative Zeit meines Lebens."
good,Wyndham is a great environment for self motivated driven people.
good,Current Manager is one to watch out for. Don't get on her bad side or you will be looking for a new job shortly. Co-workers are wonderful. Fast pace job. No benefits.
good,"A typical day would consist of meeting new people everyday, helping the customer, schedualing room maid service, and providing the needs of the guests. i learned to interact with various types of personalities and how to handle a situation and to use the computer for office realated work aloso learned phone ettiqutte. worked alone. i enjoyed interacting with our guests."
good,"Busy and fast paced, great atmosphere, enjoyable but stressful at times"
good,Good team of people. Typical day involved checking room to QA standards and delegating tasks.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with this company.  The pay is not really good but for a beginner, this is the perfect place to start."
good,"It's your typical hotel front desk job. You take reservations, check in guests, do reports and clean."
good,It is an OK company to work for. IT does not really have a culture. There is always lots of work but it is reactionary instead of being proactive. 
good,"I cleaned alot of checkout and stay over rooms. I also helped other co-workers with their boards if I was done with my floor. The people were nice,, the tips were okay the hotel itself is beautiful ..The rooms are spacious which meant you wanted to take your time and make sure you didnt miss anything but, for me I must say I had to work as I must and do the best job I could.. The wyndham is a very nice hotel to stay at lots of amenities and people who care you get the best service possible."
good,"Morning started with running daily audit reports, check in and check out reports, communication with housekeeping for daily room services. Checking in and out customers, running credit checks, pre payments, post daily credits such as phone calls, laundry services, or internet. I learned new computer programs, and the management was fair. The hardest part of my job was recording every thing by hand when the system broke down for 3 weeks, and the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with new and exciting people, sometimes celebrities. I was able to meet BB King and all of the Pointer Sisters.."
good,"The hardest part was that they call in at random times and I have to be there,but other than that it wasn't so bad. A typical day at work would be going in and washing the bathroom and cleaning bedrooms and such, and sometimes the rooms would be really bad especially the bathrooms."
good,"worked in a call center that was very loud and unprofessional lack management support,enjoyed my fellow coworkers and benifits."
good,Operations support involved routine tasks along with trouble shooting and participating in team meetings for crucial technical issues and resolution. Co-workers were helpful in the learning process. Hardest part of the job was working the night shift over the weekdays as well as all weekend days. Most enjoyable part was free food and other company events.
good,pode ser melho para todos nao es pecializa seus funcionarios
good,"I worked for the new owner for a short time before I was let go for restructuring. I was responsible for the ordering of all beverages for the hotel. Involved in all aspects of running the hotel from the front desk to banquets, even house keeping. When I was there Management was awesome, for the most part we all got along. We made team into dreamwork. I will have these friend ships for the rest of my life. The hardest part of working there was being on call 24 hrs. a day."
good,"Sign into multiple applications, receive calls, problem solve and assist with planning vacations while providing customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job is working an issue through to completion. Hardest part of the day is delivering bad news."
good,"More proficient you are in computer skills. Easier this job is. Good customer service skills needed. Love of animals appreciated.  Love of laundry, this is your job!"
good,I really enjoyed the Job just felt the environment was very favored towards certain employees..I didn't really feel like I belonged there.and felt work ethic wasnt really a big thing
good,Nice hotel with updates going on. i learned problem solving and how to have a positive attitude in situations. the management is nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job is the physical aspect of it.
good,Many people would not be able to handle the weather outside and short of hours. The weather Inter fears with peoples pay and there is lack of work. And living I  texas the weather is unpredictable.
good,Management needs to improve service and employee satisfaction. Needs to be more customer oriented but also invest in infrastructure and supplies. More training needed
good,Working for Wyndham means you must be willing to utilize cutthroat and backstabbing techniques to make any advancement. GM's are often thrown into a mess given very little Direction or skills to achieve what corporate expects of them. There is no employee dedication or commitment and goals are not clearly defined.
good,"It was a good job, coworker were good , management was sometimes bad but overall it was good they were very very flexible with me still being in school ."
good,Relinquished employment no help from mgt. Reviews skewed told about deaths too friends and family out of my control. Only #'s n money considered. Sad.
good,It was a good place to work for it wasn’t for me I got a better offer on a  different place. but it gave me experience  I was happy there it’s a good place to go for a first job.
good,"Overall experience was good. The job was what I expected it to be, and it was a job that I enjoyed. I am only part-time and do not reach the number of hours I expect.  This is my only reason for possibly leaving."
good,I liked that job alot but had 2 jobs and they wouldn't work with my schedule..I liked working in the morning so I can be with my kids in the evening..I would like to go back there..
good,I was not with them for long but in that time I did get a lot of experience with cross training. I did switch roles there because the housekeeping standards for time were a problem for me. Other than my transfer everything was good.
good,I liked working at days inn it had great benefits good people. Had to be on ur feet the whole time but that's something I like to do so that was no problem for me
good,I wouldn’t work doing this anymore! I have a weak stomach so it was super hard doing things like this. It was a learning experience though! Also I rather be interacting with people.
good,"Need to pay your own parking at work for at least $175 per month."
good,Grate job learn new thing grate place of business alot of hard workers can get real busy summer nights are the longest but over call grate place to work at
good,Great company to work for I like cleaning guest room customer service is great I like making my guest feel welcome and comfortable the hardest part of this job was getting clean laundry and the company fed the employees free
good,Guests can earn points for each nights stay and as the points add up to fifteen hundred points they will get one free night at any Wyndham location. It was a good place to earn points for guests
good,"It started out good most of my time there, but with hired a new GM that was not professional at all had no experience as a GM and did not do a good job."
good,I like this job. Everyone helps one another. They take care of their workers. The team is really strong. The pay is just really not very good. I love the job and my coworkers.
good,lots of food. I think it could be good money you gotta have the mindset for it. I wish i could have been deceiving because a guy that can lie would kill it.
good,It was a good learning experience and I certainly took a lot from it. I gained a lot of knowledge in the sales industry and would only recommend if extremely determined and gutsy.
good,Company credit card and lots of airport waiting. travel to locations and reimage older computers. As with most corporations more work load then time provided.
good,The job is somewhat exhausting however you can make a lot of money. You have to be able to handle rejection and talk to 100 people everyday to make good money.
good,Great Company i learned alot working for them. Started when i was 25 years old frsh out of college. They taught me how to be a business man and be in control of your own destiny.
good,A typical day including interaction with the public and allowed me to meet many new people but I found management was unprofessional and unknowledgeable about their employers and daily task.
good,It was good working for them.the bosses were fair and good to work for.I liked that they gave out a christmas bonus.it was also ran really smooth.i would work for them again.
good,"Working at this hotel was at times fast paced. With many hours of helping guests, taking reservations, fixing minor issues, and generally making sure guest had a good stay."
good,"30 minutes in a room pull trash and make bed dust and mop, fold the towels in the correct places and load the room back up with the needs of supplies,"
good,Good atmosphere. Not as many hours as I would prefer. Not as much money as I need to survive. The people are awesome. Customers are kind. The company needs upgrades .
good,"I think that same with every company, your daily work life is always dependent on management. My general managers and assistant general manager of the whole building were absolutely amazing. I  love them. Lower level management... I have opposite opinions."
good,"Overall, the start of the work experience was great! However, management started slacking and once it came to Doctor excuses they were very strict on missing work no matter if you was excused due to troubling health."
good,"A lot of bending over and hard work because you have to make beds, clean bathrooms. If you have a bad back I would not recommend this place but if you enjoy cleaning this is your job."
good,The typical day was checking guests in and out. making reservations and assisting guests with any suggestions on dining out and local attractions in the area.
good,Basically if the people who are connected to the manager don’t like you they will find every way to get you fired. Too much politics to the point that hard work doesn’t even come into the equation
good,"The sales dept, is very competitive, full of motivation. I would recommend anyone to get in the sales job to learn persuasion skills which you would need to be successful in life. However, every sales job has ups and downs. but when your entire team is not selling, and others do; someone might be filtrating the leads."
good,I had to check people in and out of their rooms. I even worked as the house keeper when we was short staffed some days. I made sure breakfast was kept clean and stocked for the customers.
good,"There are definitely some employees and leaders there who certainly want to make a difference in customers and Employee’s lives. Unfortunately because of high hurdles and expectations, it’s hard to maintain the integrity you walked in with and meet performance."
good,It was OK work place everyone here was helpful also had plenty of favoritism with the hours. Overall a relaxed work place but  very slow paced job with over staffed days.
good,"I worked in the hotel industry for several years immediately  after college,  I enjoyed it. Recruiting and managing staff, interacting with the customers."
good,It’s a very well build part of a hotel. Gives people free nights if you e stayed so many times. Has a verity of breakfast food and works well with other places
good,"This job allowed me to really hone my people skills. Dealing with customers from all over the world, I learned how to handle many issues to achieve happy customers."
good,A typical shift consisted of busy phones check in's and check out as well as making new reservations. I learned to be patient and multitask duties. The hardest part of the job was sometimes working alone when something needing fixing and your the only one there. The most enjoyable part of my job there was meeting people from all over the world.
good,"I got a little over a years worth of experience working for this company. It was a super easy and laid back kind of job. The manager was not to bad. There were times that the management was not great but the real problem was the owner. They never wanted to pay the bills, fix anything or update anything either."
good,If on day shift it was very busy. Learned a lot about Hotel industry. Management was helpful. If not present I could always call them. Talked to people from many different places. The night shift from 11pm to 7am was very challenging to me because I have always worked days and found it difficult to sleep during the day. I enjoyed the day shift because it was very busy and the day went by fast. I talked to a lot of quest when they came in to eat breakfast in the lobby.
good,They gave me a job when I needed one.  I was able to promote in 6 months of starting there.  The training is not consistent throughout and some managers do no value the need or purpose of a training guideline in place.
good,"The company itself is poorly run, nepotism is a running factor in the company and you have to know people to move up in the company. The managers are unresponsive to the complaints of their employees."
good,"Great place to work, manager is super nice and understanding. When I needed certain days off he approved them. The working environment was very relaxed, everyone got along and helped each other. Manager over my specific work area did not communicate directly with employees, however. Never knew there was a problem until main manager called me to his office"
good,well like i said before i rather working as a teacher coz i like to teach n to educate adults.Citizenship lessons n English ones likewise.But it was a fun job though.
good,Wyndham Destinations does their best to keep the work environment fun and pleasing on a daily basis.  They hold frequent events which usually involves a good amount of food.
good,really competitive workplace. The compesation plan does not allow for you to make much unless you have a lot of turnover. Did not like to work in the smokey workplace in the casinos
good,"Loved working here, felt like family which was nice. Pay was extremely low. Hard work but allows of advancement in the company which is important to most people."
good,"I liked working here at first, but managers could always mess up but if I would mess up once I was sent home. I didn't want to work in that type of work environment."
good,Is a very nice place to work the manager s are respectfully and nice I recommend anyone to apply to work here very friendly place Good environment and that it
good,it wasn't a bad place to work for but should be little more convenient for the stock rooms to be stocked so not trying to get it all done when getting there to work in the morning and its a lot of work to carry everything up the stairs but i learned different techniques for housekeeping and time efficient
good,"owners and new customers tended to be jaded on attending presentations as many feel forced into coming by the marketing team at check in. Product is fantastic and truly helps families spend quality time at beautiful resorts, and save money doing so."
good,"Front Line tours were not vetted properly, international tours had trouble trusting the brand and the product and as a result, years later they decided to cut out certain countries as part of the geographic and demographic vetting. International tour conversion rate was abysmally low and destroyed monthly quotas and sales objectives. Too many low income tours , too many not qualified tours, and constantly changing marketing companies .  Working weekends which are huge tour and business days , impacted personal life. "
good,"Felt a bit underappreciated. Pay is not great, working for a franchise owner made mt experience a bit less than stellar. No benefits to speak of. Otherwise easy job."
good,Loved the people i worked with but hated the calls. other then that the management is wonderful and they  make you feel at home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,Worked there during highschool. Was a good start to start learning the cooking field and gave me experience.  Very basic job and no movement could be done easily there.
good,typical work place people get along great very little drama management used be good but new owners took over and went don hills since new company is bad management all together
good,I worked with this company for a few years and enjoyed it very much.  I started at the front desk of the hotel and ended up at head office as a payroll administrator
good,"I enjoyed the people who owned this hotel privately, however the management was not always the most pleasent to be around.  I learned how to register guests and provide them with their rooms while checking in and I enjoyed the customers I met thru this job. The hardest part of this job was honestly this hotel was very much in need of being remodeled and renewed."
good,"I was a Sales Executive for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. "
good,"The work was hard at first, but got easy when time when on. I liked working here. I make new friends, meet some really nice people. The money was good and hours were okay. Some days you'll work for 8 hours and some other days you'll work for 3."
good,Everyday is different new faces all the time a lot was learned when I worked there. Always feel at home management was easy to talk to and very understanding
good,"The culture at wyndham was great, and the people made the job. I would have enjoyed the job more with better more competitive pay and a different schedule."
good,"Fast paced environment, requires attention to detail and positive attitude at all times. Clean and secure environment to work in. Personalized hospitality service provided by professionals."
good,"great company to work for. happiness just depends on the department you work for."
good,"poor management,poor skilled man power , lack of training and motivational for line staff it needs more attention to see detail and make improvement on management."
good,"another sales job, with specific but free approach to creating a market for customers off property of wyndhams vacation housing located all around Bransons tourist traps."
good,"Wasnt having any experience abroad before i landed in uk,it was a good start.mostly guest were buisness man and banquets so tried very hard and holefully suceeced as well."
good,doesn't provide benefits and pay can be a little low. the work load can be quite heavy. but management is awesome they really listen to their employees most of the time.
good,"It was what it was, it has been a while since I worked there. I liked the the management team and my co workers. I would go back ... it is good to go and work there to learn the vac pack sales."
good,"i give it a solid 8 the work was fun and continuous. i loved the hours and the people i worked with, the hours were good an the pay was great. i was a great worker"
good,I started with working in Marketing for Wyndham and then switched to sales. It was high-intensity sales. I had great communication with clients where I had to close the deal after 90 minutes talking to them.
good,"This is a good job for a student."
good,It was an okay place to work. The timeshare industry is changing a lot and lots of sales misrepresentation. People are choosing other ways to travel instead of using timeshare as its a lot of money and theres a lack of availability.
good,If I was attending school and still would not mind living with my parents this would be a perfect job. But I am looking to relocate and expand my horizons and opportunities.
good,Each location has very different management styles. Some of them have great moral while others struggle to keep employees positive. Many times coworkers become great connections for future employment.
good,"Company culture was great!  Competition was pretty stiff between coworkers, because sales targets were difficult to attain many times, because of the low amount of quality leads we received."
good,Love working for days inn as a manager. As also I am a people person & enjoy meeting new people. Hardest part of this position was maintaining the employees.
good,"Great management and great work experience. Got scammed into a third party hire and am on a 3 month contract with no benefits and make less than regular wyndham employees. also not guaranteed a job after christmas."
good,"Not the greatest people who work here very clickish and like to cause drama."
good,It was a nice place to work. The people were friendly. Was able to get linen at a timely fashion.A great place to work. Clean rooms and cat/ dog friendly.
good,"Nice people to work for, but a night demand rate. With no tools or equipment for the projects needing to be done. Nice people to work for, but a hight."
good,At the ramada I started off as a front desk agent and worked my way up to accounting assistant. This company was definitely a great place to grow and gain hotel experience.
good,This was my first hotel job and I really enjoyed it.  All management and employees were patience with me while learning.  It was a small property which allowed enough time and pace to grasp concepts and procedures..
good,"Wyndham doesn’t offer their employees a good break room. The TV they have there only show Wyndham stuff. Break ROOM Wyndham should offer Televisions to have the employee look at news, or have A small Gym to stay fit. The computers are horrible out dated, there always breaking down. Trying to get IT to fix them takes them a long time. Management wants to see numbers, with equipment that prevent you from doing your work."
good,"This was just a temporary job. i will never go back, because i am worthy of better. It was not fair that we had to stay and help someone else when we finished all our rooms."
good,The job was fast paced with flexible work hours. The job just didn't pay enough to financially support a family. I enjoyed my time with the company and would recommend the job to a young person just getting out into the work force. I learned crisis management in a fast paced world.
good,"I enjoyed the drive, the energy, the process, the training and the colleagues.  The challenges were significant and the pressure was pretty intense, but the possible rewards were extensive, and once somewhat got good at what they did, they did really well. Or it consumed them."
good,"very difficult job, have to do 16 rooms, didn't learn much."
good,they were always changing the time that you could clock in to start your shift and they would not let you get your house keeping cart until you striped the rooms that are marked checked and out rooms then you could get your housekeeping cart ready for your day
good,The hours were not good for my family. I had to work nights and this was hard. The hours would be great for a retired person or someone who doesn't have children.
good,Very competitive company. Administrative structure changes rapidly so job security in those areas can be tenuous. Major jobs were sales associates which i did not do.
good,i like the job it was fun i will do it one day i need a better job now i have thing i need to buyi need more money for what i need to do for and my wife
good,My staff was pretty amazing working there when I worked there though the general manager actually was stealing money from the company and blaming the employees
good,Co workers and benefits are what make this a great place to work. The job itself is easy and as long as you show up and do your job you have good job security
good,i learned how to proper serving and proper aproach the guest..im never fill tired in my last job becoz im enjoying my work.i never get hard in my job becoz all my co worker is have teamwork..
good,nothing to really say besides good work environment and management could be a little better. but its not enough hours (especially when it comes to the winter its barely any work)
good,Nice environment and supportive staff. Learned a lot due to union environment and work ethics. Workplace culture is supportive and enjoyable. Management is very cooperative and helpful.
good,"You have to work too hard for your money . I was working front desk , but had to help with maintenance and housekeeping. Over time and holiday pay were always wrong in payroll."
good,"property was being sold, so time here was on borrowed time. The owners did little to improve the property until the last day of sale. The new owners...even less."
good,"Once arriving check my  daily duties. Maintain the rooms, also clean the rooms. Vacuum and keep the floors clean. Handle laundry tasks and provide guest services."
good,"Daily Sales Meetings, greeting and hosting prospective clients, showing of the lovely Hotel Grounds and the Accommodations. Explanation of Vacationing with Time Share verses how clients currently vacation and the monetary savings and great prospective places to travel both in the USA and Abroad."
good,I got involved in building the hotel. It gave me the opportunity to seek the best finances by negotiating several financial institutes. Also got involved in with the Architecture and General contractor during the design and construction.
good,"It was an easy job, however the management was always looking out to work the least amount of hours for themselves and never returned the favor of covering their shifts. Expectations were unclear until you made a mistake and found out you messed up."
good,It was very stressful esp when you have a LARGE group coming in and they only have one person to work the desk. It was fun too because you meet a lot of interesting people working at a hotel.
good,Loved my job just needed to make more money than I was. Management was great and hotel was very clean. We took pride in our work there and it was sad to leave but I had to move forward.
good,"I never worked at the Wyndham Vacation Ownership. I wouldnt know a typical day working nor what thee work environment would be within that company. Therefore, i would not know"
good,"Solid place to work in specially if interest in potential relocation in your career. Management are flexible. Environment is quick paced, and company provides good health benefits."
good,"This is a good company to work for in terms of getting decent hours and flexibility. The manager's door is always open, or he's just a phone call away if staff need help."
good,I learned a lot about the hotel business. I worked during the 2002 Olympics and I met some interesting people. I really enjoyed working there and would like to work in the hotel again.
good,"Learning so many technologies here at Wyndham is a great asset.  From AWS to Data Center Migrations to Security, Network, and all infrastructure at your disposal, its easy to grow yourself."
good,"o	Followed specified procedures to audit the shift closing of all front office staff, including personally closing shift three and completing an audit summary for all shift"
good,No upward growth..pay minimum wage. Customers amazing. Not enough linen for customers.I would recommend as a starter job.I appreciate the experience. Thank you.
good,This job is a good job for people who enjoy meeting and talking to new people all day. There are chances you will have to do night shifts but they're not bad if you keep yourself busy. The manager is a great lady and will try to help and accommodate you as much as she is able to. This is a good job I recommend it to anyone who is a big people person.
good,This job is relax. If you like to work by yourself then this is the job for you. I work at night so it is not many guest that comes in at the time. Quiet most of time.
good,"Compensation for non-sales staff was very low and there was no room for advancement. Sales positions made all the money and got all awards. All support staff were poorly paid, but benefits were good."
good,this job allowed me to develop management skills as I was the only person that would work at the facility during my shift. I learned how to manage with customers without needing to go to upper management.
good,"The Daily operations and skill sets needed and utilized throughout the performance of employment"
good,Managers typically work from 7:30am to between 2:00pm to 6:00 pm depending on the day. Good training provided for sales reps. Strong workplace culture. Hardest part of the job is hitting high bonus hurdles.
good,i had no real issues working for the company ...I was treated fairly so i cant complain about the work place or the people working for the company. the supervisors were all fair
good,teamwork tiring ling days unprofessional to long of walk not enough supplies to complete job at hand body pains not long enough lunch not enough breaks
good,"depending on your specified job that day, you'd be dealing with people and cleaning as you go as well as any other job description required."
good,The job is ok for a starter to gain some maintenance experience. The managers are nice. The staff is fun to work with. The environment is positive. Overall good experience.
good,"Confirm guest information is accurate at check-in. "
good,Help guests with everything from booking a reservation to getting checked in and accommodations during their stay. when working 3rd shift you would set up the continental breakfast and do laundry.
good,"•	I was hired as a full time employee but it truly was not defined as a seasonal sales associate position. The vacation ownership  is an asset and you can put in trust for next generation since it is already paid. I express to my clients that the same money that they already use for vacationing in our 220 properties there is flexibility. "
good,"Checking people in and out, taking cash and cards. I had to learn how to work the system and making reservations for large groups. My manager was great and was very understanding if I needed time off. Hardest part of the job was dealing with spring break customers and most enjoyable thing was everyone I worked with."
good,this is a job that is all about numbers. most of the positions are entry level. this is a good job opportunity for college students or recent college grads.
good,"lack of career advancement, and not paid fairly for the amount of work that was put in. time management was poor and felt i could have achieved more out."
good,I enjoyed working and meeting new people. Management was understanding but young. The hardest part of the job was late hours and temporary associates.
good,worked as room service taken orders from floor to floor as well as working in the dining rood with other servers cleaning up after customers and making sure the trays was pulled from each floor
good,"grar peple good hours nice area great culture ok management front desk gm great It was hard to pleas guests with amenities being shut down for long periods of time Ireallt enjoyd the area and the return guests,as wekll as housekeeping staf anf the maintenance but not there in weekends when needed the most"
good,"Was short term job pay was very low.  Was not really employed long enough to do a real evaluation.  Staff seemed nice enough, immediate boss at time was great."
good,"Typical sales environment where the pressure is applied to get the deal no matter what.  Management was aware of the challenges and offered a great deal of sales training to arm representatives with the tools they needed to succeed.  High turnover, so if you make it a few months you're likely to make it long-term but there is very little opportunity for advancement. The sales sites suffer from some of the old school ""Boiler Room"" atmospheric issues."
good,learned a lot of do and don't the manager was always late never complain or get yelled at the food we put out was never fresh overall good place but bad work ethics
good,"Good company, good people.  Learn how to clean room, quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was walking into a room that has been trashed. You get 30 minutes to clean."
good,"I liked this job because we pretty much did our own cleaning, we were able to take our time, we got our breaks discounts and we where even able to eat breakfast"
good,It was nice to meet may new people that stayed at the hotel.  The employees nice to work with.  I learn many new things. I enjoyed remodeling the room.
good,"Got the job which paid very low but worked with my school schedule because it was overnight.  Interesting place.  Was trained for maybe 2 nights and was on my own from there.  Laid back overall, rarely saw customers overnight."
good,I like to meet new people being a veteran of the military. I love my coworkers. They are very fun to work with and most are team players which is a plus.
good,"I learned alot about people and me at this job. Learned I love to work with the public, negotiate for contracts, and learning how to make the best connections to make the most money!"
good,"•	Handling billing inquiries and service requests"
good,Good culture and very fair treatment of all employees. Lots of room for advancement and great work incentives. Revolving door of sales team and managers but if you can survive a year you are pretty good.
good,"Managed vacation ownership sales."
good,It was a decent company to work for. I am glad to have moved on but would recommend the job to a person attending school or looking to gain more experience.
good,"Launching a new brand was exciting, but the concept was difficult to sell versus the competition.  Unfortunately, with no sales - it was time to move on."
good,"I had to sort towels, sheets, and pillow cases. Wash dry and fold everything. make sure the shelves were full for the next day. The hardest part was when I had to take the laundry to the laundrymat "
good,"Die Arbeit an sich war sehr gut organisiert"
good,Clean hotel rooms after customers had checked out. 14-16 rooms daily. clean public areas and offices on a daily basis. interacting with different kins of people. best part of the job was getting to see and meet famous people.
good,have no clue what this place is I worked at super 8 as a housekeeper and enjoyed it except for the some issues with a co-worker. I had a disagreement with how a co-worker was fired
good,"A typical day included checking customers in and making reservations.  Taking care of your customers needs, coordinating tasks between various departments including House Keeping and Accounting."
good,"Overall work experience is good. Able to learn and grow within the company and learn different skill sets. Management within the company could afford to improve and equal opportunity could be enforced more. Can be a little hard to advance within the company with the obstacle of favoritism. However, working hard can increase better opportunities in the long run if consistent and apply yourself."
good,The wyndham hotel overall is great. I just was brought in to do a job and have been met with poor communication. I've witnessed bad judgment calls from management who arn't involved in day to day operations.
good,"This was an ""okay"" job, but it was too slow paced for my liking. The slow pace made the long hours seem even longer, and the location of the establishment was not exactly safe either."
good,The executives changed our pay and benefits and would not listen regarding a certain cut throat dishonest employee. It became a politically driven competitive environment.
good,checking guest in and out. making sure housekeeping has rooms cleaned and available. assisting guest with complaints travel information. learning the hotel business. hardest part of job is when guest have to wait on rooms. meeting new people from all oe is very exciting
good,small locally owned motel. I cant give a correct review due to this reason. I did not work for the Wyndham Vacation Ownership.........................
good,I liked working with people. Supervised 10 girls a lot of cleaning talking to guests.  A lot of laundry very busy position. Great team work management was ok
good,"I was a supervisor at the front desk of the hotel. I enjoyed it. I learned to understand guest issues. I also knew the guest was always right. I would make reservation, and check in and out people. Make sure everyone's stay was to there satisfaction. I hardest part of my job was taking care of guest complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with great employees."
good,"Working in hospitality is hard work. Guests come 1st, even when the property was sold out the night before check ins need to happen on time, its hard to turn rooms over at the speed required."
good,The hotel is a beautiful property and prime location. The front office team is great. The problem is that over all the company is more concerned with staying under budget then providing great customer service. Its always under staffed and rooms are dirty and in poor condition. If you are hired as a full time employee dont count on getting 40 hours even when busy company rather save money rather then schedule you.
good,This particular Ramada Inn was a franchised one.  The owner and manager were kind of shady.  It is out of business now.  It was never listed as Wyndham Vacation corporation.
good,I don't think there should be a time requirement to clean a room. So much stuff would get missed by housekeeping so they could make their time limit. Gross
good,changing places was new and there was good staff. no one wanted to see me leave to somewhere else . but it was better pay then were i was and there was lots of people
good,Love the company. Quick to catch on too and very good scheduled hours.  Very fast pace can be stressful at times but overall it’s an easy job with good pay
good,"I have never worked here before but I am doing this so that I can move from this page. I  do not know why they are making me do this... But anyways, yeah"
good,unread advice dont recall this job....... Sorry doont recall this nor know why Im being questioned about a job I has never had... Ive never worked for this company.... Never worked for this company
good,Es una empresa donde tienes la oportunidad de aprender cosas
good,"Nice place for learning / exposure , management is also great, the pay is okay though, the hours are flexible , job culture is good too, the benefits are not that great."
good,"The job title of facilities was also over laundry, housekeeping, general areas. It was reticulated. IT was not on site so you had to call in and then you would do the IT work over the phone. Ridiculous"
good,a typical day at work at Days Inn was we would go to the break room look at what we had to do for the day. There were four or five other guys working with me but sometimes they wouldnt show and i had to do it all on my own and i was getting stressed out especially the dishes when we had banquets we got slammed with dishes and weddings and holidays and far as the set up crew was they made me do all the work since i was low man on totum  pole but they were no higher up than me just a plain old worker like myself just didnt care if they came in or not .
good,None stop day of customers and their issues. Handling of money.  I am thankful for the experience. I truly enjoy the customers / guest that I have met.  It has helped me communicate more effectively.
good,"I learned a great deal at my time with Wyndham. I do not miss customer service though. That is a very difficult job. Great company to work for though, loved the conferences"
good,"Not a strong supportive culture, Professional growth is not a priority"
good,"the job was awesome it allowed me to be employed and provided an opportunity to get school work done, i wish i could back however i would probably go to a different location due to the new management that has undercome"
good,The staying in the Saviy hotel was very pleasant and enjoyable for us. We liked the location very much. The service people everywhere were very nice and polite. We liked the breakfast very much. The main problem we faced was the lack of air condition in the rooms. This has made our night sleep almost unbearable!
good,Different work schedule every week. Supervisors have preference for some employees. Some assigned work station was not equally busy as other locations.
good,Enjoy meeting all kinds of people from all over and have a love for traveling so it makes the day interesting.  It is not always easy though to show people what this product can do to enhance their lives.
good,"I worked at the Ramada for a very short period of time. The manager was very arrogant and didn't care much about his staff. The staff was easy to get along with but the guests that were drawn in were horrible. It seemed like the guest rooms were being trashed every time we turned around. They worked you like you wouldn't believe. Since I left, there has been new management."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. I prefer a more fast paced work enviroment, but for someone who wants a slow paced rewarding job this is perfect. You meet a lot of new and interesting people."
good,This place was very unorganized.  The leader and upper management was unprofessional.  Never looked into problems only took the  words of others. Lay off was regular.
good,A typical day is 80-100 calls per day with a  lot of different screens to go thru to achieve your job. Love that they gave to a lot of different charities.
good,"I enjoy working with the team. but management sucked, they never let me go to my full abilities, I feel like they fired me over stupid reasons, none that I approved"
good,My time there was very good and I learned a great deal as well as sacrificing a great deal.  Vacation ownership is not for everyone so make certain you are able to work EVERY WEEKEND and HOLIDAY.  6-7 days straight.  Vacations are no existent unless you exceed your goals.
good,Busy weekend job with no security to monitor the safety of guest in this high crime area.  Pleasant co-workers that are very supportive and helpful in learning the responsibilities of the job.
good,the owners were very nice and easy to get along with making the job a little better considering they lived in the hotel. its a small hotel so there was only 2 housekeepers. we met there at 9am to start stripping rooms and was normally done cleaning for the day by 2
good,usually just cleaned rooms everyday remake beds and knock on doors asking if they need anything usually folded laundry for that job and kept everything organized
good,I was hired as a sub contractor to facilitate building up the over all look of the motel Painting installing crown molding floor marble flooring installation
good,"This was a part time job that I had while going to college. I only worked three days with the understanding that this was a short term thing. Management was fine, most issues came from upset guests and being yelled at."
good,It was a good place to work. The hours sort of sucked but I worked quite a bit. When it wasn't busy I was able to do my school work which in return made me able to work more which was nice.
good,"i can work with school boards, hospital , offices , companys as janitor or maintenance worker."
good,I was with this company for more than three years and absolutely loved the football seasons and all the guest who would come in deck out in their football gear.
good,nothing bad to say about the company. i enjoyed everyday that i was there and the customers. it was an easy night job n spent the day babysitting still didnt have to lose the kids i watch
good,"typical work day"
good,poor ownership.  poor staff.  if the owner would have cared more about the staff they would have in turned cared better for their property.  instead they resented their jobs and it showed in their performances.
good,"good company to work for."
good,Having to carry large loads of folded laundry up stairs because there weren't any other way to stock the upstairs rooms otherwise. Other than that the job was fine.
good,A typical day at Days Inn Hotel was pretty relaxing. From this job I gained better presentation skills and to pay attention to detail. The co-workers and management at this job were helpful. They even took the time to check on you to see if you needed anything. What I enjoyed most at this job is that I was trusted to work unsupervised. What I enjoyed the least was the disorganization of supplies.
good,Go stock your cart and get to work.i learn so much how to use chemical how to do laundry how to inspect rooms as well.i love working and meeting all these different ppl.coming to stay there a long period of time .the only dislike I had was the pay it was not enough money for the work that's the reason I quit .
good,Too long ago don't rembember to much about what I did when I was there.  I was too young to really do anything else at the time.  sorry about that. maybe next time
good,"i like it, it was fun and challenge for me. it make me working hard to make sure guests feel comfortable and satisfied. good paying job with tips from guests"
good,It was a good place to learn and get the experience that I needed to grow. Would like to see more of the same management style in future jobs that I take on.
good,"Overall I would say this may be a good company for someone who is young and just starting out. I think there are opportunities to advance with this company, but I think they are slow to advance people."
good,"This is supposed to be Wingate University, but Indeed somehow spit out that I worked at Wyndham Vacation Ownership.  I'm sure that it's a good place to work."
good,Go to work  do the things I need to do.Well working for this job things was real slow nothing ever ready. I learned just to do mywork and go on with my day.
good,"Not sure I would say the best place, but definitely not the worst. You do stand for hours on end and will be hurting by the end of the day, but your co-workers will be awesome to work with as they assist you  along the way. Very easy to ask for help if you need it!"
good,"A motorway motel.It does what it says on the can .Guest dont expect to much,a clean room pleasant staff,and every bodys happy.managment will leave you be as long as you do a great job"
good,A typical night was a slow one where there really wasn't much going on. I learned how to space out my responsibilities in a timely manner that way I was always occupied. The management on the other hand always played the favoritism card and it was known by all workers.
good,"this place is terrible when it comes to management. the gm sold dirty rooms to a church crowd because she wanted to get the check that they were using, mind you the church guest bought more than 7 rooms on this trip. smh just terrible"
good,"Friendly staff, good working environment. Busy rountine always a job to be done. Looking after restaurant, bar and in house guests. Good management always helping to promote."
good,Its great working for a hotel business when the whole team is great as well. This place didnt really have a great system going on and it sucked working there with those kind of people. Only look out for their own back and not being straight foward about anything.
good,The benefits are wonderful the co workers are great. The guest we have are wonderful. The management changes so often and the schedules are not always the same.
good,"It was very laid back for the most part. My only issue was how far away it was from where I lived and having to use public transportation to get there. Other than that, I loved working there."
good,"Delivered ordered sandwiches by customers, made sandwiches. Cleaned. Restocked the sandwich items, chips, bottled water and cups. Management was ok. Workplace was busy. Hardest part of the job, keeping with the orders. Easiest part of the job, delivering the sandwiches."
good,"Work well with the others  to set up events at a matter of time.  Handle ordering, bars  for events as weddings parties.  Set up the bars and tear down after event, handle money and paperwork.  Also do scheduling for my crew"
good,"Reliable hours, always work to do. Nothing special unless you are the type of person that will enjoy that type of work. Management could have been better."
good,"Great place to work during for temporary, and part-time work. The job was fun and exciting fixing, and repairing everything on a daily basis. There was available work everyday to keep me busy which was a plus."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy solidario. Compańeros disponible para ayudarse mutuamente. Los jefes, personas muy respetables y muy educada"
good,Typically work from 9-5 but atleast one maintenance worker on call at all times. You can get off at 5 and whoever is on call could get a call at any time of night to come in to fix something.
good,"Great company and great benefits, just poor leadership. Supervisors are promoted based on time on the job and not necessarily experience. Felt like a glorified babysitter where I have experience and others have none but are paid the same amount."
good,very good entry level postions great pay but lack of good management would still recommend this company to anyone. you will have to stand outside and deal with all elements of the weather
good,uneventful and not very exciting.  pretty okay but not really though. good hours and very nice hotel and like it was okay but not terrible so it was pretty good
good,Hard to get along with new owners . One staff member is impossible to get along with .. too many night shifts and very little pay
good,"Working Here is All New to Me So Getting The Chance to learn everything was Nice. I love My Job and Most of My  Co-Workers. Sometimes it can be Frustrating , Especially on Busy days but Its Fun. I love Working Independently ."
good,I so loved working as the front of the house. I loved all my guest and knew everyone by name. This was a job I've always wanted to do cause your the first person to make them feel at home.
good,the hotel I worked at in Jupiter was a gorgeous hotel. staff was excellent but downside was that they don't pay nearly what other hotels would pay. staff turnover is extremely high. if they want to last as a company they need to pay better and train the right staff
good,"Typical work day consist of laundry , cleaning rooms, and restocking supplies. Learned to work in a fast pace environment, customer service skills. Management was very cooperative . co - workers were all very nice and helpful , everybody worked as a team . Typical work day was different everyday depending on the employees and the customers. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday  and leaning the skills of working as a housekeeper."
good,This job was a great experience for me because I learned alot about data entry and balancing money out.  I also enjoyed getting to work with different customers.
good,"No growth here. Company is behind the field in employee salary."
good,"fun place to work, lots of fast pace energetic people that keep positive minds. pay rate was very low at the time i was employed and hours varied from week to week so no way this is a good primary job for anyone with major bills"
good,Nice environment and I really enjoyed working there they have a clean establishment positive work environment I would recommend anyone to work there they are very respectful
good,Was not happy with the managment or how they ran things there. They did not listen to their employess about thing. Theu were easy to write people up for things that i dont think should have been write ups compaored to them not wrkting people up for what needed to be.
good,"It can be very stressful but rewarding after finishing a shift, a typical shift involves setting up the event, helping the chefs move food around and then finally serving it to the customers."
good,The housekeeping department at Days Inn was friendly and energetic. We often had 14 rooms in the summer season with only minimum time before check-ins.
good,Adequate place to work-  great benefits- Great environment within department.   Local company was great  Corporate environment lacked warmth and sincerity.
good,"the first eight years were great."
good,Days inn was an experience i enjoyed being able to go in an clean rooms an make sure that the next guest had a very clean room so that they were comfortable an would be willing to come back
good,"While working here I have learned a lot of people skills and computer skills as well. Diverse work environment, the hardest part of my job has to be working in such fast pace environment, you must effectively and efficiently monitor your time."
good,Sales position with work flexibility and opportunity to earn as much income as you desire.  I have learned a tremendous amount of information about the vacation ownership industry.
good,"Fun Fast past , Working with new people is exciting. Many people have the ability to work in groups. But choose to be alone =. I love working with people learning from them and growing. I like to learn."
good,"Great meeting new guests and people from around the world/travelers.."
good,This job was okay. It's just a lot of sudden changes and a lot of un -communicable people. Which is lack of speed or good profession.
good,I provided housekeeping services to the Wyndham Hotel. Daily duties included following all procedures for the best service we provided. Also maintained lists of all vacant rooms and needs for each room.
good,High pressure to get to your goals.  Sales training very informative.  I learned a lot.  Management could have been better.
good,"Very good and comfortable, I was helped and trained."
good,"I loved interacting with guest helping them get around the Island, we had a great team. I learned there registration system, and how to listen to guest if they was dissatisfied and help them resolve the problem."
good,The work was easy and the owners were nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with demanding guests.
good,The company philosophy is to present as many prospects as possible to the sales floor even though many of the prospects are unqualified.  The result is a very low sales rate and huge turnover of sales representatives.
good,The people are good but the company policy and the way they work are bad. There are a lot of things they need to change but the didn't
good,"This is for the above mentioned resort, this is NOT a reflection of the company as a whole.  This resort is not very well managed. They go through employees and managers very quickly."
good,"The job was okay, but the management for front desk was unprofessional and retalitory to staff. She also delegated to much of her job duties and overwhelmed staff. I have done this same position with other companies and was suprised how much of the management work was actually being done by the desk staff."
good,Hard work.  Good co-workers.  Great customers.  Ample acknowledgement.  Decent pay.  Limited - almost never any overtime.  Great parties.  Plenty of experience.
good,"Typical work environement,good coworkers, the enjoyment of your job is based on what you make of it.You learn as you go it all up to you.You meet people from all countries and it makes it exciting"
good,nice  family work place they made us lunch everyday an on Fridays we had the best lunch ever i enjoyed working their it was on the best work places i have been at an i met a lot of different peole
good,"Learned a lot of management skills"
good,"I work anywhere from 8 hours a day to 10 hours a day.  I learn how to check people in and out, run audit, and set up the breakfast for the guests.  I enjoy working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is that the weekly schedule is hardly ever the same from week to week.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to help out the guests when they need something or they something."
good,"My hospitality co-workers are awesome! They're friendly, helpful, and a joy to be around. We support and help each other to manage the busiest of days."
good,"The atmosphere is good within the company as a whole, however IT is a different story.  Lack of work life balance, ever changing atmosphere where it makes it difficult to understand direction, focus, and advance ones career."
good,"This is a decent job, I've enjoyed working here. The only issue it that my work hours depend on how busy we are, and when business slows down so does work and pay."
good,"on the phone all day, how to vacation planning,management was great coworker was great, being on the phone all day"
good,Was a great place to work before the company had to cut back - would have stayed and continued with a job I loved. Commute not very good but they let us have a flex work hours
good,I learned that there are many opportunities  advance in the work place. Starting with checking in guest to running the office by myself to taking orders from venders.
good,Lot of Work but great income for Top 2% in the Industry and they love producers but not very loyal like Marriott. They do reward for the Top 2% but not for the average Sals Rep. Must be a closer and not rely on others to do your job. I learned how to motivate and leads others and put together a Teir 1 Sales Team and make a great living. The Neg. is Timeshare has a negative Image.  Go into Solar and Do something great for everyone and make a great living based on your talents.
good,"The job was cool, and the work was really simple. I learned how to make space when things are tight. I loved my co-workers they where friendly to me."
good,"Not too bad if you are working right department."
good,Complex work with lots of technicalities that require full dedication to be successful. If you are not prepared to support your self for a while you are not going to make money for a long time.
good,it is a fun place to be with amazing people and staff. its a very clean and quiet place. the staff is very friendly and polite. you couldn't ask for a better place or better people.
good,"Great hotel to work for; many travel and vacations benefits; flexible work environment.  Fun environment at times, but very demanding."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,It was the only game in a resort area after the financial crash. Wyndham is a highly successful company. It was still selling timeshares when no one could afford their homes.
good,"My days starts  out by communicating with the night shift about  any issues or concerns that occurred & need to be addressed.  Count the money boxes to make sure that they are right. WE serve breakfast from 6am -10am  & check out is at 11:00.  between those hours I am attending the breakfast bar, checking out guests, answering the phones, & helping guests.  I break down breakfast, & clean the breakfast area. I fix things that need to be fixed & maintain the parking lot.   I also pay bills & take care of our direct bill accounts.  I work on the front desk employee schedule.  Take care of  anything that needs to be done.  I have learned that management is very difficult, but with patience, an positive attitude & determination & focusing on being a team player, your team will succeed. The  hardest part of the job is not being appreciated .  The best part of the job is dealing with the guests.  We have slot of repeat guests, so you develop friendships."
good,"Unprofessional, things were done backwards, there was never a proper method, owner believed in his employees over the guests, I witnessed my coworkers using masters key while consuming alcohol with another guest"
good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership has a lot of benefits and is very employee driven, which is great if you are in an area other than management."
good,They use company answers to cover most situations and in the reservations dept. they don't bend to extending circumstances that come up in life. It use to be a great place to work for but not anymore. If you get hired your co workers can be great. The management...not so much.
good,place is not well managed. benefit is bad. the staff are great to work with. Pay sucks. no support on second shift. staff work short most of the time.
good,"I am the best in the business, guest love coming back. I received thousands of comments online from guest. and the guest feels compelled to give the hotel high rating because they know i would wanted that  as well. i have taken  a hotel with no a/c in the summer time , no free parking, just a clean room. to a #1 ranking in the company that have ever been #1 until I join the team, with the natural way of giving customers service that come from within and guest notice its the real thing. {and the real thing is still the best thing yet}."
good,"Intense sales atmosphere, selling timeshare to existing owners.  High turnover in sales as well as management.  Did not seem to value owners or employees."
good,"kept me busy all summer long. had to leave for a family related emergency but would love to go back soon!"
good,Great place to work. I loved the concierge part of my job and marketing guests who bu timeshare to enjoy future vacations with family was rewarding to me. I loved my guests' and they loved me.
good,Always handling back to back operation & good for my experience. every day another good day for me & most my time  time I expend in floors checking rooms.
good,most days it would be messy and most days it would be clan and neat. The co-workers were great they helped around a lot and made it fun to be around them. The hardest part was keeping everything in order. The easiest part was making people happy because they had a good positive attitude along with myself.
good,"Nice place to work. Good leadership. Open door policy."
good,"short hours and a fun company"
good,A typical work day included ensuring that content was showing correctly in the GDS and websites. The management team allowed us to be ourselves and introduce new ideas. I enjoyed work here.
good,"clean the pool and do tests for the chlorine"
good,A typical day involved solving customer problems and any room situations. Great co-workers and well maintained for the most part.
good,"A typical day was good, the staff was very polite the different things I have learned was a lot. The management was very far and listened to all concerns."
good,"A typical day is checking customers in, making orders, and checking inventory. Co-workers didn't take job to serious. Learned the steps on how to be a manager. Enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday from everywhere. Hardest part was learning management skills , from scheduling to ordering items we needed and inventory. Management needed a little work."
good,A typical day was usually15 or 16 rooms to clean. I learned to organize my time & finish in a timely manner. The managers were very accommodating & my co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was when I had a very messy room to clean The best part was when I was finished with a room & looked back to see the improvement.
good,Did not have a specific title to my position. just was watever my supervisor needed me to be at any given time. i did it all.
good,"Marketing products."
good,A typical day at work is busy some days busier than others. On top of trying to keep a team motivated when the district manager don't care about anything except making money is aggravating.
good,The management was great. I became friends with all my coworkers and I enjoyed the environment! Very nice people and very nice vacation location!
good,"Great work life balance, great pace of work. The are in the business of vacations so it is a fun environment. The are open to ideas and will to try new programs. They have a very accepting environment."
good,"Ramada is also a group in wyndham. "
good,"At this job I was taught how to give great  customer service when dealing with the public. How to multitask with ease, how to do audits and a lot of office skills."
good,For me the typical day of work in this company is good. I learned to much more in this company like being respectfull and to stand on your on feet. my co workers in this company is not good even a small mistake youve done the are shouting to you.
good,It was interesting. I learned alot. The managers were nice but not extremely helpful but I did learn that sales it not for me. There could be really amazing days where you are selling everything and those days are great but there can be extremely horrible days where you cant sell anything. I something that is more consistent
good,Ok place to work undergoing changes within organization. As a contractor expect a large workload compared to full time employees.
good,I really liked this hotel the only reason I left was because of pregnancy and I took time off to raise the baby
good,Engineering staff does not believe that everything is their job like I do.
good,"•	Clean guest rooms, paying attention to detail."
good,"I enjoyed working for Ramada, but they are very lax on franchising out. The Hotel I worked at was falling apart, but yet we passed inspections every year."
good,"Since management change work atmosphere wend negative, no feeling of team work. No trust in management as salary payment not always correct and I have to go and spend my time to prove i am underpaid. Daily issues if you report to line manager in end you need sort out  yourself."
good,Enjoyed being manager wish the hotel wasn't sold and new management restructure and let most of the employees go.
good,I enjoyed working with the company. There are some great people on the team. The negative about the company is the appreciation for the hard work and the pay. There are not any pay raises within the first 2 years. A co-worker has been there 7 years and has only recieved a 75 cent raise.
good,"Family managed. Limited growth. Best part solving computer issues. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reservations, walk-ins and answering phones and transferring calls."
good,The hardest part of Night Audit is being a woman and not feeling safe at all times.
good,"This was my summer job i done when I was in high school, I was hired as an housekeeper. It was a lot of work but was interesting for me. I enjoyed working here because it was easy flow and was flexible   with the short time frame I had for summer employment. Great place to work and learn!"
good,"When i was employd by Fairfield Resorts Inc. (Owner Services) Even though for short time, I learned a great deal about myself. Like being able to work under pressure.From working at Westgate taking Inbound calls.Fairfield was Outbound; A bit more challenging. The most Enjoyable part of my day was in ending the calls of clients, i knew i had saved them a great deal of money & helped to plan there Dream vacation!"
good,"Good company to work for, great experience and co-workers. I like meeting people and I was able to do that here since they were new and return guest to service on daily basis."
good,"While I was only there a short period as I was only living in Virginia for family matters, working here was an adventure.  I thoroughly enjoyed my coworkers as well as management."
good,I loved talking with people from all over but it wasn't always busy being places so far off the highway. I learned how to book rooms online. I didn't get to work with anyone which was boring but also help me with solving problems on my own and not having to always turn to others.
good,I enjoyed most of my co-workers and management but the work was not really what I expected. The job itself was a lot of work and some things I didn't approve of having to do considering the pay. This job was definitely a had to have job and temporary. I did enjoy the job when I stared but as time went by I started to dislike it but kept it because I had to have some income until something better came along. This job may be good for some but not me. I did learn how to make a bed with all corners tucked properly and I learned to clean mirrors without streaks.
good,Housekeeping ran the job place. Most employees came into work late or looking unkempt without any action being taken.
good,This is a full-service property. The hardest part is dealing with the public when a call center messed up their reservation. Good for a part-time job.
good,"Ilearned how to use my office skills in a fast-pace environment, learned how to be professional and cater to the boss."
good,"This location is very new and is in a ""building stage"" I do not have the resources to wait for the big money to start rolling in."
good,I enjoyed my job as a front desk clerk. It was a demanding job in that I had to perform many tasks at once. I learned to better manage time and multitask. I learned to better handle customer issues and needs. Most of the people that I worked with were great. I had the best managers I could ask for.
good,The management needs to focus more on their  quest the on their phones and cute little employees.
good,meeting different people throw out the day.smiling and greeting
good,"now that Fairfield part of Wyndham it must be better since it's a large organization.  "
good,"I learned how to deal with the strangers."
good,"Working for Wyndham was a great experience. Great staff and great management, Enjoyed working there."
good,"I learned to never judge anyone out of sight. Management was very friendly and responsible. Hardest part of my job was working without security overnight. My fun time were game night and the guest, some guest would sit at night in the lobby and have a conversation about their life and family, very interesting."
good,"Good work environment to work in, just wish it was a year round position,"
good,very tedious duties.....staff difficult to get along with
good,Whatever position you were hired for. That was were you stopped at. There was no room for moving up.
good,"I personally don't enjoy this job due to the lack of ability to move up. The building it self needs allot of work. I personally like to take pride in my place of employment, and like to represent the company the best of my abilities. Saying that I feel as though I should be representing a company that looks presentable, has hard workers that not only just care about the money their making but the building and its guest. The hardest part of this job would have to be dealing with the constant complaints about the conditions of the building and having to explain to the guest that we are undergoing renovations that seem to have been promised for years. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people I work with. Even though their work ethnic isn't always the best they are kinda people."
good,Shift changes almost always happen late. I learned about the hotel industry and hospitality. My manager was one of the best Managers I'd ever had. She is a very hard worker and underpaid as well. No comment as far as co-workers go. Hardest part of the job was when things weren't passed on and guests would get angry with the wrong person. The most enjoyable part was the people/guests-interacting with them.
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting an unpredictable number of tours. I had to make sure the surveys were completed correctly and that the guest qualified before being assigned a sales representative. After each tour, I had to input information into the computer and by the end of the day, complete all necessary reports. I enjoyed my supervisors and my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the unknown number of tours that would show up. Sometimes we would only get about 5 tours and then other times it could be as high as 12-15 tours. In addition, they wanted us to go through the surveys quickly and this sometimes unqualified guests were sent up, because one thing on the survey was missed. It often times became very chaotic and I don't like that kind of environment."
good,"Arrived to work 5am everyday, assess daily issues throughout hotel.. Delegate work related issues to my staff..Learned how to manage 2 departments & a lot about the hotel industry, My co'workers were very friendly felt like a team..Hardest part of the job was getting the hotel ready to pass inspections..The most enjoyable part of the job was fixing things that guest had issues with & getting the good responses & praise for my work.."
good,"It was always nice seeing people I met in the pass come back for another stay, and getting to me a lot of different people from all over the place.."
good,"It was fun working for Wyndham Vacations resort,  The ob was located in a call center, and I had my own cubicle but was not isolated from co-workers. Help was just a few steps away with at least 3 supervisors on hand at a given time."
good,I enjoy working here. Staff is great. Management is understanding and helps you out if you are having any issues. Hours are flexible. Great place to work even for just part time.
good,Work at your own pace.  no one is looking over your shoulder so its pretty independent
good,"Made follow-up call to customers whom had their car serviced. Also, answered phones. Worked under direction of manager."
good,Good company to work for. Met some awesome managers who taught me a lot. Some managers were not easy to work with.
good,"Although business is slow, I enjoy the hospitality aspect of the job. I am a great people person & work well with others. I have learned a lot about the way hotel businesses run. I love my co workers. They are so helpful & understanding. The hardest part of the job is dealing with complaints from the guests. I really enjoy being able to communicate with the guests & Notre Dame football season is a madhouse here. Its so enjoyable watching all the die hard Notre Dame fans celebrating all weekend!"
good,good place to work but very demanding escpecially in winter
good,"My typical day at work would be of course cleaning, my coworkers are cool with no drama and very business minded. The hardest part of my job is cleaning on a crazy day(example when a lot of sick patients are arriving back to back),and the most enjoyable part of my job is when I accomplished cleaning my rooms on time."
good,This hotel by far had to be my toughs job. I worked at a trunk stop hotel. The environment out their was some time rough. I had to learn how not to get in my feeling about a lot of things. The management kept change every year so i have to get use to a new group of owners and how there run things.
good,"	Responsible for training, configuring and implementing Opera PMS."
good,I enjoyed working and meeting all kinds of people.The hotel needed to be updated.it needs new beds and tvs
good,I only worked here because I was not truly told the details it involved.
good,"Taught a great deal of patience and understanding due to the high volume of overly irate guest base."
good,I have learned to deal with different types of personalities.
good,I managed the Operations of the program and developed the technology infrastructure for properties to administer the hotel groups loyalty program.
good,"receiving my work orders;laying everything out in order and performing repairs.i came to the job highly experienced for the position i maintained.i got along greatly with management,coworkers,customers and had no problems,it was a happy atmosphere.the hardest part of the job is when i,m doing work orders and deliveries come in and have to do customer service all at the same time.the most enjoyable part of the job is my interaction with everybody;because i keep an upbeat attitude and keep a smile on everybodys faces"
good,"fun place to work.  able to work in a very relaxed atmosphere, fun meeting people from all over the united states and sometimes other countries."
good,"customer service and satisfaction, friendly atmosphere, heavy phones, sales"
good,worked independently on my own cleaning rooms or maybe just making beds and taking out the trash or replacing the linen in guest rooms. trustworthy person never messed with anything that didnt belong to me.
good,"Under staffed causing a stressful work days."
good,Checking and greeting guests and making their very first impression of staying at the Baymont a positive one. I have learned that making sure guests are comfortable and that their needs are met can be easily managed when you have the proper tools and attitude to do so. Management is reasonable and co-workers are easy to get along with. Most enjoyable part is being able to have a guest return and your efforts be apart of the reason that they come back.
good,"The property managers were very easy to get along with, never had any problems. The work/life balance was fantastic, they were very understanding."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. I learned a lot about running a restaurant and bar.
good,It was a ok place to work it being my first job. the managers were amazing and the coworkers were awesome.
good,"The property itself is amazing, now all that needs a good push towards improvement is the management and staff. They have the ability to retain customers and stop having the customers not return."
good,"Good environment and good people to work for. It is however too much of a huge property to manage with all outlets so far apart, little help and long standing hours without breaks."
good,The co-worker were nice and dependable at times but as most jobs you have to put up with people calling at the last minute but other then that it was a good place to work
good,I've worked front desk for about a year i worked all the way up until i went into labor with my son ( i went into labor at work)...I went back to work there 3 weeks later (after having a c-section) wasn't suppose to go back until I was 6 weeks. One of the owners is very nice but the other is never happy but I try my better to make them both happy. I like that my job is at night here because I get more time with my son but I would rather work somewhere else now that I have another mouth to feed.
good,Wyndham is focused on meeting its goals and provided a good work/life balance.
good,its a really nice place to work at. has great employe benifits
good,"I absolutely enjoyed working with the public and this gave me the perfect opportunity to shine with my personality."
good,Clean rooms and wash linens. Provide guest with excellent service during their stay. Easy job for those starting out or with limited education/experience in the workforce.
good,"idk what to say about the company, they were always helpful and pleasant."
good,This is a fun workplace in which I am able to interact with many different types of people on a daily basis. I have learned a lot while working here such as great customer service and great organization skills. The managers and my co-workers are good people and provide a nice work environment.
good,Fun people to work with and flexible hours.  Wyndham worked with my school schedule allowing me to work on weekends so I could focus more on school.  The most difficult part of the job was learning all the paperwork when running audit every night but all that was needed was a little experience.  The best part of working for Wyndham was the meeting all the nice people staying at the hotel.
good,"Wyndham is a great company to work for, however many of their properties are franchised, and as with any franchise, private ownership may not be up to overall standards of excellence."
good,basic dutys involving upkeep of property and facilitys. upkeep of onsite pool.
good,"I really can't say anything good about 7 Eleven. The supervisor wasn't there most of the time, the customers were rude, and I did not get along with any of my co-workers at all."
good,"great for students. not much as far as advancement. average about 20 hrs a week, if that."
good,"If you can manage to work on your own without a lot of Supervision, this is the job you can sink your teeth into. The hardest part of this job is making sure all of the reports you are required to do are filled out correctly. A very enjoyable occupation for the person that likes to work on their own."
good,"Fun environment with strong benefits"
good,"i had fun working with my co workers and I learn alot too."
good,My front desk manager was awesome so that made it a lot of fun! Plenty to do there to keep me busy but still have fun at the same time! I love talking to people and just doing whatever I can for them so that made it enjoyable to be in an atmosphere where I could do that. 
good,"Work varies daily because of banquet themes, but always preparing for daily breakfast or lunch buffets and weekend Seafood Buffet nights."
good,This job was a good job I guess cause it was my first job. Anyways I liked the job its just that the hotel thing was not the thing for me 
good,It was a job. Definitely don't get paid enough for all the work you do. 
good,"Checked in/out guests, customer service skills excelled with this position, as well as computer skills. The coworkers were great as well as the management. The hardest part of this position is that you may not leave to go get lunch/dinner. The most enjoyable part of this position is You are able to meet many different types of people."
good,"My job here always felt hostile. It feels like you are constantly being yelled at, even when you are doing exactly what you are supposed to be doing."
good,did the audit check in guess and check out guess the hardest part of the job is when the guess is upset about bus being in there room
good,i really enjoyed working here it was really great and fun thank you
good,This job was lonely since it was early morning and you were alone
good,"Management depends on where you work, I had some amazing managers and other that were jelous and had no idea how to do there job. I truly enjoyed getting to see the same guest year after year they become more like family."
good,"This is a great work environment and we are treated like family, borrowing money or even a company car is not a problem and I am treated with respect at all times by people of higher authority. The problem is advancement...Your responsibilitys go up but the pay stays the same (minimum wage)"
good,"I enjoyed learning a different way to approch how to do the audit..I like being able to work alone and at my own pace, and management appreciated a job well done"
good,"I enjoyed the time I had working for the company. The working relationship I had with my supervisor and my second manager was the best. It is unfortunate, however, that the ones in leadership who are truly great leaders like my former supervisor, are burned out and in some cases let go by the company while those above them are fake, poor leaders, and two-face."
good,"i knew what was expected of me as a employee, and the work was not overwhelming. great incentive oppurtunities for jobs well done. not alot of room for advancement"
good,i would show up at 7pm and get the stuff ready to set up.i learned its not easy to cater or do maintnence for a hotel cause alot of people shows up.management really wasnt that good cause of the way things was being runned.didnt have many co workers it was only 2 people working one shift.the co worker i had would go off somewheres else and had me to do it all.hardest part of the job setting up for assemblies and parties.most enjoyable part is i got to work.
good,The customer service is without a doubt the best feature of this brand.
good,"Lots of Family worked around me, it was really nice. Met lots of people from around the world. It was really cool."
good,2nd shift checking in and out guest answering the phones and making rsvp and making the guest comfortable as well..
good,Get your list of rooms you need to clean. Stock your cart with supplies for your rooms. Check your rooms. Learn to move fast. Say hi to management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to get all the rooms on your paper finished before the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the meetings.
good,very small place no advcement means no future for me.
good,i learned to work at a fast pace
good,great starter work! loved cleaning and all that it entailed.
good,company is nice over all lots of gobs aroud the us but managment needs work to become better.
good,I loved working there and the staff was amazing... I miss working there... but not a place to work if you going to raise a family
good,Thia was a good place to work I got to see all types of people from locally to different countries
good,learned to clean the rooms for the guests to stay in. helped the guests if they needed anything
good,This is a tough business and the location I was at folded within a few months.
good,The job was great. I worked alone at the front desk and interacted with multiple customers. I was the face of the company and allowed customers to feel appreciated.
good,"huge earning potential, tours are generated daily for you, aggressive sales environment"
good,"A day varies from day to day. One day is can be very very stressful and you must work very hard to overcome the task that are assigned. Other days it can be very slow and boring. All of my co-workers can be professional, yet can be there for you when you are having a bad day. We can all count on each other and can depend that a task will get done if they agree to do it."
good,Got into the overall building of a company in Vienna and then was hired on full time
good,I only enjoyed the customers. Meeting the state troopers was a plus as well. Everyone was really nice.
good,This was great company. The owner sold the company so I was let go.
good,"Checked customers in and out of hotel,made phone reservations over the phone and in person."
good,Co-workers made it fun and exciting to work there. Learned how to clean and maintain a indoor pool.
good,"Worked at Ramada Hotel Dubai. Learnt skills of managing people, team management skills. Lovely place to work"
good,I really enjoyed working with the different members of the staff and getting to know the guests as they checked into the hotel.
good,"I worked alone and did all the Motels Reservations, cleaning, filing, faxing and Phone Calls."
good,liked working in hotel got to meet alot of new people clean rooms and inspect them. like working in laundry and rooms.im a pleople person.
good,Running daily and weekly tracking and arrival reports. Checking daily punches and monitoring hours for payroll. Solving all problem that my arise between marketing/tour reception and sales. Holding meetings with all departments to review new procedures and information needed to insure the best customer service possible.
good,"Fun place to be and work at,Cleaned rooms,Took care of the pool,made sure guest was happy,"
good,"high stress, great benefits, huge income potential...depends on the office you work in, great support from the inside, great product!!"
good,"Depending on the property it was a great company to work for. I was relocated from the Indiana to the south for about a year and had the time of my life. Met a lot of great people, tons of new experiences and learned the Wyndham brand."
good,Working with Wyndham Destinations was hard work being housekeeping. The most enjoyable part about the job was friendly people and team work. Housekeeping can be fun and enjoyable with awesome co-workers.
good,"Wyndham Destinations makes it very evident that the guests come first and it does not matter how happy the staff is. We had a very low staff moral, a high turn over rate, and we corporate came to assess what was going on nothing was changing. The benefits are great and maybe it was just issues at our location in PCB."
good,"The best part about working for Wyndham is that they have the best paid time off benefits. Most companies you have wait 90 days for PTO, but with Wyndham you get PTO your 1st month. Also room to grow and cross train in different departments."
good,I am not sure how to describe the working conditions. My old boss was very controlling and not willing to accept suggestions to make things better. I stayed there for about 1 year and then decided that the work was not what I was looking for and went back to the Casino full tiome.
good,A typical day started with a sales meeting as well as occasional training. My co-workers were supportive and I enjoyed working with them. Management seemed to be unbalanced and employee complaints went unaddressed. Sales Center property was not maintained well.
good,"Good group of people to work with and was excited about that opportunity, but very few people actually see the financial success you are promised. Lots of turnover in all departments but especially on the sales floor."
good,Okay but keep looking. Difficult market with leads and high quotas to meet. Would be good to have additional opportunities within company but applications sent internally not responded to for action.
good,Just got a better paying job offer which is why i resigned there at the hotel but other then that i loved working there and for the management. Great place to work
good,A typical day at work was busy.I learned how to keep customers happy with their stay at the hotel.I also learned how to work at a fast pace and keep attention to details.And I make a great bad now.Management was helpful and easy to talk to.Everybody got along and worked well together.The hardest part of the job was trying to get all your rooms done by a certain time.I also learned how to do all the laundry.The best part of the job was the people and the tips.
good,"Great place to work at if you are going to college and want to be part time and get paid more than minimum wage. They are super flexible but are low staffed often times. Days are always different, some days are very easy and others are difficult, you learn to be fast paced and fold laundry, management is very flexible at times but not fast at fixing problems."
good,"Good place to start career in hospitality maintenance management, strict requirements with constraining budgets.  Overall great atmosphere, yet not everyone understands your role and importance, especially the management."
good,I enjoyed this line of work. However the owners should do a better job when employing their staff. They will hire anyone.  This has caused numerous problems in the workplace for myself as well as other people.
good,"Cleaning every dirty hotel room and bathroom. Each room had a different surprise in it, you can tell what a person is like by what they leave behind. The management is fair in how the assigned rooms that needed to cleaned were divided up. the hardest part is getting done before the new arrivals checked in. There really isn't an enjoyable part about the day other then leaving with all the rooms cleaned."
good,to stressful and not a lot of advancement oppurtunities due to the fact that they don't always promote from within. there are to many managers and supervisors who don't see eye to eye on daily operations
good,Don’t work here. The management never listened to when it came to pay raises and as the pay was way too low. We made below minimum wage of the neighboring cities which is where most of the employees lived.
good,"This was an awesome place to work at. Everyone is very helpful and works as a team except the GM. The Assistant manager is an awesome boss and is very straight froward with, well as much as allowed. But the GM is, how shall I say, a total snooty, better than thou jerk. There are no benefits and you really need to be able to speak spanish."
good,Wyndham's hotel are very nice places to stay all over the world. Some place have breakfast prepared for you and some places will accommodate you with a place to prepare your own!!?
good,"Answered phones and made reservations for guest at Floridida condos.  Gave guest info about what each condo offered as far as room size, bedding, amenities.  Would help guest with wihich area they would like to be at.  Also did customer service for guests that were already in house.  Helped owners of the condos get a reservation in their condo whether it be then or a guest of theirs."
good,Face paced work environment with on the job training have to have great attention to detail management is very helpful if you have issues but they dont give very many chances to mess up and will fire you without a reason
good,Very helpful and reliable to work with. Answers all questions appropriate and helps resolve issues in a timely manner. Always available around the clock.
good,"Some fun times, some great times. Personally, I find certain ethical and financial weaknesses in the time-share industry that force me to aver from engaging in it again."
good,It is a Interesting place to work Doing events are the most exciting . dealing with guest is a learning experience. the management is  on hands working with you.we did get discounts on our meals and free drinks. if hospitality is a field you have a interest in than  wyndham is a great learning place.
good,Things got crazy 1st we lose our Collection Director and I had like four managers my whole time there. Then made great bonuses every month then felt like they kept putting me in a team where no bonuses were being made as before. Started feeling no stability.
good,"The hardest thing was to not be robotic on the phone.  We had points we had to meet, but it was hard to not go robotic when you say the same thing 80 to 100 times a day."
good,"Average workplace, very digitally regulated.  Offered an excellent training program, and a lot of additional help after training. Technology at the cubical was terrible.  Horrible headsets, a little under-organized."
good,the people are awesome and fun to work with but all the managers do not know how the work field is and they do not care about there employees if I had better managers I would have never left
good,"The off site location for marketing was great. The  Information Center at Seaport Village, was successful for marketing In-House on-site gallery tours and promising production,and sales.  I succeeded  in meeting marketing quotas, but efforts were not recognized nor production proficiently managed or distributed. There were several managers of this first offsite location,and marketing executive team,."
good,"Environment here can be pretty cut-throat. "
good,"interesting workplace, fun people, and collaborative environment for entry-level partitioners. sometimes people are too busy to talk to each other, especially to the interns."
good,Workplace was great. Few ups and downs with management but its the same for every workplace. Great team work where everyone worked to improve the stay for every guest that stayed with the company.
good,checking in and out guests balancing daily receipts setting up and taking down breakfast . Talking to guests and taking care of there needs are the best part of job. Leaving a job after being there so many years was a hard thing to do.
good,"Cleaning rooms, experience in kids I also work in a day camp, I even have a 4 year old son that just started school this year . Im looking for a job because my son is in school now and I would like to make a little bit of money to support him in school and in every school event . Right now im at stay at home mom , but Im willing to work because I have more time on my hands."
good,"The job of sales and/or marketing is fun and exciting. The interaction with prospects and the community is rewarding. Compensation when sales occur is lucrative. The culture of the work environment is extremely competitive. If you're unable to handle the stress then this job is not for you. If you can handle the stress, work ethically, and maintain your numbers, then this job is a rewarding experience."
good,its a good place to work great people but not that much place to grow as is own by family. had to do the overnight shift so had to work a rough shift .
good,"Closed smaller locations to  concentrate on larger markets, good company, opportunity for advancement, nice benefits and work environment, okay job training"
good,"You eat what you kill.  Hard tours, tough grind. Opportunity if you can  sell.  Need to be prepared for lots of no and even yes can be no(7 day cancellation policy)"
good,"Good ability of self and Maintain accurate records of pool use and chemical levels "
good,Safe and professional working environment. Constantly busy. Maintaining building operations on a daily basis. Always learning and reviewing equipment and equipment operations.
good,"Working as a housekeeper has been a new experience to me. It amazes me how clean people can be and how dirty people can be. I have come across rooms that are almost spotless and take maybe 20 minutes to clean, and I have come across rooms that are disastrous and take about an hour to clean. I work with kind people and the majority of the guests who stay with us are kind as well."
good,Good Company to work for Great people to work with. Crazy hours Going on road trips was great. Getting to know the people you work with. Learned a lot about myself.
good,Awesome manager and staff. Easy going atmosphere. Easy work. Low pay and no benefits but it's expected at a job like this. Perfect second job or possibly first job.
good,I had fun working here but telemarketing just wasn't for me. making reservations was ok but trying to sell the packages I did not like.
good,"Starting the day off by clocking in, getting your main room key. You then would get your cart, make sure all supplies are full, and get as many towels, sheets etc. before leaving to go to your rooms. You would get a paper letting you know the customers whom have already left and go in to strip everything. You clean the rooms as you would want your house to be. Make sure you put your supplies are inside the room, make beds, dust etc for each room. I learned how to fast pace and get my job done the right way. Management was not bad at all but could have been more professional. Co-workers would come and go for housekeeping is harder than you think. My hardest part was not knowing if someone was in a room or not. Enjoyed meeting different families-people from all over the world."
good,"Work day began at 5:00 a.m. with scheduling of the housekeeping the primary early objective.  Meet with guests at the breakfast hour and supervise the work activities of the desk, housekeeping and maintenance.  Day would end between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m."
good,I like the job it's fairly easy as long as your booking tours the only thing is one week you will make $1500 the next you make $400 so it's up and down very inconsistent and it can get old. The opportunity to make money is some of the time but only consistent for people who've been with the company for 10 years
good,I loved the job! Everyday having guest check in and making sure they were happy before they went to there room. Talking to the guest from all around the world was by far my favorite part! I loved all my co-workers. Getting along with all my co-workers made it easier to come to work everyday and enjoy the job!
good,Very good work place no major issues as of the corporation. Co-workers were nice and helpful and management was good when you needed help.
good,It has had its ups and downs. The work itself aint hard but some of the employees i work with i could care less for cause they out to make any one look bad and are rude to guest. our manager is a real good guy treats us like family willing to do anything for you if you do a good job
good,"I like working for this company, but the balance of life and job wasn't that great. When I requested days of doctors appointments and funerals they were not given."
good,Myrtle Beach is in the top 10 most visited beaches in the U.S. For this reason you have the opportunity to work with many different personalities from all walks of life. You have one shot at closing the sale so you must be able to overcome objections quickly.
good,"My job is to :	"
good,"This company has 3 Business units; they're run separatly which makes them not equaly good places to work for. WER is the best for employees stability and career oportunities, the others units are not great to work for: WHG, WVO and Corporate."
good,I had fun working for this company. After working here for a while I realized that this company was not for me. I prefer to work somewhere where I can move and grow with the company.
good,"A typical day is an 8 hour shift of just checking people in and out, as well as making reservations. I learned how to satisfy customers needs as well as accommodating them, I also learned how to make an audit packet. Management was great up until I was supposed to get a raise after my 90 day evaluation, I was employed an additional 2 months after my 90 day evaluation and I was told the raise will come in next paycheck. Co-workers were great, we were a great team. The hardest part of the job would of had to have been having multiple customers arrive all at once, while your by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job would've had to have been making the customer happy and satisfied with our facilities."
good,My job is very interesting. Everyday I get to meet different people and have conversations. A typical work day is busy on certain days of the week. The management is friendly and encouraging. The hardest part is memorizing the system and all the protocols.
good,"Prospecting from account lists provided by the hotel company to generate new leads and increase business from the corporate meetings and conference market . Accomplished this by utilizing successful  communication skills with a commitment to establish personal connections with group planner. Educate planners on range of facilities and hotel amenities, what’s new, exciting and valuable for potential group customers at hotel."
good,"Empresa boa de se Trabalhar onde tinha horário flexível, salario bom."
good,"A very great place to work if you can handle being told NO.."
good,My manager was awesome. My head of house keeping not so much. Other house keepers were lazy. The hardest part of the job was fast paced work of housekeeping. Easiest part was that housekeeping itself isnt difficult to figure out
good,Took in coming calls from owners that has purchased a timeshare and wanted to book/plan a vacation. Great team work and their was always a supervisor or someone to help if you were stuck with something or had a question.
good,"Its a great place to work, learning experience in the collections world. I have learned a lot of negotiation skills due to their intensive training."
good,Great place to work but largely due to Co workers.  Great work enviorment
good,"I am a highly resourceful, flexible and enthusiastic  chef with experience in lots of different challenging catering roles and environments. I am able to maintain high standards of service and production within the kitchen and other food areas. I enjoy preparing fresh, local produce, to get the best flavours and overall product. I am well organised, professional and work equally well on my own or as part of a team. My ambition is to look for a new challenging catering position, one which will make best use of my existing skills and experience and also further my personal and professional development."
good,Working for a Wyndham hotel property is a great opportunity since there are so many hotels that fall under the Wyndham hotels group.
good,I did not have a car at the time so my manager would come pick me up for the days work. I would do what was asked of me whether it be cleaning carpets or cleaning lobby.  Helping guests was certainly part of the work since their was none from staff. I began working their as part of a program for vocational rehabilitation so it was understood but was released because of I think it was going under so it was to be short term .
good,"While I worked at the hotel.  I realized that they were Team player.  When someone need help, they were all whiling to support each other. "
good,Good job with a good amount of hours. It tends to be boring because you work alone during your whole shift and you also don't have designated breaks. 
good,"check in guest"
good,"Si pagaran mejor, sería el mejor empleo del mundo."
good,i learned how to be the manager i am today i did the schedule every week along with the payroll i miss my workers i wish my store did not close
good,"Very stressful about meeting standard quota. Everyone was nice and friendly but quite competitive in a numbers game. Different locations everyday in a casino property. It was fun, but still remember its a numbers game."
good,"mostly on your own, not much team work but good if you like those conditions"
good,"mot enjoyable part was the kids, hardest part would be the pay. loved all my co-workers, management wasn't the best.. learned that kids just want love and attention. typical day would be potty training, teaching, lunch and recess. the parents loved me"
good,"I absoutely Loved the Sonora Inn Hotel,not only was it beautiful, but i got to meet amazing people from all over the world. My day always went by smooth, and I got a ton of communication experience, customer service experience, cash handling, and computer experience. My coworkers were wonderful and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was catching on to the fast paced enviroment, but it was great experience. My direct manager was not a good manager. I tried my hardest to get along with him and even went as far as complaining to the company for various personal reasons. That is why i ended up resigning from my job. The management is under new owners, so i would LOVE to work there again."
good,"I had been in the Timeshare industry for a number of years prior to working for Wyndham. However, Wyndham was the first publicly traded company I had worked for. I learned that there is a lot of advantages of Brand Marketing. Management seemed to know what they were doing within the scope of the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the waiting on approval for various projects to be approved through the appropriate channels. For the most part my coworkers were great to work with."
good,"The office was relaxed and the co-workers were knowledgeable most of the time. Availability was sometimes not managed well by supervisor, and then staffing suffered. Our office was treated as an outside entity by the rest of the company, even though we were also company employees. Easy job negatively impacted by callers who wear you down."
good,Wyndham is a nice place to work. I work from home which is cool. But management in my department isn't the best. Poor response to issues. No ownership either.
good,Enjoyed at first but very slow paced for afternoon shift. Not much to do in the afternoons when there is only a few check ins. Personally I am bored. Morning shift is fast paced and enjoyable. Customers can be rude but as expected in a customer service job.
good,"Fast paced environment working in between sales and marketing. Sales and Marketing turnover seems to be very high, unless you are very successful. Sales and marketing key contributors get treated very well with nice compensation plans"
good,"announced closure of site at the end(ish) of 2019, no at home opportunities because not maintaining a Washington presence outside of resorts, severance TBD. the announcement immediately following, in the next meeting, 5 minutes later to the sales department: moving to a new building, maintaining presence in Washington."
good,I loved meeting the new people that came in every day and making them smile. I pay was bad if we would have been paid a lot more I may have turned it into a full-time job.
good,This property has good benefits and discounts for a lot of different places. A lot of room to grow just needs a bit more structure and computer system is slow.
good,"This was a great company to work for. The people and training are both outstanding. Commission only just wasn't for me. Other than that, great place to work!"
good,I was in a relaxed motel with many regular guests that became my friends. Accountant neglected to pay my Social Security  for a while and disappeared. Not sure all income had been reported henceforth. I was the manager and worked nights to better service ongoing activities. No benefits nor raises. Got a raise month prior to minimum wage requirement after 20 plus years. Not good in that respect
good,A good place to learn to sale.  The training is ongoing.  You also get help from sales team.  They allow you to transfer to other jobs in the company.
good,"I honestly LOVE working for the company Wyndham, but my manager is absolutely the worst!!! The company has many friendly people and they definitely will help you with absolutely anything."
good,Aprendi muchisimo en mis 5 años en la empresa al estar en 3 areas diferentes.
good,They do a lot to keep agents engaged. There are a lot of opportunities for incentives and to make that little extra. The pay and hours are reflective of the industry and contact center practices.
good,It was a really old and cheap hotel so the staff was limited and very disorganized. I was an intern and I was doing the role of a manager in most ocassions
good,people tend to talk alot and with turn make alot of drama but management was pretty awesome i would say watch who you think is a friend had very uncomfortable feelings from some of the staff for my race and being a new employee but most of the staff is every nice !
good,Love working for this company! Their are real people all around you always willing to help. The pay is lacking and there’s no consistency with pay. Otherwise this would be the perfect job
good,"Great if you like meeting new people ."
good,"The people I worked with were always willing to help out. It is steady most of the time, but it could turn fast-paced from one moment to the next. The guests come in from the airport are friendly. We all worked together as a team to make sure customer needs were met. The General Manager was very helpful, but we had issues with repair, out of order rooms, and technical difficulties."
good,"love my co-workers and Management is helpful.  Relaxed yet high pressure sales environment.  Okay if you are living with mom and dad, but don't believe the hype when they constantly talk about a six figure income.  Less than ten percent of employees last more than 6 months, and the few who do earn around $45,000-$75,000 on average."
good,Working at a Days Inn hotel is not job of my dreams but it is a great job for a student trying to finish their studies and need a side job for everyday financial needs. Working with a good manager is always a key for me and my manager/owner is the reason I went back to the hotel for work in between changing jobs.
good,"The culture is alright.  Call center environments have the same behaviors no matter the industry.  It's not a terrible place to work at.  I do enjoy the work at home benefit however working at home can be overrated.  Overall, this company isn't so bad."
good,Great place to learn sales.  If you can sell something with zero resale value you can learn to sell anything.  Unbelievable training.  Great trainer and amazing team work.  Nice culture but hard to be friends with people who will be gone in less then a year.  Not for everyone. Standards kept going up but comp plans went down.  I was the only one from my training class to last over a  year.  Had 1 great manager who got promoted then had a different one every couple months.  Once you get the hang of it you can pretty much work at any wyndham.  Lots of coworkers changed location many times to chase the best pay plan.  No job security they can fire you in 2 months if you have bad numbers.  No paid time off.  Some directors will approve your days off but some will deny almost any time.  Pay is a draw system commission only.  Get your money and get out.  They will hire anyone with a pulse which is good but get ready to prove you self.
good,Good environment everyone is excepting and very nice. Very helpful. had a good time while there. Very flexible working hours for a student going to college.
good,I enjoyed the friendly competition we had going between like hotels. My  hotel always won so it was pretty awesome being able to go to Vegas once a year with all expenses paid.  Great company to work for however they aren't to forth coming with the raises.
good,The training was probably the hardest part but we had amazing trainers that would help us whenever we needed. Everyone was nice. I wish there was more space on the floors tho
good,"Dialed about 150 calls everyday on my own time at work. Very self-motivated & pay depended on how hard I worked & how many appointments I have scheduled for the sales reps. I would open the sales pitch & schedule appointments. Every day when I would go to work, I already had a daily, weekly & monthly goal. I am always determined to do my best & make the most I can possibly get. My smile on the other side of the phone made all the clients tell me stories, smile, laugh and have a great time. The hardest part about this job is the mentality of working hard after having so many no's. Though, it never stopped me from succeeding. Many of my coworkers would play ping pong or go outside for a little bit. I always stayed inside & was dedicated to hit my goal."
good,"Very good culture. Technology is also good."
good,"It was ok to work for Wyndham, however you never know when they will walk into your call center and say whelp, its over we are closing you down."
good,I was unable to keep up with the other employees and was eventually fired due to a miscommunication after having a surgery that had me out of work for a month.
good,"Working in a hotel, there will always be that one unhappy guest and weekends and holidays are a must.  Sometimes they are hard to please no matter what they are offered."
good,i loved working for wydham group it was new and different experience in my life and whatever i learned by working over there will definetly be helpfull in future
good,"Employment at WW  was a good experience."
good,Really can't complain.. Easy to learn job especially if you already know about hair products.. Starts you off at 7.50. Just clean up rooms and greet guest.
good,Management and SOPs changed daily and HR is like in planet Pluto.  Don't become a lifer and don't let lifers ruin you.  A lot of turnover and unethical behavior.
good,I am very excited in getting out into this new state im wich i just moved to and start building a life in every angle possible.
good,"busses at moments , like taking phone calls for guest who wish to visit the motel and make arrangements for them to stay at the motel, helping laundry room mates out with keep up with their own Landry work and mine , and helping modes to clean room"
good,"Great company, great benefits... okay pay! Unless youre in SALES!"
good,"Typical call center environment - The employees are friendly and the building is nice. Those that have been there for a long time seem to enjoy it. "
good,"Great work place! got along with co workers, loved the constant work, time goes by fast keeping busy, every month once or twice a month garden and parking lot maintence, loved how once a month we the staff would get a party thrown by the manager, he would pay for lunch such as subway or pizza and drinks, nice quiet workplace, costumers were great as well, did my absolute best pleasing the stayers and the manager, worked to my full potential."
good,Wyndham Worldwide is an amazing brand and I would recommend anyone who is looking for a job that can turn into a possible career to apply.
good,"IN the morning I would come in and make all the housekeepers papers for the tasked we was doing that day.i learned how to talk to people and computer skills."
good,"I learned a lot about sales.  I learned how tough it is to get customers to trust and buy into what I was selling.  This was probably one of the toughest jobs I have had.  The money was great if you were selling ownership's. It did have a high turn over rate due to employees not making sales, therefor they made no money.  Lots of highs and lows in this type of work. Overall, good experience."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but if you're new it's hard to get any guidance and must earn your own way. Most experienced sales associates are not willing to help new employees."
good,"I am enjoying my time at Wyndham, the management is great and they make every effort to accommodate their employee's needs regarding scheduling and school or family life. Unfortunately they reduce all employees hour to part time status for indefinitie periods every year, each year those periods get longer. Also budget cuts make it very difficult to advance one's career, even after getting additional education that was recommended by the company itself."
good,This is a great place to work as long as you are self sufficient. I only had maybe three days total training and it wasn't the best training at that. The job is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Basically ran the hotel on my shift. Everyone looked to me for answers whether it be guests needing help with the area or housekeeping needing instructions.
good,"On a typical day you start with additional training, then a team meeting. Afterwards you will wait for your first tour of the day, you will take the potential owner to the presentation room where you ask some discovery questions to see how they currently vacation."
good,This location is a union hotel most of the time busy for summer time not much all year; crew is older and slow specially servers. Management never around when needed. Work between crew members not evenly distribute.
good,"Typical day started at nine, cleaning seven to fourteen rooms a day. Great customers that are appreciative on how hard you worked. Here I learned to satisfy customers requests. Hardest part was getting it all done in the time given. Most enjoyable part of this job is the cleaning. I love to clean."
good,"Positive people, and great cultural atmosphere but not flexible."
good,"My average day at work involved talking to individuals from all different walks of life. I have used the skills I learned from this company in every position I have held since. However, there is very little room for advancement, and very little job security, as it depends on how many tours you book month. During times of decreased tourism, it is extremely difficult to meet goals."
good,"A day at work was lots of interaction with the public and a mentally challenging job that taught me a lot about dealing with the public. And it taught me how to handle rejection in sales. Rejection, of course was the hardest part of the job. An average timeshare tour would last 4 hours or more, so you have to be on your toes at all times. I enjoyed helping people to make their vacation needs and dreams come true. I enjoyed meeting new people and making new friends. My passion for the product and gaining the customer's trust is what made me successful at Wyndham Vacation Resorts. I also enjoyed working with my fellow employees as a team to work for the good of the overall performance and success of sales made each day at Wyndham Vacation Resorts."
good,"I learned how to sell at Wyndham.  Before working there, I made about $45,000/year.  In my first year at Wyndham, I made $145,000.  In the middle of my 11 year career, before the economic downturn, I was averaging closer to $300,000/year.  All commission."
good,"Typical day included stocking housekeeping cart with supplies and receiving check out or refresh rooms list. Depending on if the room was a check out or not, cleaning ranged. Typically it was stocking the room with essentials, changing sheets and making the bed, vacuuming and dusting. At the end of the day we would wash and fold any towels or linen. I learned how to manage my time. Management was easy to get along with and was very understanding. Co-workers were mostly of a different race, but they were very friendly. The job was not hard at all. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that somebody was getting a clean room thanks to you."
good,this was educational and allowed for cultural exchange. It was productive and allowed room for improvement.
good,Days Inn is a very fun place to work.  You get to meet people and share ideas with people from all over the world that are traveling to their destinations.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced but fun to be in, Learned how to deal with stress when very busy, Management was great, The hardest part of the job was working holidays."
good,work started at 8am i was mainly laundry personnal wash dryed folded and put laundry away also cleaned and disinfected rooms and hallways..
good,I clean guest rooms. I have learn what guest really want and need while they stay at the hotel. The management here is great. The people I work with are one of a kind and great people. The hardest job is making sure that the guest are happy and safe. The most enjoyable thing about this job is that I know when I leave I have done by best and the guests are happy.
good,It was a good job for someone that is very good in sales. Timeshare is one of the hardest products to sell because no one that comes in wants to make a purchase. They are all lured in for a free gift. It is the sales persons job to make the sale. All of the people that work there are a lot of fun and great to work with. 
good,"Every day I come into work the first thing I do is count my cash drawer. I then go to the computer and print all information needed to assign the housekeepers rooms to clean. Then I charge all 3rd party credit cards. During this time our continental breakfast is in the process to which I am either helping with or actually doing this job as well as a breakfast hostess. My desk duties up to 11 am are to check guests out. At 11:30am I do the credit card report. Afterwards, I maintain the phone for reservations and possible guest information. "
good,On a typical day I review guest accounts as well as bill catering accounts. I am also required to balance and verify all daily hotel revenues. It was this position where I received my knowledge of Microsoft Excel. I work closely with the Accounting Manager as well as the Front Office Manager and General Manager. I am involved in training front office staff. I do not consider any part of my job as being hard and the most satisfaction I receive is doing the job well on a consistent basis
good,"I Love to work with with all people,Love to see them get ahead,it makes my day just to see a smile on their face,One of the best days of my life Was when I became A Maintenance Supervisor and Forman,And then started to sell my Paintings."
good,Call center revolving around the vacation/time share industry. Agents were required to sell discounted vacation packages to customers in exchange for the customer listening to a time-share presentation at their resort destination.
good,I learned allot of different things as times change and the way processes are done.
good,"Really fun job! Everybody loves to talk about great vacations and you get to meet people from all over the country. If the customer can afford it, they will buy it. Anyone who loves people and has selling ability, can make alot of money. Management changes quickly!!! It's better to be the low guy on the pole.:)"
good,"Typical day is filled with its ups and downs great laughter due to great co-workers. speaking to owners is always great people love the product, however due to poor pay and lack of communication at times causes big turnover and lack of pride in workplace"
good,Supervisor/Administrative Assistance
good,Like working here. Love to meet all the different guests from all over the country.
good,Nothing typical about hospitality you are always experiencing more and new each day. I have learned to wear more than one hat in a single environment. I like my general manager he is fair and helpful. My co-workers are respectful and kind i enjoy learning from them. The hardest part of my job at present is the hours i work because they are in the evening. I enjoy talking to the guest's the most. asking where they are from what brings them to the valley and directing them to what ever destination they decide on for the most enjoyable trip that they have had.
good,I loved talking to customers from across the United States. The vacation packages we offered were at really great prices. The hardest part of the job was proving our legitimacy. The most enjoyable part of my job was providing an affordable vacation to families who thought they couldn't afford a vacation.
good,Timeshare is a tough business . You have to do your job and not take rejection personally. Management is not educated at times . Training has been weak. If your not really good you will quit this job as the base pay is not good enough to survive in San Francisco. It takes about 9 months to fully understand this job . There is a lot to it .
good,"The Company as a whole exemplifies great guest appreciation; customer satisfaction, while maintaining star status. The room rates are affordable and for a reasonable amount of time per stay period. Expedition of processing card and reservation services."
good,"Each department has a significantly different culture than many of the other departments in the same building.  Some are close-knit with lots of camaraderie, others are cold, distant and want nothing to do with one another.  Most are somewhere in between, but it's very compartmentalized depending on the area that you work."
good,Wyndham has given me a fantastic opportunity to develop my skills in sales and marketing.  I am privileged to work with extremely talented marketers.  The most difficult part of the job is the schedule.
good,"Wyndham provides great opportunities to learn and grow.  The company always has exciting initiatives and strives to be best in class.  Employees become friends and even family over time.  With the new CEO, the focus of the business is on the customer, providing great vacation experiences and evolving the timeshare industry and rental business into the type of vacation every consumer would enjoy."
good,"Very flexible work, but not always sure when you going to work."
good,would be handling customers. The area the company is located in is undesirable. Drug addicts and homeless make up more than 50 percent of the customers. Customers who make reservations online make a lot of cancellations due to this fact.
good,"It is what you make it out to be.  What you put in is what you get out.  It is tough and has a high turnover rate but with the right combination of sales skills, extrovert attitude, people skills, and no fear of rejection then you can make decent money."
good,"The properties were nice. Management was very reasonable, nice and good communication skill. I did not like the fact that the pay was unable to sustain even a local 1 bedroom apt.  I just did not understand that they didn't even have any access to any housing or connections with long term rental properties, being that they are a property management rental company.  It seemed like nobody cared that I could not find a reasonable place to live."
good,Local management supports their employees.  Little room for advancement.  Generous employee travel and hotel discounts.  Many local mid level managers feel that they and only them are in charge.  One will tell you to go left and another will tell you to go right.
good,Made some good friends among sales people. Sales people were focused and well trained. Many had years of experience in the industry. The pay was good and the hours were reasonable.
good,Fun place to work but no room for advancement. No drama within the hotel or departments which makes nice for a working environment. Parking on site is a huge plus.
good,Great family business to work for at the Port Elgin Super 8. Worked rotating shifts. Had opportunity to take on extra hours as needed. Enjoyed the job. Good Wyndham discount.
good,Good salary and job security. Job satisfaction at Wyndham depends mostly in which department you work. The Contact Center Operations is stressful for lack of policy agreement and understanding within related customer service departments.
good,Stable work.  Decent pay.  People skills are a must   You must be available to work nights and weekends and know how to deal with customer complaints. .
good,"Excellent place to work, great people that will help you get ready for real sales!!!"
good,But what most I liked about that job is that if I needed help on something or also I know I needed something worked on they were there to help without judging me. So that's why I like that job. They ain't there to turn you down they are there to help you build.
good,"I feel like I understood the motel policies and procedures but, I feel like I wasn't trained well enough to audit by myself. During training my trainer and I spent most of our time on our phones and folding laundry. When guest arrived she would do most of the checking in and talking while I watched from behind or while coping identification cards and making room keys."
good,Fun place to work on-the-job training they will work with you if you have a situation with his heart in his meeting days off great benefit package the only thing I disagree with was that housekeeper and assistant housekeeper or relatives and it's not often that you see them inseparable
good,I loved my supervisor he was always very supportive fun and still remained professional. I learned a lot about different locations and top tourist spots than i would if i did not work here. Hardest part would be constantly having to battle the lies that some guest were sold on and still trying to let the guest know that Wyndham is a good company. I liked how the steering committee put together incentives and spirit week.
good,"Typical day at work would be taking calls all day as that was the job. Working from home has its disadvantages, help is not easy to get as they make it seem. Online resources are not up to date, SUPs and Leads too busy to check chat and answer. If you call for help the agent that is supposed to help you has an attitude (even though helping agents is their primary job duty). 1 question has 10 answers, left hand doesn't know what right hand is up to. Working from home your numbers are your only identity in the company. Many policies in place that are not efficient and does not rate employees fairly. Working from home your SUP is your only way in to the company, if your SUP is one of the SUPs they have- that are completely fake and knows how to climb the corporate ladder by warming up to right people; well you might as well lose hope of better opportunities. Management is  NOT  interested in employee' feedback (I think mgmnt believes bottom line employees do not have brains). SUPs will give you inaccurate answers to your questions and when you get in trouble for doing what your SUP advised you to do, there is no accountability for SUPS but you still face the consequences. OWNER CARE is a great position and not very hard job to do, dealing with OC management is the hardest part about the job. OC mgmt will do their best to trap you in OC for rest of your life. It's very rare an agent gets promotion from OC, you either get fired or mgmt find so many ways to pick on you for wanting to leave; you will get tired of it and resign. Do not believe anything any SUP says that they will do"
good,I enojoy the job and the people. Most of the people you deal with on a day to day bases are very friendly and outgoing. I think the pay could be better and i dont like the fact they have shift changes every 6 months.
good,"I have enjoyed working here, learning the various reservation programs, among other things.  Management is great to work with, co-workers are easy to get along with.  Only left to find better wages and daytime hours so that I can afford to have my boys visit more regularly from out of province.  Hardest part of the job is when something breaks down or a guest has a major issue with something within the room whether cleanliness, equipment failure or something else.  Most enjoyable aspect is meeting new people, and learning new things."
good,"Great Environment,Great Management,lack of security,and"
good,"The company itself was a great place to work. I learned how to manage my money better. I loved working with my co-workers."
good,Well being in this field is not that really stressful it was actually fun and think your having a good time and learning while you are working
good,"learning more about management in workforce"
good,A typical day at Wyndham was high-energy and very enjoyable.  I learned to be creative in my selling techniques and to appeal to each perspective client as an individual.  My co-workers were lots of fun and a joy to work with.  The hardest part of my job at Wyndham were the limited work hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the potential to earn great rewards and incentives.
good,"You need to really like talking to people this job is not for the person who can not handle stress, this is a very fast passed job you hang up the phone and you have another call you need to ask the owners personal questions like what types of things they like to do on Vacation and be prepared to help them find an alternate location for their location due to availability of the location. Your co-workers are great very nice and helpful, the most enjoyable thing for me was talking to the owners and helping them with all of their needs letting them know they were being herd. The hardest thing about the job was having certain key questions you were expected to ask owners and not sound transaction-able "
good,cleaning hotel rooms was very quiet when you clean each room yourself. it had nice people who visited there.
good,Over time you are given more and more responsibilities but the pay for the position is very little. The job itself is not very demanding and but there is a lot to learn as you go. High turnover rate of employees at the site level is common.
good,"My typical day of work was very two sided. The job itself was very easy and fun to do. I would come into work and work with a great set of girls, get my room assignments and go to it. The hardest part of the job was coming in and dealing with the unfriendly and downright unpleasant manager, and her head house keeper. The manager called me into her office because the head house keeper told her I had not progressed in my job (I had only been there about two weeks.) then said she was going to write me up for not dusting correctly. Which was fine, that is on me. However when she got out the paper for me to sign she said ""For a girl trying to pay for college you're not very intelligent."" Which is where I asked to give my two weeks notice. I then didn't even wait for my ride home and walked a mile or two to my mother in laws house."
good,loved working with pepole one on one tell them about are great city
good,"really enjoyed my time here, interacting with the guests was very fulfilling"
good,It's a great place to work. Friendly the company really help there customers out. It was always a wonderful and exciting to be there.
good,I am very pleased to be a part of the Team!  The Staff all have Heart and that’s what makes it a great environment to work in! 🇨🇦💕.   That’s all I have to say at this time!
good,"HR Department is usually helpful in getting any issues solved. The company as a whole is becoming outdated and realizing it grew too quickly. Not as great a place to work anymore, however they try to treat you right."
good,"It was an upbeat and fun place to work! There is a little bit of a clique with the management, kind of a “good ole’ boys” club but they still are usually fair and want to see you be successful."
good,It’s a fun company but fun doesn’t pay the bills.  The client has 5 day to change their minds and most of them do. So five days of stress waiting to see if your gonna get paid.  You have a draw so even when you get a deal to stick your paying back your draw
good,"It was my most favorite jobs. The manager was amazing, the staff was enjoyable and our guests were fantastic. I left due to property being sold to horrible managers who wanted to pay less and expect more job duties."
good,The hotels are not owed by the company it's self they are independently owned and operated with set standards to be a part of the Wyndham hotel brand. So it's really up to the owner what you get paid etc.
good,"Loved working there,  very cliquey tho.  And judgemental.  The co workers get along with you to your face.  And lord forbid you if you have a past.  "
good,Wyndham is an interesting place to work.  You meet a lot of interesting people there.  The benefits Wyndham had when I worked there were great - better than any others I'd seen.
good,"great people to work with"
good,"A typical day of work can be fast paced and never ending. With a call tracker you are able to see how many calls are waiting and how many other agents are or aren't on the phones. It can be stressful but this job is a decent work load and great work culture, if you are neurotypical. However if you suffer with mental health issues or issues in your personal life, the company is not well suited to accommodate."
good,"Set the orders for the housekeepers, stand up meeting every morning, check areas inspect units after cleaning prepared activities for the team inventory every month do it report to managers"
good,this company is great people to work for although there is no benefits nor sick days or paid time off. the owner pays people the way he wants to and other wyndham properties give their employees discounts well this guy doesn't! I kill myself working for him and it is made clear no matter how hard I work we are replaceable and no room in the business to move up!
good,nothing really good to say it was a nice people overall but I will not be returning to them for work.  I was treated very unfair as far as the way I was ask to leave . After I got bite by bedbugs
good,"It was great and promising at first.  About 4 years in, I realized that they were never going to move me up.  Don't believe some of the things they say.  Great benefits and incentives.  I fell through the cracks and they didn't want to pick me up."
good,"I wasnt good enough to keep working there selling timeshare.  I was above average on the floor, but still didn't make enough money to justify the drive for me.  If you stick with it, there is a great opportunity to make life-changing money there."
good,I enjoyed it there however management needs to learn that family comes first and don't tell someone to go see a doctor and then terminate them for doing what they was originally told to do the day before.
good,"Working in a hotel industry is very challenging and multi tasking, because you will face a lot of different kind of attitude of a person."
good,Typical day is checking in and out customers. making sure they are happy with their stay in our hotel. My co warkers are family. The hardest part is when you know that there is person that isin need of help and i cant drop the rate down enough to help.
good,I had a great experience with Wyndham and learned a lot about sales. It is just hard selling something so expensive to someone that only came in for the free gifts.
good,I enjoyed working here because of the employers and most important the guest. I am a people person so i always enjoy meeting people from diffrent states as well as countries.
good,As I worked here I found that being quick to clean the rooms was important. It's good to have outstanding cleaning skills to give the motel a good reputation. I was dependable  and very rarely had to have my rooms checked since they were always done right. I learned the procedures for bloody covers and towels and also if there were bed bugs.
good,"Wyndham Vacation Owners manages time shares. I manage the maintenance  departments inventory for 477 timeshare units with over 3000 line items of repair parts and new appliances. There are 13 technicians that request repair parts and new appliances to maintain Wyndham's standard of hospitality to ensure the owners and quest are taken care of while on there vacation. The hardest part is managing cost. Wyndham has about a 30% debt lost due to owners not paying there maintenance fee in which these owners are foreclosed on. Wyndham pays there worker fairly low, but to the current salaries in the area. The company has a good website for employee's to take classes and enjoy discounts."
good,"The people are great, management is great... The computer systems that I get to use on the daily make work very interested. They make sure you have all the things you need to perform your duties. They have allot of potlucks..."
good,"I worked with the sales department and signed up guests for sales presentations.  I gave the first impression to the guests.  I loved working with the guests, finding out where they were from and seeing repeat guests.  The hard part of my job was the pressure of having a quota to reach.  I would sometimes get frustrated because I felt the concern was not for the guests, but for the money to be made.  My manager was encouraging and supportive and I was proud of what I did accomplish. My co-workers and I would always support each other."
good,In my experience as a employee hard working is a verry inportant becuase of that when I was in SM Marikina ( philiphine) I recieve Certificate as a Loyal and intigrity.
good,"multiple calls reserving, cancelling, or modifying reservations. occupational hazards; prank phone calls(rare), disgruntled callers, etc."
good,disiplin titizlik temiz ve hijyen işine sahiplenme ve en önemlisi müşteri hassasiyetidir
good,A typical workday for me is to come in at 11pm and work til 7am. I am responsible for the night audit paperwork and setting up the breakfast for morning. I would like to work my way up in the managemet field. I get along with my co-workers. One of the hardest part of the job is having to turn people away if they dont have enough money to pay. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to meet people from all over the United States and other parts of the world!
good,"I have worked at a few hotels, and i can honestly say Super 8 was the best."
good,gave 90 minute time share presentations
good,Love this place to work. I enjoyed the hours i worked however i would have been interested in the split shifts it would have met my needs because i did have a daughter at home.
good,"Monitoring the room rates and the occupancy of the hotel to make the necessary adjustments to the room pricing. I learned how to create room blocks, set rates, and balance the books. The management staff cared about the associates."
good,It was ok cleaned rooms and helped each other when help was needed learned how to do management and go check behind co workers got along with everybody
good,"Although a sense of urgency is upon all of us to finish our job on time and with the highest attention to detail, we tend to appreciate working together with respect, in peace and confidence that we perform our duties to the best of our abilities and the management sees and tries to do what they can to understand the time and struggles that we housekeepers put at work everyday. Party events are usually what would make a typical day of work very hard due to the extra steps that must be implemented to make sure that the rooms are spotless for new guests. The most enjoyable part of this job comes from knowing that our guests are being treated fairly as we would like to be treated with respect and care."
good,"N/A nothing to say, they were a ok company but they will cut your hours when it slow, and they do not pay you for the time when they send you home. My manager there was down to earth and understanding."
good,We're you make beds and clean rooms out by the number of rooms they give you and make suew ever area or clean before you leave out the local of the room s
good,The hardest part about this job was making sure that everyone was happy at all times. It took a lot of coordination with different departments to make sure everyone is on the same page as well.
good,"Before I start my job, I put everything in order. Sometimes I train new employees, and also help my co-workers when I'm done with my section. Since I'm used to the job, everything is mostly easy for me. I'm a fast worker and a very passionate one, I always finish before my exact time. I enjoy talking to the guests and taking care of their needs."
good,we start off getting all are supplies that we need for the romms. they split us up n groups of 2. my co-workers are grate help we move at fast pace and before we leave a room we make sure everything is right.the hartest parts is carring the bag full of towls down the halls. i injoyed working there
good,"Manage the relationship between owners and other departments such as Vacation Planning, Financial Services, Title Services, and Owner Care.  Multitasking up to 4 job responsibilities at the same time during spikes in customer demand while exceeding roll metric requirements."
good,"It was a good place to work at but a poor reflection on Wyndham's name. It is an extremely friendly work environment they are very flexible and understanding. It was a good job to hold for a college student because it permitted me to both make a living, and be remain successful in school. However the management is out of touch with the company and it is therefore suffering and looks neglected. The hotel itself looks run down and unclean and I loved working there but on the other end of that, I would NEVER stay there or allow my pet to stay there for that matter. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do customer service, I'm a people person so my personality was able to be expressed and it was almost as if I was getting paid to just be me so it didn't feel like work. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the fact that despite my good character and personal beliefs, I would sometime be poorly reflected because of the lack of upkeep at my workplace."
good,"Working at the Howard Johnson was a very satisfying place to work. I enjoy the professionalism of this career and how at the same time the family at work team atmosphere. I also enjoyed being promoted for my hard work and not because I had seniority. I learned several skills including but not limited to accounting, micromanagement and customer satisfaction tactics. A typical day at work always went very quickly, the hotel was in close proximity to the Naval Base so their were several long/short term military guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in service to others and provide them with sincere care to make them feel at home while they are away from home. The hardest part of the job was seeing a client walk away unsatisfied with their stay and not having the resources to provide them with satisfactory."
good,"A typical day was come in early morning to get room reports ready for housekeepers,on the move all day checking rooms talking to guest"
good,The best part of the job was working with awesome people and the culture! The hardest part of the job is getting the bonus each month the standards are so high.
good,"The customers were great, they always greeted with friendly smiles. The management was great, they helped you out when you needed anything like a day off. They understood when I had school work to complete so they allowed some time off, very understanding."
good,Nice co workers and exciting product. Challenge resolving owner concerns
good,There arent many places you can work 25 hours a week and make crazy big money. You can make up to 1M a year working here its crazy. Company is going through many changes right now.
good,the environment was very calming and cozy but there were some issues that was needing to be taken care of. but the clients were kind and very happy with the care that was given.
good,"It’s a great company, however people really hate “ time shares “ and being in sales/marketing they teach you how to “ finesse “ certain things, while selling a dream. It’s a great job but you have to be great a lying.  And if you aren’t. You don’t get paid. Period."
good,"Being a house keeping is a challenge for me."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, enjoy working by myself, not a team player. A typical day at work  would include organize your work area and ensure safety for yourself and others."
good,I would love to be hired here. My strengths  are woring in hotels. All in all I would not dissapoint. And you wouldn't regret hiring me. I need a job you need an employee.. work perfectly in my eyes
good,Great Place to work with good benefits and management. I  look forward to coming to work every day and meeting all the tenants and chit chatting with them.
good,"Wyndham does really care about there Employees and provide a great workspace. Wyndham does allow me to work from home, so the does reduce the day to day stress."
good,It was a hardworking job and with every minute. It was informational when it comes to Fine Dining and dinner service. It was interesting to learn about weddings and dinner ware. Hardest part of the job was trying to manage time. This is only possible for full time. The most enjoyable part is to watch the wedding attendees have a good time on the dance floor in the candle light!
good,"If you don't have a passion to help others then this isn't for you. There are people who have special needs and help with therapy, special diets and behavior that you have to deal with. Only the strong mind can survive this"
good,It was a fun and fast pace sales environment. The compensation was good. The only drawback was that it was a seasonal position.
good,"Fun, time felw by would work again."
good,always attended to customers first and continue to clean rooms all day I learned how to clean rooms really fast and got good at it manager that was there at the time was really nice the hardest part was the bathrooms I enjoyed getting done with my work early
good,"I would check guest in/out, Reservations, multi-line phone system, handled paperwork"
good,"When I was interviewed I was told that it was work from home and $12 an hour plus incentives. I was told also that incentives were up to $750 a month and that there was opportunity for overtime. It sounded great so I took the job. Training was good. I think it should've covered more (but to be honest you will always learn more when you are hands on). Once I got out of training IMMEDIATELY knew incentives were IMPOSSIBLE to get. Their metrics are very difficult to hit and there is no overtime. So make sure you count with only the $13.50 an hour (after 6 months thats the pay). Also insurance is very expensive. Compared to other places deductibles are high and monthly premiums as well. "
good,This place is a great place to work. The General manaeger is amazing; however the housekeeping manager is terrible takes everything personal. Sometimes lack of cleaning supplies. Work area for housekeeping are disorganized. Housekeepers are no enthusiastic because of the manager.
good,A typical day at work was fun the enviroment only became a struggle when something wouldn't go right in the kitchen but other then that it was fun we all associated even out side of work
good,they were more than understanding with my personal issues. and gave me more than enough time off to deal with. I made a lot of good friends. they do a lot to make sure their associates grow within the company.
good,"Night Auditor , checked in and out guests, made sure rooms were ready, stocked breakfast bar and made sure coffee was fresh. Made sure guest were comfortable and satisfied."
good,Everyone is super nice but you have to work your tail off to get a higher position. I just can't continue to drive  15 miles for a $100 pay check every week.
good,"like all jobs, its what you make of it, I did not mind the job. Just worked the front desk."
good,I liked my job because i was use to it and i was really fast with the dishwashing machine and kept everything clean on time so that they could of have things good on time
good,Working environment was manageable and nice. Co worker taught me the ins and out of maintenance work. I never had any problems and I greatly improved my customer service skills.
good,The manager and director in the Orlando telesales office are completely terrible. The favoritism at this place is unbelievable. You do have opportunities to earn money but it's a not very much. You have to sell constantly to stay out of draw in order to make any money. The environment is Relentless you have to constantly constantly be on the phone there are no breaks... in order to sell you have to be on the phone the whole time you're there it's nothing but voicemails to leave your old beat-up very few opportunities if any at all to advance. Favoritism special needs are given a certain two to three people. This place is in complete disarray
good,"Loved having new guest come into the hotel, calling airlines and see if they have any cancel. The pictures are over exaggerated. Parts of the breakfast are a joke. No hot meat, only hard boiled eggs. Management is threatened by actual employees giving great customer service"
good,The general manager and the assistant gm treated people like pond scum. They both have no people skills and have no idea how to manage a business or people. They go thru highly trained people like water. No regard for professionalism and they do not have the respect of their employees. Upper management does not care about the treatment of people or customers only the bottom line. A horrorible place to work.
good,"Your schedule is very unpredictable as a housekeeper or laundry attendant, but front desk does have set hours. I learned a lot about independence, speed, and quality in the work you do. We constantly had new managers, and the owners are very unprofessional. Most of the employees kept to themselves, other probably should have. Hardest part of the job was the long days with no help such as the weekends."
good,While in college was easy to balance my position and flexible hours
good,love the work place and most of the workers but the owners (terry and diana) arent great either is the night manager (sharon) they can care less on our (housekeepings) concerns
good,Willing to learn as much as I can to achieve my goals in and out of the work place. I really would  love to be apart of a strong team. I am a quiet person and very easy to get alone with.
good,"I did love the people i workwd with at the company, thwy made it worth while. However miss a couple days and your job is gone. Even if you were sick. I enjoyed the cleaning aspect of the job however you are timed for each room.  And you get very little rooms to clean so it's more like working a part-part time job."
good,"A regular day at work consist supervising all the other employees, making sure that all there task for the day have been completed. I make sure that all guest have properly been charged, issue back guest refunds and of course making sure that each guest staying with us are enjoying are hotel to it's fullest"
good,"Daily routines, hard work does not always pay off all the time, management was nice, needs to pay more attention to valued employees."
good,Too many hours not enough help because of owners reasoning. Too many hours from living on property and being available 24/7. Management was too far away to get things accomplished in a timely manner!
good,It was a great experience and meeting different people. It could get stressful at times doing everything by yourself.
good,It is never the company name that does the hiring if it is a franchise so there are no advancements or compensation unless the law allows worked audit 15 years for same owner of both companies and all promises was always dismissed
good,"Front desk hotel work is a challenging job. Must be able to work quickly and effectively to ensure guests are checked in, in a timely, pleasant manner."
good,No insurance no 401k!!!! This would be a job for a person who dont have as much bills or kids. The manager always have a attitude when things dont go their way!!
good,"I learned to think quickly on my feet and make decisions regarding the satisfaction of my guests. This company was challenging, but challenged me in ways to elevate my skills."
good,"As a whole, WYNDHAM Standards are Good, very competitive with other Hotels Standards, Very Quest Orit anted. Good Name Brand in todays Hospitality World."
good,"Although i enjoyed working for this company, the owner was very stingy. The pay was horrible and no benefits. i think with better pay and some benefits there would be much less of a turn over in the hotel industry."
good,"I loved the work I did. I learned hospitality operations first hand (OJT) I had the opportunity to advance my people skills. I learned to work with people from all walks of life and cultures. I learned and perfected the skills of an certified pool operator and I had to learn to make do with materials and tools that I had not always what I needed (to make do). I learned to improvise and experiment with ways of better accomplishing my duties. I had great co-workers most of the time,who were a pleasure to work with."
good,we never received breaks and management was always yelling at the front desk crew.
good,I liked meeting the different people that would stop through for a nights stay
good,The hardest part of the job was working with a manager who did not give a care in the world about anything involving work.
good,"I worked basic 40 + hours a week ,Supervised 8 employees, ran reservation desk and handled complaints. I learned a lot about different aspects of hotel management. My coworkers were very nice except the GM and Manager whom had bad attitudes. They had a one site view of everything even if it was wrong and put customers at risk with non working Sprinkler systems."
good,its ok not the best. managment is great. nice and works with you. dont get paid enough for what we have to do. understaffed but great ppl who work there.
good,The maneger at the San Antonio riverwalk location was awful.   Rude.   Didn’t have the supplies needed to clean rooms correctly.   Did not have enough linin for rooms
good,"I would work here again, it is slow to face paced work. always dealing with the public and sometimes very dissatisfied angry people at times. Do not enjoy when laundry gets backed up on busy days."
good,you don't get paid for everything you do. they expect so much of you yet they can do the bare minimum for you. if you have a problem with scheduling or a coworker just be ready for a slap to the face with nothing being done.
good,I love the work environment and the guest but management was not good and I never got a raise. Overall they will work well with you but they also like to hire people that don't like to work I was working other people shift all the time.
good,"job was ok, great staff, worked with me with scheduling needs. the pay was ok. never really took advantage of the benefits. i would work there again bu with better pay"
good,The General Manager at my particular Days Inn did not know how to do front desk at all. She did not know to work Wynguest which was a major concern of mine because when someone called out she did not know how to do front desk which put everyone in very difficult positions.
good,everyday was great knowing that the staff was like family and making guest happy was a quest that made you feel like you accomplished something that day.
good,The management could really use some sensitivity training and information on cultural diversity. They could also use some training on proper business etiquette
good,"its a good job to boost your confidence, get to meet different people on a day to day basis. I learnt how to deal with different people from being disabled, anger and happy."
good,i work at the Ramada plaza hotel i clean the lobby taking out the trash and helping in the laundry put the linen to the wash machine
good,"I came to work at this hotel with high hopes to learn and develop my skills as a employee in a different position than a cashier. The lessons came as fast as the first hour; I was told that I would not be monitored after training was completed. I could call for help, but the front desk would only monitored by one person. I soon developed the skills to navigate and understand the complex workings of the hotel software and make sure to have plenty of time to clean and fold laundry. Soon, I was also trained to be a housekeeper as well. My job is called a switcher. I can be front desk for eight hours or housekeeping for as long as needed. The hours change drastically from week to week, but the staff is truly enjoyable to work with. We work together as a family and make sure the hotel is clean and the guest are happy with their rooms."
good,"flex schedule, and the ability to meet new people. convenient location, learned customer service skills, great co-workers."
good,I started out as a night auditor in through time i became a sales consultant. i would book group rates/ discounts. Contact other public places for future revenue or prospects. i conducted leads. While training employees and doing customer service.
good,"cleaned rooms . start at 8 to 4. Done laundary some days. Made beds and changed sheets, cleaned bathroom, dust and vaccum rooms everyday."
good,I worked for an independent franchise that was a Wyndham property. The pay is below minimum and there is no room for advancement or raises. I'm sure other properties are better but the one that I worked for was not good.
good,"Best part of the job are the different guests that I see every time I work.  We do not work as a team, because of the lack of communication, and initiative,"
good,"Easy, fast paced work. Need to have attention to detail, organizational skills and time management. Not an ideal job with someone who cant stand not to have steady hours and income."
good,Had a great ride working here so many job advances that cane quickly the company itself isn’t bad it’s just tons of favoritism that over shadows associates hard work. Management are strictly business driven for goals and not so much the employees.
good,Nothing bad to say my co workers were good workers we all were team players no week links at all if one fell short we assisted. Management was OK. Hard work when doing Cottages felt I wasn't getting paid my worth. To be traveling so far. And going up and down steps constantly with supplies
good,New manager helped with training but lacked ability to motivate. Using one's position as an authoritative rule from power does not motivate individuals. I believe servant leadership is the best approach and only occasionally in private use the position. The new manager would not care if in public to humiliate someone.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people to work with and all the guest that came to visit at the site I worked at. There were some parts of the job the questioned ethics.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but very poor management which affected my job. Very bad bed bug problem that was poorly handled. I enjoyed interacting with guests."
good,I enjoy the culture of the hotel industry. The reason I have stayed at this particular Hotel is because I have an amazing manager however there isn't any benefits or room for advancement and the pay is incredibly low there is no benefits such as Medical Dental and no paid vacation.
good,Deberian poner algun tipo de asientos para los agentes de front desk.Y aumentar el salario.
good,This position gave me the opportunity to combine my accounting skills along with my customer service skills.  Some times working the overnight shift could be hard with regards to sleep pattern. Customers were interesting.
good,only good place to stay not work. nice to guest not employees and they over work them.not good with communcation with employees and everyday was a hassle with mixed up boards with rooms to clean
good,"Was a decent job to have but they never would give you the days they wanted you to work ""you had to call in daily to see if you were needed""."
good,"A typical work day is answering the phones and checking in or checking out guest at the hotel. The management is fair, they are great about working with my school schedule but are not their to help in tough situations, this is where I have learned how to take care of a conflict quickly and calmly. My co-workers are amazing. We work together as a team and are always there for each other. The hardest part of the job has to be the conflicts and the best part of the job has to be visiting with the guest and having fun at work."
good,A good company to work for and I enjoyed many years with Wyndham.  I would work for Wyndham again as I have many good memories with Wyndham.
good,"I love my job. I enjoy seeing the people that stay with us on a regular basis as well as new faces. The job has its perks and lows as any job does. There needs to be opportunity for advancement. I myself have been there for two years and still where I was when I started. Our co-workers are great !  We joke everyday. There is not a dull moment with the girls. We are like family. I have learned a lot of new and valuable things that will help me in other aspects. If I ever do decide to leave , this will definitely be a place I will miss. You don't often find a job that you really enjoy and guests / customers ask for you by name. It makes you feel good knowing that you are good at your job and guests appreciate you."
good,Productive and the people that i worked for and with was very pleasant people .my job there really wasnt hard .It was a nice place to work at .
good,I enjoyed my time with Kangaroo Express. It taught me so much about customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers.
good,"Checking guest in and out of hotel. Answereing phones and making reservations. Help guestwith any problems they may have. Preparing breakfast and setting up breakfast bar. Completing night audit and changing computer system to next day. Cleaning pool room, reception area, gym, and office and stoking areas with necessary items."
good,"A typical day involved stocking my cart, filling and mixing my cleaning products according to code, cleaning an entire room thoroughly, within 30 minutes taught me to be able to work quickly as needed.  Also, it was a good work out as the job was quite physically demanding - carrying loads of linen or bags of garbage up and down stairs, that were heavy, and moving at such a fast pace kept me in shape."
good,"On a typical day I would compile daily reports, check in 100 to 150 guests. Process transactions from that days business day compile daily logs for accounting purposes, and insure that the guests have a pleasant and enjoyable experience"
good,"A new property so most ideas were new. Good vision, fun place to work at times. Very easy-going boss."
good,"The super 8 that I worked at was okay, The boss I had was very down grading to people though. I was told that I was doing kindergarden work even if it wasn't that way. I did love the interaction with people coming from different states. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with how the boss wanted everything done. I can do it all but he wanted everything perfect. Management was very sweet and fun to be around! A typical day at work consisted of cleaning and folding towels and checking people in. It was a very fun place minus being down graded all the time."
good,"On an average day of work I would make sure my cart was supplied and then check empty rooms in the hotel to make sure they were clean and ready. Then I would clean the dirty rooms and check to see if any guests needed anything. Finally I would clean up my cart see if any other housekeepers needed help, and clock out. At this job I learned how to keep a written record of what I did, and what was needed, as well as how to clean a lot better. The head housekeeper was a great boss, she worked with us to make sure we got as many hours as we could and to help us get our work done. My co-workers were helpfull, and nice. The hardest part of this job was moving the furniture. The best part of this job was helping people both guests and co-workers."
good,"As you work for Wyndham, you will be doing a variety of different tasks, you will be answering the phone and booking rooms for customers. You will be cleaning rooms and making beds. You will have to do laundry for the hotel. And you will also be making the breakfast for people too."
good,"Fast passed, self motavatied, work independently. Flexible hrs, great management, great hours to work, and everyone helps everyone out if they need help."
good,"As a manifest dispatch clerk I answers phones , worked. Lovely with marketers to get their tours over in a timely manner to see Wyndham’s time share tour and worked closely with gifting to make sure they relieved appropriate gifting. I was available to open and close, was willing to work weekends and do what I had to do to help the department run smoothly."
good,"Great hotel  most management is very friendly staff are very nice to work with, short help a lot, Women in office very nice hard workers Director of operation a class ack. Lots of great employees over looked for  promotion,  Hotel extremely clean and food very good. Banquet Rooms could use a little TLC very short in kitchen most of the time work got done.  Guess room all done all beds very comfortable "
good,really don't want to right a long review on this job worked there 4 years and just got burned out. A typical day was very physical and exhausting and never was credited in any way.
good,Working here was enjoyable and the guests were always friendly. The front desk manager was very nice and wanted to see people succeed.  The general manager was uninvolved for the most part.
good,This company allowed me to interact with different people. I assisted guests with checking in and out of hotel and making sure their experience fit their needs as best as possible.
good,"Working with some hotels became so challenging and others were lessons and motivating to learn."
good,"No Job Security."
good,"Super 8 was a great place to work, the environment was relaxed and I was able to meet new people everyday.  worked overnights a lot so I got to experience a lot of interesting people"
good,I enjoyed working there until my brother quit as manager and then they laid me off stating lack of work though they hired two new employees. We had a meeting in which the franchise owner of the super 8 discussed my brothers who were managers at the two motels the owners ran.  Then they gave me two weeks of pay and laid me off.
good,This job would be great for someone just starting in the hotel industry. This particular location tend to favor the new employees rather than the ones that have been here for several years. It's a good place to get your feet wet. If your a college student it is an awesome place to work. In the down time you can do your homework.
good,"a day at work at the hotel was very stressful. poor management she never had anything ready on time for us we always had to finish rooms late or finish with other workers in order for a customer to be happy."
good,You either make a ton of money by successfully selling in high pressure time close environments or you will quit because youre not making enough money to live off of.  I would say its not far off from being told to walk into a room full of strangers and sell them 20-100k of timeshare.  The people who see that and say I can sell anyone don't last usually.  It's the people who look at the top reps and ask themselves what are they doing to sell these people that end up succeeding.
good,i knew the owners and they were normally friendly easy job simple and fun on occasion. friendly atmosphere and had to be careful with some guests could be dangerouse
good,This position was very unstable due to the housing market decline. Our jobs were eliminated when no one wanted to buy timeshares. Their main focus was to save their homes.
good,"Management during that time was not the best unfortunately. it gets busy and with the events in banquet hall, systems and cc machine are outdated staff of front desk is 50/50 with the genuine friendly and the snob too good to talk kind of attitude. the facility is very nice and remaining staff are wonderful."
good,The Gm is the absolute best. She is very warm and welcoming and very understanding. She is always willing to work with you and your schedule. Some of the staff are not so warm and welcoming but that comes with any job I guess.
good,"Ensure guest satisfactions in the rooms and common areas. Learned how to multi task, take pride in your duties and to work as a team. Workplace was laid back, all employees were nice. The hardest part of the job was high season when you have to flip the hotel for the next reservations coming in."
good,"Reports reports reports, but this was a franchised property and each one runs it differently. overall wyndham is a good company that has an easy to run property management system and lenient standards."
good,"I learned so many things here how to do time cards, audits, receipts and many other things that make me suitable for any job. Love my co-workers......"
good,My personal opinion is you need to have a nestegg stashed away in order to really survive financially. The people are great to work with. Business is steady.
good,"I learn how to balance the hotel"
good,"Temporary positions are approximately 9 months in length with ZERO guarantee of being called back. Regardless of performance or work ethic & accountability - they can simply not call you back for no good reason.  Favoritism & nepotism is a constant issue in the management ranks. Manager was definitely ""hands off"" and most of the time there wasn't even a weekly interaction (not even by phone) let alone on a daily basis. Team members who did not follow the SOP were not sited and therefore no one cared about following the rules."
good,no benifits or health care. Hardest part of job is dealing with difficult people. Management is rude and uncorropertve.
good,"When your VP tells you that you are over paid for your position.  You know it's time to leave. "
good,I worked at this company for 5 years 1 month. I loved the people i worked with. But when the New General Manager came the place went down hill. You get penalized for missing work even if you have doctor notes. Which last time i Knew they were suppose to be excused.
good,fun place to work.  able to meet lotsof people from different walks of life. great management and co-workers.
good,i enjoy meeting new guests and seeing repeating guests return.
good,"I loved this job because it was so close to home. Working for this company you were always busy, esp on the weekend. i hated working there on the weekends."
good,"Interacting with our guests is the most enjoyable part of my day. Helping people with their needs while staying with us is rewarding. Co-workers are congenial but do not have customer service skills. Management is OK, no leadership. The hardest part of my job is working over night."
good,"From the time we open the doors on certain we aer extremely busy trying to get guest set up for their appointments. During all that we are qualifiying guest and declining guest at the same time. We are sometimes looked at through a magnifying glass by the guest, our peers and management."
good,Assist management and sales staff as needed.
good,I started working here When I was 25 and grew up here in life and business. Good times ... Great money !!!
good,"I worked alone, only person in the building my whole shifts."
good,A very good family working environment the work is not hard one of the best supervisor you'll ever meet and safety is the most important factor the tips were very good based on your character I really enjoyed working for Ramada Clarion Raddison Hotels
good,good job just had the midnight shift with no chance to change as the other positions were taken by staff not set on moving on. The work load was consistant as far as the software was concerned but daily was a problem solving task to locate errors or any discrepancies
good,"Depended on the guests who arrived on how many rooms you would have that day. We always greeted the guests with smiles on our faces even :though they could sometimes be rude. Arrivied at 7:45 in the morning every dat Monday through Friday and had Saturdays and Sundays off a  lot easier to spend time with my son during the weekend. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday. Hardest part was to deal with my boss, she was very bossy and practically made me do everything when the head housekeeper wasn't there."
good,"Interesting company to work for , coworkers in area are good combination.  This job I worked at a resort and was lots to do to kerp busy and had alot of fin while doing my job."
good,"Overall a nice place to work. Management was good, co-workers were enjoyable. The environment was laid back and easy going. The work was easy but slow.."
good,"No organization, to many chiefs not enough Indians is a good way to put it."
good,"It was a productive place to work, but management was lacking in several areas.  We never had enough supplies and ended up shopping for our manager  for breakfast & waiting on bedding, because we  were always short. They also did not split up the work duties, fairly evenly, between shifts. The day shift person was responsible for all breakfast set-up and upkeep, as well as, cleaning of the lobby, hallway, windows & all the laundry for the day.  This did not allow you to do your main duty: customer service.  We needed help at laundry & breakfast time, so we could satisfactorily address complaints upon check-out and engage the customer during breakfast, help them get directions to a destination they came to see: and, in general to go out of your way to make this a  pleasant stay, help with luggage or anything the guest may need in order to ensure this is a place they were likely to return to in the near future.  Let's face it: word of mouth goes a long way in the customer service industry."
good,"Beautiful place, 5 pools, excellent restaurants. The view for the tower 6 is amazing, the presidential suites are breadth taking. "
good,"I learned how to run the computer and how to check in people. Employees don't stay long"
good,"got to work early and stayed all day, most hours were made in the summer weekends are a must. I learned to keep my time short in the rooms fast paced work"
good,I like WVO. Its a cool place to work but at this point in my life I need a little more stability in management. I appreciate the opportunity and met some great people but I need to be more challenged.
good,"Great place to work within the hospitality industry. You typically have another co-worker working on the front desk with you, and the company offers a fair wage for the work, as well as employee discounts and rewards."
good,Poor management. Unorganized in a ghetto area of long island city new york. Front desk put to do things that should be done by management themselves. Low on staff.
good,"-checked guests in and out of rooms"
good,Days Hotel was a fun place to work with a good crew working together to achieve a great customer service. Unfortunately I was let go due to low budget.
good,"The management was fair to me."
good,I enjoyed my job tremendously and had a lot of fun but the environment was extremely dramatic and toxic. The company is great but if you try to bring up issues with things against labor laws they wont take you seriously.
good,"steady work, meet various customers from throughout country, a lot of paperwork, open communication with management while at work for any problems a plus"
good,Spent my adult life with this company. Was a manager with promo account for food and beverage per month.Required to shovel much snow in the winter. Appreciate  summers as outside work much more enjoyable.
good,"Wyndham is a decent company to work for.  There are many opportunities for growth and maturity within some teams and departments, which may be frustrating to the seasoned professional coming in such as myself.  Opportunity for growth can also be a challenge, so a potential employee should be careful about which team or operational vertical he or she joins."
good,"Managers are great and employees. they work hard. I clock in make sure they drawer is right not over or under. Talk to employee prier shift to make sure if she had any incidents.Culture is evenly distributed for employees. Customers are mostly one race. I've learned to use the computer system to be extremely careful with money and make sure all money is real.The hardest part is the multitasking for me, also the Pre-Paid sights.Most enjoyable part is knowing I've done the best i could to make customers happy and to make myself proud that i did a good job."
good,I work in Ramada hotel which i guess now is a part of Wyndham vications. My duties were to prepare and coordinate weddings and celebrations in the hotel lounges and help with reservations and governmental reviews. Good place to work but low payments and salaries.
good,Good  company to work with.  Excellent benefits.  My work environment was very pleasant.  The promotional opportunities are great. They promote the work life family balances
good,"Great hours daily."
good,"Strip and clean rooms, fold laundry and organize the laundry room. I learned how to clean rooms to the customers satisfaction. The management and co-workers were okay people. The hardest part was calling in every morning at 7am. The most enjoyable part was a couple co-workers who helped me thought the day by lifting my spirits."
good,"Clean rooms and get ready for guests "
good,"No quality of life in regards to department heads, be prepared to work 12+ hours daily. Senior Management has unrealistic expectations for department managers and associates. The benefits are awesome but you rarely get to use your vacation time because of constant projects.  ."
good,"I enjoyed working at this hotel, although it was difficult to report abuses or difficulties in the workplace because of the hierarchy that existed. This was a much more prevalent problem for people working in housekeeping or catering. We were owned by a private LLC so things were a bit different than simply working for the corporation. I enjoyed very much getting to interact with guests from all over the world and working to make their stay in our city more enjoyable. Not all of my coworkers saw the job this way."
good,Not the best company to work for. Don't get sick working for this company. I learned a lot about the Wyndham and the people that work there.
good,I enjoy the busy work environment the employees are great and the bosses are amazing always open and make you feel important and heard. i love my job but it dosnt stay steady for a single mother to live on so im looking for steady work.
good,"Most of the associates have been there about 4 months or less due to the high turn over; however, if you do make their sales goals you can make a lot of money with very little training.  You do have to be a very aggressive sales rep and get past a lot of nos."
good,Management wasn't very organized and was very unprofessional. I worked midnights as a desk clerk and auditor and met many very interesting people. The work environment was pleasant and fast passed. No room for advancements.
good,I worked swing and graveyard.  The manager lived on site so it was very easy to get help if a situation arose.  My normal shift was swing shift but I eventually trained for graveyard so that I could be the one who trained a new hire for the spot. My manager was worried about letting the original graveyard worker train anyone new.  I balanced my til at the beginning and end of my shift as well as ran reports for the manager and issued payments to vendors. I
good,"Long days with lots of down time, l learned to effectively use my communication skills, management was always very stressed and very  inconsistent. Co-workers were all good people easy to work with, hardest part of job was inconsistent work schedule, best part of the job was a happy client"
good,The largest hotel franchisor in the NY Tri-state area for those commuting within this area.  Job/Work Life balance initiatives continues to be strong.
good,I loved this job but the management was very poor and they seem not to care about employees well being. Also the pay was not good.
good,Very nice place to work great staff and wonderful hours.very nice guest and wonderful work hours. Very nice work space and helpful staff would give this place a five star rating. would recommend working there. Very nice place. five stars. they have a new staff now so I don't know how it is now.
good,"the typical day at work would be working at an event or a theme park engaging conversation with random people who I think may qualify for a timeshare tour. I learned how to be punctual, self motivated and also how to help co workers when they are losing a booking.  My co workers are my team mates, when I'm down, they do their best to bring me back up to par and they expect me to do the same for them.  The hardest part of the job is to identify if a person is qualified or not with out offending them. whats is most enjoyable about the job is working in different locations and interacting with new people everyday."
good,"I was Front Desk Manager so just about everything was under my supervision. Payroll, Collections, Bookkeeping, Typing and Computer entries as well as making sure all the guest were very happy with their stay."
good,You earn every dime that you work for. You truly have to hustle to get paid at this position and it is definitely not for everyone. I did fairly well while working here but it was tough to book tours if you are not mentally and emotionally on your game!
good,"I enjoy working for this company, but I am also working for a company that is privately owned but also under the corporation."
good,"The biggest part of my job is responding to phone calls and emails, (make that money)."
good,"My day started with staff meetings talking about guests success stories and issues that needed to be resolved. What I liked the most about the meetings was the employee recognition, whoever went out of their way to make a guest happy. I would then start going into checked out rooms and strip the dirty linens and towels for the housekeepers and then start inspecting the room for anything that needed my attention. I got a really good eye for detail doing that and honestly I got into that. The rest of the day I worked on the hot tub ph and chlorine levels, landscape and trash cleaning. I took pride im my work. This what I liked doing."
good,Great place to work but a horrible General Manager. Guests constantly complained about how they were treated by the GM.
good,"The people are great to get along with, I was nice working downtown."
good,"nice place to work. great people, guest were happy and we had a lot of guests checking in and checking out from all walks of life. We did alot of church functions and tours."
good,"I currently work the afternoon shift, 2pm-10pm.  I come in and get information from my co-worker, then he/she leaves and I am alone until my relief comes in at the end of my shift.  Sometimes I see management, sometimes I do not.  I get to meet and speak with a lot of different types of people as I try to sell as many rooms as I can in my 8-hour shift.  I am responisble of making sure the lobby stays clean, the guests stay happy, and the paperwork stays up to date.  I applied for this job when I was in college, the free time between guests allowed me time to do my school work."
good,"Typical day is a morning meeeting once aweek, for communicationa between departments, how best to serve the guests more efficiently, also management communication with different levels, also getting along with co-workers in diferent facets of the operation"
good,Vacation dream ownership with exceptional quality and world appeal
good,"Learned a lot from the head chef. Most of my co-workers, however, while talented, didn't really care about what they were doing. Also, the hardest part about working there was knowing that there was no available advancement."
good,Love working with guests and knowing that I am able to help with most problems/needs that arise. One downfall is everyone is not crossed trained for any shift which puts more work on those who are trained for any shift.
good,I greet guests coming into hotel. I answer the phones and take reservations. I do billing and post payments to accounts. I book the banquet rooms. I do data entry. I run reports for the Owner. I manage hotel when the GM is out of state. I love meeting new people all the time.
good,Any normal day can have you working on the strip to the outskirts of Vegas
good,Good place to work and treated fairly most times.  Owner was racist and was hard at times to rent rooms.  He cared more about making money than making guests happy.
good,"workers are nice, have to work outside of building as entrance to rooms are outside, very cold and not a good way to work for the amount paid. Management is good, they are helpful."
good,I enjoyed this job & especially enjoyed meeting different people. I appreciated that my manager picked me to take care of everything while she was in India for 6 weeks. That gave me the opportunity to learn more about the Hotel business.
good,The tour you are assigned can define your mood for the day. Do not judge a book by its cover. There’s challenges everyday but you need to keep calm and stay focused sometimes. Follow the process it works.
good,"Company used to be fun and come with great perks. However, with the complete changeover of management, it feels like a completely different company with different core values. Upper management does not seem to care about its employees and it shows."
good,"I like working here but things aren’t working out with the days I should be getting and my hours.  The management is good, but the repairs to the rooms are good also"
good,Shortly after I decided to leave due to feeling totally unsafe; someone was killed there within a few months. Glad I got out when I did. Reports of forced prostitution and drug use fell on deaf ears.
good,"I get to work grab my phone and keys , open up the patio door and clean up the deck . Afterwards go down to 1st floor and sweep up the debris on the curb then I go back to my phone and wait until a guests has checked out . There I follow up with the room checking to make sure everything is working properly for the following guest."
good,The AGM was very rude and condescending.  He would speak down to employees but want to write them up if they spoke to him in the same manner. The director of sales was excellent and always trying to put money in the hotel. The AGM spoke to guest with pure disrespect in his voice and demeanor.  The AGM would make inappropriate remarks to female guests and think it was funny and acceptable.
good,"Wyndham offers great benefits in all positions. There is a ton of opportunity for education and training to advance your career further with the company. However, management is awful, pay could be better, and many of the clients are extremely rude because they have a lot of money and very entitled attitudes. This can difficult to deal with. While I worked there, I had members call me everything under the sun for any minor problem that had nothing to do with me. But the benefits and opportunity for growth makes it a little easier to deal with the horrible treatment received."
good,I feel there should be more benefits for employees. I love my job in the hospitality industry but the lack of benefits is whats the problem we need insurance paid vacations and such
good,Learned a lot from working in a hotel. Always something to do. Lots of interesting guests. My manager was always good at managing the hotel. They liked a lot of the suggestions I brought up for repairs and or improvement. The hardest part of it was heavy lifting because I'm not that strong in my arms but my legs were strong. My favorite part of this job was being able to be outside and help with keeping the property looking great.
good,This was an ok place to work. You meet a lot of different people and get to help them out. Mangers were nice and easy to work with. It was a different pace of job for me.
good,"That job wasn't the best, however, I think the specific location I worked at was not reflective of Wyndham as a whole. This place was specifically the Lynchburg Super 8 and the owner ran it horribly. There was rarely more than one Front Desk clerk on staff at a time, so if someone called out, the person before them had a 16 hour shift. The front desk took up housecleaning duties because they were the only employees in the building from 4:30PM-8:30PM. Not that that was ever beneath me or anything it's just that it took time away from the customers and I would check customers in and out after coming out of a back room sweaty because I'm folding sheets next to a hot dryer in business casual clothes."
good,I learned a lot while at Wyndham they  helped me out a lot .but as far as the Management goes they need to step it up. and the employees really do there best at making the resort look brand new.
good,Everything good but limited opportunity for advancement. Most of my colleagues have been stuck at with the same position for 5 plus years. Definitely not a place to go if you want to grow. A perfect place to be comfortable.
good,Company has great benefits from the date of hire and you can move up within if you don't find stepping on toes and are sales oriented. Certain teams lack communication and they have a high turn over rate. If you want long term I recommend the corporate side of it like reservations.
good,This is a difficult job for most as you must be constantly attentive to the needs of your guests while maintaining all daily duties. You must be patient and understand that there must be a balance between guest satisfaction and daily duties.
good,"Great place to work, but the culture is changing because the company is splitting in two.  It seems to be heading in a very cut throat manner. The new leadership team is fond of low pay and regular rounds of lay offs.  Beware!"
good,I enjoyed working for Wyndham. There were only a handful of positions that I could move up to so it was necessary for me to leave in order to advance. Overall a great company to work for
good,Very nice place to work.  Some days are hectic and some are not. with the professionalism and expertise of the staff things are handled quickly and with a smile.  My most enjoyable part of working there was my guest. Always aim to please my guest.
good,Annual party gives the staff a sense of appreciation.  Also the ability to utilize any facility owned by the company and get a discount is a plus.  The staff feel a sense of purpose.
good,"Fun fast paced environment. Manager was an awesome woman. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful, so was manager. If something needed fixed, maintenance was right there to fix it."
good,They wanted us to work fulltime hours but the pay was not a livable wage. Security there was not good because the cameras didn't work half the time. I learned here how to work with customers and satisfy their needs. Management was kind and tried to provide for its employees unfortunately due to lack of sales person we did not stay very busy. The hardest part of the job was trying to find stuff to do because we had minimal customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with regular guests.
good,"Housekeeping is a great job, it is not as easy as one would think. You have to work hard and be on a steady pace. The hardest part of housekeeping is carrying all the linen back and fourth and or up and down stairs. the most enjoyable part about housekeeping is being able to work alone."
good,"Fun place to work with lots of great employees. Lots of places to learn and grow. Learned a lot about the PMS SynXis, learned money management and finances."
good,"We do not get paid overtime for the hours we put in. I work a little in ever department and am not compensated for that. I deal with staff issues as well as guest issues, I try to make sure supplies is kept up, but I only deal directly with vendors that visit site. Manager on duty deals with outside vendors, bills and payments as well as reservation issues with expedia, hotel.com etc."
good,"hard place to work because the new owner don't want mohave a budget to perform all the repairs that place need, over all before the new owner was a good place to work"
good,Well established honest peopleGood working conditions a nice paced Job a typical day was always enjoyable the pay scale was decent and always on time plus well represented
good,Wyndham is a great company to work for however the management of some departments leave a lot to be desired of.  To advance is more of who you  know and not what skills you possess.
good,I worked as an Internal Auditor for SOX Compliance. This was the 2nd SOX audit I performed for Windham.  My manager was very nice and very supportive and we had a successful audit.
good,"a typical day at work started with getting my work assignment by  floors  assigned to me. learned various different skills on how to properly clean rooms and use various cleaning supplies and chemical. in regards to house keeping. "
good,"Lots of potential, but cutthroat business. Good opportunity for someone with a lot of brass to them. Supreme self-confidence a must.Relentlessly positivity required."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Wyndham very much."
good,"The workplace was comfortable and welcoming. On a daily basis I got to interact with many different types of people, which I loved.  The management could have been better."
good,"In my time with the Ramada Inn was short lived it was a great learning experience.  I was hired as a guest service agent and shortly after that I was promoted to Front Desk Supervisor for my experience.  I also did Sales and Catering when the sales manager left since I had some experience working in sales and catering.  I was in charges of scheduling, managing the front desk/audit staff, routing all special reservations plus advance deposits, receiving e-mails on group rooming lists, covering for any and all call outs, and taking care of any IT situations that may or may not come up."
good,"Best part of working was to the interaction with the customers.  The management of the company was organized.  The best part of working here was that, everyone worked in a professional manner."
good,customer concerning company. customer detail oriented. Taught me great customer skills. Hardest part of the job was communicating with others.
good,"the best part about the job is the hours. a typical workday runs from 8 a.m. until early afternoon, normally around 2 p.m. If you cannot take the strain of a commission based sales job, then this position is not for you. Must be highly likable and a people person."
good,"I loved the work, I enjoyed going in everyday in a suit. My only real complaint about the particular hotel I worked at, was the Management. The were biased and inexperienced."
good,"It is a great company to work for, but if you aren't interested in working for the hospitality industry then it's not the place to start off a career. Growth is very slim."
good,"Positive working environment, all co-workers were friendly and outgoing. Fun to work with. the hardest part of the job was that I had to resign because I had a job opportunity at the Rescue Mission."
good,"My supervisor was very friendly. Instructions that were given were always clear. Also, customers were usually very nice, which made working there enjoyable."
good,I had an amazing work experience at Super 8 even though my job was kind of stressful at times. But overall it's a fun place to work at. I'd definitely work at a Super 8 again.
good,A typical day at work would be making sure all the rooms got cleaned and up to code for the guests to check into. its not always easy because cleaning these rooms isnt like cleaning your bedroom everything has to be perfect so depending on the room it self it could take at least a half hour. I learned not everyone is gonna be happy in that enviroment because that job is hard but since i experienced alot of different things in housekeeping i would always try to help people if i had the time but i always had a job of my own to do. The hardest part of the job was when you would get people not doing their job correctly and you would ask them continously and your hands were tied it felt like you was being laughed at. I enjoyed my job because i could get time to myself if i needed it to just breathe because when your cleaning or checking the room it does take time.
good,"great place for part time work "
good,"Setting up tables, Chairs, Vacuuming, sound equipment how to hook up microphones and sound level. good management pleasing the banquet people."
good,"Fun work environment with pleasant co-workers. Meeting new people every day, as well as greeting returning guests into the hotel. Was able to learn to remain calm, not to panic or not get frustrated when things got a little tough or busy. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the numerous relationships I made with the guests."
good,A tourist based position that requires greeting vacationers makes it a fast paced job at the height of the tourist season. Great way to meet people. Hardest part of the job is being persuasive.
good,"Had the mid shift or night shift. Management was very helpful when help was needed. Learned many things about customer service. Co-workers were very team oriented. Checking in the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job, it kept me very busy."
good,"working for Days Inn is good for my books.  Everyone gets along great like a second family, good environment. The only thing I do not like is the hourly pay and no benefits."
good,Generally a fun place to work.  Only drawback was the hotel was the only hotel on the airport strip to accept cash at night.  We had a lot of undesirables and no security.  Too often worked alone at night.  With some troubling incidences I came to believe my life was in danger and so decided to leave before something bad happened.  GM was not very understanding of the risks involved in this type of work.
good,Wyndham is a typical company that provides Sales opportunities on a commission basis. The commission structure is comparable with other sales positions after the first 60 days of employment. There is a training program for new and returning sales professionals. I did not receive much formal training in the position that I held except when released to actually work in the department. Management on the n ext level was very competent and directed me extremely well in  all aspects of my job. Management on higher levels did not seem to me to be very interested in what or how I was doing or with my specific program since it did not relate to any sales that were significant to the overall productivity base of the company or site at the time. Any sales of a future possibility were seen as non important enough to warrant discussion or care. Changes in the program were promulgated at the last minute with no interest by upper management in securing success for the sales representatives in the department.
good,"I would sign customers in and out of rooms, file paperwork, make reservations, and do simple cleaning. I learned how to book reservations and answer a multi'line phone system. My management was always great as were my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with dificult customers and resolving problems in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy and hearing that they were satisfied with their stay with us."
good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a phenomenal company to work for with great benefits. I have learned so many new sales techniques which I will continue to apply to my future careers. My co-workers are the best, team work to me is everything! Of course the hardest part of my career is the overall stress one has to maintain goals, but if you set your mind to it one can achieve anything! I love my work environment, especially when your managers and co-workers are like family!"
good,"General Manager very respectful, nice, easy going. Unorganized and far too passive when employees are not performing tasks required."
good,I enjoyed 6 years of working for Wyndham Vacation Resorts and continuously grew in salary and commissions. I was able to network with some of the best salespeople in the timeshare industry and learn all the tools of the trade to be successful.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"Fast paced contract driven paper management environment. Management style at 10,000 ft. level."
good,"Overall good job, limited benefits, with long hours. Had a lot of payroll problems when it came to overtime and bonuses."
good,Typical day was productive. management was understanding.
good,"Most days were very busy. Rooms had to be cleaned in a timely manner."
good,"busy work"
good,The Ramada inn was a good place to work we cleaned rooms. the people were real nice and respectful.
good,Working for this company has been great and I have learned new things and have also met some great people while wrking with the public
good,"Very well managed operation. The owners were very helpful, great training, and very nice people to be around."
good,"everyone gets along "
good,A day working at days in was very quiet and solo. one cleaning was assigned to 10-20 rooms depending on the vacancy. I learned a lot of organization and neatness here. The management was very stern and made sure everything was finished properly. The co- workers were nice but we as workers didn't socialize to much for we were always on separate rooms. The hardest part of this job was just making sure the rooms were cleaned to customers satisfaction. the most enjoyable part was getting free breakfast in the mornings.
good,"I started at around 4 in the afternoon and my shift ended at midnight, I would start by counting the cash in the register."
good,I enjoy meeting different people all over the world.  The hardest part of this job is not being with my family at night.  A lot of the nights I work I do not leave til 1 am to 2am in the morning   
good,We worked hard everyday.I learned how to cut chicken a special way and work at a pace.Management was good my co-workers were fun to be around.I was hard to be on the fast lines and keep your knives sharpened.
good,There is room for improvement but you feel a great sense of teamwork.
good,Schedule was fully understandable with also being very flexible. Communication was very important.
good,"A typical day consists of guest registration and check -in and/or check out. It is an administrative position so there is a lot of office tasks faxing, filing, etc. Management was flexible and understanding"
good,I have learned how to do my job the most proficient way. I enjoy working with the other members of staff.
good,I worked as a housekeeper for 1 yr. Then I became the supervisor of housekeeping. Always making sure the girls was doing there rooms perfect. I enjoyed the girls that worked there. They came in on days off. It was a fun place to work.
good,A typical work day would be the lunch rush we have around twelve o clock. being able to have a fast but steady pace and still able to promote great customer service. I've learned is that i have become great in customer service and maintaining excellence and being able to work with a great team of coworkers and managers. I could'nt say their was a hard part i enjoyed working their.
good,"Enjoyed working with all the employee's ,Everyone is hard working and cares about the job they do."
good,"Before the company restructured in 2010 the Service Desk used to be in Orlando, Florida. We worked for WVO before the restructuring. There were 14 of us before that time."
good,"great experience, had alot of opportunity and life experiences there, staff friendly"
good,"It was a fun place to work, the opportunity to make a reasonable amount of money but the management staff were young and needed more experience and versatility"
good,The work environment was great. Loved my co-workers! The teamwork was some of the best i've seen. Only drawback was a high turnover rate.
good,They are not organization!! They are into every one business instead of finishing there work. They have no management team to push everything into place. It hard when there no team in the workplace.
good,"Well I’ll start by thanking wyndham for the growth opportunity, I actually enjoyed my time with the company. However they aren’t very flexible schedule wise 2-10 during the week and 9-6 on Saturdays .... however the pay is what you make it with 12.00 base pay plus great comp plan as a reservations coordinator. Overall the company and people care about you . I recommend it for those who have tough skin."
good,It was the first time I ever worked in the hotel/motel industry. It wasnt that bad of an experience but they did like to work you to the bone. Had lots of overtime when employed there.
good,"The people are good to work with, just do what you are supposed to do and you‘ll be fine. The owners recently bought the hotel so I didn’t know them that well."
good,"Decent place to work long hours compensation is low, management is excellent, helping customers to have excellent stay is unique. Meet all types of people"
good,Great learning experience and seem to care about the teams under all their brands. Fun hospitable always looking for new way to do it better. Can do attitude yet here for you.
good,The management at the downtown battle creek mi Baymont inn and suites hotel is horrible. They are foreign owners who do not speak very good English and they continue to put their family and friends on front desk. The customers constantly complain about the language barrier.
good,"You come in, clock in and maintain that happy persona. you will have fairly easy to deal with guess most of the time, if you are overbooked or anything like that happens, you do your best to diffuse the situation. then clock out,"
good,Professional and reliable. Has an easy way to booking online and the Wyndham points reward program is very satisfying and everyone can win free nights stay and many others advantages.
good,"it was fun and easy, meeting all sorts of people, had to be fast and understanding. guest came first above all things. easy to run thing in the front desk area."
good,"I work full time, but I work under a franchise so I don't know much about getting benefits or anything - but I do know you get discounts for other Wyndham hotels, so I guess that's nice. "
good,I enjoy the environment at Super 8. My boss is awesome at making sure employees know what is expected of us. Watching the property grow more prestigious has been most exciting.
good,"Love the owners and managers, hotel is clean and safe to work at. Duties are clear cut. Comp program easy to learn and navigate through. Just wish compensation was more."
good,"The job was the best job I had, take customer service calls, document customers calls and take reservations for hotels. Fun work place, made many friends, Management was workable with about everything."
good,"The benefit package at Wyndham Destinations is great,"
good,"I enjoy the job itself, as I enjoy dealing with the guest. Most of the time a very easy job, but there is times things get very stressful. I feel that with some of the stress to deal with pay is not good."
good,"Lots of room for advancement, depending on the management.  I worked NA so I was on a 10pm-6am schedule.  Any management changed a few times in almost 2 years.  Still, great managers from what I experienced."
good,"Owner was awesome. Management was ok for management you need to be awesome not ok. Signing up on wyndham rewards, always a reminder never bonuses....."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but the lack of benefits or vacation was not something I can do with out. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning new things but it is time to move forward."
good,"The training a wyndham is top notch, even if you don't stay at the company they provide you with a skill set that you can use anywhere. Very interactive and personal career, if you don't like speaking to people this is not the job for you. Management and your trainers are there to guide you along the way to success."
good,"They are a solid company with strong processes. Sales just was not something I enjoyed. They were very thorough in their training, and made sure you knew what you were doing before hitting the sales floor."
good,"Wyndham really goes out of its way to make it's employees feel comfortable.  The discounts are generous and they are communicate them to the employees well.  They sponsor different events for the employees and their families, like bring your kids to work days and Halloween trick or treating.  They give turkeys for Thanksgiving and other gifts for Christmas.  "
good,If Wyndham had a competitive hourly rate it would make working here that much better. But who can really live off a $300-$400 a week pay check. This is what you get paid IF you don’t have your license. Need a real estate license to get max payout on any sales you make.
good,"Great place to work. Management was excellent, Work was easy and laid back. There isn't really anything that is hard about the job. They care a lot about their employees."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Wyndham Destinations. It was a great environment to work in and the company was very supportive of the employees and their work/life balance.
good,"A typical day of work would be to come on shift and do Check Ins or Check Outs and the get started on the Night Audit.   I learned Computer Skills, Outlook, etc.  The Management was great, very professional.  The Culture was fine too.   The hardest part of the job was the hours of work, nights can be very hard on the body and not easy if having to get up during the day for an Appointment or something.  The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with and the Guests I met staying in the Hotel."
good,This company is young and dynamic want to grow fast but often losse the balance between owners relationship and end up had to gave up the management rights.
good,I lovvvve meeting people. I lovvve that they chose my city and hotel to stay in and I do everything within my power to make sure that this is not their last visit. Genuine Southern Hospitality does it everytime!! I throughly enjoys my job.
good,"It was a decent place to work. you learn to become a team player there or you will find it sometimes hard to do your work well. It can become very frustrating at times. You must have patience, temperance and the ability to know how to speak to others. Employees or clients."
good,"Typically, as a contractor, you help keep your working space and sales center clean and organized."
good,Good company.  Constantly being sold and bought by different companies.  I worked at a francize that is no longer in this area.  Enjoyed the sales and customer service part of the job.
good,"High impact sales environment helping families guarantee vacations for the rest of their lives with the largest provider of hotels, condos, cabins, etc. worldwide. Early start to the day and typically busy mornings taking vacation goers through a two hour sales presentation. Motivation is the key to keep the right mindset because this position is 100% commission. Learn basic to advanced sales techniques to increase the size of your paycheck. If you have the right attitude, willingness to learn and get uncomfortable you will have the chance to thrive in this environment."
good,"While most places you work tend to feel like a dog eat dog environment, this site truly promotes working with your team to deliver results. If you do not work well with others you can still have success but not as likely."
good,"This is a great job if you're still going to school, its slow so you have time to do other things.  The manger I had in 2009 was amazing, she made the atmosphere very enjoyable."
good,"Wingate by Wyndham Edmonton is a hotel offering business amenities, family friendly suites, services, and facilities ideal for any length of stay for business, vacation or weekend getaways."
good,I had a bad experience with a new manager who was hired.  He took something that was left for me by a guest and then lied to me when i ask him about it.  He told me he did not know what i was talking about and I showed him the proof i found.  He still played as if he didn't know what i was talking about!  I had to leave because i could not work for a dishonest manager and be responsible for money he had access to.
good,Hours changed frequently and was difficult to plan ahead with children. Some availability to work from home or in office setting. Very fast paced phone calls. Must have excellent people skills.
good,"Fast paced good employees, discounts, any work related issues were taken up with a boss or whoever in charge and the issues were fixed. Also had access to the gym pool and hottub"
good,It was very relaxed and flexible. The Manager was down the earth and as long as we got our job done he let us go. There was also over time that was offered.
good,"Basic call center, Can be great money. The pay will sometimes change suddenly. Its cut throat, Can be fun and fast paced, Can advance easily. Discounts"
good,"I currently work for the location in Statesboro, Ga. I LOVED MY JOB THERE! However after years of working there and no advancement to any higher level, I resigned. I could not live off of a $8.50 an hr. salary with no raise, or chance of advancement after 5 long years of working there."
good,"my review on the job at ramada was hard working, it gave you challenges in cleaning but yet it was exciting. the co workers were sweet with a lot of personality. if I were to redo that job again I would."
good,"Management lacked work etiquette"
good,"When I worked there , there was a girl that had the shift after me and there were several times that she didn't show up and didn't even call and I would have to work a double shift with no notice and they wouldn't say anything to her. If it would been me they wouldve fired me."
good,I mainly worked the morning shift on weekend which consisted of 12 hour shifts.  I would sent out breakfast and I cleaned the lobby.  During the week I worked the evening shift which allowed plenty of time to do homework.  The hardest part of the job was knowing that their was no room for advancement.
good,"Wyndham Ramada Inn was a great work place until the work hours went from 40 hours  week to  6 hours week, is due to management changing so frequently."
good,Really calm and easy job. Staff is amazing and always there to help you. Compensation sucked though barely making minimum wage when worked overnight but good job.
good,Days inn is a well managed work place. The rooms are kept clean on a daily basis. There is a friendliness in the air and the service is great. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Recently remodeled also.
good,"I worked 2nd shift for about 3 1/2yrs. And worked by myself MOST of the time. Unless we expecting a huge crowd. I was paid minimum  wage but never had weekends off and never got a raise. But I was the ONLY one they had at the time who would either stay longer, come in on off days OR come earlier if asked.."
good,Worked weekends at front desk alone which were extremely busy. Accommodated guess from all over the United States and many different parts of the world.
good,If your a good salesman you can earn a decent living here. However the quality of people that they hire here is not that good and they can be negative.
good,There is no other job you can make this kind of money. But you have to be very good and persistent. Some people are making 20k a month. If you are a shark and have talent to sell you will make a lot of money. It takes a while to get used to.
good,"was ok but not the best the management was fine but the staff was horrible, hard to work with and unprofessional. lack of pay and lack of respect from manger"
good,The job is hard work and likable dependent on who you may be working under. Going above and beyond and going unnoticed can cease motivation. I enjoyed the free lunch.
good,Working at a Wyndham property helped me grow as a person and as a professional... I learned how to resolve problems and work with a fun group of individuals.  The employee discounts are also great!
good,"It was a pleasure to work for a Wyndham partner property. I received full time hours that I asked for, and received overtime when the property was understaffed."
good,relaxed place to work. management was very acommadating and friendly. I enjoyed working with the public. and learning about all the exciting places they were from
good,High Call Volume with minimal time to complete each call.  Great lunch room with fitness center on site.  Plenty of parking on site.  Co workers were friendly.
good,"It was fun to yell TO and have our peeps closed hard..."
good,"While this wasn't the best hotel in town, it was really relaxed and easy to work at, could pretty much do what you wanted as long as you showed up and took care of guests. The owners took exception when 4 out of the 5 employees evacuated for the hurricane, instead of making any plans for the evacuation they punished those who left upon return by cutting hours significantly and demoting me from manager."
good,"Maintained condo units within the five buildings at the resort: including the floors, walls, ceilings, outlet, AC, garbage disposals and appliances.  Was directed on work orders via walkie talkies"
good,Fun place to work. Team approach to making the sale was new to me and very productive. The training was very good with a lot of topics covered. Loved the sales presentation training .
good,Loved my job there. The only reason I left was it became very under staffed and was working 12 he days. I never had a family life or day off. It was a fun place to work. And some of the guest were like family. Hard work but the pay wage is very low for the time put in.
good,If you love to meet ppl and can sell snow to a snowman do this. You'll excel. it's not a scam. What's turns ppl off about this job is the inability to get out of their shell.
good,"I have a lot at the company as I have learn on my own mistakes and "
good,"Wyndham is a great company with gorgeous resorts. If you are surrounded by the right leadership and support, it’s a dream career. If not, it will be a very rough experience."
good,not the best place to work at. owners are not the nicest and pay is garbage. Guests were always the plus side of my day. Carpet needs redone extremely bad
good,I worked for Wyndham Hotel back in the 90's. I started off as a housekeeper and advanced to a housekeeping supervisor. After a while I then made housekeeping manager.
good,"Set up breakfast, greet guests, clean common areas, take down breakfast, do dishes. Hardest part of job was having to be there so early. Most enjoyable was meeting people."
good,"stocking "
good,I loved working with everyone and the pay was ok... I could've been way better. I didn't agree with the draw. It should've been a salary or commission whichever is greater.
good,This job was fairly easy for me being that I had housekeeping experience. The people were nice and I was able to pull extra hours as needed. My supervisor was very understanding to my every need.
good,"Working with all types of customers on a one on one basis. Upgrading current owners and selling new non-owner accounts. Greeting customers, then walking them through the sales process while providing great customer service. Helping other sales reps close new and current customers. Top sales rep several months while excelling to senior sales rep, Mentorship program, presenter, while on pace to reach their highest sales award"
good,"This was a fast paced work place most of the time. Night Audit was kind of a quite lonely job. Until morning. "
good,"Wyndham is a fun place to work. It is always busy and there is an opportunity to earn a substantial income, depending on your sales skills. The hardest part of the job is during the winter months it can be slow, which leads to a significant drop in one's income. However, the job could be enjoyable for the most part, being that individuals are meeting a lot of people and also have the ability to enjoy staying and some of the resorts they are selling."
good,Company offers great benefits and is a great place to work with tremendous growth and learning opportunities. Requires hard work and invests in their employees.
good,"The coworkers made the sometimes hectic times bearable! The laundry duties took away time that could have made customer service more effective. The staff and management all worked together to accomplish goals which made everyone's guest experience there great. They had fantastic customer reviews because we were encouraged to be friendly, yet professional."
good,Mangers and co-workers were very helpful in trying to help reps succeed. Commission only after the first 3 months so as a rep you need to learn the product and how to sell it.
good,It's an amazing company to work for. It's going thru a transformation phase after the company split off from the parent company. The profits are declining hence lots of cost cutting is happening at this time. Overall a good place to work
good,"Resort Quest is a great company to work for.  My location in Miamar"
good,"awesome pay, great, fun place full of energy. However, they are very bad with time management. Company definitely cares about their employees, especially the ones that produce!"
good,I did not work with Wyndham Vacation but i did work with Wyndham Hotels.  I felt supported and empowered.  The hospitality industry is a close knit team of people working together to achieve a goal.
good,"I mean, its a resort town!! Job instability - many associates worried about the future of the organization. Reasonably so! Many managers laid off two years in a row."
good,It was a relaxed hotel environment with some stressful moments but otherwise the workload was good. there isnt much more to say so I'll leave it to that to hit the mark
good,"I loved working for them, work was easy and fair. Managers were very helpful and profeesional.. They try to keep all rooms and work fair. Employees were nice and worked together"
good,"I was a front desk receptionist, Great customers, Fun environment, great people to work with, Set schedules for shifts, work place was great, slow paced"
good,The company is a strong company to work for. However being a franchise expectations were not met. It was like working for two companies as one with contradictory rules.
good,"I did not work for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. I worked for an individually owned Wyndham Garden Hotel in Harrisburg, Pa. The hotel closed in 2016, seven years after I left."
good,"As a hospitality company, Wyndham employees were friendly and helpful. The pay is low, and advancement can be difficult. My managers were outwardly helpful and concerned but self-centered and uncaring inside."
good,"It started off good as me being the person getting the breakfast area setup and sweeping and mopping the floors. Then one day teh housekeepers needed help, so when i got done with my job i helped them. So far it was okay until they pushed the manager to leave. It was TERRIBLE after she left. We needed things, they had bedbugs, the house keeper was hiring people and trying to fire. She cut everybody hours except the ones the liked, and that went for front desk to."
good,"Helping find people their vacation dreams and helping them book their future reservations. Also handling deposits of owned weeks when owners did not want to travel back to their home resort."
good,"this is a good company to work for overall, they treat their staff with respect. they are honest. the pay and benefits are good, there is really not much that I can say bad about this company."
good,The owners were cheap which created multiple problems for staff and the general manager. There's no real training so it's hard to get good at your job. General manager was great and was a great boss.
good,Its a very fun place to work and the other employees are all great to work with.  There are lots of perks with employee discounts and free travel in some countries.
good,Friendly environment and great property owners. The area is pretty rough though. If not for the outside area would be a great place to work. Building was built in 2001.
good,It was an interesting job that taught me a lot and met a lot of good people. My manager was very stressing and not pleasant to people making it uncomfortable for me but he was caught embezzling.
good,"A typical day looks like :"
good,"Unfortunately, pay isn't the greatest here and being eligible for benefits takes WAY to long in my opinion. Never the less, you never have to pay for any of the uniforms etc and management (at least at the Seaside location) is SUPER good to their workers. "
good,This was just a part time job right out of college. I dont have anything too valuable to say. It was a front desk job at a motel. Helped guests check in and check out. that was it
good,Wyndham Vacation Ownership is an awesome place to work. Its an honor if you get the chance to work here. They many different areas to work and so you get a nice opportunity to learn different departments
good,Average motel. Staff friendly. No place for advancement. Minimum pay. Fast paced. Have to wait 3 business days after payment scheduled and it does not include weekends and holidays so sometimes you have to wait longer than 3 days for payment.
good,"Corporate offices are nice, great location and festive work place.  The associates are very friendly and everyone is passionate to help.  The leaders are very open and transparent."
good,I enjoyed my time working for wyndham. The job was easy enough and not to stressful. They provided good training and the staff was great. Not to mention the discount on hotels was great.
good,Wyndham Worldwide offers progressive training and infinate opportunity for financial growth. For any sales/ management professional with desire to I would highly recommend.
good,"The hours were not working for me after some changes.  Loved the people I worked with.  Team environment."
good,"I enjoyed working at RCI it was very fun and I met a lot of cool people. I would like to work part time, but they don't have any openings for that currently so I am at a lost."
good,"Management was very caring of its employees.  Was able to learn many computer programs, and even cross train for many positions."
good,"it was a privately owned but ruled by wyndham hotel. i didnt have enough hours, no benefits, and it was a very unsafe job. i was harrassed by all types of guest gthe crime around the hotel was horrible."
good,"Property Sales Manager at Baymont Inns & Suites. Convened with the General Manager to organize, schedule, and attend various public relations events, business fairs, and community activities. Performed multiple tasks as part of Front Desk Customer Service Representative. Trained in all aspects of hotel operations in order to better represent hotel/chain-specific attributes."
good,"Great co-workers. Good benefits, Lots of variations in day to day work.  Complex IT environment. pay is adequate for job being preformed. good travel opportunities."
good,This job is similar to the job I currently work at now. Basically I had to make sure my area is up kept and I have to make sure all my duties and requirements are met.
good,I was working for levy during the 91st pga tour at Chanhassen i was lucky enough to work with different cheffs from all across the country and cook for the professional golfers
good,I feel comfortably working at this resort. Great staff but the turnover rate and restrictions are very high. Overall this a great workplace.
good,It's a good part time job if that's what you're looking for. Management is really friendly. Co-workers are generally nice. It's a very upbeat positive work place.
good,Wyndham can be a family company.  Great colleagues and some opportunities to train and develop and a positive approach by most associates. Pay structure can be developed to better fit the employees.  Communication from top can be slow but overall a good company.
good,"This job taught me to interact with people."
good,"Look at functions for that day ,have meetings with cooks discuss with each cook what needs to been done delegate what needs to been,Meet with the catering director to go over set ups for the function.Do a line check ,check with restaurant manager to see if anything needs to be done a customers are happy. Do any orders for that day .Make sure all food is rotated and labeled . One hard thing is doing four major parties at one time .The enjoyable part is when everything goes well and the clients send an email to the GM HOW WONDERFUL thing were. Here is something that I want to say I moved to NC after almost working there for two years.while I was on vacation in tulsa my GM wanted me back at the hotel .So now I have been working there for over three years."
good,Gave associates all the leverage. I loved working at Worldmark by Wyndham and loved working with the associates. I think WorldMark Nevada RVP is cold and calculating.
good,I loved working nights at my job. I enjoyed cleaning and making every thing ready for the next day. there was always something to do which I enjoyed.
good,"An average days work was enjoyable in the Ramada. I got on very well with my co-workers I had great pleasure working with them. I would get to work and be greeted by my co-workers we all got on and had a laugh, we were also very professional when it come to the customers. I mostly enjoyed being busy at work as it made my time go faster and wouldn't get bored. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers who could be rude at times, but i always dealt with them in a polite manner."
good,"This company has literally given me the opportunity to grow. The culture is that of a family. You're treated as an adult and held accountable as such. Not only is Wyndham a great corporation to work for, it does an amazing job giving back to the community."
good,Responsible for checking guests in and out. Taking payments for posted reservation charges. Executing weekly unit inspections and communicating any safety hazards to dispatch and maintenance. Completing and totaling up all daily charges for night audit.
good,"UNDER STAFFED, over worked, not a classy environment.  Not thrilled with the work load or environment.  Current management is not on point."
good,"This job is one that will leave you drained at the end of the day. A higher standard of professionalism is needed but if other needs aren't met that are out of your control, you will receive the harsh end of things. You act as the face of the business and all complaints mostly are vented towards the front desk staff (even when it is not your fault)."
good,Great job if you didn't mind the overnights. It just wasn't for me anymore and I went back to school. The only complaint I have was the guest. There were some nice ones but they were too far in between. Most people at the times of 11pm-3am are not the most cooperative. As far as coworkers they were great!
good,"Days Inn was a wonderful place to work for, always busy but not too overwhelming, the rooms are all pretty decent so we never had too many complaints. small town, tons of regulars that enjoy seeing you time and time again"
good,......meeting new guest i have learned to be more of a ppl person.management was okay and my co works work as a team always there was nothing hard about the job
good,"I work with a great team. Management has an open door policy if the associates need anything or have any concerns. A typical day at work is mainly checking in guests and making sure they have everything they need. The most enjoyable thing about the position is helping and communicating with the guest. I have definitely learned to be very fast, efficient and organized. The hardest part of the job is when I am unable to help a guest."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, I enjoyed what I did. I needed more pay. The most enjoyable part about my job was getting to meet people from all over the world."
good,"The motel is a clean and well kept.  I was given a great deal of Independence and freedom during my night shift.  The staff was friendly and helpful. However, there was lack of training."
good,"Enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,"Great company benefits, flexible hours, very busy but rewarding."
good,"I loved working for Wyndham! It was an awesome company that made you feel like you were really doing good, helping people achieve their dream of vacationing in style all over the world! Depending on what department you're in the stress level to perform can get intense at times, to meet your numbers. I love most of my co-workers and managers. It was a fun place to work!"
good,"Worked 12 hours most days, managing motel and running restaurant."
good,"Never had a slow day, there was always plenty to be done and keep busy with.  Appreciated the hours, nothing i hate more then a job with a lot of standing around."
good,"sweep, scrub, mop "
good,"management, not so much.  i would image a management change will take place soon.  2 weeks paid training. they don't pay for your license. poor tour quality. top reps got fed"
good,"colleagues and management is cooperative and supportive."
good,"I enjoy working here however, I'm looking to further in my career! I look forward to starting a new career at a company that is fast paced, learning and growth potential and I loo forward to getting a start on life!"
good,"the place isn't managed great, they have one staff on to look after reception aswell as clean a lot of rooms, the place is run down we have loads of rooms that have things wrong with the place and they wont pay to have it fixed which leaves unhappy guests. the place needs a whole refurb and new caring management"
good,"Fun FUN, FUN was my take a  way from Wyndham."
good,"The job itself is amazing and I was able to meet and experience all sorts of guest from all over the world.  I only ever had one problem and that was that the managers always seemed all over the place.  It wasn't that they were bad at their jobs, but they just had no focus on an overall goal."
good,"work hard, and have fun,smile. good management,co-workers, we work togather,and help each other when behind their work, if ther is no break. like to be at work keep busy,and quest are friendly."
good,"Since I live in this company, my daily work is very light. As I woke up, I'll just go on employees entrance to time in for my duty. As a housekeeper, I clean 10 rooms a day. Make beds, clean bathrooms, change towels, etc. My workmates was easy to deal along with. Our relationship was like a big family. Hardest part of the job was adjusting in cleaning rooms and carrying the linens. And most enjoyable part of this job are getting unexpected tips from the guest."
good,"Customer service is a must, no matter how far you have to take it you need to make sure all parties in the situation is some what satisfied. If the conclussion is a compramise then thats where you take it. Being energetic is a must, positiveity and being able to hold a conversation with complete strangers."
good,"Very chill environment, but has an aspect of professionalism. Amazing property and very nice people. The advancement of the growth is limited."
good,co workers were great! The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the customers. not all about the money! great work hours learned alot
good,"House Keeper"
good,Very interactive and busy company but always has it focus on the individual employees. Many different departments but all work together to provide an excellent stay experience for all guests that stay at the resorts and those who view the property.

good,"I like working in a postion to where my skills are motivated. I just loved the othre house keepers, we made a great team we worked hard, and helped each other every chance we could"
good,Great company to work for until it changed hands and then it was just a matter of time. The hotel went through 2 years of recovering to where it was under the new management.
good,"Although the jobs I had were very basic compared to other more experienced employees, I was never treated as lesser than. Everyone was very friendly and inviting."
good,"Nothing to do with Wyndham in particular, but sometime your crew can easily mess your company's reputation based on how they treat employees. During the 5 years working with the company, this is how a typical day usually look to me:"
good,"The Ramada Plaza Hotel embraced me with open arms. It gave me the opportunities to learn, grow, and test my knowledge. I was able to embark in the Management position and develop this skill even more while being able to actively be a part of the hotel's operations and decision processes."
good,Very nice work environment with friendly people to work with. Conversing with guests in the beach atmosphere is enjoyable. I disliked the biased management.
good,"At this position you are never bored, you work lot of hours, you do lots of things, but get a good opportunity to learn lots of things as well."
good,The variety of people that I am able to interact with here is amazing.  I love hearing the stories about where they come from or where they are going.
good,"My job description requires me to interact with current time share owners and assist them in scheduling vacations at Wyndham properties.I have learned volumes of information regarding the hospitality industry. I find management very accommodating to employees. Most of my co-workers are much younger than me. They keep me young."

good,I got more knowledge dealing with customer I am enjoying my job as a security officer but I need to more salary to satisfy.
good,I started each day at 6:30 am with setting the housekeepers work sheets for the day checking to see how many check in and checkout  we had talking to kitchen and wait staff as well as front desk to see if any problems from the night before and taken care of those. I learned how to deal with guest in all types of situations. I like working with Mr. Pozin he was hard but fair with everybody. I love the people there it felt like family. Toughest part of the job was balancing the work load because the house count could change hourly and when you are trying to make schedules for the next week sometimes it didn't workout. Having time with my staff during meeting and letting them know when they had done a good job. I will miss those Ladies.
good,"it was a fun job always meeting new people and having great conversations"
good,"The company is fast to train and put you on the floor.  The stats they start you off on is very specific and strict, and then they keep changing the status of those stats until the stress can make you quit or you thrive under it, depending on how you handle it."
good,"Check people in and out"

The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting the various clientele and networking with them.

good,Overall Wyndham is a good company to work at. A typical day at work will be calling the franchisee and working with them to getting the proper Property Management System install at the property. I have learned a great deal of customer service and how to work with the franchisee when they have questions or they are upset with something. My coworkers were fun and great to work with.

good,Fast paced environment that upholds the highest standards when it comes to quality and customer service. I learned the true meaning of customer service and team work.
good,I liked this job. It taught you have to be depending and not waiting for someone to tell you what to do. You don't have a manager breathing down your neck. So I enjoyed being to myself sometimes.
good,This was a great place to work at if you are going to school and work. Tehy actually let me do my school work if i wasnt busy.
good,"At Super 8 Motel I got to run every aspect of the Hotel operations.  From Front Desk, Housekeeping, Hotel Sales, Maintenance, Pool inspection, to answering the phone."
good,"This is a timeshare resort.  A typical day consists of check-in, check-out, processing payments, handling complaints, providing directions, recommendations for entertainment and restaurants.  Co-workers are great.  Management expects you to perform multiple jobs not related to front desk duties.  There are constant complaints from guests and timeshare owners about the condition of a lot of the units.  Guests are made to wait several hours after the 4:00pm check-in time before getting to their unit. Management turns a blind eye and def ear to all the problems. They find many excuses but no solutions .. New management is required"
good,Great place to work in a relaxed environment where your production and dedication can lead you to greater places
good,Will and can provide outstanding customer service skills and a great asset to any company.
good,"There really is no such thing as a typical day at work.  I work in the accounting department and then on the weekends as the pool supervisor.  But, being a hotel, there is always something that can occur where someone needs to do something outside of their job position just to help out.  I have helped out in houskeeping, in maintenance, at the front desk.  This job always keeps me on my toes.  "
good,Wyndham is a great sales and marketing organization that promotes a good work/life balance.  
good,"I answering resort in/out bound calls - dispatching housekeeping issues to housekeeping runners, security, lost prevention, emergency, etc, assisting with checking guest in/out.

good,"Wyndham is a fast paced, community focused organization.  Wyndham is a relatively new company, although the brands are iconic in the Hotel industry.  People are friendly.  On-site fitness center and cafeteria are both pluses."
good,"Excellent place to work and learn at the same time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of sometimes managing the desk, cleaning rooms ready for the customers and just generally making sure everything runs smoothly. I enjoy working, although some days can be tough."

good,Checking in & checking out customers.
good,A great place to learn and hone your hospitality skills. The most enjoyable part of my time with the company was working with the owners.
good,"I loved working for Wyndham, and I found the management to be very good as well. I did well right away as an OPC, but not everyone does. I think having worked for Wyndham before, and having had their training before really helped me a lot."
good,Encountered a lot of different types of people.
good,Meeting new people everyday with different personalities is a great experience.
good,"I enjoyed almost my entire time at the motel. I met a very diverse group of people, both guests and co-workers, and regret having had to quit. I made a few friendships that still continue and enjoyed listening to the stories that some of the guests would share. I found the no matter what your station in life is, when you are tired all you want is a safe comfortable place to lay down your head. I am proud that I was able to help these people find comfort when far from home."
good,Working any Front Desk position in a hotel or resort can become boring. During off season it's difficult to stay busy and there's always a lack of hours. But during the summer months you're never looking for something to do.
good,"Hangled all front desk responsibilities. Supervised front desk staff, generated weekly schedule. Handled reservations, check-ins & check-outs"
good,"Each day started different, but usually was started with taking a review on accounts and incoming reservations and checkouts. I learned a large amount of information of running a business and people skills. The management was very fair and a pleasure working for in any position. My co-workers were very sunny, smart, and open minded people. The hardest part of the job was working with people face-to-face while on the phone with other persons and organizing account simultaneously. the most enjoyable part was every day had something new happening and you met so many new and wonderful people from so many different walks of life."
good,"making sure all your rooms are clean , co-workers are great most of the time we work as a team. hardest part of the job is,there is no hardest part of the job.love to assist the visitors when needed is the most enjoyable part of my job and making sure my job is done."
good,I liked working there because I liked the work. You know what is expected of you and you can keep busy no problem. I like that I had steady hours. The staff was nice. Hardest part would have been when there were more rooms than staff at times. Yet I still stayed and finished my work and if needed worked extra to make sure everything got done.
good,I enjoyed working for this company Just because of the benifits in sales. I enjoyed all the employess and supervisor. I was excited to go to work everyday
good,Need to be very active and fit. Require a lot of running up and down the stairs. No elevator.
good,i worked here for four years and had my ups and downs of this job. The people was good to work with. The hardest part of the job was the rooms and how guest left them when they checked out. Overall i loved working with the public and providing them with a good experience when they stayed at the hotel.
good,It's a very nice place to work. Training opportunities plentiful. Hard work is recognized and appreciated.
good,"At this job, I oversaw over 30 lifeguards at 8 different pools within a 20 mile radius in South Jersey. I generated weekly schedules and visited each pool every day to ensure everything was running smoothly. This was a summer position while I was in college."
good,"I really enjoyed this job it was a nice, clean place to work. I met alot of people at this job."
good,learnt how to manage a restaurant co-workers were good people
good,Great place to work.Nice co-workers. Great everyday job. If you like cleaning up after others then by far this is the job for you.
good,"As a housekeeper the morning starts with taking all of the dirty sheets and towels out of the rooms, so that they can be sent out to be washed. We then clean the rooms for the guest who are staying and all the rooms they have just check out of. The head of house keeping is the mom of the group and make sure that we do what we need to do. There is not any hard parts to the job, just be prepared to do the same thing everyday. The most enjoyable part is the friendships that were made."
good,"I learned how to deal with some very difficult guest and it helped expand my prior training in hospitality. This job definately wasn,t always the easiest but I would return."
good,"i worked by myself on 2nd shift. It was a little scary at moments. Management wasn't to bad, but like I said, I was the only one ever around. When he was around, he was super nice, and so was his wife!! I think my only complaint would be that, there was a family that actually lived in an apartment above the office, and it always smelled...indian food!!!"
good,"I love the job that I do being able to work with people and problem solving it is a very exiting experience "
good,Must have a lot of patience when working for a hotel. You deal with people that are traveling and are tired but need to have the same standards as a regular
good,"Answering Calls, assisting customers by booking they travel arrangements."

good,"It pays you minimum wage, focused on commissions to be able to survive."
good,"Es una empresa que es muy buena para trabajar ,porque tiene un equipo de maneger,y supervisores muy competentes"
good,"I loved working for Wyndham until I came back from my vacation and my morning shift was changed to a night shift without my knowledge or my consent. It was extremely unprofessional and I was genuinely upset about the whole schedule change. I applied and was hired for the day shift for a reason, which is because I am a single parent so I needed to be home with my little one in the evenings. My former co worker who worked the evening shift was promoted so because their was a promotion and they needed to fill in her spot, they pulled me out to do it without even asking if it would work for me. The night schedule obviously did not work for me and my home life. I even went to management many times to speak of this and I was told it was just temporary and that they needed me to do it. I stuck it out as long as possible but it interfered with my life in many ways. Although I did not want too, I had to leave the job."
good,"Established company with many departments to excel in. Certain areas are more competitive than others. There is always encouragement to travel and experience the product. There are opportunities to see many different locations. Since the company is worldwide, there are opportunities to relocate to other areas. Very customer service oriented company."
good,I enjoy meeting new people. Working with my staff and multitasking in all aspects of the business. Problem solving and conflict resolutions. Creating a safe and enjoyable experience for both my staff and guests.
good,Everyone was very nice but they are very numbers driven and you can feel a little unappreciated.  The training was superb and efficient  This could be a great job if you were paid enough to afford to live in Orlando
good,Wyndham Destinations is suffering from the changes of spinning off from its Hotel division. Upper management has been turned over almost completely and they are struggling to reestablish a cultural identity.
good,"Ramada Hotel is a good place to work, staff are nice."
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Days Inn & suites, however under new ownership the management started to falter. Housekeeping became my responsibility (which wasn't a problem) but when housekeepers stopped showing up or marking dirty rooms as cleaned I needed either a housekeeping manager to reprimand the individuals responsible or the power to do so myself, neither of which the owners completed. When my manager left there was talk of promoting me to manager but after hearing nothing for over a month and still being managerless, I received a better job offer and left."
good,Typical day for a security guard consists of a great deal of walking and meeting homeowners and guests.  The workplace culture is customer oriented and is reinforced through management on a constant basis.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with unexpected emergencies.  Most enjoyable aspect of the position is the opportunity to meet new and interesting people.
good,Super 8 was a very good place to work. I enjoyed my time there. The manager took opportunities to teach me about the hotel business and I learned alot from him.
good,I recommend Wyndham Destinations as a good place to work. No overtime is given. A full 40 hr pay check is not guaranteed. Hours could be flexible if co-worker is willing to co-operate.
good,"I liked to work in Wyndham. Good company providing a great life and work lesson and easily to graw up with it."
good,"The bellman position is ok. Although they are multitasked, Wyndham understands their needs and, depending the staffing situation, can be very accommodating."
good,Enthusiastic work environment with new obstacles and objectives each day. There are several opportunities to solve problems and aid in the creation of perfecting a craft in an amazing work environment. The other staff and leaders have great visions and they express a very thorough work ethic and drive to get the job done.
good,"Great part time job.  Flexible shift.  Great team to work with.  "
good,"There was no room for advancement, like I said the staff already had their titles and took their positions very serious. I enjoyed doing the end of day reports and correcting all discrepancies. I made sure that the lobby and front desk were very clean. I liked to organize and clean the breakfast room."
good,"Baymont Odessa is a dainty little hotel with decent rooms and ok customer service. There is often confusion among the roles of subordinates and management, miscommunication between the staff, and improper storage of confidential files."
good,"Selling mini-vacation timeshare can be tough, but if you can make your numbers you'll make a good living and wyndham has a great benefits package. Come to work focused and be trainable."
good,"Working at Tryp hotel was a great experience. I learned how to accommodate guests, give them advice and make sure thay have a nice stay. The management was very professional the job had positive outcomes."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working under someone who applied corporate desensitized standard policies and micro managed your day to day to include various re training on any behavior that is deemed unacceptable. Very little room for individuality. They offered you bare minimum in incentives. A very good hotel discount if you want to travel a bit, but very little paid time off to utilize the discount."
good,"Working in this environment is like working with family. Team building exercises, and the general atmosphere were pleasant - the feeling is very inclusive."
good,Fun place to work and get to know highly driven individuals. Wyndham offers amazing benefits and great opportunities to advance. The job culture is great!
good,It's hard for me to give an accurate review of this workpalce because I have never actually worked here. Not sure why Indeed is asking me to give a review of a place that I have not worked for.
good,They gas you up in the training and make it seem like youll be making alot but it doesnt go that way. Theres alot of favoritism as well for the top performers. Overall the way the company makes itself seem like pretty cool
good,"You work in doors ,You meet people from all a cross the country.The pay is awesome .the down side is you work on a commission, that really makes the job stressful."
good,A typical day was going in and getting matched with clients that want to tour the timeshare and find out all about it and I was to try and sell them a unit by the end of the 90 minute tour.It was a fun and lucrative career. It was wonderful making couples dreams come true. The hardest part were the hours and holidays. I had to resign because my children were too young to be left on holidays and weekends.
good,My typical day at work is taking two tours a day. I have two hours to introduce our product and give them a sense of urgency to purchase their dream vacation ownership after my presentation. It is a challenging sales job because 99% of customers are there for the pricey gifts and not to purchase. My experience in vacation ownership has taught me how to manage and deal with difficult and demanding clients. Relationship management is the key to success and this experience has showed me the importance of nurturing client relationships.
good,"We are responsible for cancel rates yet it we don't really have any effect on it. If cancel rates are too high, you don't receive your bonus which greatly effects your overall pay. Nice management."
good,"Like any hotel, the work culture is is pretty similar. The work culture depends on the manager and his vision in relation to the organisational goal. It needs improvement."
good,"I worked as night auditor so I was by myself and didn't see as many customers as day shift.I checked people in, took bookings and answered questions over the phone, also early check outs. Also ran daily reports and got breakfast ready."
good,"Just ok place, too much BS and not real nice employees.  Too much busy work and unnecessary procedures that are  mostly useless.  Management try's to make it fun but it is very stressful most of the time"
good,fast paced! You have to know what you are doing in order to be successful. If you don't have a good manager your life will suck. You have to have some sales experience.
good,It's is a very good job to work at. And too move up to different learning . The overall experience is a fast paced and extremely enjoyable. I really say this because serving in all the events I have make me experience and see things I have never before and it helps me be more open minded
good,"I did enjoy working with the Company   It is a stressful environment but my main goal is to do my job , Be there for  the Client  .   Is hard to work in a Company when you leader  are not doing there job."
good,"working mostly by yourself, except for shift changes, was something I enjoyed. management was easy to get ahold of if and when there were problems or questions that needed answered. The computer program used to book reservations was new to me but easy enough to learn. Some guests were difficult and complained about our (fair and competitive) pricing, and there was the occasional sketchy character, but overall people were friendly."
good,Best place to work while getting through college. Excellent schedule management techniques and hotel management . Opportunity to learn and experience all aspect of vacation/hotel management .
good,Overall great place to work.  Encountered a bit of a good ole boys network with career advancement.  Overall collaborative and well run company.  50 years in business
good,Its fun and competitive....people are great!  They provide great benefits and lots of opportunity for advancement.   Pays well and pretty fair depending on your performance.
good,I managed the phone and admitting systems for guests. There was a contract with a rail company in which call-outs were managed by desk clerks and guests were needed to leave quickly.
good,"I have been working there for years. The work sometimes is fast paced, but not stressful. Management is helpful, friendly and understanding towards the guests and the employees."
good,Great work environment great coworkers wish I would have had more luck but for those who can make it work and are single with no kids can do well at this job
good,"walk around the streets of NYC and convince coupes to come and check out the hotel, take tours in hopes the sales department would sell property to these new potential clients. This was a very difficult job"
good,"Since Wyndham is a resort management company, it is much more relaxed than most companies you'd find in the hospitality industry.  I work in accounting, so I can't speak for front-end work."
good,"no advancement locally, but plenty of opportunity to relocate. good benefit packages, great HR dept. Management always stands behind team within reason. very fast-paced environment."
good,It was a relaxed place to work; We had good communication. It was a good environment. Easy to learn. They work with your schedule and are very understanding.
good,"Wyndham is the biggest and best timeshare company in the world. The growth within this company is un-matched. Great opportunity, great pay, great career!"
good,Great place for high school kids. Good summer job. With good pay in the summer. It gets slow in the winter and they will cut your house and they also put a lot of people on part time work.
good,"Met many people from all over the world, made friendly acquaintances, learned something new every day. Usually fast paced and when it wasn't, no one minded if I was reading a book, which also made for good conversation. Management was a bit too lax, maintenance was never around which caused for difficult experiences with guests."
good,I love that this job has an amazing management team. The open door policy and they really don't make you feel replaceable. They work with you and help.
good,"Sales position that is really stressful.  Granted the managers try to make it fun: there is music playing, they allow you to create your workspace (but it must be taken down for the next shift), and there are themed parties during the year, but if you do not make your minimum sales  weeks in a row, you are terminated."
good,"Working for Days in was a good clean and safe work experience with good hours, order, and origination. I was able to get my needed house and had no issue's at all."
good,Working in the hotel was quite interesting. see all types of different people and their problems. The easiest part of this job was dealing with customers and making them happy.
good,A typical day at work consisted of reviewing all existing accounts of our corporate guests. Local canvasing for new guest prospects. Training and coaching of a sales team in which I ran.
good,"The Company do not offer flexible hours."
good,"management was amazing, very helpful very good with giving feedback. typical day at work was helping to fulfill  the guests needs by asking them skilled question and exceptional listening skills"
good,"Clock in, pick up room assignment sheet, clean assigned rooms."
good,Super 8 was not only a good environment but also fun. I had the ability to expand and learn new tasks.Management was very helpful in any questions I had.
good,"As a Front Desk clerk I had to make room reservations over the phone and in person.  I had cashiers responsibilities, dealt with debit and credit cards, data entry. My coworkers and management were great."
good,"great co workers, meet new people daily, not liking working every weekend, benefits are good, pay is ok, my skilles not used to the fullest"
good,"This was the first job that I ever had, and it worked very well. The staff was friendly, and trained me without any previous experience. The management was ok."
good,"* six months back when i was at work place at Abudabi in Hotel Ramada a person has died by taking drugs that is my typical day of work....."
good,"GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR ME. Monday to Sunday, was my work schedule. DAY OFF was only wednesday. I do not remember if I had a hardest part of the job that I Iiked what I did. What I like so much was people I've meet."
good,"Working in a restaurant can be tough for job security. You would think a hotel restaurant and bar would be busy constantly, not in this case. There are weeks where little money is made, which is especially hard when you rely on tips for income. On the other side there are weeks where money is outstanding. As far as the work, it is a typical menu with nothing too eccentric. Co-workers are friendly and in any customer service job, people are the hardest part to deal with. As a waitress, the customer relies on you as far as orders being accurate and timely delivery. Others with experience in a job like this know very well there is a team behind a successful dining experience, and having little control over how the cook per say is feeling that day is a downfall. Overall I would recommend employment with Wyndham hotels, they offer a good stepping stone to gain experience in customer service, as well as management."
good,"Managing financial account for vacation ownership. Resolution of financial issues concerning account that are past due, collections or foreclosure. Assisting financial services representative with policy and navigation system related issues."
good,Wyndham Worldwide is one of the world's largest hospitality companies across six continents and it offers individual consumers and business customers a broad array of hospitality products and services as well as various accommodation alternatives and price ranges through their premier portfolio of world-renowned brands.
good,Yup you got it it's one of them chore doing jobs that require you to pretty much clean rooms all day and or do laundry too. That's basically it about this job. Never really interacted with co workers too much mainly customers at times.
good,great place  to work managers great to work with friendly people friendly staff sometimes would have free lunches great training good money
good,"Hawthorn Suites was a great learning ground for me. I was located near the DFW airport which was a great location for guests on business trips and Groups. We were often busy and even busier during storms or bad weathers. I would be the only person working with over 20 people to check in at the front desk. I could have happy customers and yet frustrated customers that were still frustrated over their flight delay. I've learned to deal with the fact that sometimes we will get angry customers. I always keep my customer service intact and go above and beyond to change the mood of my customers. If I fail to do so, I just keep trying anyway. I've had many customers apologize and praise me for staying on top of my game, giving everyone a speedy check-in and yet keeping a great attitude. I had great co-workers who were there because they wanted to work and wanted the best for the hotel and our guests, and yet I had co-workers who were there for the money. Management was great and I learned a lot of customer service and back office skills from my management team. The hardest part of work is probably when we have a storm and everyone is calling from the airport at the same. I am answering phone calls and checking in guests altogether. I can get 5 calls at once. My job is to sell out the hotel so although I am the only one, I get the phone information down and let the guest know I will call them back shortly while keeping an eye on the vacancy of my hotel. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and learning new things every day. There is many things that I've learned from the hotel"
good,"Helping Guest with directions, accommodations,suggestions, planning their vacations better, selling tickets, offering tours, and making sure they feel like home."
good,"You're tasked to do several things at this location, Cleaning. Cleaning of the front lobby is a must. You must check on it at least several time during a shift to insure quality control."
good,"Very helpful, worked closely with manager and co-workers. I was well trained and learned a lot while I was there. I loved getting to know the guests."
good,"learned computer skills, and gained customer service experience, very low demanding job and very flexible. most difficult part of work is having to stand for 8 hours without a break."
good,I was able to meet many new and different people.  You never know what will happen during your shift. Could be funny or scary.
good,I enjoy meeting new people every day and being able to interact with guest as they check in or as they check out in the morning. I work night audit so depending on how full or busy we are the night can go slow but I do enjoy the down time. I dont have management on duty but I do work with a driver for our 24 hour shuttle service and I do feel safe knowing Iam not working alone during the night shift.
good,"A typical day would include making hot food, stocking shelves, cleaning inside and outside of store, and working as a cashier. My managers were very friendly and communicative. My co-workers always handled a steady flow of customers with great attention to detail. The hardest part of the job was often having to work overtime. The most enjoyable part of it was getting to know the regular customers."
good,I was good at discovering what was important to my clients when they arrived at the resort. I enjoyed giving them a great experience while they stayed with us. We were responsible for setting them up with an update to go over any new programs or resorts. I always incouraged them to do that because we were forever changing. The hardest part of the job was not being able to set a client up for an update and that hurt your penetration. We had certain goals to make on owners and nonowners. It was very frustrating to help a client but not able to set them up for an update either because they refused or because they weren't qualified. This hurt your production even though there was nothing you could do. We had a great team that helped each other make sure we reached our goals.
good,"Being a shuttle driver for the hampton inn for almost 10 yrs was great. I've met a lot of good people! The hotel was always busy,clean...over all good place"
good,"With the exception of the state of the art facility and brand new work stations, I do not recommend working for this company. WVO offers wonderful benefits and truly unbelievable incentive programs for it's employees, however those luxuries come at a cost - and that cost is the employees time. By law employees are not required to work more than 40 hours per week nor are they required to work on their scheduled days off, however management will convince you otherwise and mentally/emotionally guilt you into doing so."
good,"A typical day at Wyndham is taking care of owners and members with their concerns and needs. Being a Tier 3, I take care of escalated issues as well as some more difficult questions that our Tier 2 agents cannot assist with."
good,Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a fast paced company. Great pay and great benefits. This company is also very diverse! You can go anywhere!
good,It was a pleasure going to work here because of the people.  The employees were great to work with and it was like a family atmosphere.
good,"I worked with many great people and learned a lot, but at a certain level of management, office politics outweigh actual performance."
good,"Sooo far I been working at the Super 8.  And I been enjoying working there but working in Maintenance sometimes it feels like trying to get equipment replace and/or upgraded is like pulling teeth.  but the first week on the job I found I was getting equipment from my car to do repairs or buying tools (from my own pocket) to do repairs. "
good,would go into rooms that guests had stayed in and changed the beds and cleaned the rooms and the bathroom.
good,"Good people, qualified leads, pleasant working conditions, great location"
good,As a night auditor in ramada navi mumbai I was responsible for complete night audit work.That was primary duties
good,"A typical day at work would consist of serving customers either in the restaurant or bar depending on where I was required. I loved both aspects and got on with near all of the staff there. The hardest part of the job was the management, one manager in particular was very difficult to deal with. For instance, if you were to displease them in some way, you would be punished in the way of the rota, doing a finish shift on a Saturday (which could easily be three in the morning) then putting you on an early start on Sunday. Focusing more on the positives of the workplace, I loved interacting with customers and am sad to say I won't be seeing the regular customers any more. Summing up my experience at the Ramada I would say that I truly loved it there, despite it being sub-par in many ways, it is a time in my life I will never forget or regret doing."
good,great company to work for only wish there was room for growth.
good,"Great diversity, loved the people. I learne a lot pertaining to my field. Excellent training."
good,Very positive work environment. Upper management made some major changes which dramatically negatively impacted commissions. Great coworkers family atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is going for days without making a sale. The best part of the job is the feeling of helping people with their vacationing needs.
good,I worked as a marketing coordinator.  I promoted Wyndham vacation ownership and New Orleans tourism.
good,It is a fast paced good work environment with a ton of perks. It was a good summer job.
good,"Coming from a background in hotel operations management, working the guest services department was not fast-paced or challenging enough to keep my interests. Although, there is room to use your creativity and entrepreneurial skills if you have a mind to make processes more efficient."
good,"run night audit and I learned my first night audit and front desk career here, neither of my bosses are working there anymore I do believe the owner is the same. All my cowerkers were awesome very helpful,i enjoyed it all greatly really didn't have a favorite."
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits.  Believes in a work-life balance."
good,very nice area. just started not much to say. The breakfast area is very appetizing. The gambling sites are ample. The staff is polite. On-site manager. The pool is well lit. Taking the garbage out is heavy.
good,"My shift is afternoon shift which involves checking guest in and making sure they are satisfied, and this shift is as random as can be I have no idea when guest are arriving or who will even show up or what issues will occur during the day."
good,To ensure that guests are provided with drinks and food when requested and offered these when appropriate in an effort to maximize sales. To ensure the Restaurant service is at a quality at all times whilst preserving a level of guest privacy. To complete all cleaning and preparation to ensure a smooth service at all times.

good,"I loved working so much with the customers. I worked any time my boss wanted me in, and loved being on call."
good,"Working in Hospitality, is the perfect career for that in the future, be a success your life."
good,"The people were good to work with, I enjoy my job and enjoyed the customers."
good,"A sales meeting every morning would start the day to brief everyone and bring them up to date. I would be in charge of the front desk greeting clients upon arrival, checking them in, and informing them of the presentation process. When not in face to face contact, I would keep records of sales, do filing, answer telephone calls, and schedule appointments. My co-workers were all very friendly and everyone kept lighthearted, yet good business relationships. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy clients. My position did not allow me access to certain information that sometimes became an issue, depending on the client. Also, some sales would last hours longer than expected, which demanded some long nights on my end. The best part was the cheery atmosphere. There were always bagels on certain mornings and catered lunches other afternoons, and everyone was comfortable joking around and having fun."
good,"I never worked in a Hotelenvironment beforehand and this job made me love it! Its was easy to pick up the system, the guest are great, as well as the pay. I have a set amount of hrs and a set sechdule. A very relaxed and cool atmospshere."

good,"fun place to work,  you get to meet a lot of new and interesting people."
good,"At Wyndham a typical day at work I would be on the phones all day, I used to work in a call center. I learned a lot about life, types of managers, and about people in general. I made some great life long friends, I had some amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being on the phone every day for the entire shift. The most enjoyable part was adding it to my experiences, the benefits, and the friends I made."
good,"I enjoyed working at Great Western as a Front Desk Clerk, My Job entailed opening and closing a Cash Drawar, Data Entry, Entering the Information for the iCustomers into the Computer..

good,temporary not for permanent
good,Attivita is an office work. I am working directly to the President of the company. I learned so much about office industry especially dealing with different types of people. You will learn to negotiate and interact as well. My co-workers are cooperative in same manner.
good,"A typical day would be talking on the phone and dealing with customers with different issues and problems. I learned how to deal with different issues that might face someone in a call center atmosphere. Management was pretty good in helping with any issues we came across that we couldn't handle as well as questions we had about our job in general. My co-workers were mostly professional and I got along with them very well, they were also helpful at times. For the most part my job was pretty easy, but I would say the most diffcult issues I sometimes came cross were dealing with Irate customers that just didn't want to listen. The most enjoyable part would have been the enjoyable customers I came across and also the different contests we would have, which I won quite a bit of."
good,Interacting with associates and managers on a daily basis. Keeping up with personnel files and the best was the corrective actions for employees.
good,Answering calls and assisting customers with any needs. counting money for a drawer and making sure that it is completely correct.
good,"I love working with people and the general public. It is very exciting meeting people from all over the world. Hearing there stories and then helping them and servicing them to the best of my ability. Everyday it is something different working at a hotel. It is amazing, i just need something more solid with better pay and benefits. I will have a college degree in another year. I deserve better."
good,that was nice motel my job dealing with pepole which i liked and i also did luandry fo motel
good,"Persuaded tourists and current owners to take a 2 hour timeshare sales presentation tour in exchange for gifs. Also, told them all about New Orleans and what to do/where to go. I learned a lot of valuable marketing skills and closing techniques. The best part of the job was the benefits and perks as well as my teammates. Actually, my manager was amazing and taught me so much. He encouraged and promoted me to not only succeed but to excel. He was a wonderful manager and believed in me, propelling me to reach the top 20 team in all of Wyndham."
good,It is nice to come to work and see how you are appreciated for the hard work you did. The staff is fun to work with .
good,"A typical day would consist of about 15- 20 check- ins 15- 20 phone calls, printing and reviewing several daily reports. My co-workers consisted of a team of housekeepers, one maintenance man. There one manager with no assistant manager. My relationship with my co-workers was fair and honest. The hardest part of the job was to stay awake on the overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting all of the guest,building rapport and socializing with the guest."
good,"I really enjoyed working for wyndham,i met alot of intresting people from all over.France,Japan,Germany,and i learned of their culture which is very much like ours.And i ejoyed showing them our city of Milwaukee."
good,"Wyndham Destinations is overall a pretty great company to work for, but definitely still had opportunities. The pay rate is probably the biggest opportunity. While it is competitive for the area, the amount of dedication expected is outlandish for the pay. The higher you get, the larger the gap between work and pay gets."
good,I whole heartedly enjoyed working for days inn. I got my desired hours and personal assistance to learn more about working a front desk job from my manager.
good,"Love the customer service had a lot of problems with the computer system but most of the time tech support helped to"
good,"Be honest, friendly. Kind to people and animals. Good computer skills. Don’t mind laundry. Cleaning lobby. Stocking kitchen and fitness room. You will be happy with this job."
good,If you want to be a gouse keeper i recommend days inn. The rooms are always clean and the employees are always ready to help with a friendly smile. You will definitely enjoy your stay.
good,Very satisfied and would recommend this job to anyone.. decent pay plenty of advancement and Wyndham property discounts at numerous locations..  working at this company was fun and peaceful.. the boss always recognized the great work we all done..
good,"Each day was very good. I did not work for Wyndham but I was very familiar with their company. Through working with them, I was able to see how they run business, and it was very well done."
good,I loved my job at the hotel. But it was time for me to take a new direction. Management there works hard to be sure everyone's needs are met. Great team environment.
good,"Wyndham does an excessive amount of pumping its employees up making it feel as if u will be rolling in big checks. If you don’t have the special knack to get folks to take six hours out to tour, then you may go broke as after training pay goes down to minimum wage. The people and environmment make it fun but you are dispensable far too easy. dispensable"
good,"currently working here as senior waiter,reliver for captions and bartenders,learned how to handle the shifts and solving the complaints,smooth operations."
good,The culture of the hospitality world is ironically sarcastic and dramatic. I appreciate having the job and their support through my maternity leave. Paid minimum wage and there are only a couple opportunities to get raises. You have to know the right people and have experience to advance.
good,"It was hard work that's no doubt, but it was a very good job with good overtime pay. It was my first job so of course I got a little overwhelmed and left. I regret every leaving that's for sure and if I could go back to that job I would!"
good,My boss wasn't an issue as I enjoyed working for him and he helped me out but people from a certain department weren't the best to work with. Housekeeping is a different story at that place.
good,I love my job. I would recommend Wyndham to anyone. The culture is supportive and team focused. I have made some friends that I believe will be friends for life. Good people.
good,The management was awesome. Really good atmosphere which made the work days fun and enjoyable. Loved suraj and leighton. The main complaint we got was no onsite pool or hottub for guests to relax a bit more. When i first started there were problem employees that were making this establishment not so friendly and safe. Not long after i was hired these employees were either terminated or quit. Such a relief this place was finally able to become what it should have been for so long. I enjoyed everyone i worked with here and am glad to have had this work experience along with them. Over all i would recommend this job to anyone looking for a good day job.
good,it was a great job but the pay left a lot to be desired its very easy to do most have different owners though so its hard to compare one to another it just depends
good,Great place to work and the manager is very nice. The only problem is that I dont get enough hours for the pay so it's hard to pay Bill's on time. All in all it's not a bad job
good,"Waking it when ham was exciting you get to meet important people special people "
good,"Overall, Management is very cool and helps you maintain productivity throughout your day. Also, they are very flexible and understanding when it comes to learning new processes and systems."
good,"I appreciated this company for hiring me, because I was out of work for a year and a half. This job also gave me the opportunity to go back to school and receive my GED."
good,"The environment is very fast paced. At times the work is grueling, but at other times it is highly rewarding. Overall, an enjoyable place to work. There was some dissension among the staff, but overall management was good."
good,"Always room to grow "
good,A typical day would be coming into work with my peers everybody and myself have all smiles. On our breaks there are fun things to do to get your mind off of things.
good,Usually scheduled for no more that 30 hours a week. Weekly schedule varies depending on hotel occupancy and scheduled events. Food Handlers card required.
good,I had good days and fun days . I wish I could go back but I had to more forward and relocate. I learn how to work as a team as well as lead one & I appreciate given the opportunity to do so .
good,"my hours working for a wyndham "
good,"Very nice laid back place to work, management is very nice. No advancement, no benefits, no paid time off. The hours are not very accommodating, no weekends off,"
good,"Needs better management. Other then that it's a good place to work. We would get teamed up with another employee and work together to get the rooms cleaned. At the end of the shift we would stock our carts for the next day, and we would go see if our other employees needed any help with their rooms. I loved working in small groups and cleaning."
good,"Go in count ur drawer, need to know what is going on with any guest or anything making  appointments for customers at anytime. cleaning when not busy and doing laundry , folding. just making sure you take care any problems with the customers that say. Make sure their stay is comfortable as possible."
good,"Overall great place to work. Very corporate. The rules are not flexible. So you have to be on time , have good attentance , dress appropriately, etc. They are very strict about production standards. I've seen them terminate really good employees that might have had a couple bad months."
good,"Just sat at my desk and did my work.  Co-workers were a lot of fun, but Management doesn't know you or try to get to know you.                                              No advancement in 7 years even though you gave 100%.                     It's who you knew, that you would get ahead.  A lot of Office Politics.     At the end, my department was outsourced and we were all let go with NO prior notice."
good,"the money is good when your selling, go through your ups and downs, sometimes its the tours and sometimes its your atittude.  you learn to take every oppurtunity as if its your last.  Preserverance and not cutting corners."
good,Enjoyed working there temporarily and taking part in the up keeping of the rooms in the property it really makes you feel good that you took part in the cleaning of the rooms and you make the rooms what they are when the people rent them and go in there you feel good that you had a good housekeeper that was able to meet your needs and make your hotel stay a good stay
good,"Fast paced, lots of money to be made, focus and hustle!"
good,"It was decent money for a work from home job that offered flexible hours. Like with every other job, it can be an enjoyable place to work at as long as you have a great team. They are always having activities that work from home reps can attend to at the corporate office."
good,"Wyndham is a great place to work. I enjoyed working at Wyndham and learned a lot. Wyndham, I can say was my first official job. I didn't come with any experience and knew nothing about Wyndham or even working at a hotel. You can gain a lot of experience with Wyndham but promotion wise, it isn't all that easy in guest service. They rather bring someone else from a different area then try to promote their own employee who worked really hard and took all the necessary steps to be promoted. Your vacation time have to be placed two weeks in advance and have the time to take said vacation, the managers don't approve it half of the time.  All other departments, Activity's, Housekeeping, Engineering, Guest service, Bell service, communicate with each other. The resort has 1149 units, One to four bed rooms. For the work I've done, you don't get the respect/acknowledgment or the right amount of pay. They put in affect ideas, without informing employees of the idea so employees have to adapt like any other company. You also do wish-hours, which you have to go to. Everyone likes helping the kids who need help and Wyndham gives them the helping hands they need. You have to do 8 hours of wish-hours per year. Wish-hours is going to a local spot in Fl and helping with kids or preparing areas for kids. We helped with, Give Kids The World."
good,"The days went by fast during our busiest days the work is fast paced which isn't a problem however, you're usually time crunched. The team i worked with were great at communication and that was our strongest feature in the admin department."
good,Its a fun place to work where you can make 6 figures with minimal skills. It can be high pressure but its no worse than any other sales driven position.
good,have a morning meeting for 5mins. wait for our Tour/Customer for 6 hours. proceed with a 90 min Presentation. The hardest part of the ob was to play the waiting game. what I enjoyed best was the friendships built.
good,The management was generally very helpful.  Coaching to help you succeed.  Friendly atmosphere.  You can make a good living there if you stay focused and ask for more help as needed.
good,"I wouldn't take a full-time position at this location because the management structure is disorganized and communication is not consistent. "
good,a very fast paced work place. if you fully commit yourself to the company you can make a bunch of money  but you'll quickly find yourself working 6/7 days a week and feeling burned out
good,Both the head of housekeeping and the owners of the Days Inn & Conference Centre Pentiction are amazing. They are understanding and kind people. This was an amazing first job!
good,The management here was always helpful. Staff were treated very well and the work hours were good. Pay is not bad. The supervisor does not micro manage therefore you have to plan your work day accordingly. Overall was a great experience and made good friends working here.
good,"its a good place to work, good employees and good management . they are willing to work with you if u need to change hours for something like having a babysitter after 12pm just ask and they will work with you"
good,"Just a great experience...Expect to work hard and smart."
good,"I worked as a maintenance technician at Wyndham Worldwide Resorts Group.  I worked there for over ten years and enjoyed the tasks I performed,  The culture is competitive but friendly and people seem to enjoy working there, generally.  The pay was competitive with other companies.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with a demanding task list on a daily basis."
good,"Good Place to work on this franchise, busy place all year round, conveniently located in the Island, Great coworkers and management.   Local and out-of-town guests are nice and always welcome."
good,very good quality of service. intense work i learned at lot from housekeeper to supervisor housekeeping.where they gave me the opportunity to work ocassionally as a manager.
good,"It was an OK job. The chief engineer was great and knowledgeable. Maintenance team, was very tough to work with, and to educate. Very combative and very abusive, needed a lot of coddling."
good,You don't have to worry about being slow working the 7-3 shift at the Days Inn and Suites. I met a lot of people from a lot of different places. But there was just no advancement available there.
good,I enjoyed the work environment at Baymont Inn and Suites. There were both times where things were fast and slow paced. I gained great customer service experience.
good,The Wyndham was also a location that couldn't stay under the same management. It was a decent place of employment but unfortunately they did not have room for advancement and once under new management.
good,would work here again if i could overall good experience only left due to lay offs when the property was appointed new management. There wasn't any down sides working for this employer.
good,Meeting all kinds of different people. Easy laid back work environment. Understanding when Time is needed off for family emergency.  Always able to smile.
good,Hours are okay- pay isn't guaranteed. High pressure sales. Odd sales techniques sometimes making you feel guilty for the people even buying. Very stressful.
good,"open and close petty cash, check in and out customers"
good,"Great Company but needs to increase the pay rate. Night Auditor tak on the many different roles during the shift because no one else is present. No management, housekeeping, bellman, or front desk associate."
good,"Great place to work with high compensation, you either kill it and make a ton of money or you don't and will be starving. Great work environment with awesome company events"
good,"Enjoyed my employment at Wyndham for many years. Interacting with employees throughout the company and forming relationships with my co-workers was the best part of the job. Unfortunately, the company decided to out-source my position to an independent service provider."
good,Working at the Super 8 was great. A very relaxed place of business. Always options to grow with the company. Always an option to make extra hours. And make extra money with monthly bonuses by meeting goals.
good,Good opportunity for a career. Good reputation in the industry. Internal departments work well together. I would recommend the company for a career. Thank you
good,"It was a great place to work, every day new challenge and amazing colleagues and superior. "
good,I loved working here. I loved the guests as well as the employees. The owner is extremely cool and fun to be around. It is a laid back environment with plenty of room for advancement. I only left because I moved away.
good,"I learned a lot about the vacation rental business. I learned a lot about how to use excel and now feel that I have a better then intermediate ability with excel. I enjoyed the team environment of working for the Shared Service Center (SSC). Each month the closing process required long hours, which seemed unnecessary. "
good,they are a great company to work for and have great benefits. The staff is great everybody for the most part gets along and has a great culture very good company to learn the f&b land with if you are new to the industry
good,it was an great place to work.  I learned a good bit about customer service in a complay that is all about the customer.  People contact was the best part of the job
good,I did enjoy working day in day out cleaning the rooms! I know that sounds weird but Im a neat freak. You have to be fast and super clean in that environment!
good,As a Hotel Front Desk Agent I greeted guest assisted in the checking in and checking out procedure. In addition to this I would also set up breakfast and assist in the maids schedule.
good,"It's a simple job, didn't take much training. Just keep your eyes open, follow the rules they give you, and it's an easy day. I think this place closed down too, so this is also filler."
good,good paying job and good area good people to work with loved working for them loved the security part of the job some dealt with drunk people and crazy people
good,Owe I clock in when I get to work and chill and talk for a few then get to work .  I make sure there's towels and linen avaliable for the house keepers and Asus any costumers in need of directions or towells. I sort the towells from the linnen then I fill the washing machine with either a mix or based on what the house keepers need. Then I loud the two dryers and fold any towels that's still there from last time to get reddy for the house keepers and repeat  this sickle. When dun I make sure to shut and turn of the light.
good,This is a simple job if you are detail oriented.  The pay is based off of minimum wage plus tips but you receive very few tips.  Excellent job for mothers with children but weekends are required.
good,i love working at wyndham hotels! i would love to eventually get a management job and travel around the world working at different hotels and experience different cultures
good,Overall i enjoyed my time at Wyndham. Not bad hours - unfortunately we were required to work on all Sundays. Didn't mind working some or a few Sundays but it kept me out of church
good,"Great Company to work for, never knowing who or what will walk through the door next; either a deal maker or a deal breaker. Loved having the chance to be part of the face of the company."
good,"Offers opportunity to grow within the company. unfortunately, management needs to improve in showing appreciation to hard working employees."
good,"* 11 years with Wyndham Vacation Resorts."
good,An hourly job at a resort could be used as a stepping stone to management if desired.  Opportunities are provided to transfer to different locations if the position is available which is nice.  Different experiences will be had at different resorts depending on the management at that particular location.
good,It's a nice place to work..  You meet people from all over...  Great tips when they check out...  Not a hard job at all... Basic cleaning is all the experience you really need
good,Great exposure nationwide when working with the Field Team leaders and connecting internally with various departments.
good,"Small staff,  like family. Everyone got along and very cooperative to each other. Management was great and understanding with schedules."
good,Wyndham is awesome. This company knowd how to treat their employee's. They take the time to teach you all the ins and outs of the business. Very accomadating.
good,"At first cheek all table setup then work in in your won section."
good,the front desk was sometimes a little hard to work with. a lot of the departments did not enjoy working with them so it made it hard for the new employees who joined the front to pick sides.
good,"answer phones"
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my co-worker as they progression various problem  that comes up with the guest stay. Answer the phones and dot he schedules. Order product they we need. The hardest part of my job is the Laundry. The most enjoyable part of my job is I like went I have made a guest happy and that they real enjoy there stay at our Motel. They leave with a smile on their face,"
good,"Setting up cart's for servers before they arrive insure all functions are a success,go over function's for following day with other department's.  The hardest part was not enough supplies, I liked that it was fast pace."
good,Great place to work. Some issues with management and there lack of leadership skills. Other than that the people working there and the people you meet are great.
good,"Changing the sheets, blankets, towels. Doing thorough deep cleaning of the rooms. Making sure that the rooms were clean and meeting guest expectations. It was time consuming, and time would just fly by while I was at work. People leave the oddest things behind in hotel rooms sometimes.. :)"
good,Open office. Order all supplies. Greet and check-in guests. Answer phones. Handle any special/office events. Timeshare company was going good until the economy went bad and the company went under.
good,"I loved working there at Days Inn in Jackson, TN. I worked the night shift coming into the next morning. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, as they kept the job going, very fun workplace. Loved my customers"
good,"Culturally diverse"
good,"It was the best place to work as I was in school to become a MA. The pay was not that great but it served to its end which was to help me finish the MA program."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with different customer everyday. Also management the different everyday problems of the hotel.
good,"Wyndham is over all a great company to work for. For the line of work I want to be in, there isn't room for growth in management or compensation."
good,"good benefits, food discount, chance for advancement, good hours and management willing to work right beside you. there are classes available to make you ready for advancing to a higher position"
good,"Don't plan on going to work for Wyndham and making a ton of money. If you're willing to work hard, you'll do alright but it is mainly based around how hard you're willing to work and how much you're willing to sacrifice. Lots of training opportunities. People are generally willing to help. Watch the best and do exactly as they do and you'll make great money."
good,"Good supervisors who are willing to take the time to explain new policies and procedures. Great people to work with, and potential for advancement."
good,"It was a fun company great pay, 30 hours of work on average. My job was to convince people to tour the timeshare resort near by and for their time they were given a gift such as free dinner and I had to meet a weekly quota and was commission based plus hourly."
good,"Duties performed where A/P, prepared gifting packets to disperse to visiting clients, expense reports for sales personnel, performed HR Duties. Enjoyed working with sales personnel and management."
good,I worked at the Howard Johnson which is a small Wyndham property. Hours and days were not usually flexible. I had the same schedule for the 5 years that I worked there. No altered compensation as time went by.
good,A good company experiencing the challenges that come with success and growth.
good,"I work in the face to face sales dept, have worked both frontline and in house.  It has been a good company to work for.  Good benefits, some of the best training in the industry, and there is an opportunity to advance quickly if you are a great salesman.  It's a commission job so don't expect to make money immediately if you're inexperienced.  It definitely is NOT easy, and you have to deal with a lot of negativity daily so having a great attitude is imperative."
good,"Working hard ."
good,"rough understocked lien "
good,A great company with opportunities to meet all different types of individuals on a daily basis.
good,One of the best things about Wyndham is its involvement in local charities and organizations. During my tenure there I was able to participate in the corporate partnership with Big Brothers and Big Sisters which was a very enjoyable experience.
good,"Entry level position becomes repetitive and if you aren't related or really close friends with someone in upper management, it's nearly impossible to get promoted to a position off of the phones. They do however have awesome benefits such as amount of vacation days, sick time, health insurance, 401K, and much more."
good,"	Interacted with the guest in a warm, friendly and courteous manner."
good,"A typical day would start off by counting the drawer. We would have to make sure the drawer was at $300.00 unless it was a busy day then the drawer might have $500.00. Next we would do our call around which is just calling the other hotels to see how many avaliabilities they have. Afterwards we would print off our emergency reports just in case. Then you would answer phone calls, sort out your paper work by VI, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Cash, or Check. "
good,"Very good company to work for, challenges are depending on department very little opportunity to grow within."
good," Prepared nightly audit statements, balancing accounts & money drop-off"
good,The Sports Cafe was my favorite place of employment because they did a good job training me and it was my first experience as a waitress and bartender. My co-workers were very helpful and great teachers. It was a very good work enviroment. The hardest part of my job would also be the most enjoyable part of the job. When the resturaunt would get packed and really busy at first I was stressed and overwhelmed then that became my favorite time because i was more experienced and it was eventful
good,This company gives you all the tools you need to develop and master your craft. The employment benefits are amazing! I loved working at this location.
good,General maintenance of inside and outside of 2 different hotels including the swimming pool and hot tub.
good,"Calm and relaxed environment."
good,"- cleaning rooms in =15minutes per room"
good,I am a hard working team member and can also work by myself and would like to work with Morrison team in warehouse or in kitchen as porter
good,Was a good experience and good people. I worked good hours and had a good time
good,"The typical day was busy open and distributed the mail "
good,"Some days are long but fun. A little repetitive but different guests everyday."
good,The company was great to work for however new management has forced me to look for other employment.
good,"This was so long ago, I cannot recall accurate information,  This call center has closed down."
good,I think they have treated me good. would like very much work up the ladder .
good,"A typical day at requires answering the phone and servicing owners vacation needs.  Every day I learn about the Apollo  travel system, new rules/regulations,  accommodations, travel packages, and how to improve.  My co-workers are very welcoming and easy to get a long with.  The toughest part of my job is not being able to book someone a vacation due to the high cost of vacationing.  Last but not least, the most enjoyable part of my job is researching fantastic vacation getaways for a clients and their families."
good,"Learned how to offer rewards, take reservations, customer service, develop relationships with co-workers, customers, management. The hardest part of the job was the talk time and I still think that shouldn't count against you when your main goal is to satisfy the customer!"
good,"A day at Wyndham was always interesting and different from the rest. I enjoyed assisting and learning from different departments. "
good,"Wyndham has some terrific programs available to their owners, and they take very good care of their top sales people.  Excellent benefits, nice and clean work environment."
good,did a lot of cleaning each day. had many rooms to clean helped other housekeepers when I was done with my rooms helped make beds for them while they cleaned rest of room
good,Fun pace to work with great benefits. Co- workers are very helpful and motivating. 
good,"Business is always steady, even during overnight shifts. Co-workers are very informative about any incidents or account/reservation changes that will benefit the employee taking over the subsequent shift. They are willing to stay longer in case an incident requires further resolution or explanation. On certain occasions, management was inadequate in replenishing items needed for breakfast preparation, which could make for difficulties. When management was off-property or on vacation, they sometimes relied on an inexperienced employee to handle major managerial responsibilites, which should be diffused to other employees familiar with the daily operation of the hotel. I have learned to adapt to the drastic changes in management or erratic work scheduling and work efficiently with others in finding prompt and creative solutions. The hardest part of the job is when certain supplies begin to diminish and nobody is unavailable to contact in order for it to be replenished. But the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships developed as the result of the inconsistencies and the friendly guests/work environment."
good,Great...work  for a great company  and great managers co workers were alright
good,"Schedule varies depending on available shifts."
good,"Learned how to interact with customers."
good,"Be careful of frequent layoffs.  Great work environment, people are generally nice.  Work can be boring at times."
good,i got to meet alot of different people and learn about different states as well as help with customer complaints.  management was always onsite to help with any problems.  I learned alot about other cultures there as well.
good,"Was a decent motel despite the location and the general customers that were seen everyday. This was more of a get your foot in the door establishment where I could learn and progress. I learned the basics of hotel operations as well as geting rid some of the military attitude I had, so that I could be more customer friendly and do anything I could to improve anyone's stay."
good,The typical day consisted of setting and verifying reservations; direct interaction with guest to ensure satisfaction; sales and up-selling guest while concentration remaining on customer need and satisfaction. Continued training on new software and changing policies
good,"A typical day entails reporting to the supervisor and reviewing the duties and assignments for the day. Throughout the shift I would be assisting guests with any needs they may have and providing guests with the best service possible for a enjoyable and relaxing stay. Lunch with the co-workers and reporting to the shift supervisor before leave. For the most part I learned a lot about the job and on the job, built many relationships with my co-workers and supervisors. The hardest part of the job was the changing of schedules every week. What I loved about the job were the many socials the company had for us. It showed us that they really cared about us."
good,"I work almost all shifts and areas of work excepting Maintenance and Shuttle Driver, so a typical day at work for me contains a lot of customer service and patience. At the Super 8 I furthered my customer service skills and really enjoyed the variety of guests I had the pleasure of meeting. My co-workers are all exceptionally nice people and they really make the hotel a better place to work. The hardest part of this job, I believe, is when you get a disgruntled customer and try to soothe them while at the same time help them to achieve there satisfaction in a way that they will remember our kindness and efficiency and will then be a repeat customer. The best part of working here is definetely meeting different people from all over the world as this hotel is right near the Portland Airport."
good,This was my favorite job maybe because it was my first. I learned everything about dine-in resturants. The Management was awsome. My co-workers were pretty cool too. There was nothing hard about this job because i enjoyed every bit of it.
good,"Company works hard at employee experience, and promotes good values. Manager skills sometimes lacking, so your mileage may vary. Corporate office environment good, and reasonable pace - can't speak to field experiences, but compensation is quite good if you excel."
good,"Awesome job, awesome people, and working at your own pace is a plus"
good,greeted customers prepared hot and cold beverages as well as sandwiches trained new employees on daily procedures and routines handled customer complaints
good,Most the customers tend to be nice because they are on vacation they are already in a slightly good mood. You are left alone and allowed to work and do your job peacefully. Considering the fact that the pay is pretty good and the job isn't to hard it's a fairly nice place to work.
good,"easy going at work In an everchanging workplace, employers seek employees who are interested in keeping up with new developments and knowledge in the field. I've learned Employers can do their part by offering a safe, supportive, work environment that offers employees an opportunity to learn and grow. Supervisors who hire self-motivated employees do themselves an immense favor. For self-motivated employees require very little direction from their supervisors. Keeping up with current changes in the field is vital for success and increased job security. Professionals are enthusiastic about their work and optimistic about the organization and its future."
good,"I worked night audit, assisted in the kitchen cooking breakfast and setting up the breakfast bar."
good,"management was very friendly. Got to meet board members. i learn a lot of valuable sale/retail techniques. A typical day involves opening the register, counting out cash flow, making sure 200 even is in the register for the day. maintain clean environment etc."
good,"I normally work the day shift of 7-3 so I do all the check out from the night before. This shift is responsible for maintaining and cleaning up after the complimentary breakfest. I answer a multi line phone for reservations, cancelations, and just general questions. I was put in the gift shop cordnator position after being there only 8mts. The GM is a good lady that respects the opinions of her employees and how they are doing as people not just workers. The hardest part of the job is figuring out what the guest may need or want in the gift shop. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and enteracting with my coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working Wyndham Resorts. Since Wyndham is a time-share selling company I learned a lot about selling timeshares, executing contracts, and giving timeshare presentations. The co-workers made working there enjoyable, getting to know and relate with them made the job great."
good,indoor swimming pool and spy.....great facility
good,"Handled over 200 high end accounts with the resorts that are affiliated with RCI. Confirmed vacations for resort personnel to include Project Managers, Developers, HOA, Resort Managers and other employees of resort. Delivered white glove service in all aspects of job to include the resort contacts, guests and other RCI Departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was very satisfied and happy guests. The most challenging part of this position were the check/in problems, which I enjoyed the challenge and had previous experience working for the Check/In Department at RCI to resolve check/in issues in a very timely manner by working with the resort, the client and other RCI Departments. I worked with three other VIP Specialists. Teamwork was very important and we shared information, problem solving and covered for each other, when someone was out of the office or on vacation."
good,A typical day at work for me would be to start assisting customer's at the start of my shift. interacting with my team and supervisor following up on emails and always wanting to learn something different for advancement opportunities.
good,Several years later I am still friends with former Staff members. Most were laid off due to the times. Many did get their jobs back at busy locations. Mine was a stressful position - I typed the contracts for the timeshares in Lake Tahoe. I have happy memories of both my coworkers and the managers.
good,"Enjoy working at the Wyndham. Is good work place, excellent location and I get to interact with new people everyday. I’ve been there for almost two years and the staff loves me."
good,"On a typical day I received all incoming mail (faxes, ups, fed ex, usps, email and website) processed all refunds and denied accounts that were not eligible. We were an open floor space with cubicles for us to work in. Our manager was around but she was never over our shoulders because she trusted we would get our daily work done. Working there I got involved in our volunteer program to help the community. This is something I enjoyed a lot. I was able to be the chairman for 3+ years and was on the executive council for 2. We helped come up with fundraising  ideas that could benefit one of the local charities here in Vegas. The money and items we raised was from regular people who wanted to do something better and put out goodness in the world."
good,A typical day will be getting your cart ready getting you're rooms find out what rooms to prioritize. Taking out the trash Gathering lining looking for lost items putting dishes in the dishwasher. Cleaning the bathroom making sure you clean the shower really well so there's no hair. Making up the bed making sure everything is in pleace
good,I worked at Wyndham Destinations for nearly a year.  They sell more timeshare than any other company worldwide as far as I know.  The flexibility is not too good but the potential to make money is awesome.
good,"By working for this company, I learned to use more patience for the guests. They all are different and have different requests that needs to be met. The most enjoyable part of my duties were to make all of the guests happy and to make sure their stay with the company was memorable."
good,Good place to work. The management could use a little more encouragement to the employees but overall good place to work very kind employees always encouraging you to do better and help you grow as a person.
good,It is an ok place to work. You have to be fast but make sure the job is done right. Rooms have to be super clean! Hours are pretty good too! The owners are somewhat flexible
good,The manager for the lifeguards although very busy with things will always help you if you ask and will always do what helps the team. some of the higher management can get pretty annoying but the lifeguard manager takes good care of her employees.
good,"There are nice staff and management team to work with. "
good,"This is a great place to learn vacation ownership sales, with a strong culture of sales and training for new sales persons. Hard work and lot's of learning to become successful, and individuals with drive will succeed."
good,"Was OK until they outsourced everything. Worked there for a year and since it is a hotel business, outsourced everything to Sabre. Prior to that a typical day was fun, productive and left me with more knowledge than I had before the job."
good,"Management is excellent and promote a wonderful team oriented culture. "
good,Great place to work. there's nice guests and not so nice guests but its fun and  I made friends with people from around the world. its a  perfect place to work if you're not made for labor. can be a very relaxing work place.
good,It's good doing better. They are trying to get better at all points in this company. I feel in time it will be a lot better. Communication is a big part maybe learn more English and pay better. And work the good people that need the work and money.
good,"It is my pleasure to work with wyndham group and i am looking forward to grab some more advanced experiences and roles."
good,This was a great place to work with the different cultures included. There were constant groups that came in and had parties. It was different cultures from all over the world as well. I love my bosses and I love my coworkers. It was a really wonderful place to work.
good,This was a nice place to work. The workers were kind and helpful. It was a pretty fun place to work overall and management was fair and understanding of employees.
good,You got to meet a lot of people from different cultures and backgrounds and from all over the world and they have great opportunities to grow and learn.
good,"This is not a reflection on Wyndham Destinations. When I was employed with Days Inn, I was hired by franchised owners of a Days Inn, not by Wyndham Destinations."
good,"My days are easy going and can be boring. However, there are some busy times as well. I have fun at my job and get a long with my co-workers very well."
good,I was a temp but the folks were nice and moral was great. Nice group to work with ever. Mgmnt was great to be around and atmosphere was nice. Systems needs some updating but was ok.
good,The management at this company are absolutely outstanding. They're always willing to work with personal situations. The fellow employees are extremely personable and are always doing their best to make the overall employee experience a good one.
good,"Horaires de travail variés et roulement du personnel accru. Bon climat de travail, mais quelques tensions entre les différents départements. Culture d'entreprise correcte, mais il y a place à amélioration. Clientèle variée, mais plusieurs façon de la satisfaire."
good,"the sales in vacation ownership especially in in-house division, upgrading existing owners is a great place to make tons of money.  You can work extra days and flexible"
good,It was a awesome job you can meet and know a  lot of people from different parts of the world. The management was a flexible one for the employees that work hard  on the requirement of a day off. Lots of great benefits to the employees including a great health insurance.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company.  It was fast-paced, at times.  The hardest part is maintaining their stats, which change from time to time.  The culture is friendly and they do various things to make things fun."
good,It was helpful working there. Managment really took care of me.  It was a great place as far as working envoriment. And they trained me very well. I got great working experience in the short time i was there
good,"Long hours most of the time, but flexible when you need it.  Pay is good, and benefits are very good.  Company takes care of its employees. Relatives to management get preferential treatment at times."
good,"Great job with good benefits.  You are capable of transferring positions every 6 months."
good,"Overall /Wyndham is not a bad place to work as an Activities Associate although for the amount of work unrelated to activities that is required is a definite reason for not getting a higher rating.  Also, the pay rate is justified by Wyndham due to the discounts on hotel and resort rentals, but with the work hours per week and the length of time required to get days off those perks are not much value. I would have rather had more money  than discounts on travel that I never had time to use."
good,"A typical day consists of your pre-sale meeting held by managers to pump up the sales team, followed by taking up to three, two-and-a-half hour tours a day where you give a sales presentation to families that are on vacation. More often than not the prospective families are informed of this vacation presentation, but when they are not, OH BOY they're upset. You'll get an intense initial training for a month and a half, and you afterwards are constantly reminded to practice your pitch and improve on your sales techniques. Overall you as a salesman will constantly be stimulated and interact with families from all over the world, and will often deal with rejection. The glory comes with a successful sale, that is announced the next day in the morning meetings to show recognition for your hard work."
good,"Wide variety line of hotels to work for. Relaxed atmosphere, and the ability to be in the front-line with people was always a great aspect of the job. I will miss it, but it is time to move on since graduating college."
good,Sales organization that puts people on vacation. The company promotes from within and encourages people to stretch their skills beyond their current role.
good,"Days Inn is very busy, The customers are treated well and the workers are always on time and very hard working. You get a free meal every Saturday. You don't work alone, There is always someone with you depending on the season."
good,"South Lake Tahoe Days inn was a fun place to work tourist destination, good training ground  owner taught me maintenance, handle all aspect of front office operations.."
good,Very enjoyable company to work for. Actually listened to their employees input. Management kept up with the employees and communicated with us regularly. Lots of growth and relocation ops.
good,I believe the culture is improving by some recent changes the company is making and some of the leaders they are now highering.  I am looking forward with great expectation to see what improvements will be implemented.
good,"A typical day depends on what projects you have going on but everyday can be the same or different. I have learned a lot when it comes to project management, collaboration and learning different systems. The workplace is a fun work environment. The most enjoyable part are the people that are always willing to help with anything."
good,"I loved working at Wyndham.  Unfortunately, I was a contractor and did not secure a permanent position while there.  They really made me feel like part of the team."
good,"Best experience so far. very motivating environment and competitve."
good,Not enough days I've gotten 2 days out of the week and as of now i made only 115 dollars last month i really enjoyed working there and if your a waiter than you are set 5 days most likely more but busing you'd have better luck scraping pennies together
good,I most enjoyed interacting with different types of people.  I also enjoyed working with a good group of co-workers.  A typical day was mostly relaxed.
good,Checking in and out guests. Accommodate the guest with whatever they needed. Management was great. I learned a lot about  running credit checks. The hardest part was if there was so much down time it would get boring. the most enjoyable was helping the guest as much as I could.
good,Great place to grow and work for a fortune 500 company . Learned A LOT. Opportunity for advancement company wide. Work life balance is difficult.  Slightly stressful environment.
good,You need to possess the ability to multi task. I had great co workers while I completed my time at the Wyndham. I may say once the hotel was brought from different owners. They hired within their culture most of us were fired.
good,I built long lasting friendships and enjoyed my time working for Wyndham for 7 years. I would recommend Wyndham to a friend. The hardest part of the job is being sales numbers focused 24/7.
good,"Excellent company overall, treated employees and customers well. Abundance of locations, nice place to work each day, friendly staff who encouraged learning for success."
good,I enjoyed working with this company. It could be a little busy at times but I enjoyed fast pace. You never knew how the customer would re-act to you..
good,Agradável de trabalhar. Tive a oportunidade de agregar novos conhecimentos e aperfeiçoa-los
good,Great management always there to try and help you to succeed. Plenty of training available. Great vacation benefits and discounts. Great job for someone who does not want to be on their feet all day.
good,I have found my time with Wyndham both fun and challenging. My colleagues are always positive and supportive. My supervisor has been amazing. always supportive and fair. The hardest part of the job was the constant changes that are so common with the sales environment. The funnest part of the job was talking to the guests. I have had some amazing conversations with complete strangers! The people that I work with have truly been like a family.
good,"The workers had great energy, the boss was nice. Everyday the workers greeted each other & boosted each other to work. I like to clean, getting everything done in a reasonable time is sometimes hard."
good,"sometimes management gets overly stressed, but on the whole it's pretty chill. There is some pressure to stretch the truth a little more than I am comfortable with when presenting to customers."
good,"The best part of working for Wyndham is the people that work with you, We have a great team. I enjoyed working during the day with guest and always felt like a valued person here. Management always made us feel like we would have more room to advance but I feel like that is only the case for certain people."
good,"It's a great place with a games room, cafeteria, gym, Be Well walking trail etc. Work culture was healthy and top management was very friendly and helpful."
good,"Great step into the hospitality industry. Paid time off and options to buy into benefits were fantastic. other perks included discounts on timeshare resort rentals, and hotel discounts."
good,My day was very busy and I always found something to do when It was slow. My boss always came back to check to see if I needed any help and she told me that laundry was the right kind of job for me.
good,"had a lot of fun working here. grounds keeping, pool maintenance as well as all the small repairs to rooms  and building. good atmosphere. good people to work with."
good,A typical day on the dinner shift is making up to about 15 orders and cleaning the kitchen. I think the hardest part of the job for me is doing some of the cleaning because I am just not tall enough to actually get the the place that they want me to clean. A fun part of my job is that no two days are the same.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wyndham,and the rush you get when you make a big sale is extremely exciting. But at some point the people stop looking like people and simply like numbers, and I didn't like that."
good,"i didnt have no hotel experience at all when i was hired, but now i love it. its just the job for me. im very people person and thats great with this job."
good,"My job consisted of the Night Audit, working from midnight until 8 am five days a week.  This is a rough schedule, but can be rewarding if you have the right mindset and lifestyle to support it."
good,I like working here because you don't really have co-workers in your face daily. You do your thing and at the end go home. It's pretty simple if you have a general knowledge for industrial cleaning.
good,"Good place to work. Was with the company for eight years. Started at the front desk at check in. Switched to marketing... It's fast paced, can be somewhat stressful, and competitive. After 6 years of that, I advanced to marketing manager. In that position for a year."
good,I would say in general this is a decent place to work. Every job has its pros and cons but overall the company is a definately a good place to work for.
good,I have had  different positions in this company and the level of stress will dramatically change dependent on your position and if your pay check depends on commissions or not.
good,"It's been a great experience, meeting people from all over the world, being able to uplift and encourage employees to be team-players, and developing ways to improve customer service."
good,This position was a fast paced position. Had dead lines to meet in which I met. Was always praised on my work and my work ethics. I enjoyed working there for the past 4 years but financially things got tough so we had to move out of PA closer to my husbands job.
good,I like the place. Lots of faces. Famous people. Very Hardworking place and Loves to have everything prepared. Would go back if the oppurtunity presents it.
good,It was an exciting place to work people coming from all over the world during the colts little league world series. The kids are always so excited to see America
good,"Great Management team.  Unfortunately due to economy changes of the business and new company taking over the existing company, a lot of jobs have been removed."
good,"ResortQuest by Wyndham Vacation Rentals is a stable, guaranteed job with good pay and benefits, provided you are willing to practice the reliability and work ethic the company requires.  Even if you don't, however, management gives exponential second chances, leading to some issues in morale for those who do come in and do what they are supposed to do.  "
good,"I love every aspect of this job!! From grassing mowing, to setting up events, to booking large groups,having each and every guest satisfied."
good,Working here provided a great earnings to hours ratio.  The pay rate for cleaning pools and spas compares favorably to any job I have had.  This job was one of my first experiences having minimal oversight and being able to utilize my own methods of completing work.
good,"I enjoy helping people and hotels gave me the opportunity to assist people from all over the world.  Taking reservations, constant guest interaction, handled hurricanes, guest game show host, sales, food runner, make schedules and housekeeping director"
good,"A typical day at work is just that, It's work. Upper management is great awesome and fair people. The hardest part of the job is sometimes it's too easy. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet great people from all over the world."
good,i enjoyed meeting the various owners of the timeshare resort locations along with their families and providing them the necessary tools to maximize the use of their programs.
good,I was a student at the university at the time I was hired at the hotel. This was my first experience in such environment. The management was great at understanding and working with their employees schedule. I enjoyed helping our clients in anyway possible. I helped in translating many conversations and was able to communicate with a lot of internationals that stayed with us. The job was very light but definitely kept me busy.
good,This is a great company to work for if you enjoy slow paced work that is relaxing. Not to much training is required to work at a hotel like this. and its simple.
good,Meeting different people everday makes coming to work interesting. The positive attitude of the emploees makes a good work environment even when things get a bit hectic and stressful.
good,"hello all, I have worked with wyndham as franchise service manager in New jersey. here I had provided operational support to owners and managers of Ramada Franchise properties. it was great working here."
good,Great place to meet people from all over the world. Sundays are the most busiest days to work. We are different than a regular hotel. Our rooms are like mini condos where owners pay to keep up with the cleanliness and appearance of the resort.
good,"High energy, busy fast paced.  Great benefits and compensation plans.  The work culture is great. Working at wyndham has thought me how to be a great leader and they have been preparing me to take my career to the next level"
good,The company is very corporate and pays very little. There is very little expression shown in the people we work for. They step on the little people a lot to get people they want in positions they aren't qualified for.
good,"Well management for keeping co workers in a well experienced workplace . Lots of well training was well done. Every employee was treated equal. Competative with weekly rates an high volume guest reservations coming in on certain days of the week. Enjoyed discounted rates, an most non- manageable experience in a job is when the system goes down an manager is not manageable to make it in. Especially when all employees are new at there job."
good,"Call center environment, good training, supervisor availabe for continual assistance, fun place to work. Able to work 30 hours per week, good benefits, rewarded team contributions, individual and group recognition."
good,I basically work here on my own. Preparing bills and taking care of the accounts. I used to work during graveyard hours when i got free from my other job. I used to work there for a few days and maintain all their accounts
good,"Always was hard to pin down specific hours of work. Not in the best part of town.Good people to work with though. Always an extra bit of work to do,"
good,Basically Super8 gets a good amount of guests but its enjoyable to coordinate with every guest and try to satisfy every guests needs.
good,"Getting to work and completing my job successfully.Having fun "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wyndham, I worked Front Desk as well as Night Auditor in my short time their. The work life balance was great, The management was superb (a little out of hand and dysfunctional) But overall they did a good job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working nights. I was all alone and usually worked on school or played Guitar and always got the work done ahead of Schedule."
good,Great properties; they focus on creating positive customer experiences. They also place emphasis on leadership development and employee engagement....
good,Most of the people that I encountered we very nice and friendly. Managers were very helpful with assisting new employees with training. Break time was amazing because of lunch.
good,"Easy Going days (Even when Busy)"
good,just the manager sucked and didnt take pride into her workers as a team but as a front desk supervisor i loved working for this company in all gave me alot of training and expereince
good,checking in out guest. helping with bags. greeting the customer making keys so they can enter there room. recording keys. reprogramming locks . refilling batteries on locks.
good,"I have been an assistant with Wyndham for almost six years now.  This company has an a beautiful campus with many wonderful and talented associates all led by a fantastic, insightful CEO."
good,This is a very stressful place to work because of job security.  The pay is amazing if you can make it and sell to your customers!
good,"I got my list of rooms to be cleaned and retrieved my housekeeping cart, then started cleaning rooms. Management was good. I enjoyed working alone, as well as communicating with other employees and guests."
good,"Very nice place to work. Stressful, but what job cant be? Everyone is a team here. We all work together on big tasks, which helps a lot. Management is ok."
good,Challenging.  Great team mates.  Always something new to learn.  Every day was different.  We were able to work with agents and supervisors in order to balance the needs of the business with the needs of the employees.
good,"Associates at Wyndham are hardworking, friendly people.  The culture is very relaxed and welcoming.  Work life balance is pretty flexible for most positions."
good,"Growth and development helped my efficiency and professional expectations."
good,"The days go by quickly and an employee has the opportunity to always learn new things and meet new people."
good,"Amazing experience, learned a lot, great people to work with, high volume lots of fun, front desk supervisor is amazing"
good,"Plan and supervise the day to day operations of the Reception section which are related to the arrival and departure of guests, including the room sales, the room assignments of VIPs, Groups and Crews and room registrations."
good,"Over worked at times , but we all get along and work as a team to get our job done. long hours , sometimes working 8-11 hours per day .. supervisor sometimes  too strict"
good,"On a typical day i would come to work around 10pm and check in late guests, do the audit, set up breakfast and the reg cards for the day."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be going in at 6am turning on all the light start filling the orange juice and water jugs fill the sugar containers so guest would have sugar for their coffee, seating guest as they come in taking their orders bring them their orders picking up and cleaning the table once they are done. I've learn a lot there like how to use a cash register at a hotel restaurant and how to handle work in a restaurant all together. My co-workers were very helpful when I didn't know what to do at times. The hardest part about that job was nothing really I enjoyed my job."
good,Working different shifts allows for different information to be accessed for guest assistance allowing for an enjoyable visit by the guests.  Management works with the employees to ensure positive outcomes on each shift.  Co-workers interact and help each other in difficult situations so positive outcomes are the result.
good,Wyndham Hotel Group allows Managers torun their departments.  Each is held accountable to decisions they make - but allows control.  The core front line employees are consistent and very good performers.  Little bit of co-worker competition and some resentment of ideas.
good,"Patient care, capsule endoscopy, blood draws, injections, procedure room. had to give the patients IV fluids, educate the patients on Hep C protocol"
good,standing all day was hard on me but at the same time the job was easy to do and didnt take long another hard part of the job was not knowing who you would be working with and  what kind of people i would have to deal with every day but thankfully i worked with nice people and made several friends
good,"The job was fairly straight forward job, checked guests in and out of the hotel, made sure that they had what they needed to make it an enjoyable stay. My boss was very kind and coworkers were as well. The only thing that made me leave is that I couldn't afford to raise my kids on the salary that they provided and there were no benefits."
good,The office is organized and meets the needs of each employee. Daily tasks are inputting guest information along with inventory of rooms and supplies.
good,I enjoyed the time with the owners and learning about why they love or hate their ownership with this Vacation ownership company.  I also loved to hear where they had been or where their next trip was going to be.
good,"Meeting after meeting, training after training. I was able to learn the emotional sales tactics behind sales. Management was professional on the floor but never off the floor. Co- workers were adverse and seemed to struggle with customer service and were not excited to be at work. The hardest part of the job was the recission process of sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money I could make."
good,Very well run business. Family welcome. I enjoyed the guest interactions and the casual atmosphere. The Owners take great pride in their business and accommodate staff as best as possible.
good,"As with any company Wyndham has it's good and bad points. The culture and diversity is vast which makes it a melting pot of ideas as well as innovation. It can also bring out the good and not so good in the people there. The not so good is usually few and far between, but it does happen. They take good care of their employees and most managers are very understanding when it comes to life, medical issues, and family emergencies though there are a few that have systematically eliminated the good employees from their teams in favor of those who they show favoritism to. I am honestly glad those managers are very few within the company and most are very honest, fair, and a joy to work with!"
good,"The company is good to work for, had decent benefits. Hours were any time from 8am to 9pm 7 days a week"
good,"clock in check and see if tea and biscuits where stocked up, take orders and pack them, and make sure dinning area is clean for customers."
good,I never had one day the same as the next the guests made my experience a great one
good,"It was a great place to work, and our team was close and willing to help out each other any way they could."
good,"As a Timeshare Vacation Consultant, i would arrive to work at 6:45 am every morning for our morning sales training.  there we learned how we could improve different aspects of our sales techniques and processes in order to achieve a much desired sale.  After the meeting we would be assigned to a site where we wait on a tour.  Once assigned a tour, we then are expected to apply our sales expertise and training in order to produce a sale as the final outcome.  I certainly learned a lot about what it takes to be a successful salesman, despite the product that is being sold.  I had excellent co-workers and management who were more than eager to offer training and advice.  The hardest aspect of this profession is definitely maintaining a positive state of mind.  The most enjoyable part of the job is without a doubt walking out of deeding knowing that you gave everything you had in order to produce the sale."
good,"Overall i have no complaints, its a great company to work for if you can make good money doing it. They have an hourly base pay but allow great pay for above and beyond results in sales. Absolute great management available.."
good,"As a night auditor I mostly worked alone. I booked guest into the hotel, made sure their stay was pleasant and did the shift end report. I had a great experience working for the super 8 and obtained lots of knowledge around being a night auditor."
good,Pretty much enjoyed my employment at the hotel. The staff welcomed me with opened arms and I caught on quick to complete the jobs at hand.
good,"cleaning the pool and testing for correct chemical balance is very interesting. I learned how to be proactive in the workplace and work with other people."
good,"As a Director of Operations and Support, there was weekly travel.  Great opportunity to meet and support hotel owners and operators."
good,95% of the staff works very well together to accomplish what needs to be done to help make sure that the hotel is up to the best running standards possible at the time. The other 5% causes issues by not effectively taking their managerial position seriously. I have been put into a position to be a middle person for confrontational situations that would normally be handled by upper management. I always try to be well prepared for guests requesting information and have learned that we are recommended by many places in the area for our information sheets. I have learned many tricks of the trade in regards to maintenance and housekeeping which I had not been able to do at my previous hotel position.
good,This is the ideal place to work for someone just starting out in the maintenace field. Great way to learn how things work and figure out your customer service style.
good,"Fue mi primera experiencia "
good,I miss working a this place. I would have came back if they had a night position in housekeeping. I was pregnant my reason of quitting.
good,"An front desk agent involves a quite few of multi-tasking skills. From answering the phone , to putting in a wake up call , while checking in a guest.   Hotel front desk clerks perform some or all of the following duties:"
good,"It is nice to meet many people from all various companies throughout the United States. To hear about their businesses, and why they enjoy coming to our facility for their meetings."
good,"making that the guest happy service with a smile "
good,"A typical day at work would start by me signing into the computer until my ID code and then printing off the checklist, which identifies all of the tasks I must do throughout my eight hour shift.  Then I will do paperwork while waiting for guests to check into the motel.  When I am done with the paperwork I will clean and make sure that every aspect of the lobby is clean and presentable.  Then I will do more paperwork and file the remaining that were left behind.  Once all of the guests are checked in and all my paperwork is accomplished then I am able to use that time to do my homework for school.  I learned patience, how to fill out and file paperwork, multitasking, teamwork, accounting, and punctuality.  The majority of the time working there I was by myself, but when I did see my co-workers it was only for five minutes while changing shifts.  Every encounter was good but the main communicate was with a book that we would write encounters and problems that we had throughout the shift.  The hardest part the job would be working the overnight shift because there is last activity during that time.  As long as I kept myself occupied then I was fine.  The  most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the guests and the relief that they had because they had finally gotten to their destination.  I really do enjoy interactions with other people."
good,"A typical work days was lost of productivity and gratitude"
good,"I enjoyed the management ,other fellow employees it was like a small      family enviroment"
good,"Great benefits, though expensive.  Productivity based.  Hourly plus commission and bonus.  Competitive.  Management tries to to motivate employees but have no real power.  Monthly quota is required to be met in order to keep your job, regardless of factors affecting production numbers.  Viewed as unfair by all employees.  Competitive."
good,Great people to work with. Dynamic team. Fast paced environment. Great leadership.
good,I had to come in to work and count my drawer and then i had to tend to customers and take their reservations and answer the phones when needed. It was difficult at first because of all the multitasking but I'm a fast learner. When I learned how to do everything i loved it . My management and coworkers were very polite and fun to work with.
good,"Typically running to project meetings.  Lots of overlapping priorities and projects.  Good strategic goals, but still working out the process to fulfill"
good,"Muito trabalho. Os dias são muito dinâmicos e nenhum é igual ao outro. Ocupações altíssimas e que demandavam muita energia e bastante controle emocional. Aprendi a respeitar as diferenças e aceitar críticas. Um dos melhores momentos na empresa foi quando participei de uma convenção em Las Vegas.

Management has openly and frankly communicated providing feedback and reinforcement of a good work enviorment.

My supervisor was easy to communicate with but made sure I knew when i had done something wrong. My co-workers where all easy going and understanding. They made the work place much easier to get along. The hardest part of the job was the fact, you cant make every customer happy. Overall, the most enjoyable part was meeting so many different kinds of people."

good,It is all about learning new oppornuties about children's behaviors.

good,"The company is the biggest timeshare company on earth so if you are working as a sales rep you have the opportunity to make hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly. Those who make the big money are in the top 5% while the majority float around or are rooted out. It is not an easy business, but the opportunity to make money is there."

I've learned to be very patient with customers and how to handle some really difficult situations. There is really never a dull moment at the hotel.
good,Great company with lots of growth potential if you're willing to relocate. Amazing HR leadership.
good,"Great hours to make some $ (30-35 hrs per week). But like many things, can be deceiving for pay. High high turn over for a reason."
good,"The resort is ran by a Energetic General Manager who has a personal relationship with each of her employees. There is no ""typical day"" at work because your duties vary depending on what resort event is going on. Management holds various events for the guests so Monday I may be serving Ice Cream, Wednesday I may be serving ""New Orleans Beignets"", all while working as the only Valet and Bellman for the 265 room resort. I am also a videographer who produced multiple videos for the resort as requested by the General Manager. Everyone helps where needed so at times I've cleaned rooms when all of housekeeping was gone overnight, worked concierge and gave information whenever concierge steped away, and even worked front desk when the front desk attendant was rushed to the hospital due to problems with her pregnancy to name a few. I love that every day you are faced with a new challenge and you must be ready to step up . The Workers are very friendly and there has never been a day i wasn't exited about going in to work."
good,I very much enjoyed my time working the front desk and driving the hotel shuttle. I have learned from working at a hotel that you will need to take initiative which I have now conquered and understand what it means and how it will help.
good,"I had a great deal of advancement with the company. I took extra time to do certain things and when managers saw what I could do and my potential, I was promoted, three times. The hardest part is dealing with irate customers, it seems nothing will make them happy, The best part for me was the M-F 9-5 work schedule in my own office at my own pace."
good,I love my job it was great I love working face to face with the guests
good,"Fairly nice hotel. Off of airline hwy. Alot of guests that come there, next to celebration station, some nights are a little hectic"
good,Arrive and jump right on the phones
good,"Enjoyed working with wyndham, their managers were the greatest and the team leaders always kept their teams upbeat and ready to work. It was an enjoyeable place to be at on a daily basis, I didnt dread going to work."
good,Wyndham values its employees as much as its owners. The sales staff are all passionate about their work and the management at Lake Delton is smart and good at what they do. The best part is the one on one training you do to perfect your sales skills and move up the ladder.
good,Each day varied depending on the events that I had for that day. I have worked all kinds of events from small business meetings to large social events. I managed about 40 employees.
good,Must love a challenge to turn frowns upside down of disgruntled guests. Great team work / work family. Compensation not enough for amount of work. Certain departments have commission which could make up for lack of compensation.
good,"Me gusto mucho toda su organizacion y disciplina ,solo pagan muy poco a los engineering."
good,How do not wish to leave anything about this company on here thank you that is just my preference any questions  If there are any questions please feel free to ask

good,Everyone is very friendly here which helps one feel like they are part of a huge family.  Training is available for those who are interested to gain new skills.
good,This was a great place to work with a great culture that was driven by teamwork and was represented to the top down. It was a high stress job but came with high rewards.
good,"Great benefits and opportunities for making lots of money.  Very Male based.  Long hours and open 7 days a week so work/balance is off."
good,"It helps you to improve customer service,Meeting  all types of people. learn to communicate, management understand  situation regarding visitors some issues address regarding customer complain. the company give a christmass party and christmass bonus."
good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership was a GREAT company to work for in Orlando. The summers are brutal working outside in the heat at that property, although the environment is VERY laid back. The Managers are very helpful."
good,"Out of the options for call centers, few come close to the level that Wyndham is on! They have impressive employee benefits with manulife that begin after 6 months, a amazing RRSP program where they match up to 6% and a very supportive management system that gives you plenty of room to grow and improve."
good,Everyone is nice and likes to get the job done on time . It's better to be in a non stressful work environment . Smile to all customers and make sure they are satisfied
good,"Wrap station make all biscuits and sandwiches that comes on the computer screen. Always greet customers with please and thank you, worked drive thru window"
good,Fun and great place to work - Was placed on a 6 month contract and was unfortunately not given the opportunity to have this extended. Attempted to drop to Part-Time to persue Study but no flexibility to accommodate this. Fantastic training program and encouraging support and motivational management team.
good,Time share sales is not for everyone. This was probably the most challenging job but also. Very rewarding. You really have to have a lot of energy and be good with words for this sales job.
good,"Working environment is stressful. Management is always lacking, yet it is easy to make friends and create a fun environment. Hours are long and hard. Usually never enough staff to create an equal team."
good,"Its a very nice hotel no work at, really nice environment with nice coworkers, the people over there are really friendly, if you had a bad day they will always find a way to make it better so it wont affect your work performance,"
good,Productive work environment.  Good job work/Life balance.  Very competitive and fair job culture. Worked as a contractor for six years.  The company moved to Indianapolis in 2018.
good,Working at Wyndham was ok. The pace varied from day to day depending upon the number of arrivals/departures each day. The assistant Mgr. was a micro manager and created unnecessary stress.
good,"Be prepared to work under pressure and however long it takes to get the job done. Some leaders are great others are not, if you can learn how to handle the stress of the job you can make great money."
good,"Wyndham, like any large company, has the problem of matching its corporate vision with the day to day operations. They do, for the most part, allow for a flexible schedule and career advancement, but need to do more when it relates to listening to their employees on the day-to-day level."
good,"Good owner to work for, property was in good location on main highway.  Open year round.  Property was remodeled in the past 2 years.  Has an indoor pool"
good,"The job was good overall."
good,"Well run company.  Great business model.  Talented and innovative leadership."
good,"The day starts early, if you’re not on time, you will go to the back of the rotation.  I learned a lot about the selling process. One of the best trainings I’ve had. A very busy place during the summer time."
good,"Very professional but fun atmosphere. Not very good management. Workplace culture is very relaxed yet professional. I learned a lot about the selling process. The product I sold was based on points, we sold vacation time, it was very hard."
good,Was able to advance from line level to management loved my job. But because the reorganizied I was laid off. Given a decent severance package. Still would work there if a position was available.
good,"I enjoyed working with Wyndham, however, there is no guarantee that the calls will be consistent."
good,"Liked working here - with lots of benefits, but some time that cooperate stuff is stressful.  Was a nice place to work until total change in management."
good,"Being a Sales Professional is a very hard job, because its commission only but very lucrative. The work environment is very high-paced. You have to have tough skin to survive in this industry. The best part of the day is closing deals and being around your peers."
good,A good job but towards the end of my time there was too much turnover with management and compensation got considerably lower. It overall was a good company.
good,"The accounting department supports resorts with financial accounting, month end reporting and answering various financial questions.  Management is hands on to support accountants and resorts."
good,"Great company to work for.  Opportunity to move between locations could be made easier."
good,Being in the Vacation Business is great for the Soul! You are always discussing Great times with the guests and sharing in their vacation experiences!
good,It was a great place to work. I always met new people and had fun with my coworkers. The money was good and there was never a dull moment at the Ramada.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Worked with different cultures throughout the years. Management was a pleasure to work with. Learned to be part of a team
good,Sales Professionals receive all of the benefits.  Applicants should understand Wyndham is a Time Share Company - not a Resort Company ~ Emphasis is on Marketing and Sales.
good,Wyndham is a great company if you want to start at an entry level position and work your way up the ladder. They offer many opportunities for career development and growth through their many training sources.
good,"Wyndham is a great place to work.  A typical day is full of different tasks and interaction with employees.  I have learned new procedures and interesting facts about the hospitality industry.  Management is good but, rules are not always the same with each manager.  My only reason for looking elsewhere is the amount of distance from my home."
good,"I've worked for a handful of call center's but Wyndham was the best one. Most of the managers are exceptional. Much of the time the work environment is upbeat and fun. Everyone celebrates your victories. For the most part a lot of the workers there are some of the finest people I've come to know. There's a real sense of family there."
good,"Working at Days Inn was a great time, everyone was helpful from your co-workers to the managers. It was a team effort in housekeeping and no one had to complete a hard workload by themselves. we celebrated  staff birthdays and it was a friendly environment to work in."
good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a professional, focused company. They take the time to train new hires to learn the ropes, succeed in their roles and advance."
good,"The people and culture are a good mix.  They are mindful of the different cultures and makes a point to support everyone."
good,"Thumbs up"
good,"I start to work in Wyndham Worldwide as a full-time position. People here are really nice. Good work and life balance. The only thing is the office is too far away from the city. And the work here, is kind of casual."
good,The moral is high in the workplace. The lunches were provided. For a hotel they tried to balance life and work. They also offered monthly partner recgnition lunches.
good,When I started with Wyndam I was in a management development program. The hotel I started at had new managers in all the different departments of the hotel. We all learned and grew together with excellent management and leaders.
good,"A typical day at work required a lot of phone calls. "
good,Like working for the resorts was looking to be hired permanently but I was under contract by another employer as a temp to hire position. Position ended due to employer not been able to find position open for me.
good,Good positive energy.  Good advancement opportunities for entry level employees.  Diverse culture at the entry to mid level positions.  Very large at home work environment.
good,"Universal Agent program is the merge of two departments between marketing and resort operations. "
good,Fast Pace. Resolving owners issues. I learned that you can take a very disgruntled owner and resolve and most of the time they are happy when you say your goodbyes 
good,"Overall the experience was great, the owner, manager and staff were all welcoming and helpful."
good,Great place to work. Some of the days are long but in reality that means the resort is busy which is a good thing. While other resorts in area shut down between seasons we do not. There are always hours available if you are willing to work. Fantastic benefits available to even part time workers. management is flexible with scheduling as much as they can. Saddened I have to leave due to family relocating.
good,Each employee pulled their weight and pitched in when was needed. Our manager would even go up and spend a few hours doing laundry if the housekeepers were busy.
good,it was fun to work there with a great group of people. they can manage things well.they don't need any help from the owner and they know what theyre doing.
good,"It's a decent job. I would recommend to others as a matter of fact I do. Pay is decent as well I am just used to always working 2 jobs, and with the hours being switched up often I can't so it isnt a huge income."
good,Fast paced. A lot of room for growth. I enjoyed the people and the culture. Definitely have clear favorites but if you are a hard worker you'll do great!
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Working for Wyndham provides great work-life balance. The nature of the work performed is not very stressful, but the environment of the sales floor can be quite the opposite. The opportunity for financial growth can be great, but like most sales jobs, the consistency is very difficult to maintain."
good,Was a good part time job. They were nice people to work for and understanding to my situation. Everyone got a long well. Hours were decent for a hotel.
good,"A great opportunity for a competitive sales professional.  Work environment very focused at the job at hand.  Assistance from the team when help is needed,"
good,"- It is the easiest/ hardest job I've ever had."
good,"I really enjoyed the challenge of working there. However, I am of the opinion that their marketing, to a certain extent, lacks the ability to provide or produce qualified leads. If marketing gets under control, they will get 5 stars employee reviews more often."
good,"It was fun. Got to meet people from all over the world. if you talk to the guest you really get to them on a personal level which is great."
good,great place to work good management. people are nice and so are the guests. hours are good when its busy but can slow down drastically in the slow sesason
good,"Great place to work, you meet people from all walks of life. the pay is not that good considering the work that needs to be done.  Management overall is great, easy to work for and very accomodating."
good,"Check rooms."
good,Great benefits for employees. Never any issues concerning payroll. Fun atmosphere but still lacking a bit of structure. Management can definitely improve.
good,Was a very popular busy hotel when I worked there at the time was called Ramada hotel. I mainly worked breakfast and lunches also did shifts in the hotels coffee shop. I worked as a waitress.
good,I am a people person and people love me. you have to love what you do. I really love meeting people from out of town. I loved the time that I was working I was sorry when they closed.
good,This is a good job with insurance. You  are busy all day. you work in a team setting. At the end of the day your main goal is to make the guest happy.
good,yonetim beceriksiz en az adamla cok fazla is yaomaya calisiyor tabiki bu benim calistigim.yerle ilgili
good,I was responsible for the scheduling and supervision of 10 employees. Supervised the daily operation of restaurant. Planned the set-up and execution of banquets.
good,"I've set up and broke down events, weddings, parties, etc.  Bartending and learning how to do the books for them.  I've also learned a lot with this business.  The hardest was learning the paperwork, but got it.  This was a part time job.  Talking and meeting people from all over the world"
good,"Good team work and healthy competitive ambience, has a really good training process with paid training.  What they offer is not always what you get so you may feel frustrated at a point."
good,Company was great but there management is horrible no previous experience just winging it. They do what they want no matter if its company approved or not. Besides me there was one other male employee and we where highly discriminated against
good,"Professional and collaborative environment. Ample time off, but challenging work with impactful results. Great place to come to work every day! I really enjoy it."
good,"Answer phones, helped a customer to understand his loan and maintain fees for the timeshare that he just had purchased. At first he was really upset at himself and Wyndham sales reps who sold him the timeshare. I calmed him down by listening to him and answering all of his questions. I didn't put him on hold one time, he ended up a happy customer and glad that he had purchased the timeshare."
good,I kived working for this company. My boss and co workers were always very friendly and always willing to work together to get things done in a timely matter. I would work for this company again in a heartbeat!
good,Job Work/Life Balance allowed more time for doctor appointments and time off for family or personal reasons.  Lunch available on premises with discounts.  Good benefits.
good,It's fun working there great people and so kind. I remember every morning we sat and eat breakfast them the time it's over and back to work lol. It's a fun place to work.
good,great management! I have learned how to be patient and understanding the needs of the customer. Trying to calm down a irate guest can be challenging at times. The satisfaction comes from realizing that I have made the customer happy with me as well as the organization. While supervising other employees I have also valued the skill of organizing and delegating authority while continuing to command respect as management.
good,"The atmosphere of the work place was enjoyable - had many pictures from around the world to brighten the day at work. Management was friendly - always providing food to their employees. I learned how to book vacations for air, hotel, car, and cruises - so I learned a lot about the different traveling needs, their employers, and other cities people wished to visit. Hardest part was getting a good schedule - seniority was big there so if you hadn't been there long it was tough getting an earlier schedule. Most enjoyable part was discussing the vacations the owners were going on."
good,"Very good job, only downfall is it gets boring at sometimes. The people are kind and you are allowed your freedom while there are no guests. all in all a great job"
good,Has a strong culture and work ethic. Employees feel like part of the team and strive for success in all aspects. Talented and dedicated leadership team that rewards it's employees. Overall structure is great and attracts the most talented sales people.
good,A typical day at work is coming and greeting people and the environment is very nonchalant. The job is not that daunting and if you have any troubles with anything then the manager is always there to help.
good,"Secure front desk position. It was fun during the summer season, always busy. Guests were fun and made my job enjoyable. Once rainy season started it was very slow and not much to do."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, with promotional opportunities at most levels. Company is constantly reviewing factors for success to remain competitive with emerging market."
good,Wyndham is a fast paced fun creative and warm environment to work in that encourages good employee moral and participation. They strive to make sure the staff is valued so the staff in return can value other staff and customers.
good,I really enjoyed working at the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel. Everyday I met new people and helped guests to make their stay a desirable one. I grew close to my co-workers and enjoyed going into work everyday. I learned how to better communicate and to work well with others. The managers were always willing to help me out with any inquiries and helped mold me into a better front desk attendant. I do miss my job there and my co-workers but we now live out of Sudbury and the commute would be too far with my two small children in school.
good,"This job was like literally made for me. It was made for my personality. The challenging thing is that it is not for everybody. I intended on this job only being a seasonal job to hit a few goals, but if I could have I would have stayed forever. The work environment is very supportive. They are understanding, and they are very supportive. If you are looking for a family type of environment, this is it! This company is the true definition of work hard, play harder. "
good,"An opportunity to work short amount of hours with great co workers who are funny, talented and fun."
good,"my work life at Wyndham has become repetitive with the same issues coming back week after week, facing the same issues and it just becomes tedious. Other than that, fellow employee's are enjoyable to work with."
good,A day at the life of Wyndham was not very stressful.  The project goals and target dates were very realistic.  The people were extremely friendly and helpful.
good,"Great place to work expectations are high, if those expectations are met the job was a lot of fun, great team atmosphere."
good,"I love working hotel. It was by far my favorite job so far. Management could use some work, but overall, it was a very enjoyable job. I worked alone most of the time, so I very rarely seen my co-workers."
good,"I've been working at Wyndham for almost a year now, and a few times I became so stressed out that I had to step back and remind myself that this wasn't the worst things that could happen to me. I love most of my coworkers and get along well with my supervisors. The workplace is very accommodating for your needs up to a realistic points. What this tends to do is encourages a sense of loyalty to the company that can create stress and it becomes easy to forget that other things might matter."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Universal. I loved sharing the experiences with the guest and their children. If we could afford the cost of living in LA and raise a family, I'd go back in a heartbeat."
good,i enjoy my job very much it is important to have front desk agent. i meet new people everyday from all over the globe. Management is cultured so the hotle is very open.
good,I loved the staff I worked with at Wingate Andover.  I met a lot of great nurses that helped me grow.  They also have a great staff of C.N.A.'s that take excellent care of all the residents under their care.
good,"During the last 10 years of my working career, I have worked for two Fortune 500 companies and it was during this time that I discovered that I am a storyteller of data. I love taking raw data and transforming that data into meaningful and useful information that assists the decision making and showing how effectively an organization may or may not be operating. Then using that data and utilizing Lean Six Sigma strategies to identify and correct the identified inefficient processes when necessary."
good,"Great company to work for and safe place need more benfit for employees,good PTO system you will get big desconut for vecation on all the hotels reservation for you and you family."
good,It's fun enviroment with positive people ! The most enjoyable part of this job is mini competitions which makes every sales person drive their goals to succesed and win small prizes.
good,"Professional, organized, and good ethics. Quality training in company knowledge, product, and sales. Good health benefits."
good,The job involved calling previous guests of timeshares. The environment was conducive to reaching goals. I attended a week long class to understand the rights of the public and the importance of respecting DNC registrars. We were given the tools to get the job done and during times of high employment and good financial times it was possible to make the calls positive in setting up tours with a vacation package. The downside was when many were laid off and not looking to vacation. I enjoyed working with a varied work force and sellingaproductI believe very strongly in.
good,It's a great living space for the ederly and also a great emplyer. I enjoyed worke rther and getting to experience working in that field.
good,I loved working here! The managers were great. I learned how to get a lot done in a short time. They provided transportation when needed and worked around your home life as much as possible.
good,"Days way fine, but when flights was cancelled, the airlines put up guest for the night. How to work underpressure, co-workers was the coolest, had a fun with them, when you think your shift is almost over get a phone stating airlines cancellations."
good,"Overall Wyndham as a company was an amazing place to work, the environment was positive and upbeat, the hardest part about working in reservations would be trying to save the package. Many times  guest would be upset for false promises told from the time of purchase, they then will insist on a refund and try to get a supervisor. What i enjoyed most is what i took away from that experience, i have learned how to handle irate customers, accommodate guest with what they need for their reservation and also i have become more skilled at up selling products."
good,"My work day with Wyndham includes working with 3 departments to verify all client accounts for the National Harbor site. I am the liason between my site and our corporate office so i prepare reports and roll out new initiatives from corporate for the marketing department.I some of the pilot programs before they are implemented at other sites."
good,"Sales and clients are treated well and given lots of recognition! Company did have great medical benefits at this time, and good 401K, education reimbursement. "
good,This hotel is a nice hotel in a location convenient to the Master's Golf Tournament but the manager/owner takes no initiative to deal with issues when they are reported to him.
good,enjoyed the training of employees to ensure that guests enjoyed themselves and that they would return. Coworkers were good to work with and some ended up outside friends.
good,Main duties cleaning rooms and re stocking them. Great people to work for. Hard work quite physically demanding but good team.
good,Great place to earn income in timeshare especially in the in-house dept. Company great at getting tours in front of you and with that opportunity it on you to maximize your income to any level that you want.
good,"A typical day at work include coming in, waiting for guest to arrive, set up the breakfast bar, and run the audits."
good,"Loved waking up everyday and going to work, where i can get to do something productive and entertaining for the day. Help other people have clean rooms and fresh bedding."
good,"always a hectic day but i can deal well with a heavy work load"
good,wasabi japanese restaurant is my frist job in uae when i start little big difficult for me but i lean a lot of team
good,I am working in Brazilian specialty restaurant.it usually opened at 6.30 pm.so this is my fist experience with Brazilian cuisine .it helps to learn about Brazilian cuisines.the management team and co -workers are very help full and good supportive people.

good,while working at the travelodge i made some grate friends and had an amazing experience working there. the environment was grate and the learning curve/ training was grate the workers are very dedicated and patient with one another.
good,"Wyndham has a strong culture, they encourage team building and interaction in and outside of the work environment. The management staff is strong, knowledgeable and extremely helpful at all times. I had to navigate between several systems, and utilize up to fifteen windows daily to perform my job successfully. Mostly, I enjoyed the schedule flexibility. During the school semester, the scheduling manager accommodated me with all my scheduling needs."
good,"Checking emails, managing calendars, setting up meetings and on boarding new associates would be a typical day"
good,"Great place to work, company culture is great because the company is always finding ways to enhance employee work life balance."
good,"We never knew what challenges we would face from day to day, it certainly kept us on our toes.We worked as a team and with positive can do attitudes to complete our daily assignments. We were located on the Virginia Beach oceanfront so the majority of our guests were there for vacation, and in great spirits witch is contagious! I worked seven days a week so i didn't get to enjoy the beach as much as i would have liked to."
good,"Typical day at work is departing guests that have stayed with you, some may be from the northern Unites States or even from another Country.

It combines the best of big company benefits and opportunity with more personal care and nimble reactions.

good,"A typical day at work involved many constants but in my department also a lot of changing variables which required constant adjustment.

good,This is overall a good place of employment. Just be prepared to work long hours and most holidays and weekends. It also has a fun and encouraging work environment
good,Everyday I went into work. I had a clear understanding of my responsibilities for the day. Nothing to stress myself over with a clear direction and leadership.
good,"I would say this job is very productive and a great work environment. There are a lot of multi-tasking with working with the guests and working on paper / computer work at the same time.

good,My original career was an automotive sales manager for 20 years got into timeshares for an easier schedule. The pay is great if you hit top level bonuses if not you will be making a 825 an hour and won't be employed for more than 90 days. If you can't handle objections and a lot of no's then stay away. Only 1% will make it over a year keep that in mind
good,I enjoy working with the public and cleaning is my specialty... Working alone... No one looking over my shoulders... Being trust worthy and loving my job

good,House keepers working as A team is A great choice. It was nice to take A break and get A free fountain drink of soda Respectfully Thank you Great job.
good,Corporate culture was good with many team building opportunities and team focused goals and projects.  Was an owner operator of the Ramada Williamsburg and Wasserbahn Waterpark Resort.
good,I have worked for Wyndham 3 times twice as an opc once in call transfer... the Las Vegas OPC marketing management team is the best my call transfer manager was the worst I ever had. My problem with the company is the constant changes in pay plans and hours always raising goals while paying less...
good,Ramada is a fun and active place to work to it’s just the pay isn’t good enough they have awesome mangers and the employees are real nice. It’ll be hard at first startin off but once you get the hang of things in get easier .

good,Beautiful work area and atmosphere. nice routine and people to work with. Calm and productive work environment. Flexible hours and days off when needed

good,Housekeeping strip beds make beds empty trash put clean trash bag back in Clean bathroom dust phone desk ect vacuum rooms and hallway Clean mirror windows ect  Laundry sort wash wash towels and sheets when wash done put in the dryers when done start filling wash then put it away
good,Great company to work for and the leadership is very good. I would predict the company will continue to do well over the years and grow quite a bit. Their sales position is probably the hardest sales out there.
good,Treated fairly well and happy to be a part of the company I was just thinking what else do you want they were fine with me but the housekeeping staff was a little confused about the whole thing
good,Assistant general manager was highly enthusiastic of my willingness to learn and better myself in work experince which resulted in a job promotion from houseman to front desk clerk.

good,"I enjoyed working as the night auditor--night shift during the typical work week.  It had quick paced times and lulls in the night. On nights when the hotel was booked full, I always made sure I knew of other hotels in the area that had rooms available."
good,"Overall it was an ok place to be employed , showed some favoritism. Started out being full time , switched to part time. Worked over a year an ended up with just $8.75 an hour some that just started , started off with more ."
good,"Managed 40 unit motel with 13-15 employees. Duties included; training; supervising; hiring, firing employees; managing inventory; checking rooms for cleanliness and maintenance problems; selling and marketing; public relations; payroll and bookkeeping; doing direct mailings,"
good,A typical day at work includes me setting up my station as soon as I clock in. Greet customers and provide customer service and accommodate to every customers needs. I learned a lot about time management in the industry and how you just have to have a time clock in your head when trying to get everything out in a timely fashion. Its helpful having a manager on the floor when customers have questions about places to visit or explore if your not familiar with the area. Work place is diverse. Hardest part of the job would definitely have to be trying to accommodate a guest that doesn't speak English and trying to make sure that they get exactly what they want and need. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers leave with a satisfied experience.
good,"fun job, nice people and great managers. the pay was great only cause of the commission you can make. benefits were a plus and well around good company only downfall is during the end of the year it slows down drastically and the pay doesnt reflect that so commission made is not the best"

good,"well wyndham was first paid job. so every things great for me cause learn some things for example setting conference room,meeting room, sitting up buff table."
good,Had a great Manager and staff at the location I worked at.  Can't obviously speak for all locations but if this is any indication on how management is trained I would definitely recommend working with them.
good,"You meet people from all over the world . It is a Hotel in Galveston, Texas. You get to eat free lunches prepared for the Sunday Brunch that was left over. The people there were amazing to work with . Very kind and considerate."
good,"Great laid back job. Would be much better if they paid more. Easy work, great location, but pay is too low. Would stay forever if pay was better. @@@@"
good,"This job is a great one, if you like sales, are motivated and consistent. Only then is the sky the limit on how much you get paid. This job is a business. There may be some amount of favoritism, but mostly, if you don’t sell, you can and will be replaced. It is a timeshare company. All employees are timesahre salesmen in that their advancement is all that matters. You work as a team, yes, but everyone is focused on their own paychecks."
good,It was an awesome job and fun people to work with.  I met a lot of different people in different cultures. I love to talk because i'm a people person and always listening and willing to learn more.

good,"I loved everything about my job, the pay was nice, the pace was good, I never got stressed at work, but had to leave cause a co-worker was bullying me."
good,"Different kind of serving. Working in a hotel is very different, one moment you are dead, the next a convention has let out of 500 people and they are all hungry. Has its ups and downs but the events and rush of people make up for it."
good,Wyndham has given me the tools to be my own boss and run my own company. I am able to recruit my own customers throughout the entire process. Wyndham is a company where you can easily move up the corporate ladder as well.
good,"Working at Ramada Inn was a great opportunity. Managment was awesome, they loved making sure their employees understood the job. It is a very damading job and requires lots of attention."
good,Take talent and strength to survive long term.  Great pay and benefits but be prepared for the schedule.  Cannot complain if it pays it takes work and skills
good,Yes I would like to work here again and yes I would recommend this job to other people that are looking for a great way to get work experience and have a bit of fun.

good,"the recent spin of Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels and Resorts has created quite the stir!  Being appreciated is one of the reasons I have always loved this job!  Of course, I do what I need to, and assure my work production is above average and always completed.  With the corporate office moving to Orlando, I will be working remote from NJ."
good,"good working enviornment, mostly commision based. Most days spend in hot florida weather with face to face sales pitches. Cons are that is its a timeshare presentation to random people who mostly do not want to listen to what you have to say."
good,"Wyndham is a great company to work for. Although I feel that the pay could be more, it is a very relaxed environment and the staff gets along great! Management does whatever they can to make your job easier."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Wyndham. I was consistently treated fairly by management. They train you well and are invested in helping you to advance your career.
good,"A typical day at work involved answer phones and speaking with customers. Morning shift was responsible for checking customers out, while night shift was responsible for checking customers in and taking payment. The hotel I worked for had a hard time hiring an effective manger. The managers that were hired either never showed up for work or did shady things including steal money. This was the only real problem the hotel had."
good,This was a good place.  I worked there so the place was run down.  I've met many nice people there.  Our department closed down so we had to find other employment.
good,I enjoyed working for Wyndham Vacation Ownership. It was my first hospitality job and it was a great experience. It was fun and everyone worked well together which made for a good day.
good,the hotel was fun to work at. i got about 40 hours a week and i did the laundry when it was slow.  it wasn't bad. i wish it had better security though.

good,"For the past 15 years I have had the pleasure of working for Wyndham Destinations.  The company took care of me multiple times when I needed help, they provided multiple opportunities for me to grow, and afforded me a life I never would have though I would have.  I was able to live in Washington DC, New Orleans, LA, Fort Lauderdale, FL, San Juan, PR, Nashville, TN, and currently Austin, TX.  "
good,Great hotel to work for:) I have been here for almost 8 years and am looking for new employment due to a new owner buying the hotel. I have been in Salina for 33 years.

good,"Management was easy to work with "
good,During my time frame working for this company there was no room for advancement and there were very few raises involved. I would recommend them but only if you are looking for a quick job not career.
good,I have the best coworkers to help me with anything I needed when ever we came together for projects it was all hands on deck no excuses and the training courses were well done .
good,n/a once again I would not like to state anything about the corporation. I did not have any direct contact with anyone in upper management. Thank you for understanding.
good,Ramada is a laid back job.  I worked as the Night Auditor.  I check a small amount of guests in at night.  I had to run the night's daily reports for the next day.  I was boring at times because it was not busy at night.
good,Is helping individuals grow and meet their personal goals. The company provides an encouraging environment to do this in. I am happy to work for Wyndham Hotels and Resorts.
good,"I got promoted to General Manager after working on the front desk as  a supervisor for 3 yrs. Managed 2 small 90 rooms each properties until I resigned in 2012. Managed 50 plus employees at each property. Followed all wyndham's standards, procedures and expectations. The hardest part of this job was trying to keep up with my bosses needs. Seeing I was responsible for all operations in every department, everyday, it got crazy sometimes."
good,"Fun place to work with great benefits, company culture values teamwork - designated volunteer hours to take advantage of. Downsides are lots of busy work."

good,My work is to keep the room clean and also the hotel areas. I also do the other work in other department when it needs more staffs. It thought me to be more aware and gave me more experience specially facing foreign guest. The management is very amazing when it comes to staff concern. My work place is giving best stay for guest. There hard part is when there is events that made us work for long hours. I enjoy a lot when guest are happy from the service i gave.

This internship allowed me to build upon my skills and knowledge while giving me an idea of exactly what career path I wanted to take in hospitality!"
good,I enjoyed my job it was like my job like my second home and clean environment. I'm just thankful for the time I was at this job because I learned for what I know now even though we learn more everyday.
good,"- short shifts involving patroling the condominium complex for new arrivals to assist with"
good,"It should be Super 8 Motel."
good,I just signed people up for wyndham. When people use their points they were please with the deal. I don't think its fair they cant build points if they are getting the room at a discounted rate through their company though. In the end they are still paying for a room so should be able to earn their points. Some times the discount is only ten dollars.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wyndham and the experience I gained while with them. For anyone looking to join their team, I wouldn’t have any hesitations to do so."

good,This was a great job and an even better opportunity for me to gain experience in the hotel industry. Unfortunately I had caught the owner of the property I was managing engaging in multiple acts that seriously lacked integrity and it forced me to separate myself as to not get associated with that. Otherwise highly recommend.
good,"Usually, teams get enough time to work on required efforts. "
good,I do not really know this job. If offered an job and a reasonable salary and position i would be interested. I would be honored to work for Wyndham if offered.
good,"A typical day would be waking up going to work and clocking in. At work, I had to make sure everyone was doing what they had to do and make sure that I was doing what I was assigned. An issue in this job would be the amount of time I had to clean, other than that I liked it."
good,"love it, as a froogle person, totally see the value. However 100% commission is not for me personally.  Most employees have spouses with fixed income, or 2nd job, or young kids being supported by parents."
good,Not all the days are same in hospitality and you get to enjoy and have fun with all your colleges which supports you in daily task personally & professional.
good,Wyndham was a great experience. There wasnt much to really know as long as you can talk to people. You really have to watch the veterans of the game there. As soon as you start doing better then them they will try to get rid of you.

I just wish there was a higher rate of pay with health benefits because we do put in a lot of work, even for positions we are not getting paid for. I feel like they should take care of the people that help run there company more then people who just work there regular shift. I Do not want to leave my job I love my job because my managers are amazing and my coworkers as well."
good,A typical day as an intern consisted of shadowing managers in different departments and completing projects on Microsoft excel. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture and the way management was open to receiving feedback from the interns. One of the biggest projects of the internship was a presentation to the CEO about where Wyndham could potentially expand their hotel and timeshare business. This was also the hardest part of the job because it required weeks of doing research on countries around the world and trends on where people like to vacation.
good,"Working as a union engineer, so the pay and benefits were good. Working in a hotel can be stressful but fun at the same time. Met a lot of good people there."
good,"I worked for the Days Inn & Suites in Hinesville. It was a great experience and I learned a lot. I had no prior experience and had to learn everything on my own. There was no assistance at all, overall I learned the system and enjoyed it."
good,During my time with this company I saw several different personality types excel in several different roles. This is a company that rewards drive and the willingness to learn. Not for everyone but if you are willing to put your mind to the test and can trust that the work pays off definitely life changing potential in this company.
good,"Working for the ramada inn was fun, i loved the guests as hey did me. my co-wokers were great and so was my manager. sometimes it would get stressful during my 9am-5pm shift due to the fact i was the only person there at the front dealing with guests and answering all the phones along with ringing up snacks customers would get from the mini mart"
good,"Excellent experience serving as several positions, but mainly Guest Service Supervisor. Friendly staff, clean facility, highly satisfied guests who visit."
good,"This family owned business is a great place to work.  The family owns and operates this business and sometimes in my experience its not a great work atmosphere, but this family super-cedes that perception.  They really are all about the customer and the experience.  Really great place to work"
good,This position was great. You were able to interact with guest and sales personal with great management applied. This position was well organized. The most enjoyable part was that it was well staffed and they have room for growth.
good,"Handled hotel of 100 rooms by managing front office."
good,"I enjoy working with Wyndham very much.  It is a fun atmosphere with great associates to work with on a daily basis.  My daily responsibilities is to manage RFP's, quote group rates, negotiate rates for contracts with major pieces of business for the hotel.  It is a pleasure coming to work daily because it gives me the opportunity to interact with guests at Manager's Reception and upon check in and check out.  Working with global sales has benefited both myself and the hotel--we have established excellent working relationships.  Our property entertains many Broadway Musicals and they are very enjoyable to work with.  This has been both challenging and rewarding and I have loved every minute of it.  The hardest part of the job is that you must be very competitive, which I am.  This is a most difficult property but we have exceeded goals and budgets for 2016 and ytd for 2017.  I would recommend working at Wyndham to any possible candidates looking to join the industry."
good,"The Wyndam I worked for lacked good management.  It was a revolving door of managers, and everyone of them had their own agenda.  Top management had little professional experience."
good,"I started at Wyndham a very long time ago and did not think that I would make much of it as I was only in the mail room.  However this ""job"" turned into the experience of a lifetime!  I found that as long as you work hard and excel, opportunities will come your way.  Thanks to this job, I was able to travel the world and meet people that I would have never met.  The experiences were beyond amazing.  I found that I was a great trainer and really liked to see the light in someone's eyes as they learned something new.  Wyndham gave me the ability to do this for many years."
good,The workplace was a great environment. The compensation and benefits were great. Would work for this company again if given the opportunity. Working with staff was very enjoyable.
good,"Lots of bureaucratic nonsense when trying to get any changes made but what should one expect when working for such a large company? Overall, not a bad company to work for."

good,Excellent for starting out your career within hotel management. Learn a lot and can really enjoy the perks of employment discounts. Work life balance is always there and an opportunity to be creative and really think outside the box for resolving issues is great. Being challenged and making strides to resolve various issues is part of what I enjoy as a supervisor.
good,I started out in housekeeping. People just don't want to work these days. I was then moved to kitchen as the cook due to staffing problems. I was then working my 5-12 shifts and then helping in housekeeping. I think once management gets more comfortable in their positions it will be a lot better place for all.
good,"where I use to work at Days Inn in Holbrook, last year. Why I quick because is the pay is  not enough paid and they go by the rooms. I didn't like that job. that's why  looking for another job like that can go by hours."
good,"the office is always welcoming, the management is excellent with all areas of the workplace. everyone is treated equally throughout. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work on a day to day basis but everyone helps out in different areas and share the work loads and that is what makes the job enjoyable."
good,There is room for advancement and I strongly recommend looking into that as being on the front lines isn't ideal.  You deal with more pleasant customers the higher up you are.

Everyone becomes family and helped each other out to get the job done right. I learned a lot of customer service skills and telephone skills.

I checked the till float at the beginning of each shift and ensured all cash/payments balanced at the end of each shift to ensure the next shifts till float balanced and was ready to go. I learned to use Opera which was the system platform for running the hotel. I learned hot to manage a small team of receptionists and completed my NVQ level 2 Team Leading. I enjoyed the workplace culture as i was face to face with the guests at all times, i enjoyed interacting with all guests especially the ones checking in for Weddings & Festivals. The hardest part of the job at the time was having been promoted from a front desk agent to front desk manager, as the team was a lot to take in at the time as i had the responsibility of running the hotel when the general manager was not in - weekends mainly. I had the responsibility of each guest's safety and also my team, i felt a great sense of pride having this responsibility as it helped me develop into my role. I thoroughly enjoyed this role and the hotel."
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same day on repeat. I learned how to function in a high stress environment as well as how to mediate between conflicting interests. The overall management was great, However in my department fairly new, so their were quite a number of set backs. My coworkers were great. We had a friendly environment created between us. The hardest part of the job was having to complete our list of duties in such a short amount of time, but that is also what made it challenging and fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with guests and ensuring a great experience. That always made me feel good."
good,"As Regional Director of Marketing for the Southern Region, I was able to flourish due to the autonomy afforded to me for running the business.  I was tasked with isolating potential areas of improvement, developing plans to execute towards resolving challenges and implementing those plans with the assistance of local site leadership.  This provided both the greatest challenges and rewards for this position as everything could be measured from the past to post implementation.."

I learned most of my skills at wyndham because this was like my second job asa housekeeper. Everyone was fridenly and nice. Management respected the employees like adults and work with employees as a team. I think the hardest part was bending to clean under certain areas, not such a good idea if you have bad back.

good,"The pay is okay, but with a lack-luster incentive program.  The job can be really repetitive, but that is the typical of all call centers.  The workplace culture and the people there are second to none though.  There is always something going on, and people are always having fun.

I have learned how to treat each employee differently, how to take into consideration other peoples concerns and views on certain situations, and allowing them to make decisions, good or bad, and helping guide them in the right direction. I have come a very long way with customer service skills and handling any situation  the best way possible. The hardest part of my job is being ""the bad guy"". It is tough work, but I do believe I have gotten a lot better at standing my ground and taking leadership to another level, without making the employees feel like I'm drilling them. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the fact that I love what I do, so I don't feel like I am working. It's incredible being back in the hospitality field and enjoying it just as much as I did before venturing out and trying new things.

My co workers are fantastic, everybody pitches in & helps each other, which I find important when working in a team.

Funnily enough, that is my favorite part of working at Wyndham; the guests. I absolutely love to see them smile when I am able to go above & beyond to help them. The most difficult part is just the time share side, even though I don't cover that area, I needed to learn everything so I could inform clients, I'm still proactively learning in that area to grasp a better understanding.

I learned how to work as a team and create ideas together to manage and set activities also how to make them more enjoyable for our guests. My coworkers were fun to be around and we had  a good chemistry considering the team was quite small, but even at a larger property it was just as pleasant. I would have to say the hardest part about working is when events had to be planned and set and handling the amount of guest we had, being that it was either a hit or miss we had to mentally prepare and physically prepare for the day. For last but not least the most enjoyable part of my job was setting events and having to come with ideas to make it as exciting and pleasurable as possible for our guest, there was honor in making something small something big for others stay."

They would keep track of customer reviews and treat it like a competition for each different part of the business like housekeeping, reception, maintenance, etc. All in all it was a fun and rewarding place to work, but the housekeepers definitely have the hardest job there."
good,"Made a daily schedule and work on it so it will be your habit for all day."
good,"My typical day at work was fun and very fast paced. I learned to work with my peers and customers. Management was good, my co-workers where great. The hardest part of my day was the administration work but the most enjoyable part was helping my agents excell."

good,Excellent place to work! My coworkers and management team name like a 2nd family to me. There was a lot of opportunity to learn and advance.
good,Good fun place to work. A lot of flexibility. I'm in IT so there is a lot of work since this a sales driven business.  Many systems to develop and maintain to keep up with sales demand.
good,Day to day overseeing property requirements and making sure employees are performing at a high level at all times. Proper management of employees provides best customer service. Employees felt that they could be open and bring and concerns regarding work and personal issues to me.
good,"Great company, commission based but the benefits are excellent. Timeshare sales is a fun business but you need to be financially secure during the learning curve."
good,"Enjoyable work place, nice enviroment and was able to meet plenty of new people and get to learn about different lifestyles of different types of people"
good,Overall awesome job and a good career path joining a team with high standars and execellent customer service skills. Great atomphere and good management and customers were overgrateful
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Wyndham. I was given many great opportunities. Wyndham treats their employees very well and offers great benefits, travel discounts, etc."
good,"Working here at the front desk has been a great experience, working in the hospitality business for a long time i see and meet people from all walks of life, from professional Athletes to Authors and Singer Song Writers. Management is very out going with all staff and is looking out for all of us, great bonuses and know how to keep the staff motivated to keep providing an A+ customer service satisfaction."
good,"Wyndham is a great company to work for. The opportunity to make exceptional money is presented everyday; however, one must be a tremendous salesman to capitalize. They offer no base salary, so employees are relying solely on commission. The atmosphere and employees at the Nashville location couldn't have been any better."
good,"A typical day at work was challenging because you never know what to expect.As an employee, I always came prepared. I learned a lot with this company and advanced to a higher position with the responsiblity of making sure everthing was up to par in the housekeeping department. Management was outstanding  working with the employees, but they were very attentive to every need. Unfortunately, co workers were few, but I have worked with dedicated and committed co workers. However, the challenging part of the job was lack of staff. In contrast, I was responsible for handling multiple tasks to ensure work was completed. Therefore, I enjoyed every aspect of my job and making sure the guests stay was as comfortable as possible during their stay."
good,"They know how to treat their sales staff, excellent product, income potential and benefits pkg are fabulous if you can sell.  Annual retention bonus can be a nice chunk of change and they run regular contests that include all expense paid vacations which are always a nice perk.  Presidents club trips are Top Notch!"
good,"Share our product with customers and close the sale.  I learned a great deal about sales.  The sales training was rigorous and in depth.  Management was amazing, co-workers were funny and entertaining.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of down time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping families make their dreams come true."
good,"Work is very stable, always 40 hours a week and the benefits were awesome and affordable. However, if you want to advance your career in the tourism industry, it either takes years or you don't move up at all. Work was very routine from day to day."
good,"I learned more about the resorts that were available to offer to my customers.A typical day consisted of answering calls from owners who wanted to book a vacation to one of the resorts that were available to them anywhere from Orlando Fl to Colorado and places in between. The management was fun they made everything fun  such as decorating cubicles for prizes, cheering us on when we were doing good and being there for us when we had a down day.The co workers were awesome, everyone seemed to get along well with each other and supported each other with booking tips. The hardest part of the job is when I transferred to another department and had to collect maintenance fees from the owners and hearing them complain that they went up without knowledge. The most enjoyable part was hearing from owners about their experiences at a particular place to share with new owners or other owners that would ask about a particular place."
good,Managing day to day activities is satisfying feeling when you know you done the best you could.
good,It was great experience and learnt a lot. worked in a busiest working environment. gained confident to deal with the customers at front line. Gained teamwork skills and proved through the success of the completion of the tasks.
good,"A typical day at work would be get to the D.O.B at 745am get our cleaning supplies in our buckets and grab our rags.Go out in the office grab a key from front desk person,grab our paper from our lead tellings us where we would be at and then wait until 8:00am and punch in.Then after everyone is punched in our boss would do a morning meeting.After our boss gets down we go to our assigned sections to start on a villa.Once you get to the villa you have to punch in a number on the phone to say your starting that villa and where you were.You had 2 hours to clean the whole thing.After you were done you had to punch the number back in to finsh it. you have so many villas to do.Once all the villas on your list were down you would have to call the office to find out if you were going to start another villa or help someone finish their villa.After everyone is done you take your cleaning supplys and rags back to the D.O.B and punch out and go home."
good,"The job had wonderful benefits, and there was a lot of potential for amazing paychecks. There was few discrepancies with my paycheck if ever, and the benefits that I received more than made up for them. My co-workers were enjoyable to be around, and the work environment was more than pleasant."
good,I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. We were like family. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,This is a fun filled environment that offers quick advancement.
good,A typical day would be started out by chatting with my staff and having an update on the happenings in the motel.
good,i love that i worked Independently. i learned how to work at a fast pace. i have skills that i could use in my personal life
good,From your introduction to the process until the end of the day you feel the encouragement of your leaders and peers as the applaud your successes and help pick you up from your failures. A prime example of what every office should be modeled after.
good,love whyndham companies and would love to work for them again
good,I would recommend people to work at Wyndham the only thing I'd I do not like New year's day do not offer any overtime. other than that Wyndham destination is a great place to work the only downfall is I do not feel like they pay you enough
good,"If you are in the food and beverage industry or the hospitality industry.  This is a good job to have because it is a full service hotel that has its own night club,  restaurant,  and bar."
good,"It can be a bit frantic at the front desk at times but once you know what you're doing, it gets easy and even fun! You just have to learn to be relaxed while you have three groups of people waiting in line at the desk and two people on hold."
good,Every day was a learning experience. It was never a dull moment and the issues that would arise would challenge you to think outside the box and be resourceful. Most communication was through email which sometimes lacked following up.
good,"My typical day at work would be constantly on the move, lot's of action and moving around.  At times it was exciting but also stressful. I enjoyed working with the public, so I felt very confident in this job."
good,It has been a while since being employed with Ramada. The location is no longer a Ramada but a Best Western Plus. During my employment there I learned much about the hospitality business that inspired me to truly make a career of it.
good,"Working outside greeting and meeting guest, learned I could still work outside and book people for timeshare presentation :)  Management was great! always there if we needed help. world culture was fun and the hardest part was working out in the heat when we had too. The most enjoyable was working with people"
good,"Loved it, great place.. I would have stayed longer. But I found a job closer to my house... better hours. People where great! Great benefits. Great place to work!"
good,"This company have good benefits , amazing employees , everyone treat each others with respect , Once you complete your 6 months as reservation agent and have good performance you are given good opportunities for advancement within the company"
good,I learned a lot in this hotel because this is my 1st time as a housekeeper. .The hardest part of work is mostly the guest will give a trouble. The most enjoyable part of the job is if the guest leave a tip or a appreciation letter.
good,"Outside of lackluster management at this particular location, the job was actually quite fulfilling. They give you plenty of opportunity to grow in the company and to cross train with other departments."
good,Good working part of a small team working in a busy environment and always keeping busy and when not busy I would help the head chef and always keep the kitchen clean and tidy
good,The atmosphere is delightful.  I would not have left  my position there were it not for my desire to be closer to my family. Management and co-worker alike work together as a team to ensure a productive and cohesive effort.
good,Enjoyed my short time with the company. At the time of my employment there were some unfortunate life circumstances that caused me to need to move on from the company. Great place to work.
good,Very good company (location) culture and work-home balance. Easy on working from home.  Sr. management is very knowledgeable and keeping people updating on what is going on in the company.
good,It was a great place to work.I had to leave because I started police academy.  A typical day i helped organize activities and help run the activities.
good,"A typical day at work involves going around the hotel to check things that needs to be fix. The management is great because they give you opportunity to grow in your career. The staff are nice and cooperative. Its like a family there. The hardest part of the job was during winter since we have to stay outside for an hour to make sure there was no slippery spots. The company provides parties during Christmas, end of summer BBQ and participate in gold star award every year."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but the upper management was severely lacking in discipline. With the new compensation plan, working in concierge and keeping your job is difficult. The work environment was always fun, with room to move up in and between departments."
good,"Working at night I had full responsibility for the hotel, its guests and property. I really enjoyed working with other staff and interacting with our guests. It was truly a culture of hospitality and meeting the needs of the customers we served.  Management was supportive and helpful and easy to communicate with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the guests.  The hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,"meetings every evening, everyone is very friendly great work place, everyone is very supportive, most enjoyable part go this job is actually making a deal and having everyone cheer you on. the hardest part is actually getting someone on the phone, and convincing them its not an waste of time. the management is incredible, like i mentioned everyone is very supportive."
good,great place to make great money meet great people and really have a great work and life balance. job is not easy but you can learn a lot from this company and apply it to your profession

good,Fun place to work. You get to meet lots of interesting people. Your part of a team. Customer service is the main point of this job.Great management and co-workers. Great benefits and 401k. Will miss my coworkers. Hardest thing is dealing with disgruntled locals.
good,Good job but it was a 24hr job. But id you are career orientated this is for you.
good,"Wyndham is a great company to work for. Being that it is so huge there are tons of opportunities for advancement or relocation. I tried being a OPC, when I struggled with that, I was able to transfer to a position that better suited by skills."

good,High pressure sales but a super fun environment! When in sales you are guaranteed to be around a lot of personality and that's Wyndham! Great benefits and resources!!
good,Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a great company to work for. The overall atmosphere is a very positive. There is room for advancement and hiring from within is encouraged.

good,I like this job but he was bad at management his hotel he went under. i really like the coworkers
good,Amazing people work-wise and people from around the world coming in to ski.
good,Working here was over  all a good experience . I want to work in another environment like this one . I would recommend this job to anyone else . Pays  extremely well and has hours
good,This job made me respect the hotel business. I learned so much from my managers and was truly an amazing place to work. My customer skills were advancing constantly and I took away a lot of great tips on working as a front desk agent.
good,"My shift can get very busy. I meet a lot of different people from all types of places. I have to have very good customer service skills and patience in order to work here. Some times I have to handle large sums of money for payment, so honesty is very important with my job also. I love my job, it's just that I need to find a part time job or a full time job for the day shift."
good,This was a great company to work for.  Working so close to the airport being able to her stories from travelers was awesome.  Management was great and helpful when dealing with private issues
good,I worked in the mornings with awesome co workers that made my day go by fast. I learned how to activate phones and also how to process bills for customers. Overall it was a great job I've I had.

good,"stocked for next shift.worked with public.took customer orders,worked on fryer and grill."
good,small business sometimes does not offer great pay or benefits it is fun meeting people from all over the world
good,"More than poor management ! Scheduling makes it impossible to make any plans as the operations manager changes almost daily . She is rude and a horribly asset to our team. She is threatening , unavailable , tired because she also works overnight at a competitor hotel in the same town."
good,"Hours were inconsistent, could never get an exact schedule on time.  The managers were usually mad, lots of gossip and talking behind others backs.  Favoritism"
good,"I answer the phones, check people in and out of the hotel. I make reservation. "
good,Wasn't a bad job even tho it was temporary. I liked my co-workers alot and the work enviroment
good,"my typical day at work is to get my room list from my supervisor then stock my cart then go clean the rooms. I clean toilets, bath tubs and I now have an Associate of Arts Degree that I want to get away from the endless cycle of the dead-end jobs."
good,"For me everyday is a good day the job is great rather than not having job. Everyday is struggle is part of life, anybody want to be treated with respect. I've learn in life you can learn from anybody including a child. I learn that the world struggle is communication on individual. So, In my part I'm doing everything I can to do my part to show communication by making initiative and doing my part by being phone,fax, e-mail, mail. l also learn to co- workers and management to be helpful. But the main thing is to execute and deliver 110% satisfaction to the best of my ability. The best thing is to be positive person smile and be happy and be helpful with the customer that way; I felt that I've done everything I can and be very proud and dedicate to my job. Always maintain professionalism at all times bad days or good days."
good,"A typical day at work was fasinating, i met new lovable people, cleaned the rooms, maintained the linen throughout the rooms even sanitized the rooms, vaccumed, and took out the trash."
good,its a good place to work but their is know place for advancement
good,"Working there was fun when the management would do their job."
good,Horrendously inefficient with poor management and a declining need for proper customer service. You will be lied to and then treated with utter disrespect.
good,The security for such a huge company is pretty low and could be better. The management in both jobs could use a big improvement as well. Better training needs provided and better communication along with maintenance.
good,"not much to advance, bad manager .The front desk manager is rude to customers, we get complains afters complains and the owner does not believe, were losing business because of him."
good,"I like the job, however I do not get enough hours. Wo paychecks are minimal. You dont work very many hours during the day and off about 3 days a week."
good,"Great working with the customers and being able to help, assist and train others as needed. I enjoy helping others learn when I am able. I love the hospitality industry. Clarion Inn was my very first hotel job and I would be happy to return,"
good,Nice place to work and nice hotel friendly staff and co workers. Working to many hours and cant keep staff. Like our regular  guest who stay here. They are nice and polite
good,As a banquet server i was well paid and got good tips from the conventions i worked or banquets i served. Only down fall is hours are very unreliable.
good,They aren't the greatest but they are not the worst either. You have to pick and choose co workers carefully and some of the employees I knew actually stole money
good,Experience with the Baymont under Wyndham Rewards was by far the most interesting job I've yet to hold. I love meeting new people. And you come across a lot of foreign people who share their experiences with you and it makes your day go by a little bit easier however the owner of this hotel I was working for wasn't willing to give raises in fact he would pay you just below minimum wage. If you're looking for a job to get hired on the spot and earn some fast Cash that's your go to you. But if you're not a people oriented person or can't handle concentrating under a great amount of stress it's not for everyone.
good,"I deal with customers face to face for the last five years in a busy hotel  this involves dealing complaints and other issues, i have use the computer a lot, siometimes i have to work on my with a manager, i would to ge a new new job related to my education and experience."
good,I enjoyed working there and would like to work there again I made good friends and learned to work fast and accurate learned communication skills and how to work as a team
good,There would only be one thing that I would change and that would be the rate of pay. The one they that is nice about it it is the friendly customers that come in to stay
good,"Working here was great. But however the there weren't any benefits, poor parking, the management needs some work along with upgrades to the resort and rooms."
good,Fast paced job environment for younger and older crowds. May not be suitable for all. Must drink coffee to sustain energy. Pay is every Friday. They have direct deposit.
good,"Discrimination and unfair to labor practice and high turnover in the maintenance department. The good thing on Wyndham is PTO, sick leave and Vacation pay."
good,"Working at family market was always a casual day, i learned a lot about the government benefits and as well about how to deal with unhappy customers."
good,"I was the General Manager in control of both the front and back of the house."
good,Decent job with a lot challenges everyday. Employees were loyal and worked as a team very well.
good,"•	Answer inquiries pertaining to hotel services, guest registration, and travel directions, or make recommendations regarding shopping, dining, or entertainment."
good,Working there some days was hard cause they r outside and the rest of the time was good i liked it there i had good boss nice Gm and head housekeeper was pretty nice i did my job every time i came in
good,"Well I can go on and on but will keep this short. First off I love Wyndham it’s a great cultural company and a great brand , it’s the best timeshare company around. Corporate HQ is filled with great leaders and show you how family is all about away from home. Going to the resort was another opportunity I decided to pursue and learned a lot. But poor Mgmt and lack of professionalism. Supervisors go on vaca and they forget to make sure their employees get paid. Some sales reps and managers lack integrity over at the resort, and talk down to the coordinators as if you were a slave and piece of candy wrap. Tried to resolve with mgmt and clear the air but they just brush you off and just so they don’t admit theirs shame and mistakes they just rather see you leave or quit on your own terms. Lack of leadership at the resort!! Sad to say it’s a 5 star resort but with no professionalism and a whole bunch of corruption!!!!! I hope HR can really dig deep and see what really goes on there. It’s all about who you know to get advancement. Don’t work in contracts !!!!!! Trust me"
good,I have worked at a hotel with the Wyndham system and the system was very easy  to learn but the management at the hotel was very poor she did not know how to handle people and I find that is not good for management but the system Was easy to learn thank you
good,"Currently work in reservations Department and want to switch departments, Can't be considered for a new position if you don't currently meet goal in current  position. They should consider  speaking one on one before making the decision to see why goal not being met. "
good,"Wyndham was an excellent experience for me, it thought much knowledge in Vacation Ownership and Hospitality standards. Respected all cultures.  I would say the hardest part was the many changes in pay.  I loved making vacation dreams come true."
good,I really love my job. Wish they had healthcare benefits. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting different people on a daily basis. I have learned how to deal with different situations in different ways.
good,job was fun got to meet all types of people and operate a hotel overnight was kind of peaceful by your self operate and make sure customers are taken care of set up breakfast
good,typical day consits of u have a board of rooms you had to clean. what i learned about this job was take your time no need to rush. my co workers were great and very helpful. the hardest part of the job was when people didnt check out for a while
good,"I enjoyed working for a hotel. I would come in at night. Clean and prepare coffee for the night guest. I would file paper work from the day, enter in information about the guest, make reservations, keep check on the guest, answer phones, set wake up calls, run credit cards. I worked graveyard shift. At first it was creepy because I was the only one there. I was sad when the owner said he was closing down."
good,It's mainly routine day in day out. There is really not much to tell because I have no room for growth.
good,"Typical day at work would include prepping food for the day. Washing, cutting, mixing what i need for my shift. I learned how to mange my time for the venue for the day and or week. Management wasn't the best very sloppy. There would be days when we would have to substitute ingredients but we did our best to keep taste and quality up to par. Co-workers always worked as a team and helped out when needed. The hardest part of the job would be not receiving any benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the events and buffets would come out great. Nothing could beat having a good team that can keep up with the output and quality that we always kept number one."
good,i njoyed working with others to keep the guest happy and satisfied
good,"I loved the job, work, and the guest that stayed at motel. I would get to work at 8 a.m., would get my list of rooms for day, I would strip linen from rooms already checked out and et laundry started. I than would clean my list of rooms and get laundry done before I would clock out."
good,OK company to work for depending on the location seeing each location is run differently which can cause confusion for employees traveling between locations.
good,"Es una buena compañia, pero el querer mejorar y surgir es dificil, siempre tienen una excusa para no darte una oportunidad, ese fue mi caso."
good,"If you like working for people and helping make a difference in travelers experiences. This is the company for you. Every day there is something different to accomplish, outside of your day to day duties. It is an ever changing environment. I thoroughly enjoyed the employee supported environment."
good,"i enjoyed workiing with my crew getting the work dune,we would get what needed to be dune our work would be dune and we went to lunch ,after lunch we would go and help the other girls"
good,"my manager was one of a kind. she would work with you on any type of condition. she was fair.  it was a family like atmosphere. this job is only like a supplement job, not a job to support family"
good,"Overall the company is great, it has great benefits and environment. It mostly depends on which property you work at and hoping you have a good management. Management at times can be very one sided and some managers may take advantage of your position to do their work while falling behind on your own responsibilities that fall on your title. It can be overwhelming and incredibly stressful but the rewards and the self achievements make it worth it. Not all managers are the same, I just happen to have one that was an emotional roller-coaster with a lot of leverage behind her words and with poor leadership skills. Just need to stay strong through the abuse and focus on whats in front of you."
good,I worked for the travelodge in Orlando FL. I loved it! I met people from around the world and got special perks at Disney and Universal studios. The hotel its self was gross and management could care less
good,"My overview of this job is okay would be better if management was more organized and more perfectional,but the job is an amazing job if you like to be alone and work independently. folding  and cleaning can be a very good and realaxing"
good,"Management is poor and they don't have the training, knowledge and experience to try to keep this resort working under the same goal. In my opinion, but worldmark by wyndham like company is great."
good,"It's a great place to work, however this particular hotel is seasonal only, so you work for 8 1/2 months, and there is NO benefits...other then that., You have a full-time job for the season"
good,Great working place but there wasn't any opportunity to advance. I learned a lot while working at the Super 8.  I was unhappy with my hourly wage.  I am looking for more per hour.
good,"I worked hard at this job, but rarely ever saw the fruits of my labor. We got paid very little and hardly ever got any tips at all. We had one short break, but only if we got 3 rooms done before break time otherwise we did not receive a break at all."
good,"This  job  keeps moving all shift long. The phone never ceases ringing--and from one hour to the next things can change. We deal with third party vendors and all sorts of outside vendors and contractors. We handle cash and charge transactions and each shift is responsible for a $200.cash drawer that we balance at the beginning of each shift. The job is challenging and most of the time rewarding. Days are spent answering phones, booking reservations and helping hotel patrons. I have excellent customer service skills and am very patient.Management is inexperienced and resents being put in the manager position-but she does the job to the best of her ability.The people I work with are so awesome and professional.The hardest part of the job is interacting with the owner of the hotel. The owner is not from America and does not understand many words and things spoken in English. I have worked here long enough to develop a rapport with the owner and we understand each other. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers--most of them are just a joy!"
good,"not one of may favorite employers how ever i did appreciate the free range to self motivate and be my own boss. the astmosphere was fun and motiving, although the seasons are slower than anticipated."
good,"I loved working at the Wyndham Hotel & Resort, the only problem I have is that I felt a bit like a threat to others because of my continuous college studies when it came down to position wise, but other than that its awesome there."
good,world wide experience moving form one port to the next waking up a different place everyday was once within a life time within Hawaii
good,". Responsibility and consistent task"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the work environment. I loved being able to have a good relationship with my fellow coworkers, and being able to have a set schedule each day I came into work. I also really enjoyed helping guests solve their difficulties with the hotel, and book their vacations."
good,given the right tools this company will project your career in the direction you wish to go in your professional life.
good,"a typical day at work was good cleaning rooms."
good,loved the job but is not stable as the economy is not stable  but it is a great lace to work 
good,Working in the hotel industry allows for meeting all kinds of people and it was a wonderful place to work. 
good,"Staff and higher ups always were kind and welcoming."
good,"You get a lot of benefits like health insurance, dental, vision, 401K and so on. Very fast pace job, a lot of learning. Management is very helpful, as long as you're ready to learn"
good,"I will recommend to any one to work to this company, because it has work flexibility, safety, good salary and the Managers cooperate to their employees."
good,"Great job good people tons of skills learned, especially in terms of being able to learn the neccessary skills to save somebodys life and to insure there safety"
good,I been working for Wyndham for almost 3 Year and I really like it. Everybody here are great. They made me felt welcome when I started working here. they are my second family.

good,"Wyndham provides a clean, pleasant place to work.  The Manager is excellent and attentive to company and personnel needs.  Personnel work as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide a clean, pleasant place for customers to spend a night or two, and because of their satisfaction, meeting them on a return visit!  Hardest part is high customer time (like Hall of Fame) when the lobby is full and you can only do so much at once -- causing folks to wait.  Very pleasant to be able to provide a reasonably-priced place to spend a night - or a week."

good,When I work there it was called Ramada Inn.  I don't know who Wyndham is.  I like the staff and the Inn Keeper was a nice boss and very up beat.  My manager was helpful to me while I was there.  I worked alone as I worked the third shift.  There was a security guard on duty and we were it for the night.  I learned the procedures to business as an auditor.  The hardest thing about this job was the lifting of cots and cribs when guests needed them.  The best part was the audit and directing the guests.  The concentration to detail and being on the computer made the time fly.

good,The best thing I can say is meeting the customers was the best part of my job.
good,"A typical day at work was finding out who you were going to help progress in their life that day, and what new places you were going to experience.  The traveling to different locations throughout the US, Hawaii and the Caribbean kept the excitement for this position and helping employees further advance was the most rewarding.  Unfortunately the ""travel industry"" experienced a down-turn and took away a lot of what I had previously looked so forward to on a daily basis."

good,"I was a Housekeeper in the Lindsay location. It is very fast paced! Every room you cleaned is inspected and has to be cleaned in a very small time frame. Also, the other housekeepers that are there had been there from the opening of that location and seemed like they were entitled to do whatever they wanted. The managers there are amazing though and do their best to help you in anyway."
good,My work experience there was great they trained you well and the pay and tips was excellent kinda just done at your own pace then when you was done helped other housekeepers so they didnt get left behind before you go home
good,"Excellent  training. The best  that I  have experienced  in this industry  so far. I  didn't  like  the rotation system. It  sometimes  caused  goals to become  unrealistic.  Management  was diverse, firm and understanding.  Goals  were clearly  stated.  Co-workers  were  great.  Overall  a wonderful  experience  and a fun  place  to work."
good,I have received a lot of knowledge and skills working at the hospitality industry which can be always useful in any aspects of life. Meeting different people and making sure we over-exceed their expectations is definitely a great challenge. I enjoyed working for such a big company as Wyndham hotel group and I have been proud of being a manager for such a big company.
good,"Sales is a tough business and vacation ownership ever tougher.  But even so, I had a wonderful DOS and Manager who always encouraged me to reach higher and farther.

good,I enjoyed working for this company. I never had any issues with communication and everyone is pleasant. I was on contract so my time was limited. Everyone was cooperative!

The best part of the job was that it was slow paced and if you had homework they let you work on it while there was no customers in the lobby. Customer service was a big part of the job and it helped set that mindset for me.

good,I would take care of customers and their complaints. I also prepared schedules. In my time there I made good friends. The hardest part of the job was handling the customers and employees complaints. I always wanted to be in the hotel industry since I was a little girl and it was an exciting opportunity.

Most enjoyable part was meeting new people and expanding helpful friendships."
good,"Typical day would be greeting guests, but also doing housekeeping during winter and setting up breakfast. you basically do it all there, it's like running your own hotel"
good,"At the hotel, I have days where there are just not a lot of people coming in. Now, that provides for excellent job security, because there always has to be someone at the front desk, but at the same time it creats a lot of down time. With this down time, I would normally study for exams or go around checking for little irregularities in the hotel. Being the only employee on duty, I would be my own manager and manage my time accordingly. It would become exremely difficult when I would get a swarm of guests who all came in at the same time because I would also have to be helping the current guests with things that they required, so I owuld have to manage several things at once. This, however, was also the most enjoyable part of the job- as I am a busy body and find that I enjoy work more when there is plenty of work to be done."

I than head to my office and run a "" mil "" report and this comes up in Microsoft Excel and now I have every guest in order by status code, I began to go guest by guest on their sheets to match marketer to guest and make sure that either the guest is in fact staying with us and has an in-house booking with our sales or not, if everything does match up I than make sure it is assigned to the correct marketer. other than that I do side projects for the VP of Marketing.

good,"A typical day working at Super 8, one of Wyndham's popular resorts, was relaxed, and was generally slow paced until customers arrived. There were not many tasks so if you like an easy and laid back job, this is it. The hardest part of the job was assisting people by phone because frankly, some people are hard to understand.

good,The atmosphere of Wyndham was a great experience. Friendly leaders and caring co workers. I enjoyed every day i walked in the doors.  Would recommend this position to anyone.
good,"Highly paid for successful sales results, but they also tend to drive you into the ground to get the numbers they want.  Lots of Sales Mgr. turnover, with each a different style/requirements.  This made it frustrating at times."

The hardest part of the job is guest complaints and not because I cant handle complaints but i do not like when a guest is unhappy. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiling faces of our guest as well as the employees.
good,"their was a lot of small details in working front desk, having to manage everything at once and provide excellent customer service was a trait that was improved dramatically. But once you get the hang of the major factors of the job the little details begin to fall into place. I appreciated the independence that was provided by being an host and even on slow days work would be enjoyable, because of the relations  made with customers. The toughest part was learning every single detail, because one minute error could mess up the next shifts flow of client housing and cash report."

good,Enjoyed working for the owners never had a problem.  When ever they needed me I always came in but due to circumstances they had to move back to South Africa and that's how we departed.
good,"This company really takes care of the associates.  Many amenities in the corporate office like and on-site fitness center, wellness program, flu shots, biometric screenings, great cafeteria, on-site store and even barista bar (Starbucks).   "
good,"typical work schedule was 6am-3pm, cleaned showers and surrounding areas, completed other assigned duties"
good,Sales is a pressured environment enough as it is. But having poor judgement and bad knowledge of job requirements makes things a far bigger struggle. The job and rewards were more than enough to keep one interested. Poor decisions from a decent location.
good,Its a slow pace job but there were times it was busy. I did the overnight shift so customers were scarce most times. I learned about patients and keeping myself busy during slow time. The people I worked with were very interesting and hard to communicate with due to the language barrier. I most enjoyed my job when I got to speak with different customers about their travel journeys.
good,Great work environment. Room for advancement. Great pay and raises. The hardest part is making sure guest dont destroy room with smoke and defiling furniture. The most enjoyable was enployee bonuses.Luncheons once a month to show appreciation to employees. Discounts on room and events.
good,company was gave lots of options such as working around ones schedule and working with them through family problems and issues. The work enviorment was far from hostile so every one came to work with a smile on thier face this made work less streesing than what it already plans out to be.
good,One of the best companies and places I've ever worked.  Terrific company culture and fantastic co-workers.

good,"Great place to work, but upward mobility is limited. Qualified as a manager off the street, it will take me at least 5 years to make that position now that I am an entry level employee. It is frustrating that someone with limited experience and education makes the same pay as I do with decades of managerial experience and a degree... That is the same all over Las Vegas, not just Wyndham."

good,Its a fun workplace. Very comfortable areas to work. Co- workers are very nice. They are very interactive. They always in stock with all supplies needed for cleaning rooms.
good,"I have worked with coccas,  dunking donuts, and Ramada inn. Hours were good and the management was good at times,  There is some fast pace request for rooms at the hotel, but for the most part,  you have 8 hours to get your work done. Sometimes you have at the hotels, 12 to 17 rooms to do. At dunking donuts it is a fast pace job. However, there are a lot at times that it. Is slow. Which at that time you can get your cleaning and stocking done."

Although this resort was in Hawaii, it is also a worldwide corporate environment; staff may look relaxed and carefree, yet daily tasks and assignments were calculated and managed carefully.  Customer service was the top priority and desired end result in any transaction or communication.  I love a corporate culture and daily complex challenges that are ever-changing!"

From drywall, sanding, tiling and wallpapering when we were getting the property ready to open, to audit, assisting the manager in daily tasks to helping out with the housekeeping and laundry when needed.  The owner and manager was always helpful and kind.  He also treated us like family.  As I still to this day am close to their whole family."

I was to make sure that all persons are of age to rent rooms and to provide a safe and friendly environment.I also worked for the cafe and would open for breakfast.

good,the company its self was good to work for but the owners did not care one bit about you or tired to help in any way. I loved my job and meeting the new faces and would love to find another job with this company
good,I inspected spark plug boots down a conveyor belt and put them in a box for the last inspector.  Then I got them ready to be shipped. The more product you put out the better.
good,Any Wyndham property is a great one to work for. The people are always friendly. They do have a computer system that is not great but it does the minimum that you need.
good,you come in wake up people and get them ready for there day and breakfast. after thats done its time for the showers. Then nap and get them up for lunch and activities after that. If they were not felling good we still would get them up and have them sit in their rooms. The hardest part of working with the elderly was taking care of the dying.

good,There was only 3 employees and myself. We all worked well together. I found that employees work harder and with more positive attitudes when they have a boss that does the same. I never put them down. I always made sure to give them positive feedback and positive criticism. I had to hire all new people when I became manager but I never had to fire anyone here. People came and went occasionally but not because they didn't like the job mainly because they needed better pay.
good,"My days are pretty laid back. I have yet to have any problems. Ive learned that there is actually a job out there that could really fit an individuals personality. Management there is awesome. Dont recall a bad moment under the management of the Super 8. The co-workers are cool but we usually work individually on a shift. Theres no hard part of anything i do at my job. I love the solitude, respectful guest, and a dedicated staff. I plan to be here for a very long time."

Then moved over to house keeping, where we would clean the rooms at a fast pace. Management was good and taught me everything I needed to know.

We became a family and would have company dinners for holidays that seemed more life family get togethers. Had they not closed, I would have still been working there even though the salary was less than desirable, it was the people and the atmosphere that made this a great place to work."
good,"It's a good place to work if thats the kind of experience you've had since you were a legal age to work.Personally I prefer factory work.And more time to train.2 Days hardly is enough time to train then go off on your own.It's a nice place to stay for vacation though,I guess."
good,"This is one very good organization to work for. They have goo compensation and advancement programs, and also a good employee training ."
good,I told another job in the nursing home to get more skills under my belt.

There work/ home life balance that is offered to employees is also wonderful."
good,"You get to come in and converse with some of the best people you will meet who is truly there to help you including your co workers and management. Management not only wants to help you but, they also have to. A sale for you means money for them so they will try very hard to make you money. The toughest part of this job is hearing ""NO"" and sometimes seeing lousy checks for a certain time frame. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are making sales, you are making very good money. You only put in 2-4 hrs per day truly working and the money you can make is amazing.

Great management keeping the place clean for our guest. co workers were awesome when a bus comes a little bit earlier and a few rooms need to be finish they all work as a team and have the guest rooms cleaned before they check in. Hardest part of job is when someones calls in sick and have extra rooms to do but always get it done by team work.

good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership is a great company to work for that allows ample opportunity to make a great living, while interacting with new clients every day. The management staff is always there to help keep motivation and striving to have the success you want to have."
good,"a typical day at work would be introducing myself to a couple interested in owning a time-share, spend approximately 90 minutes with them telling them the benefits of our ownership, proceed to show them the resort and then show them what it takes to become one of my newest owners with wyndham resorts, co-workers are easy to work with, the job is very enjoyable, i like to interact with people and meet new people"
good,It was a great experince meeting the new people from all over the world. I learned different things from different cultures of life. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was having to tell people our hotel was filled and had to point hem in a different direction.
good,"nice place to work, good benefit, and nice compensation........."
good,"I would work there again, if I ever wanted to do front desk again"
good,"was were i did my practicum, had to do hours to complete schooling. would love to work for them again. greatest experience i have ever experienced. would enjoy a career in the airport someday."
good,It was my ideal place to work. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were being rude.
good,Great people and excellent management. The whole time I was there I had the management's support.
good,Customer Service Greet guest upon arrival answer multi phone line handle money manage front desk
good,I like this job because i like people. I sell myself and i like to help people with their needs.
good,"Timeshare isn't an industry for everyone. But if you are looking to put in the work and focus on customer obsession, Wyndham is great company and will provide you to opportunity to make great money and advancement."
good,First time doing such an long commute to any work place especially by transportation kinda was an hassle but i manage broke a couple sweats also enjoy you meet different people along the way.
good,Some of the best sales people I had the opportunity to work with. It is a never ending hunt. You don’t get to a place where you can relax. Top sales people would miss first level bonus. It’s for sure a grind but everyone is grimy with you.
good,"A typical day at work is assisting the General Manager by making sure that all shifts are covered and everything runs smoothly,  rooms are clean and ready for our guests when they arrive, and to manage the daily operation of the hotel. I have learned how to run Quick Books for payroll, pay vendors, ordering, and etc. The workplace has a family atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is fulling the work schedule because we are a smaller branch of the Wyndham hotel chain and to find good workers with a good work ethic. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people and making sure their needs are met."
good,"As a sales executive, the company provides two weeks of classroom training plus continuing development and coaching for long term growth. They also provide you with your leads. It’s up to you to sell them."
good,"I liked it. Great place to work if it fits your personality. I would work there again, if I am living in the area. Great people, great environment, great job!"
good,"This job helped me learn the basics of customer service and satisfaction. Furthermore, it helped me to learn crucial skills in retail such as answering questions on the spot. Furthermore, it also helped me learn how to handle and count money effectively."
good,I enjoyed working there as a housekeeper I always like to have a system down when I clean rooms and it's an excellent company to work for they are flexible and work with you on your schedule
good,Worked at this bussiness for about 3 years became a great working experience. Great management. Also they helped when I had personal issues where very understanding
good,They have many positions and its very easy to transfer within the company. Easy to move up. The marketing job is very lucrative but very stressful at the same time.
good,This was the best job I could ever ask to have! nick and suzy are the best bosses and they're very professional and care about their employees. They gave me chances I didn't deserve because they saw potential in me to do better and I was beyond blessed to have worked there for almost 4 years.
good,This was a great company to work for worked here for 15 years. Had the opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge. Was given the opportunity to advance.
good,"I was a hard worker and everything like public, house keeping, laundry and helped make bed's I enjoyed doing it all and the hours where good we also had team's I liked working as a team or individual my co workers helped each other every day especially on weekends."
good,It was a great place to work! You also meet a lot of different people! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a job like this! The staff were great to work with as well!
good,I enjoyed working here. Very Nice and kind management. Friendly people who checked in. Clean environment and accessible by buses and close to the metro stations.
good,"I always manage to do everything well, as well as it is very easy to do I find it fun to do everything but the part I don't like is that I had to do a ton of the work mostly myself."
good,"It’s a really good place to work . Felt like a second home . The staff are wonderful , friendly , and always happy . I enjoy working and helping everyone around me"
good,Wyndham was a great job for me. I was able to work different shift I was paid fairly and always got dates off that I requested. I enjoyed all my customers especially from different countries or states. It’s a beautiful thing to meet New people from different locations.
good,"I would arrive talk with staff. go over the days arrivals etc make sure duties were getting done, I would go through arrivals for the day. I also did accts receivable for the property. I would set up blocks of rooms. Order supplies, Check with maintenance  and housekeeping to see how there doing. Converse with sales and banquets, I would forecast revenues for the next week and do schedules. I would walk the property and much more as stuff arises."
good,"Management has changed a lot since I worked there, but when I did work there it was very laid back. Paid above server minimum wage, plus tips. I love my job!"
good,Its a great company that offers great benefits as well as a generous amount of vacation time.As well as this is the only company I have worked for that you acutally see the vp and other higher ups actually engage with the employee's.
good,"I was overall satisfied with working at Wyndham. A family atmosphere with a group and individual training."
good,Working here was great! I got plenty of experience with front desk staff! I was the night auditor here. I did a lot of reservations & checked customers in & out.
good,I loved working for Wyndham and would give anything to have the chance to work for them again I left in my own terms do to personal reasons. They treat everyone equal and no one is left out its one big family!
good,The internship was different than any other hotel job in that we worked out of a central office that operated everyday 9am-5pm. Anyone who had not checked in within that time frame had a packet with everything they need locked in a box outside with a phone that connected them to central reservations who walked them through getting their stuff and to their property. Our job revolved around preparing the guests packets for arrival since we were responsible for every property within about a 5 mile radius and each property was vastly different. Our inability to handle any billing was both great yet difficult because it gave us a more concise job but left us unable to help the guest with any questions or concerns. Overall a great segway into the hospitality business.
good,"Winter is always the main subject in Breckenridge, Colorado. Most guest interactions were to help provide a good winter experience. This helped create excellent relationships with the guests and front desk. The culture was great and good management helped create that culture."
good,"Really enjoyed my work there and the people I worked with, Loved the discount you get when you travel and stay at another hotel with same brand. Benefits were good and pay was not bad either."
good,"They were some busy and slow days that I enjoy both. Because working on a busy day it will go fast and I learned more stuff. And slow days it will be boring but at the same time, you have more time to catch up stuff. And it's a beautiful Resort to work and have fun that enjoys every moment."
good,"Looking for something similar to current position with all the benefits and same hours. I am great with communication skills and also trilingual. I speak French, Arabic  and English."
good,"We would start in the am with a sales meeting and then wait for people to come in to show them the traveling options available to them.  The culture was driven, management was great, and I learned to sell.  The best part was meeting so many people and learning to constantly improve my sales.  Worked with great people.  The hardest part was when we didn't have people to sell to and sat around motivating each other or watching movies on sales procedures and training."
good,"Very busy and competitive the training is excellent, the job is fast paced . many people strive to sell in Disney there is a sky is the limit mentality with money to be made because who doesn't want to visit Disney ."
good,Comedy Zone was my first serving job ever. It is very fast paced with all patrons being seated at the same time. It definitely requires attention to detail and being able to think on your toes.
good,"Everyone at the Ramada are very nice and forgiving, there Is alot of helping others. When there is a problem the problems get solved right away the only thing I don't like about the Ramada is there is no benefits but they are very understanding with life situations and are good with scheduling things and letting us know about it."
good,"Typical day:  email, reviewing project deliverables, testing, responding to user questions, collaborating with team.  Learned more about Oracle, managing tasks for the project team, UAT and providing feedback to technical developers.  I loved my management; they were very supportive and took the time to listen.  Hardest part of the job was the resources, sometimes spread too thin.  Loved working with people across all parts of the business."
good,Overall great fast paced clean n professional n people were great to work with an management was good also food and menu was to die for food was tempted an made to order hotel was beautiful and we got to use pool n gym as well as bar on off days.i lived it had to relocate to Minneapolis MN..
good,"Wyndham is a great place to work because they offer advancement opportunities, great work hours, great mentors, and they genuinely care for the employees and their success. Highly recommend working here."
good,i loved this job. you get to dress up every day and make reservations for people and check people in and out. it was a very nice and relaxing job. the best job ive ever had.
good,After working in the customer & guest services for many years I would not want to do anything else. There are many hotel chains out there to choose from. Stay with one.
good,"It was a great experience in Management role. I have learned management and leadership skills. "
good,"I learned a lot working at Wyndham. Never made much money though. Wyndham Oceanside is not the best place to have a stable job. The quality of tours are not the best and they will pay you hourly salary, but will discount the salary once you have a sale that week. I really enjoyed management and they do put a lot of effort in training. No one stays, the turn over is really high."
good,My boss is amazing.  Flexible and does not micro-manage.  Team atmosphere and great sources when I need answers to questions.  Ability to cross train and  further my knowledge in this industry.
good,"This was a good place to work. Good hours, got a promotion, one weeks paid vacation every year. Myself and other employees worked well together as a team to keep things running smoothly."
good,"Great company to work for. I left because of schedule conflicts but loved the company. Lots of opportunities to grow and very good benefits. They have a happy work, fun and life balance."
good,Typical day at work is customer service support. Almost everyday I learn something new from the clients. Management are always updated and they see to it that all the employees are well trained to improve their work efficiency. Work culture is always to have a team player attitude and a winning attitude. The hardest part of my job is how to delight the customers to the highest but the best part of my job is when I accomplish my job on a daily basis but above all is when I delight the customers to the highest.
good,The peopele are very friendly and helpful. Amazing company with good work life balance. the techonlogy is very old school. The Management is trying to bring in lots of changes after the Spin off with Wyndham Hotels group
good,"Especially for younger adults, this place is a good place to have your foot in the door and to begin the steps of a career if you are willing to work. You have to be able to think on your feet."
good,"It was a fast-paced work environment with jokes going around the office floor. The learning experience was how to work with multiple people with multiple projects and deadlines, in a short time. The managers would give us the opportunity to try new technics to grow in the company."
good,"Honestly speaking,all day a have arrived on time at work exactly at 6 o'clock.Even if it was difficult to get up early I could handle it, I used to fell asleep earlier in the nights.So,days were so enjoyable have had enough friends from number of foreign guests.The staff members were so friendly with every individual they assist not only guests but to their colleagues as well.Managers used to to be so reasonable that getting on with people for them considered as plain sailing.Managers to make us high qualified every 2 weeks made trainings after working hours .they tought us how to make a pont and reach,about serves and histrories of servings .Certainly per work place has it is own hard time there was in lunch time when our restaraunt for breakfast changes as for lunch there should not be seen things from breakfast ,for example, some spoons or knifes are should be delivered to cleaning place.So,lunch consist of group of people from conferences there will be just  few waiters for serving, as for 150 guests 6 or 7 waitres  to deliver their meals and only this a bit complex .However,at the end of my retiring time I was able to handle it.Actually,the most enjoyable part was in the morning when all breakfast waiters and waitress gathered and started their job together.So,I had really fun together with them."
good,"Come prepared to make money. "
good,"Typically, days are busy checking in and our guests. Enjoyable place to work. There are many repeat guests attesting to the friendliness and efficiency of staff"

good,"This was probably my best job opportunity but it came at a time in my life when I was distracted by personal problems and I allowed it to ruin a great job."
good,"My experience with the group I worked with was fun and tight knit. A lot of use have known each other for years so we were like family. Mgmt, including SVP/VP were great to talk to and had an open door policy. Very down to earth environment."
good,it's was so nice to work there. My trainers and co-trainees are so kind and cooperative. It is so great to be a member of that wonderful company. That's all...
good,Wyndham flagstaff resorts is a fun place to work with lots of very understanding people who will accommodate with  your life away from work. On the down side at times it get chaotic due to  miscommunication. They often do not order the supplies on time and will leave you supplyless for weeks even months. But most of the time it is a great job and one of the best I've had very willing to work with your little corks.
good,hated the pay way under paied in the Branson Area. loved the job and the staff and benefits. Would recommend it if you are not a one income family. But it could just be the area I hear Branson is like that everywhere.
good,great team work and career growth they will lead you and give you such a wonderful opportunities in your career and develop you as a good leader in the near future.
good,"Wynham vacation Resort was a very nice place to work,I would and have recommended people to work there; "
good,"While working at WVO I had the opportunity to learn on the job as opposed to coming in with years of experience. They had faith in me, and taught me valuable work & life skills. Without the opportunity to work there, I wouldn't be who I am today. I highly value the 5 years of job experience I had at Wyndham, and will always respect the company."
good,"WDN is a great place to work.  Company leadership is wonderful.  The entire Senior Leadership Team is accessible to all associates.  Workload is extremely busy, but the the workday passes very quickly due to the variety of  tasks.  Very collaborative, excellent team."

good,WVO is an awesome place to work! Everyone there is awesome! Management really cares about their employees. They go above and beyond to make sure you're successful.
good,Wyndham has a relaxed atmosphere. I was not micro-managed which made the job fun. Everyone worked well together even across departments. I worked directly with managers and supervisors of other teams to reach a common goal.
good,"Fast paced fun and exciting place to work. I met a lot of great people at the airport,coming into Houston.The job was challenging however it was very rewarding providing guest services.We were provided with free lunch and access to showers.Also discounts on hotel accommodations"
good,"The most enjoyfull part of the job was when you walked into the rooms and you could feel and smell the cleaness of the room. Also, when the people felt at home and welcomed to the hotel."
good,Everyone here is so great to work with - work/life balance is encouraged and CEO is an amazing man and very respected throughout the company. Lots of perks!
good,"I loved this job, very very much. I only left this job to become a stay at home father. due to a seemingly endless change of ownership and policy changes that would happen almost daily with the constant oownership changes. And with my wife working an amazing job make three times as much as me it just was no longer a good fit as my title as manager was always in limbo as the property was sold to new owners almost once per year over the final three years."
good,Need a good location to do well in CMP. I had a good location and did fairly well. Work hard. Stay positive. Pitch everyone and you will see $1200 - 2000 checks every week. Slack off 1 week and it will be $300. It is commission so you work for your own money.
good,Wyndham Vacation Ownership is an exceptional place to work. This is the only company that I have ever worked for where the management team actually makes an effort to great and give a positive feedback to their employees.
good,"Fun place to work with a good, friendly environment, like working with family."
good,"It was a nice place to work at. The owner is a nice guy. I was in housekeeping so cleaning rooms was my job duty. My issue would be is if you forgot to wipe the top of the mirror for dust, while working in another room across the building, the manager or owner would have you stop and go all the way there just to dust off the top of one single thing even though he had a rag to do so himself."
good,Not really sure why I am rating this business as it is only a small part of my job responsibilities.  I deal very little with the ownership of the condo units.
good,"I learned a lot, I enjoyed the environment . Cooperation with other staff.  Meeting and greeting groups of people and seeing that protocol and requirements were done as requested and follow through was done as ordered."
good,Wyndham Worldwide is a company that is very great to work for and give you plenty of vacation time.  Everyone is very helping and supportive. Definitely a great 3 years of my life

good,"Working here was a Great experience as i meet different people from different culture and background. You get to know people their story get to be part of their life's for  that moment. Management  is very supportive and encourages the employees to work hard and and complains of customer service is dealt with immediately. Also they see to it that the working environment  for employees is pleasant and all their employees are happy and working as a team . for them team work is very important and they train everyone to help each other out."

good,Competitive culture with world class sales training and great compensation and employee benefits. Many avenues for career growth and development.
good,"Wyndham Hotels was a great place to work. I personally tried to work at other hotel chains but always found myself back at Super 8. The minute you walk in you are welcomed by staff with open arms, they not only care about their guests but also care about each other. I found my experience at Super 8 by Wyndham to be more than a career. We were family, we helped each other. "
good,"I love working for Salina Super 8, Amazing company, Management is wonderful and works with employees. Co-workers are amazing and very easy to get along with."

good,"A typical Day (Night) at work includes checking in or out guests, getting them anything they ask for, and striving to be the best Customer Service Representative I can be to make the guests as happy as possible. I've learned much about how to engage with customers to make their stay with us a pleasant one, and have also learned how to manage my time effectively, work under tiring conditions (night shift), and furthered my knowledge of the uses of Excel when doing the Night Audit. The management is great and very supportive; very willing to work with you when it comes to scheduling, especially when comes to needing a day off. They are also very forgiving if you make a mistake, and take the time to show you what you may have done wrong and how to avoid doing it in the future. The co-workers are great; we're like a big family and always look out for each other. I know I can depend on them if an emergency arises and I need a shift covered. The hardest part of the job is at first learning to use to computer system used to check guests in/out and make payments, but once you've learned, it's very easy and simple to use. The most enjoyable part of the job is the guests/co-workers. The people are almost always very nice, and it's very enjoyable getting to meet new people from all around the world and getting to talk to them for a little bit sometimes."
good,"Great place to work. Excellent benefits and I work side by side with a very supportive team, which I have learned a lot from."

good,"Disclaimer, when I worked at Super 8 in Bozeman, MT, it was not part of Wyndham, but a privately owned franchise (might still be)."
good,"Working at the Wyndham Hotel was very busy and more work for just one person to do alone, but the people I worked with were very helpful and everyone had a way of cheering each other up. The feeling I had when working there was amazing, you couldn't upset for a second because someone always made you smile."
good,"Wyndham Vacation Ownership was a very enjoyable company to work for. I dealt with marketing and real estate sales on a daily basis. Once a month I had to visit one of our many resorts for a conference with the management. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that my agents would make commission which often could be very profitable. I provided ongoing training which included role playing, one on one critiquing, and also listening to their recorded performances. The atmosphere could tend to be very stressful because we were dealing with individual sales whose worth was in the thousands. You had to ensure that you made enough sales to not only make commission, but also to maintain your employment. I made the atmosphere enjoyable by giving inspirational quotes on a daily basis. The most important part of the job was providing service for a product that I truly believed in."
good,"A typical day at work consists of making the schedule, answering the phone, taking messages (as needed), giving directions (as needed), checking the guests in and out, making sure the rooms are cleaned properly, & counting the drawer for shift change.  My General Manager was a great person she took care of problems in a timely manner. I learned how to use Quickbooks. My co-workers were great workers."
good,I would come in at night and get the hotel ready for the morning while assisting guests with their needs and checking in the guests who arrived late.  The management and co-workers were wonderful.  The hardest part of the job was being up all night.
good,2 to 3 scheduled appointments a day as a sales representative. as a presenter you will see 6-12 couples a day.
good,"Work starts in the evening, gets pretty lonely. It's a good job for a student who has lots of homework. There is a lot of down time."
good,"Management always worked well with whatever needs I had.  My co-workers were nice and friendly usually.  The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking many things.  I learned how to do daily audits, which were the most enjoyable part of my job for me."
good,The typical day at work would be answering phones and booking the customer a meeting room or booking their wedding as well doing the same with emails.  Having meetings every morning to let the managers know what is going on for the day/week and making sure that the customers were happy.
good,I started as a housekeeping lead  in this company  . I then moved into maintenance . Then finally i moved into the marketing department . I had so much fun working at this place it is fuilled with hard working people and great managers .

good,"I liked when I first got into this business was when I was in college. After my degree I ended up coming back to the hospitality business. I started off as a night audit. I like to deal with guests of all types. I have met people frmo Japan, China, India, England, Europe. I Like to read on my New Mexico history and it helps to bring the visiting folks a way to learn about my state which helps the local ecomony. I have had a chance to work with people from NY,Pa, Tx etc, and teaching the staff about NM and keeping them intrested. The hardest part of the job is having to leave at the end of my shift because I enjoy talking to people. I have checked inn people that spoke diffrent languages, had hearing handicaps, etc. was a challenge but my ultimate goal was to make the sale without compromising superior guest service."
good,went to work every day looking forward to work.the people were great the environment was great and management was outstanding.
good,"Planned parties, weddings, reunions, etc. "
good,"A typical day at Wyndham Vacation Ownership involved the maintenance and management of cash operating and reserve balances for the purpose of processing vendor payments by due date and forecasting future expenses along with Journal Entry update for the maintenance of Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss accounts.  I gained a great deal of knowledge on how to manage time to meet several deadlines with the same due date for different properties.  Management at Wyndham was tiered properly and utilized appropriately.  My Co-workers were a joy to work with.  We created a team bond that promoted unity and efficiency.  The hardest part of my job was the acceleration of financial statement due dates but once time was managed properly, this was no longer an issue.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships built over the years with co-workers."
good,"great job, nice people, good security and great experiences"
good,"I work 8 hour shifts, usually 8 am to 4 pm. My co-workers are really friendly and helpful. My typical day consists of supervising cleaning maids, making reservations, checking people in, and assisting costumers. My job is really easy and fun."
good,"I was responsible for running reports on a daily basis for upper management which would show productivity of the department, doing assigned projects from management, and trained employes, whether it be new hires or current employees who needed more assistance. My management was amazing and wanted everyone to succeed and move up within the company. The hardest part of the job was getting all of my assigned tasks completed because the work-load was extreme, but I was always able to accomplish them. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning every aspect of the timeshare industry and gaining so much knowledge that I was able to be promoted three times in the 7 year period I was employed."
good,"This is a great company and there are a ton of possibilities for advancement that include over 100 place to work worldwide. There was a little bit of a language barrier between myself and some employees but the experience was great and benefits are top of the line. The hardest part of the job for me were the shifts, I was working graveyard so my social life became just about non existent."
good,"I love working for Wyndham and in the hotel industry. I take care of all the HVAC issues and maint. I'm also CPO and take care of pools, spas, lazying rivers, etc. I have great co-workers and management. I'm looking to move back to Md { at my own expense} to be near my family."
good,"learned alot more about customer service, i learned better sales tactics, how to interact better with people"
good,"If I could've stayed there I would. I loved working for that company. I truly felt like I was a part of an extended family. Everyone was so great. Even the VP of the company would treat us like we're equal. My everyday there was very hectic and you had to multi task almost every second of your day, but I still loved every minute of it. I feel that I work best under pressure. The hardest part of my job was declining a client that wanted to purchase but couldn't due to their credit, or any other financial reasons. The most enjoyable would be the laughter among all the crazy, hectic sales reps coming in demanding their paperwork, credit scores, reports, etc."
good,"not a bad place at all, i lost 40 pounds as a housekeeper there."
good,"Grateful for the training in leadership, management and sales in the vacation ownership industry."
good,Very supportive work environment.  I was able to get along with my coworkers.  The management did a good job of communicating expectations.  I absolutely liked the job but left for higher pay.

good,It was a very fun job. Everyone is friendly and eager to help you if you need help. We treat each other like family. Overall a great job easy to get along with everyone
good,"I loved my job there.  I had a steady schedule, reliable co-workers that were fun and respectful, and decent pay.  The benefits were my problem.  If I could get back into the Wyndham family, I would in a heartbeat"
good,"A great place to work, Friendly service, very sanitized, always a warm and cozy feeling when staying and after leaving, if passing through i would recommend stopping by for some good R&R."
good,"This position is not for anyone who can't handle rejection and isn't coachable. 80% no and 20% yes. The pay is wonderful when a minimum of 20% is achieved. A rep can earn a years salary in a month. Supportive mgmt, builds confidence, be coachable, team environment, excellent product/service. Truly the best company in the timeshare industry."
good,Great Company to work for. I been here for a year and is been a great ride. Hoping to grow more and more within the company. Here to sat and go all the way.
good,"Good management. We do civic work outside of the office. On top of that, we're not a third party BPO company. We work directly for Wyndham Destinations so there are very minimal pay disputes, the incentives are great and perks at work are awesome."
good,"Not everyone is cut out for the job, however if you work hard enough and push yourself, the pay is incredible. You have to be outgoing and creative. Face to face marketing."
good,"Food service manger and bartender  costumer  service manger. care all  my employees care,  all the cash register keep the place  clean  and good  quality  food"
good,Working here is very stressful and it's a quick paced job and you have to make sure everything is clean cause they check on your work after you are done with the rooms ......I did one room on the 31st floor and you only have so many hours to get it done and when you are done with the room you by pushing finished on your cell phone cause your room assignments are on your phone and how many rooms you get
good,"Working at Days Inn was fun with friendly co-workers and cool supervisor. A typical day at work consists of making the rooms look neat and tidy by making beds, replenishing toiletries etc."
good,You make great money. The schedule is also flexible. I was paid weekly and my commission three weeks in arrears. Overall it was a great experience. I was there for 9 years.
good,The job is good and its quick pace job and you have to make sure everything is really clean cause they check your work when you are done a room and your assignments are put on your cell phone and you have two hours to complete the room and then hit done on your cell phone ...its a stressful job and the rooms are big ..I did some on the 31st floor ..

good,"It was a fantastic place to work with wonderful senior leadership team.  Great culture. Every day was a good day to go to work. If the company didn't relocate, I probably would still be there."
good,"At least within IT, there was a lot of long-tenured associates. People stay with this company, because it takes care of its associates. After 10+ years, I have more vacation time every year than I can figure out what to do with. The greatest difficulty I have with the company is that the processes we must follow include a great deal of overhead. Process overhead (including unnecessary meetings) accounts for more than half of the time spent on projects."
good,"As a guest they bend over  backwards to see that each guest is comfortable. Love hearing about the guest vacations on occasions. I loved being apart of Wyndham ,"
good,Co-workers were excellent and management were also great people to work with. My father became sick while I was working there and they were great an understanding when I would need unexpected time off for him.

I loved going to work every day, I knew from the day of my interview I was going to love it here. My coworkers were fun and amazing, I loved everything about my job. On top of a pretty nice hourly rate, there were monthly incentives and bonuses which was awesome. The on site gym was amazing.

good,"•	Responsible for guest satisfaction."
good,"This review only applies to working for at the HQ corporate office in Orlando, FL - I work as a Paralegal in the Legal Department and I LOVE working for Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (formerly Wyndham Vacation Ownership).  I felt the need to offer my review here since I have not really seen my corporate in-house experience reflected on sites such as Indeed, as it is mostly representative of Housekeepers and Admins at the Resorts and the various Sales teams.  My day to day experience is drastically different from those employees working at the Resorts as Wyndham is a very large company.  "
good,"My co workers are great and we have access to the best training!"
good,I loved working for Wyndham and I will miss the company. I was restructured out but that is what happens. I am ready for my new adventure. The company cares for their employees and for the most part the management is ok.
good,This company shows you exactly why they are a Fortune 500 company .. from the hire process to the promotion process etc everything is fine right and very professional .. I would work for these guys again
good,Great work-life balance. Talented IT group with a great working culture. I would still be working here if not for the recent shift in location. Good luck in Indianapolis and Orlando!
good,The opportunity that Wyndham offered me brought me huge accomplishments.  I was so excited to be able to take pretty much a blank slate and turn it into an International Award winning program within a year.  They allowed me to bring my knowledge and experience to the table which resulted in a $20M program my first year.  I am privileged and blessed to be able to travel the world doing what I love.
good,"Quality assurance process on customers purchased agreement"

It is very fast paced and the day goes by extremely fast, too fast for me. Upper management is extremely supportive and definitely foster growth if you have the mind and heart to grow. Under the current leadership I have no intent or desire to go anywhere but up. I can't say enough about how fulfilled and supported I feel."
good,"Every day is a different day. As an employee, there are no set schedules. On any given day you may be the opener, mid shift, third shift, or the closer. Every shift had different responsibilities; however, each shift pitched to every eligible person(s). "
good,"Wyndham has been a great place to work for over 7 years for me. I've advanced in my career some, but not as much as I'd like, although there are multiple avenues for advancement."

good,"I was a manager of a Team of 18 agents, closing business deals, and helping with solutions with guest daily. I held daily trainings, and worked hard to get to know each agent to understand strengths and weaknesses. This allowed me to keep the team motivated on a daily basis. A typical day started at 7:00am and ended at 7:00pm. I managed the sales processes from start to finish, including contracts and closings. I developed relationships with our partners and venders to help assist clients with solutions and options to their travel needs."

good,"Wyndham Worldmark is a great way to vacation.  I dealt with people from all over the world!  I would get to know them through asking questions and obtaining their answers.  If they had any problems with their ownership, I very quickly found a solution.  If they were interested in upgrading their ownership, I assisted with that as well.  The hardest part of the job was getting someone to spend upwards of $20,000 or more for upgrades to their vacation ownership.  The easiest part of my job was getting to know the people and their families."

good,First time working for a vacation resort type company. I would say that this company really cares for not only its customers but its employees as well.

good,i just graduated from college.  and this job/career was waiting on me.  this place got me started with sales. and the fast paced environment and it help mold the beast of a salesman that is here now.
good,Working as a booking agent for Wyndham was great.  The company sees employees as an investment and not a cost which leads to a great in house culture.  The changes that are being made always seem to be for  the better too.  I loved working for Wyndham and miss the job because I had to move out of the area.

good,Working for Days Inn was tough but it wasn't a bad job. I loved my manager and my co-workers they were all very nice.

good,This wasn't a bad company but it was only seasonal what i did so they're wasn't much else to do for the year besides hosuekeeping.
good,"Housekeeping is not easy. Very far from it. Dealing with guests while cleaning rooms can be very stressful and difficult to manage at the same time. I loved working for the Ramada but the management could use a little improvement. For the majority of the time I was employed there, I got along with my co-workers and management pretty well. Would recommend for employment for short-term or long-term."
good,"washing up dishes and they were nice and kind and gd to use"
good,A place where you can grow and learn. I learned multiple things that made me grow and be confident. Co-workers are great and always willing to help. Management is great as well!

good,I have learned alot while I attended Drug and Alcohol Treatment. I know how to communicate well with others as well as giving feedback and challenging my mind as well as others goals. The hardest part is when someone breaks down and is starting to understand were they fell in their life and are eager and willing to pick their selves back up. I enjoyed this because I have been in the same situation so to be able to help someone else feels good.
good,Wyndham Vacation Ownership Inc. is a great organized Company.I also have had the great pleasure meeting many new people in my 30 year career.I think I can talk to just about anyone.I love giving great customer service.

good,Working here is great!!! From day one it's been really really cool.
good,"A typical day at Wyndham consisted of coming in early arriving groggy and tired but immediately being woken up with the lively stand up meetings. We would then get our daily cleaning necessities together, load up the karts, get a list of rooms, and get to cleaning. We washed walls, dishes, tables, chairs, made beds, folded laundry into decorative shapes, prepared the rooms for incoming guests, and cleaned up after their departures. We were often greeted with treats and always a smile, so we were sure to do the same for our guests. I learned how to do a thorough job fast. I developed and eye for detail. My co-workers were fantastic, lively, and great to be around. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. We knew what days we had to work and what time we were due to be in the office each morning but there was no leaving until everything was done. We weren't aware of what time we would be off until we were off.  This made it hard to find babysitters! The most enjoyable part of the job was by far the people i worked with. My boss' were amazing to work for and with and my co-workers made it easy to enjoy the full days work."
good,"Central Reservations took over 4 islands and had an average call log of 100-150 tours a person. Everyone is running all over the office to get to manifests that are uploaded in different cubicles. The hardest part of my job is keeping on top of time management because the time really flies by during your shift but, the most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers who are so helpful, when they see you struggling or falling behind they pick up the slack and help you get back on track."
good,I learned how to work a cash register and how to resolve customer complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting so many travelers of many different cultures.
good,"I would like to tell about my job. It has very nice job. I have to open the lounge every morning for the breakfast. I have to serve VIP guest every day. I learn alots of things such as food knoweledge, how to take care of the guest, guest complain, guest service. All my team members are kind each other. My managers are kind of the all staff. so I m happy and satasfy in this job."
good,Iearn how to stay focus with the customers and the people around me.
good,i was very happy about learning housekeepers how two clean rooms the right way.and working in a very clean work place.

Making reservation for the guest stay and valvet parking for the guest cars.I learn to do unemplyment claims etc.Management ere great we all work as a team. Co-worker were pleasant. I had to get use to working on a outside enviroment. I really enjoy when the corporate came and i pass every inspection."
good,"My typical day at work was always knowing what to do when you first get to your job. also hoping that nothing went wrong for the night before because it would take you a little longer to correct a problem not knowing when, where, and why. I've learned from my experience to ask questions in how the business ran so that there wouldn't be any suprise. Mangement was a little more stressful due to more responsibilities. Like when some of your co-workers wouldn'y show up and trying to look for other employees to work that schedule or it would be the manager to work it and have an asst. cover your shift. The hardest part of my job was being very strict with your employees due to some like to slack off but i would let them know that when the job was not done it would become a write-up or even suspension. The most enjoyable part of my job is every month one of my employees would earn the employee of the month and it made my job lot easier."
good,"Wingate Inn is a great product with excellent management at top positions, stayed busy every day sending out required reports, inspecting rooms, yield management, room inventory management, purchasing, working with continuious training & observation of other employees, managed payroll, billed accounts receivable, keyed accounts payable invoices, handled guest complaints, networked with guest during breakfast times to insure quality, implemented quality starts with me and count on me programs, budgets, sales forecasts, key control, human resources, booking groups, working with third party agents. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to work many weeks without a day off. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the returning loyal guests back to the hotel and seeing the employees grow and developed their skills."

good,"The most challenging part at my job is to check-in guests without their credit card information in downtime. Even they decide to pay in cash, we still do not know what type of rooms we have available in the system. Since our hotel doesn't print downtime report in the morning, I still manage to check all of the guests in. I have learned of of things to manually check the number of rooms we have available with the help of reg card bucket. I do know that we have eighty five rooms in the hotel and how many rooms were sold last night. We keep reg card for every room we sold last night. I have learned how to manage staff and customers in busy time especially when we have downtime."

Management is very supportive of my decision making and always available in a time of need. My co-workers are also a pleasure to be around and always willing to assist one another.

good,I loved everything about Wyndham. All of my employees were so helpful and kind and they helped us whenever we needed. Wyndham also offers so much to us as employees.
good,"As a Guest Service Agent, I have eight hour shifts with two fifteen minute breaks as well as an unpaid half hour lunch. I stand for a vast  majority of my shift and am the front line of the hotel. I process all guest check-ins and check-outs as well as answer phones, direct traffic, maintain the front desk and lobby as well as direct incoming calls to other departments and answer radio calls. Management is appreciate of their staff and have proven that with hard work it is easy to advance to upper level position both inside and outside your department. It does get very stressful during peak seasons if there are not enough employees to handle the amount of traffic, but generally there is enough work to keep you busy, but enough you are going full tilt for eight hours. The Ramada Plaza is a well maintained mid-sized hotel and the staff care dearly about the customers, so I never feel like I am encourage to neglect anyone. I really enjoyed my experience working for this independent location."
good,"What I like is that each day brings new guests and all types of situations  I have learned a great deal about hotels and what you   do because I have been in healthcare facilities,church security and law enforcement. Every one is working for the best of our guests. The hardest part is when you try to explain a situation to a guest and they won' listen.  Example parking in a handy capped spot when you are not handicapped. Most enjoyable is knowing that when the day is done you have helped people with their problems."
good,"I was a part time employee during school semesters and full time in the summer. Great working atmosphere, wonderful people and above all excellent organizational culture."
good,"I did not work here very long but the time I did spend here I did enjoy the job the pay and the staff. I would do the night audit which was fairly easy. I would be left alone for the rest of the night after the audit.Every hour or half hour I would make rounds around the hotel.Other then that I would love that I would have free time to do my homework in between. I would just have to make sure the night audit was organized and sealed and the breakfast was out and the floors were swept and mopped in the lobby. The manager would always offer me to stay for a few extra hours the most two to help the maids with their rooms I would have to strip the rooms, I would be tired but at the end of my shift it was worth it."
good,Great place to work. I loved the country music that was playing. Got to the point where I was singing most of the songs.
good,A typical day at work started with getting our cash drawer and making sure we had the correct amount in it. Greet each customer as they enter. Check them into/out of their rooms. Tell them if there's anything they need call front desk from their rooms or stop by. We have a 24 hr service. Answer calls as they came in and make reservations Customers were priority. The hardest part of my job was staying awake when I worked graveyard.
good,"Dedicated and hard working employees, that also know that ""enjoying"" coming to work is most important in staying productive"
good,"I greet guests, check them in to the hotel. I try to make sure that every guest has the best stay possible at the hotel. Working in hospitality taught me how to be nice to every person, no matter the situation. It brought me out of my shell, I am a much more confident person since I started working at the hotel. I don't have co-workers on the shift that I work. Management was amazing. They took care of problems when they occurred. The hardest part of the job was being nice to people who were rude for no reason. The best part of the job was seeing guests leave happy."
good,"i loved the staff, management/owners (with days inn and knights inn), alot to get used to but they were all so helpful and fun to be around. i only worked there for a few months bt i would def recommend them its a great place to work. very family type place.. regret quitting that job is all i have to say ;) should tell u alot"
good,"I usually did housekeeping and front desk. Making reservations, cleaning, answering the phone. My coworkers were good employees as well so I did not find myself having to pick up their slack. The hardest part of the job was the housekeeping, after making 12 beds my back would really hurt. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I could make my own schedule."
good,"Never one complaint, absence, or lateness. I did my job and also helped house keeping. On weekends I would assume the position of front desk clerk."

good,A great company to work for if you're looking to build in the hospitality department. Helps you to really appreciate customer care. Before working at this company I never used to understand why it is important to pay attention to detail until you have to deal with others food and drink reservations.
good,Quotas are easy to meet. Good locations. Opportunity to make 8k-15k a month. Good training and good work environment. Branson is slow during the winter time but you can take advantage of that and learn how to manage your money.
good,"Wyndham was a great place to work and gain experience because they give you all the tools and resources you need to grow and refine your craft. You start your work days with a 30 minute training session where an instructor will teach all of the employees how to reach their full potential and succeed at the highest levels. After training, my team and I would hit the floor and start booking tours for our company. Wyndham is super well organized and places a huge emphasis on training you to become the best you can be at your job."
good,"During my employment with Wyndham, I learned how to multi-task in a timely fashion, check soft credit scores to ensure qualifications for guest to buy a timeshare, manage my time wisely to ensure the completion of all database entry and management, answer and transfer calls on a multi-line phone system, and work as an effectively collaborative team member of the company. In my opinion, the hardest part of this job was qualifying guests for a timeshare tour and if unqualified, having to deny their eligibility to move forward with the tour. Some had driven all the way from San Diego for a tour and our office was in Anaheim. We as a team, thankfully, had to subtly convince them that there was truly nothing we could do to further seek their qualification and that they would need to go back home without a tour from our location. Many guests had left very upset on multiple occasions. The most enjoyable part of this job was the teamwork environment and friendly atmosphere. It was very easy to work and grow in an environment such as theirs."
good,Information dissemination in the team is very crucial and I must say it is well managed at Wyndham. The management team has a good relationship to its employers which makes every single work day light and fun.
good,excellent place to work always up for any task at front desk. Employees are always generous and always looking to help the guest and manager was very nice
good,Present manager is concerned about the hotel and the maintenance of it. He is setting priorities want needs to be done and trying to get the materials needed to do the repairs.
good,"My entire team was full of laughs and jokes, while we were keeping busy. We built shelves and pit the sleeves on and put the tags in the sleeves and stocked the shelves. It was interesting and honestly fun."
good,It was very competitive and the employees made a game out of it to see who gets more sales which pushed the sales reps to do better and work harder. Salesmen with the most sales by the end of the day would get cash reward for the day.
good,"* Posted room charges and taxes to guest accounts."
good,This is by far the best company I have ever worked for. It was up beat and the management cares about its employees. If you want great money and to be surrounded by great people this is the place to be.
good,"•	Providing guests fast, friendly and efficient service while managing guests on telephone as well as in front of me. "
good,"Great company to work for, awesome benefits, awesome culture, very positive environment. After almost 3 years of employment I still like coming to work, that says a lot about the job."
good,"I would arrive at 2 hours before our tours started. The first thing on my list was to go through the tours for day and set the sales rotor for the sales agents. "
good,I love meeting new people. I'm sure if I was acually working for Wyndham and not a privately owned hotel I would get all the benefits and pay I deserve. But I don't.
good,"I worked about 35 hours a week for two years in Glens Falls, NY and Warrensburg, NY. I was laid off in the winter. All of a sudden there was lack of sales and business."
good,Wyndham Destinations is an incredible place to work because of the close knit group of people you work with. The bonds I made with co-workers made being at work enjoyable and fun everyday. The professionalism shown at the Branson offices is unlike I have ever experienced. The best place I could have began my career.
good,"Great company and attitude. People want to help you. Awesome training, really very interesting job. "
good,Wyndham was a great company to work for.  The training was intense and prepared you to be successful.  The hours were flexible and allowed time that you could have a life outside of work.  I would recommend this employer to anyone.

good,"set up schedules for workers cooed and prepped in kitchen make sure the customers were satisfied with everything they wanted, made sure the workers did there job."
good,"I was called to build the kitchens and the line of work for this 5 star hotel when it was still under construction and to create a kitchen brigade that could express itself to the maximum on a very small budget. With 18 people I managed to manage a banquet kitchen for up to 1000 people or three multi-banquets of about the same amount, the kitchen of the restaurant of 70 seats also took care of the room service and in the summer of the pool garden of 70 seats or buffet for concerts. Breakfast in Turkey is one of the most important meal and I am proud to have revolutionized with the rich and intriguing buffet the classic buffet compared to the other competitors on the City and to have enriched it with some salty paste copies of some famous monuments handmade by me. The executive lounge had a much more exclusive buffet and we also had many meeting rooms to add with our cafeteria products. I left this diamont kitchen that practically worked like clockwork just to open my first restaurant."
good,Great place to work at. Great environment. Exceptional co workers. Stable job. Fair hours. Flexible schedule. Fun bosses. Fair pay. Fair time off. Fun environment.
good,This employer gives you opportunity to advance and better yourself.Management is very professional..The hardest part of my job was acting like you felt good and you did not. Balancing accounts or reports back in balance when out.

good,I loved working for this company. It played a huge part in shaping who I am today. I received multiple promotions and growth opportunities. I had amazing bosses throughout my time there.
good,"I've never had a better place to work. The people support each other. Supervisors are interested in what is best for you. They promote within quickly and are always looking for the best department for you. The shifts are fair, they offer changes every 6 months so you have reliability. There is unlimited overtime most of the year. There really is NO SALES! They are the only call center I've ever worked at that I am willing to return to. Also the only company I have ever seen that allows you to sit with a current employee and observe the work before you interview. "
good,I found Wyndham Vacation Ownership to be a wonderful place to work. The company culture is fun yet very professional and they have a great team of people working there. I enjoyed my time there and highly recommend it to others.
good,"its a great, relaxed place to work. there is great people and customers, I hated to leave. during a shift, I checked guests in and out, made reservations, and accommodated all guests."
good,"I started early in the morning 6:30am with a motivational meeting, also a review of what happened the day before and what can we improve. Sales meetings started at 8:00am and we all as a team would apply every sales technique learned and practice through out.  Help close deals to team members. and by 3:00pm approximately the day was over."
good,This position is great if you are independent and capable of working alone. There is a lot of down time and it gets lonley. The hardest part of the job is having nothing to do and no one around.
good,Wyndham embraces the Count On Me spirit from the hiring process through the daily tasks. The hospitality culture surrounds the office campus. The hardest part of the job will be leaving.
good,"Wyndham Has a great Program. Very Well Managed , Great Location and benefits. Meet some great people, My first tour bought a 52k Package! Had  to leave to take care of a Health issue!"

good,The Timeshare Industry is tough.  It is very rewarding if you apply yourself 150% and stay in tune with the business.  It requires self motivation on top of continued training.

good,"I have had the chance to work here and the staff are the most amazing people. If you have a problem, it becomes their problem. They try and help you out the best they can.

good,"Wyndham was the busiest Hotel I worked in! It taught me my speed and customer service skills the most. The team was excellent and we all work together very well. "
good,Typical high paced work environment with positive motivated individuals looking to help families vacation. Hardest part of the job is managing your mindset and handling the no's.
good,Positive atmosphere with like minded individuals seeking to better themselves as well as the families they meet. The day is fast-paced and high intense but the work day is short. You learn a lot about selling strategies through training and from your manager.

El dia comienza con nuestra ""morning meeting"" donde vemos que nos depara cada dia. Tratamos de que sea una gran familia, un ambiente que genere una sinergia que se traduzca en resultados para el cliente.

Definitivamente lo que mas me ha gustado son los resultados obtenidos"

I mean, sometimes we disagreed about things like ideals concerning the business on how I thought the prices were kind of high or sometimes when I come to work some things were left the way they were the previous day like sometimes you couldn't find your equipment you needed, but all and all are relationship as work partners was real good. Other thing's I liked about working there was it was a good distance for me to go. I made sure the count for supplies were correct and that the business was cleaned. My co-workers were nice, we got along very well. At times I might see one of them when I'm out and about  we greet each other with a smile and even a hug. One of the things I've learned in my three and a haft years working there is that you have to learned how to deal with a lot of different personalities' and be patient with customers even thou some may refuses to be patient with you. Customer services and being a team playing are two of the main factors of employment."

good,"I do morning shifts in the week with a late shift every saturday.  I really enjoy going to work and giving the best customer service that I can possibly offer, i enjoy seeing all the regular hotel guests - as its a corporate hotel, the same guests usually check in every week and you get to build up a rapport with them.  All my co - workers are great to work with, and since promotion of shift leader / duty manager , they show respect to me and i thrive to get the best out of them sharing my knowledge of the front desk.  The hardest part of my job I would say is complaints from guests. i deal with every complaint in a professional manner and always try to offer a solution to the guest, even if its offering a complimenry breakfast / drink etc, even when the problem is solved.  I have guests that check into the hotel and sometimes only wait until im on shift as they know i will give them 100% and sort out their queries."

good,"Great place to work, good management and the best co-workers. Meet with guests to tell them about Wyndham and vacation ownership. This is a good product that I felt was of benefit to almost every family. Short hours - average 35 hours a week. It is the easiest and hardest job that I have ever had. I learned an emmense amount of information about this company and loved my job. Met a lot of good people and also some extremely mean people. Most of the people come in to get a gift. I never met so many users in my life. They have already made a pact that no matter what we have, no matter what we offer them, no matter what the product - they are not going to buy. It is up to us to make them want to be a part of Wyndham. Most people want the product once they learn about it but the majority of the people can not afford to buy it; the ones who can buy it refuse to make a decision at that moment. They want to think about it and come back. We offered them a lot of special things in order for them to make a decison that day. I could not have worked at this job as long as I did - 1 1/2 years - if I did not believe in the company and the product. The hardest part was living on the money we were earning until we became ""excellent"". Only the best will survive. It takes a person who can take a lot of rejection and have another income to live off of until you are very, very good. I was average; not the best and definitely not the worst. I just could not live off the money that I was earning during the learning process."

Then, I will answer a multi- line phone where I would make reservations and cancel reservations. I also called the surrounding hotels to check their avialbilty for the night to make sure we're above the competition. I would spend countless hours laughing and talking to the quest and the tell why the ventured into Atlanta, why they love Atlanta, and their family life back home. The best part of job would be the gifts the quest brought me to show their apperication. The hardest part about my job is not being able to please a customer."
