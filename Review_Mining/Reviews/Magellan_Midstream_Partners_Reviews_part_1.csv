bad,"Work was good.  However, decisions are based upon who you know within the company not on your skills or experience."
bad,The pay is great everything else was not even worth the pay at the end of the day.  Management is awful in almost every aspect.  Think about more than the money when applying for a job.
bad,"If you have a disability the company will not treat you fairly. They will try to push you out the door silently. However, if you are well connected you can violate just about any policy, procedure and in some cases laws without negative recourse. It is sad to see what looks like a great company on the outside be so corrupt on the inside. If you just want a good paying job and don't mind the unethical actions taking place and don't mind seeing others less qualified than you move up quickly this is the place for you. If you want growth and your not well connected steer clear."
good,"Management was terrible! They only looked out for themselves.. They could care less about the ""little guys""! They really hate the union folks! Look for another place to work.."
good,Don't expect to work for this company for long. most people do not retire at this company they are forced out so they do not have to be paid.
good,Loaded oil cars. Harderst part of job was the heavy lifting and outdoors.
good,"‚óè	Spent my first year as a railcar loader, and was commended and promoted due to productivity and following procedures directly."
good,"Definitely a good place to receive training and get experience. Lots of friendly people willing to help you. Depending on your team, on-call rotations can be unreasonable. Some teams barely get sleep during their week of on-call and other teams rarely get paged. Flex time isn't available to utilize for weeks of high page volume meaning that you could be up all night on a page but still be expected at your desk at 8am the next day. Given that the teams experience drastically different volumes, it creates an unbalanced workload that can burn people out."
good,"Very laid back company, enjoy coming to work everyday. I interact with my supervisor and area manager everyday to ensure that our facility continues to be a safe work environment.  I manage a main pipeline coming in to our facility and leaving our facility.  We have twenty-two holding tanks that hold gasoline, diesel and transmix.  I operate, test and collect readings on a Transmix Distillation Unit.  I also make sure that all of our paperwork is up to date and in compliance."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of mowing the facilities, painting poles, and striping road lines, cleaning office and assisting supervisors."
good,"Typical day at work - Busy 10 - 12 hrs"
good,"A good place to work. Good job security. End of the year performance bonus. Bad IT Management, IT employees overworked and under-appreciated."
good,"Overall, Magellan was a great place to work. There were times that it was highly stressful, but those times were few and far between. Quality control requires a lot of time spent traveling away from home"
good,Solid company to work for great pay and benefits. You work with gasoline and fuel oil so there is some risk with this job. Harsh working conditions at time. The job requires tank climbing in excess of 40 feet.
good,Good insight to learn many different jobs in operations. Operators for Magellan cover a larger span of skills compared to other pipeline companies.
good,"Excellent workplace environment. The company is very conservative and stable. The benefits are excellent. However, their is no training and very little opportunity for advancement."
good,Fun and good people to work with. I liked work as Pipeline / Terminal Operator till retired. Now I would like to back to doing things allover with another Co.  I can fit in.
good,"great co-workers and management."
good,The work is good and most of the employees are helpful and supportive but the opportunity for advancement is not there like they described. The overtime is also not there like they had said.
good,After 18 years at MMP I decided I wanted a change.  I should have stayed with this excellent company and begged them to let me relocate.  They truely care about their employees and have a very positive corporate culture and if I get the chance to go back to MMP I certainly will.
good,Excellent company not complaint expect for just like any other place you have your bosses that like to have their favorites and it shows in how he treats other personnel not in their group
good,This is a great place to work. They have excellent benefits and solid upper mngt. to ensure success of the company. The people are all long time employees with an enormous amount of native knowledge that can be easily accessed.
good,"Incredible stability, great compensation package, and vast industry presences.  Very interactive culture in supporting and participating in non profit activities."
good,I worked in the Control room which consisted of 3 to 5 monitors with various pipelines per station. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,Magellan beliefs are one of a kind! They make you feel like a family and will stop everything when it comes to safety. Has a pension plan which not many companies offer anymore. However the only bad part I would say is the advancement. Who have to move to tulsa or around to move up quicker.
good,Satisfied with this company. Paid extremely well. Incredible benefits. Supervisor was very helpful. Training was very helpful. Flexible with family time.
good,"Great company striving for safety, efficiency and to accomplish goals. All the employees were cooperative and worked well together. Makes you use your brain a lot in a great way."
good,Good company to work for. Awesome benefits. Lots of overtime. Fast paced. Management are fair. Co employees help each other out to get job done in timely fashion
good,This Internship provided great insight into how final petroleum operations were handled. Tasked were limited due to it being an internship but this allowed me to really delve into the different monitoring systems and there functions. Co-workers were always helpful in answering any question I had about various apsects of operations
