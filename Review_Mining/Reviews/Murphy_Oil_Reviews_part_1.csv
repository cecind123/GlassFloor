bad,"Supervisors are heartless, no compassion, threats of losing your job if things were not perfect in their eyes. Managers got paid for 80 hours but worked over 100 hours."
bad,I enjoyed the customers; but for a convenient store was surprised that management encouraged a cut throat environment. when you try to check I D's management did not adhere to the sled requirements.
bad,this is not a good company to work for. management was always gone working at other stores but not taking care of his own store. the district manager treated the employees like high school kids. if you were not part of her click you were hardly acknowledged.
bad,This is the absolute worst company to work for. I was hired as an assistant and the schedule is up and down so therefore you have no life.  The management is lazy and you do their job while they sit in the office. Go to the upper management and it gets swept under the rug. I literally have pictures of the filth and mold on the icee Machines where they never clean them. I've never worked for such a horrible company.
bad,"This company cut pay, doesn't give seasoned employees advancement in the company, high turn over rate, long hours, low pay"
bad,"The Whitehall, Ohio location is terrible! Management doesn't care about how many hours you can work. Signed up for part time, was scheduled full time every week. Management refused to let me have any holidays off, even when I said I couldn't work, because management wanted that holiday off. Management installed microphones and cameras and used them to listen in on employees...would receive a phone call about talking behind the register. The bathroom is outside and you have to walk around a dark building at night to get to it. Customers don't need a key for the restroom, so it is always trashed. People did illegal activity in the restroom. Toilet was clogged almost every day. One time, someone emptied a litter box into the toilet, I was on an 8 hour shift and was told to relieve myself in a bucket in the supply closet during my shift because they couldn't get a plumber there until the next day. Management installed awful door alarms that went off every time someone opened the door. The sound was deafening and annoying...the customers even complained. Management left all duties to employees and spent most of their time away from the store. Don't work here even if it's the last job on earth!"
bad,"I have about 19 years of experience in the Oil & Gas Industry. I happened to work for this company in the Houston corporate office as a System Analyst for about one year. So far this was my worst experience in my professional career."
bad,Get thrown on a shift alone after 6 hours of training manager and assistant manager not wanting to cover for off shifts if someone had an emergency make one mistake and all of the sudden the male chovanist upper managers suddenly take an interest in you a whole crew of back stabbing people very bad management one of the worst jobs I've ever had
bad,Everything sucks manger always have an attitude and is always late no hours and workers work too hard for little pay customers are very friendly and so is your co workers they make you feel at home and always brightens your day prices are awesome
bad,Manager and main boss are freaking insane they just use any and every thing wrong to pin on new employees to save their own job. Worst place to work for. Save your self.
bad,I loved working there great hour but no breaks quit because manager was to worried about her daughter's prom she forced me to work when I had been throwing up in front of customers the night before and she knew I had been sick all I got back was I hope you feel better. Management is lazy needs new one right away
bad,"They stick one person in a kiosk alone for 6 to 8 hours. One top up taking care of customers, you have other responsibilities to see to any free chance you get. The pay is lousy yet they are dumbfounded at the turnover rate. Only part time positions until you become a manager"
bad,"Did not get trained well, was thrown into the job without proper training, then got fired for making mistakes!! Management made all kind of new rules which applied to everyone except her! Worse job I've ever had!"
bad,I was terminated while on vacation over the phone. The manager called and stated the my register was short and i was even present that week i was on a family vacation in Greene county.
bad,"very rude, not properly ran! never told me set schedule , and when I would come into work id be scheduled for the night because the asst managers never wanted to work nights. my friends and family will never go back because of how rude they are besides a few of them! i have to drive by to see who is working because i just get bad vibes by them! and not to mention we would have ""meetings"" over text messaging! I was harassed one night and the boss left it never asked me what happened just telling me how I handled it was rude... murphy oil of Punta gorda is a joke!"
bad,"I was hired on as an Asst Mgr. After three days of register training only they placed me in my own store with no additional training after that. "
bad,"it was an awful place to work while still in highschool not getting off until 11 at night then still having to do homework and there were no benefits, they always said there was but I never got any"
bad,"The corporate office has no idea how the stores are operated but they still believe they know it all and will not listen. This forces you to not only put in 80 hours a week in for your normal obligations, but now you have to spend another 20-40 hours a week on projects created by people who have no idea how a store operates."
bad,"Pays the bills !!!"
bad,"This job was more than frustrating, I had to deal with rude belligerent thieving customers. I have had to deal with drive offs with gas and people trying to steal product from the window box where i worked at. this place is over rated."
bad,"I was the Assistant Manager in late 2014 into 2015. I was hired in on the heels of 3 prior employees and management walking out of the location.One manager tired of districts crude behavior. The store was borrowing employees from other stores to keep it running and had a manager from a Whitehall store coming onsite after she trained her currents store employee to manage that location. Me and the other assistant were basically thrown in and ran the company on a prayer for months and calling other stores for proper procedure.. One time flagging down a pepsi truck because we were out of product prior to the managements arrival. Not having proper stock seemed a problem.lol ,Once the management arrived she then took about 3 weeks of vacation leaving us again with not a lot of structure and training.I was on the job for 5 months knowing i had no stability or future there. The store has a proven high turnover of employees. It was a free for all.District management is crude and aggressive and has a history of running off employees. Current management just wasn't customer service oriented and detailed and could care less about the employees. Work environment became hostile because of the daily frustrations.Job security is not at this location. A career is not at this location. It's a waist of time.Communication between management and employees and corporate is non existent. I had payroll issues the entire time i was employed. Murphys in whole may be a good company. But this location as a whole is an awful place to work. Two of us left Murphys employ within days of one another in February"
bad,"I enjoyed my job and my customers but I feel that numbers and contests are more important than employees and customers, I had good and supportive employees."
bad,"Terrible place to work. no breaks, no lunch, and no where to sit down for 6-8 hrs. You have to always up sell. If you don't know what to do it is too bad or figure it out with customers calling you all kinds of names."
bad,"There's no telling what a typical work day is. I was alone in the kiosk, RUNNING a what had to have been a million dollar a day area. No help, hours were ridiculous, and the one time I have a drive-off, on a SATURDAY no less, when there's thousands of people coming in and out and I'm expected to keep everything cleaned, stocked, organized, handle payments, make deposits, AND THE LIST GOES ON, I get FIRED. Management is gone, it's ridiculous, and I'm working doubles several days in a row. I don't know what they're doing up there now, but I hope to God they have a better system going. I would be working a 14 hour shift, and can't go right across the street to the Taco Bell for lunch because there's no one to hold down the place! Absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!!! Not to mention the employees don't get paid nearly enough for everything they have to do."
bad,Worked for a month with the worst boss who threatened everyone and was constantly harassing every employee and cheating them out of wages for personal gain then  the grunt work terrible..
bad,"This Place Sucks all around,so does management,they make two sets of rules one for them and one for everybody else"
bad,"The co-workers there was absolutely nice to my face, but lying to the store manager behind my back saying I didn't do the job and they had to do it when I watched them on camera not do my jobs. All they did was stand their and eat. Moncks Corners Managers are out right rude, cruel to a young age person who had NOOO experience for a gas station. They put me on nights, well first time ever working a gas station I had to get use to what was my duties. I worked their 3 weeks and yet I had 15 things to do in a 6pm to 11pm shift. That's not including costumers. That added more an more on my list. I literally broke down an cried because I felt so beaten when I tried so hard to do everything right but I was getting nothing but negative feed with more work added to my list. I've never worked in a place where I was treated so horribly. I don't advise anyone to ever work here. On top of it all when I was fired because of lies, the store manager told me I needed to come up there and give them my things or they will call a lock smith an take all my checks from me. I did indeed call the district manager and tell him how bad I was treated and what a nasty voicemail she left me about it. The district manager told me she could never charge me 500$ and take all my checks and he would straightin it out. I will say the DM is sweet and was good to me. But the Store Manager, Assistant Manager and the co-workers are horrible people to work with. The schedule and pay was decent and I liked it. But I cant be treated poorly and I don't want to see anyone else go through what I did."
bad,"Worst places to work at. Store managers are ussually jerking it around asking you to cover some ussually graveyard shifts, pay is lousy, no breaks during your shift whether an 8 or 12 hour shift."
bad,This is an awful place too work . They dont treat anyone with respect and treat you like a child. They treat customers with disrespect as well . I dont recommend anyone to work here.
bad,Horrible place to work!! All manager that i have come in contact with are nasty people. My district manager when I first started was arrogant and always a jerk and always smelled of alcohol. Always a busy store and they did maintain great customer service but u would work 9 hour shifts with no break what so ever. You were left in the store alone and all the managers are lazy. HORRIBLE!!!!
bad,"They treat you like dogcrap, wont alow you to take days off for medical"
bad,Overall this is not a good place to work. The management is horrible. Turnover rate of employees is very high. Customers are horrible.
bad,"WORSE PLACE I HAVE EVER WORKED ....Management is the worse- very unprofessional, not a people person, I can say more, but rather not .. I have never had so many issues at a job or seen so much turnover in such a short amount of time.."
bad,"worse place ive ever worked. was lied to, clocked out by management while on shift, was not paid for all hours worked. was sexually harassed and all around mistreated."
bad,"Overwhelming work load; computer-driven system that doesn't work; totally aloof to employee issues; trouble collecting money I worked for; no breaks."
bad,"This company is untruthful.   I, applied, passed all necessary requirements, was called by the store manger and given my starting pay, etc etc.  I, then left my other job to begin THAT one and.. was told they had changed their ""system for applications"" SO I would have to start all over and re-apply.  I contacted headquarters about all this and they said the store manager KNEW about the change and should NOT have offered me the position..  I , THEN was told to contact HIS  DM and I tried but he would not return my calls.  I contacted headquarters AGAIN with my complaint and STILL nothing was done about this OR the store manager!!!  So, ALL this left me with NO job.  And , now that I had done all this, IF I had started all over I was pretty much TOLD, I would be at the bottom of the store managers list because I had done all this.  "
bad,This job was the worst place Ive ever worked. I was made to work a 36 hour shift i was not paid for. I dealt with sexual harassment and mistreatment.  All this was by the manager who lied to me to get me to take the job. I didn't work with anyone other then management. The hardest part of this job was putting up with the manager long enough to learn my job and being able to quit was the most enjoyable.
bad,"I have been waiting for three weeks to get paid! I was told when I was hired it would be the 6th then the 6th came and went and I still have not received my first check and it is now the 13th! I have called the HR department and the payroll department and left multiple voice mails with multiple individuals and still have gotten no answers as to what is going on. I was in a tiny booth handling customers, climbing up and down a ladder to get cartons of cigarettes, trying to keep the inventory stocked, bathroom cleaned, pumps cleaned and filled with paper, cleaning the parking lot, taking out the trash all at once! It was so hard to mutli-task all of that and handle customers all at once. It was not worth the amount of money paid. I would think about it before going to work for this company! They will work you to death and not even pay you."
bad,Did not like the way I was treated my management. They have no values.
bad,Horrible part time hours. close one day and then open the next morning.. for absolutely nothing. if 1 person calls in you are screwed because you are stuck working unless your manager will come cover for you.
bad,we had to sit in our car during 12 hour shifts our boss was 80 miles away so if we had problems of any kind it took a while to be relived or helped
bad,"A typical day at Murphy's? I come in, no one else has done anything all day. Nothing is stocked and the garbage cans are overflowing. Then I'm given six to seven hours to make up for everything everyone else didn't do, do my assigned jobs, and take care of customers ALL BY MYSELF. Work conditions are unsafe, in example the cooler where pallets are stocked too high. I can't tell you how many times bottles and cans have just come crashing down on me. Management lies and they are lazy lazy lazy. They gossip and will go behind your back. There is NO room for advancement unless you kiss their fat behinds. I get phone calls and letters constantly about how I'm not doing things well enough and I'm talked down to all the time. The only part of the job I like is some of the great people I've met. This job is not worth the pay. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"I worked here for a very short time. I was trained for 4 hours, most of which was just videos on not selling cigs to minors. Then, I was left ALONE several days. Some idiot took the keys home, so I couldn't lock up. The managers are disrespectful and one was racist to the point that I quit. After many panic attacks because I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing!! Pay wasn't anything good. Made me train for 1 day, in another town, and then work in that town. Then tried to tell me I would be wworking at any location that needed an extra person. From Tulsa to Broken Arrow to Bartlesville, and the Tulsa location is on Admiral. Dangerous. Robbed a lot."
bad,"Management is terrible, they don't care to teach you much before they stick you on the closing shift alone."
bad,"Good pay, on time checks!!! Management is incompetent and self centered to care about any employees needs. District manager all she is worried about is for you to upsell so ""she"" can win a vacation at the end of the year while we bust our butts upselling products. No lunch breaks, or breaks if your by yourself! Its just not a job I would recommend anyone to apply for there are so much better companies out there with real benefits not that cheap insurance that just serves as a overpriced health discount card. In conclusion I've been working at murphy express for a year now. Trying to get a better job with no success. Anyone have any sugestions let me know."
bad,"I worked in the call center for a month and a half. I got THREE days of training before taking calls. I was then put on a shift that had almost no one on it and then got in trouble for my call times being too long. I was written up for my call times being too long, was told to get help sooner or transfer the call (even tho there was no one there to get help from or transfer the call to). I was then fired 24 hours after that write up. I then spent 2 weeks emailing and calling trying to find out about my last check. I emailed my previous boss and got no reply. I called and talked to HR and they sent me to payroll. Payroll said they would have to find out what was going one and call me back. They never did. I called 2-3 times a day and left voicemail for almost everyone in payroll and no one ever called me back. I wish I never heard of Murphy USA..."
bad,This company works you till you can't function. They don't care about their employees. You don't ever have time to even use the health benefits. I would not recomend working for this company no matter how much you get paid.
bad,"A typical day at murphy's were angry people honking and getting mad at you for things they done and blamed on me. People driving off without paying for gas. Management was bad at training and threatened to let me go everyday after being chewed out for not knowing how to do something that I was never shown how to do. The worst part was having to watch people that were getting gas because they would drive off and not pay for it. That would just be another reason to be yelled at by the manager. There are no breaks, you can barely have a chance to use the restroom. If someone bought tons of lottery tickets or anything thing that was time consuming you would end up with a very long line. A long line gave people oppertunities to drive off without paying for gas. The worst part was the management and it was the reason I left without saying a word. The most enjoyable thing of the job was working by myself in the little box. The most important for me was the paycheck and I really needed one."
bad,Worst job I ever had.
bad,managers expected to work long hours with no help and turnover is high do to not enough labor hours allocated to stores to have the ability to manage stores effectively.
bad,the job was fine the manger sucked. she was not understanding there was a lot of favoritism going on and i could not get with that at all so i left.....................
bad,"as an assistant manager, you're pretty much a cashier with the title of assistant manager. they don't train you for what you need to do. Depending who your manager is they won't help you most of the time, and the labor and work put in is hardly recognized."
bad,"Put simply, one is expected to work themselves to the brink of insanity while simultaneously being kept comfortably under the poverty line."
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had!  The current manager is untrustworthy, devious, and a liar.  She will go behind your back and tell other employees things about you and make stuff up as well.  This place was awful overall as a job mainly because of the lack of management caring and experience!   I would not recommend this place to anyone ever!"
bad,"this location is a kiosk and not the full store. they go through several managers and assistant managers. you have to stand your entire shift,do not get lunch breaks etc. the standing with small range of movement within kiosk can cause your limbs to be stiff if u work consecutive days.your shift changes frequently even with your availability being known.this is a busy location as oppose to some of the other locations."
bad,"I worked here for a short while but I would not suggest this job to anyone. You have to either work incredibly long hours without a break, alone in a small box or quite short hours. Management is horrible. They have people working for them that treat their employees, like they are beneath them. You can get written up from every little action and you are not trained properly. So no matter how experienced you are if you forget to do one little thing during your shift your written up for it. This includes forgetting to front face every single item before you close."
bad,The manager in Columbus indiana is crazy!!!  treats customer like dirt..and doesn't follow the rules and regulations and blames it on other employees... Makes you feel like garbage almost everyday.  Most definitely steals from the company.
bad,"It is very difficult to work for a company where you either do not have a manager at all or consistently have a new manager, which was the case with this company.  In interviews they talk the position up, telling you that you will recieve set days off each week, that there won't be a problem working around a school schedule, etc.  The district manager expects perfection and threatened my position when my class schedule changed (even though I had signed up for only a five week course for the benefit of the company).  I also found that a job opening was posted for my position when I was out of work, with a doctor's note, while having bronchitis.  I was not given much authority in this position, and it even went to the extreme that although an employee had outright cussed me out and suggested fighting me on numerous occasions, she was never reprimanded for it!  This company as a whole is very dysfunctional, very competitive, and this specific store is in a terrible part of town where employees are forced to deal with break ins and robberies, as well as being threatened by many of the people living in the area."
bad,"Productive and fun workplace to in,but lack good  manger skills"
bad,"I was hired in as an Assistant Manager. Manager had not had a day off in months and was only interested in getting someone there so that he could leave. I was trained on the register and after a couple of days training, I was left on my own. I got almost zero training as an assistant and after 3 months I could barely do the paperwork as most of the time I was running the register while he was trying to teach me things ! Very abusive towards his employees ! Would call the person that closed the night before at 5am and yell at them about something they had left undone. I was there 4 months and we went through 6 cashiers so I barely got days off because schedule changed constantly ! I hurt my back stocking the cooler and things got worse from there. I was demoted to Head cashier and was told I would be kept at my same pay. Well, my pay was actually cut .50 an hour and I was put on night shift. Then today I came in and my hours had been cut down to 28 hrs a week ! He is fully staffed right now with the newest employee being there 4 days. He said if I could make more sales than her then I would get more hours ! He was always pitting the employees against each other in this manner. After I stuck by him through all the hard times, I was treated as expendable. You couldn't ever call him with a problem or question without being yelled at. And I do mean YELLED ! Basically was a waste of time and energy to work there. I don't know about any other stores, but this guy is NOT someone you want to work for ! You will not get so much as a thank you for anything you do no matter how hard you"
bad,The last place on earth I will consider for a job.No training .the emolyee for them is always stupid.The Territory Manager is awful arrogant
bad,"Turnover rate for cashiers is horrible. They are underpaid for what is required of them. Being the Store Manager, I was constanly on the register. The DM took the chair we had and said there is no sitting and you would have to hunch over or sit on your knees to do schedules, reports. . The DM demands all these things done, but does not give the time and if you do something wrong or not to their standards, they will yell and degrade you on the phone. And the emails you receive are just as insulting. When you are graded,which will determine your raise, the DM will give bad scoring and will tell you this will effect your raise and forgets what it is like to run a store. They do not care about your crew, family life, being sick."
bad,"Constantly pushing you to sell stupid candy bars or whatever promotion they have at the time. So annoying. Was hired as a full time employee but wasn't allowed over 25 hours. Was expected to drop everything in life to come to work if someone called out or if the manager just up and decided to have a meeting. "
bad,"I worked for over a year for Murphy Express the full store. A manager in another location had to have back surgery and I as an assistant manager was asked if I would fill the role of the store manager returned and I agreed. I was there for 8 months with no additional pay, no raise, no promotion. I was turned to salary, so I could spend more time not 50 extra hours a week. This company sucks!"
bad,unfair treatment lots of favoritism only good thing is pay very busy so you must be on your toes speaking of feet you stand for about 7-8 not allowed to sit.
bad,"I worked 12 hour shifts back in 04' at the Lewisburg, Tn store."
bad,"Murphy usa is not a good place to work at, but it is a good start if you want to learn customer service. This work place attracts rude people. Not a good place at all, but of course it isn't a perfect world."
bad,horrible job.management doesn't care about you or anything that goes on
bad,"What a god awful company and place to work.  If you want to submit to micromanagement, being hung out to dry, being thrown under the bus and being patronized by people that are ill-equipped to serve as your superior, then this is the place for you. Favoritism, good old boy and girl networks abound.  Rank has its privileges hypocrisy all around. Don't dare tell the kings and princes and princesses they have no clothes. El Dorado has a Wal-Mart, so you better be comfortable with that as your sense of community, entertainment and social life.  There is little else.  Lots of crime too.  But Murphy has proclaimed values they don't embrace nor live by, has a horrible leader in IT, Marketing and HR and most hate their jobs.  Accountants actually like their jobs here though.  Beware, this is a Stepford employee place and you can't trust anyone or they are related.  Do yourself a favor and do not work for Murphy USA.  (Murphy oil is okay)  If you work from the premise that they know everything and you know nothing, but will polish apples forever, you may fit in and maybe even move up."
bad,"Great atmosphere too meet and great people from all walks of life, very fast pase. Overall compensation for what's wanted and Area Supervision not supportative or encouraging, The company has in place a mystery shopper program that out ranks local laws where in they hire someone 25 too 30 that goes into a location and attempt too purchase items requiring showing of ID,if employee in place do not ID this mystery shopper it is an automatic lost of employment, the argument is that your local government supports this action but when they do their mystery shopper it is ALWAYS done with a minor therefore this is a very bad in many eyes of entrappment, many have lost their jobs for this action. This is the hardest part of the job, dealing with rude customers is most pleasant. Once the employee lost his job for not ID'ng someone he knew. Healthcare needs addresing also, going to the doctor equals additional debt added to your already table."
bad,"I recently left the Ozark store, why? Because of the managements lack of appreciation and motivation. At that company if a manager senses you would do there job for them than they will try there best to do so."
bad,"They lied to me and fired me for some stupid reason because the lady I was suppose to replace decided she wasn't going transfer. They are very rude, slow and don't treat the customers or the employees right. I am a really good cashier and have lots of experience in retail and at gas stations. And I an very unhappy with this company."
bad,"The manager would tell at employees and customers. He had expectations of employees but none of himself, he ran the store as if he own the company. He gave us no breaks and ran us ragged with additional tasks. I was very sick with strep within the 24 hours and the manager demanded me come in to work."
bad,"Terrible hours and expectations of staff"
bad,"I worked for the store in Sanford, NC to a manager who was woefully incompetent and a district manager that was simply a monster to deal with.  The company touts Integrity and Respect unfortunately in my experience the people in management for the most part lack both.  There is advancement opportunities in that the attrition rate is sky high in this company.  Proceed at your own peril but knowing what I know now I wish I had worked else where."
bad,"I only work here because I need a job. I have worked in customer service for many years, but the customers who come here are absolutely ridiculous, not to mention rude. I have a thick skin, you have to in order to work here, but more than a few times I've literally been brought to tears, not because I'm weak, but because I was two seconds from putting my hands on some of those people. They curse at you, degrade you, speak to you as if your stupid...and management does nothing other than say deal wit it, basically. You work long hours and get no break and there is too much work for just one person to do, especially if you're the closer. I would never recommend this job to anyone unless like me, you have no other option. I literally start counting how many dreadful hours I have ot be there as soon as I hit the clock until my shift is over."
bad,"Maintained paper work, operated cash register, stocked shelves, and maintained a clean work environment."
bad,Murphy USA in Bristol Tn is the worse job I've ever had. If you have a problem there is no one to go to cause the Manager and DM are best buds and you can't complain cause the manager is like go ahead I'll know before anyone else. Don't get me wrong I did like working there. But you can't talk to your manager without her saying I'll take care of it and nothing never happen she just turns people against you and tells them lies. Murphy's needs to get rid of the DM and put someone else in there that can do the job She lies on her visits and after that her and the Manager goes out and smokes for a long time. The manager can do whatever she wants she says her job is to do the paperwork and make sure her truck gets there she can smoke anytime she wants her children call her 20 times a day she is always cursing while on the phone. But this is the stuff you have to put up with if you want a job there.
bad,"My experience working here was frustrating.  The store I was hired at has a continuous problem keeping its employees, managers and cashiers. My first few months there was horrible: the stockroom a mess to the point we did not know where anything was or what we had in stock. Also, the only manger they had at this store was the assistant that was completely careless and barely worked. We had to keep bringing in other managers from surrounding stores to fill in and they were sometimes mean and rude, which is why I'm no longer employed here. The pay is low but they expect a lot from its employees."
bad,"i was hired to be an assistant manager. i never received any true manager training. i was expected to close alone receive a truck and train another employee after 3 days of working. i was called the next morning and when i said hello i got ""what the **** happened last night"" and during another instance my hand was smacked because i deposited a bill facing the wrong way. the manager is completely inappropriate with customers and employees and its a very unprofessional work environment. family was harassed when i had an emergency out of state about my whereabouts although i had spoken to the store and district manager. after i quit to manager and district manager, i was continually called and my family that went to the store was questioned."
bad,"Murphy Oil was not a good place to work for I was not trained to do anything but to work outside, got to run the register one time"
bad,I was terminated over a very trivial situation.  The new manager they had didn't like me and I eventually got fired over a minor technicality and now am no longer able to work at this place.  So just stay under the radar if you want to stay here.
bad,"NOTICE HOW ON MANY OF THESE REVIEWS, MANAGERS, ASSISTANT MANAGERS, & DMs RATE THE COMPANY HIGH. I have worked for one other gas company and this Is by far the worst! You bust your bums all day, and don't even bother trying to get a break in between. You have more rude customers than anywhere else because everything in the store tends to malfunction. The health insurance is terrible, and unknown. There is no up-to-date computer system or security system. DMs are insane because they try and tell you how things should be done but don't relate to customers. Many employees steal! Some employees are fired for no reason! If you're co-workers don't do their job you are SOL because you have to pick up the slack! Managers and higher-ups reep the benefits, while cashiers do everything! You only get vacay as part time after a year. NO SICK DAYS! The only good thing about the job is the nicer customers, and if you are fortunate enough, you may end up with a good manager and 2 good assistant managers. BEWARE OF THE POST PAY OPTION FOR GAS!!!!"
bad,No training programs available.  Management is not organized
bad,"The managers are messy,they gossip about the other employees.you cannot go to school  working for this company,the want you to have an open availability.the store manager texts you all times of the night threatening to fire you,if you dont get you scores up.you have to beg for a weekend off.they dont rotate the schedule.they arent fair what so ever,im glad i got away."
bad,Terrible management. Not room for advancement. Sexist in the NE Arkansas area. All women management with no experience. Water in gas tanks. No help or support from corporate offices. Will never buy from Murphy ever again.
bad,"I worked as a manager for over 8 years. 7 was good. It was Murphy Oil. Then they spun off into Murphy USA. After that it was as if nothing was good enough. We had always hired for 40 hours a week, then policy changed to part time employees only. 100 hours a month only. It was a task to stay staffed. No one except management  received benefits any longer. A 50 hour work week became a 70 hour work week for most managers. The pay was excellent for management, but the strain on the body was not worth it . I was salary and my employees actually made more than me per hour due to long hours worked. Upper management changed and in our district alone, 6 long term managers resigned in the first 6 months due to working conditions."
bad,"This job have very little room for advancement.Always 1 store manager and 2 assist manager. Cashier is expendable, you can get a write up for basely anything. The job security in this job is low and the benefit is almost none if you just starting out. How the pay decent and fair but it barely cover cost of gas to go to work. You do get no break at all . Even state required breaks however murphy goes around it somehow. There is very little room for advancement in this job. Been there over 1 year and I make the same as the new girl. This company do pay above minunum wage but the 25 hour per week rule make me want to find a new job."
bad,"I was interviewed and sent an email congratulating me on my offer of employment pending background/drug testing. I went and took my drug test waited a week then called to inquire if they got it back yet. They did not. Another week went by. Called again. They said they couldn't access it and asked me several times for a tracking number. After a few more days I called the testing company who informed me the results had been sent during the first week I had called to inquire about it. They sent it again and told me if the employer did not receive it in an hour to have them call. Did that and called employer to let them know. They said they still didn't get it and asked for the elusive tracking number AGAIN. I gave them every number I had down to the specimen number and all other numbers from the form given at the clinic. I have not heard from them since I gave them that info and it has been another 2 weeks. I live a clean lifestyle and have always passed background checks and drug tests, so I know it is not something I did. If you are applying at Hutchinson, MN don't expect competence. I told this person I had already put in my 2 weeks notice at other job and only had 2 days of it left. They never even bothered to tell me I might not want to leave my old job yet, they just let me end up without a job at all.  "
bad,good pay but they get their money worth.  they require a lot of dedication.  the hardest part of the job is keeping a good crew.
bad,"I feel there were not enough hours to support working there.  If you are a student who does not require a certain per week, it is a great place to work."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Never know if your pay is going to be deposited and get in trouble for doing things district managers in past have approved. Once you leave the company they decide who gets paid what they are owed in terms of accrued sick and vacation pay. They owe me more than $10,000"
bad,It depends on what day of the week it was that I was really needed. I was able to learn so much over the past 5 years. I was able to go to other store to help clean and reset them. I helped other stores out by getting them staffed. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was finding really good help for part-time cashiers for under 25 hours per week. People didn't won't to do the work for 25 hours or less a week. Because they had a lot to do on there shifts. I enjoyed my regular customers more than anything. They really made my day when I was able to see them.
bad,"I worked here for several years it started off great but then slowly went down hill to where it was unbearable. No breaks, have to work out in severe weather conditions, seemed like you never got a day off and a life outside of Murphys was unheard of. They have poor management. No one ever follows the same rules and there is poor communication and no accountability unless it suits someone's agenda and forget even trying to take a problem to someone higher up."
bad,"Cashiers are not able to be full time, and cannot receive benefits.  Always work alone, low pay.  No breaks.  Hardest part of the job is getting in the cooler to stock the drinks.  Best part is meeting the customers."
bad,"Very fast paced , hectic retail job . A day at work started at around 4 am to open the store and get things done before the store opened . Once opened , there was a steady flow of customers getting everything from gas to food and other things . I worked this position as a fulltime college student , it could be a very stressful job at times due to the demand of people ."
bad,"First off, 8 hours on your feet with little to no breaks. No recognition for going above and beyond. Management leaving belittling notes almost daily. She is constantly creating new rules and then breaks them herself. Hardest part of the job is being mostly by yourself. Overlap of an hour to get cleaning and cooler done is not enough. Most enjoyable part is days off. Management is very poor."
bad,Pay is ok.but hours are not enough to add up to a decent size pay check. Favortisum is a huge problem at the lewisburg location. No breaks no lunches. One man show when you are there working.are repeativaly told to things that managment would never do. Used and abused
bad,"over crowded.  things worn out or falling apart"
bad,"To be honest, the only good thing about this job, is the flexible schedule.  The management was horrendous, and what made it even worse is the fact that you work so hard to where you sacrifice your own family time, they still crack the whip on you.  Stocking and ringing up customers wasn't the hard part, it was being FORCED to ID people that I just dealt with 10 minutes ago who I KNOW are old enough to purchase age restricted products, even though they just bought them the first time.  Sometimes you would even be fortunate enough to get a 5 minute break, IF you're lucky.  Even though I had a disability on my left knee, they still want me to stand for 9 hours... Unbelievable..  I am SO GLAD I finally got onto my profession career instead of this place.  If you are desperate for a job where these people want to beat you to the ground, I'd recommend just working at Walmart.  At least they let their employees off for Christmas!!!"
bad,"The company is great and have some good benefits. However, the people running it need to get out and work in a store and have to meet the expectations they expect of their employees. Turnover rate for cashiers when I left the company was well over 200%. Which means they will replace a cashier almost 2.5 times a year. Store management turnover was almost 150% a year and district manager turnover was about 75% a year. So yes, advancement was very possible, if yoiu can hang in there and make the position. Once there, just remember your life span is short. They promote monthly contest that are biased toward stores in high volume areas. Many people cheat just to try to keep the district manager off your case. If caught, you're fired. If you don't achieve what they expect they treat you badly through emails and trash talk. You are expeacted to perform shift duties while you are toh only person running the store. You finish a customer and run outside and empty trash or fill coke coolers etc all while watching for the next customer to come to window. Murphys are typically very busy which makes getting things done while by yourself difficult. District managers have a check list of things they do each visit. They grade you on things you do or don't do. Don't get something doen on the daily list they count you off which affects your yearly numbers which is part of your evaluation for raises, if you are lucky enough to actually have a dm evaluate you. However, they never mark the things that would count against themself if a negative manner. DM's typically have an integrity issue in this"
bad,It's not the ideal job if you have career goals. It is for younger people who are unsure or for people with no career goals yet.
bad,"I worked for Murphy USA as a cashier got promoted to assistant manager in 3 months, where I had to pretty much teach myself how to do an assistant manager job. It really would have been a great place to work if they would just learn to manage better and treat their employees with some respect."
bad,"Typical day would be counting ciggs, cleaning pumps, cleaning parking lot, empty trash, resupplying product at pumps,stocking merchandise, cleaning the bathroom, your training will consist mostly of shift duties and of coarse reading for one day of training. Eventually the job becomes easy. Schedule changes at last minute are often. Customers were often made fun of by asst manager. She enjoyed carding people she knew and didn't particularly like just to make them mad, Very spiteful individual. Manager was a nice guy but too close to the asst manager. notes would be left to make you feel inadequate. often implied that you didn't do things that you did. unprofessional notes left all over the place. This place has a history of unstable staffs, after working here I can honestly say it is a result of one person. An asst manager that is given to much authority, Please think twice before applying here. The best part of the job was the customers, that is the only thing I will miss."
bad,"All the mgmt. team are like robots. You work your BUTT OFF for the mgr and asst mgr to get their bonuses. It is non-stop and they quote the labor law to you as to why you don't get any breaks on your 8 hour shift. (or more, depending on who doesn't show up that day) I do not recommend this as a good place to work."
bad,"This was an extremely fast paced job indeed. From the moment I came in to the time I left it was non-stop. Assisting customers at the register, upselling products, answering the phone, cleaning up gas spills, restocking merchandise, taking up inventory. What I loved about it was the fact that it was a laid back environment as far as the interaction with the patrons was concerned. You built a rapport with them as they continuously came to do business there due to the low prices and convenience. We could joke around in a friendly manner and they appreciated the courteous service I offered not to mention I was the fastest of the clerks."
bad,"Pay isn't nearly enough for all the work that had to be done. No breaks. Most work is done by hourly cashiers,  not management.  A lot of the time you're alone,  no time to eat,  use the restroom or smoke if you're a smoker.  No time off, erratic schedule sometimes you are to close,  then be right back at 9 or 10 in the morning. Just not ideal if you're married or have children."
bad,Worked for 2 years and met my manager maybe twice the whole time. No management worked a single night shift my schedule was closing shifts 5-6 nights a week at first which was hard to schedule around or do anything with especially after getting only a dollar raise the entirety of my time there. Also created a harsh work environment starting different employees out at different wages. My coworkers constantly had drama. Just wouldn't recommend
bad,I am not an office environment person so that did not help.  But the training is poor and the people are clicky.  They are not transparent about anything going on in the company.  You will most definitely do more work then your job requires but not be paid for it.  They do not like to convert hourly to full time and hourly does not receive benefits
bad,"I was not a fan of this company. The management has not kept up with times, they have a very old school mentality, require ""presence in the office"" even if someone is working in a global role (and works after hours). No flexibility. Benefits are tailored for man with stay at home spouses."
bad,"While there is the benefit of flexible scheduling, in my experience, management was atrocious, advancement was slim to none, and they lost an employee out of me."
bad,"A typical work day at Murphy USA Oil would consist of being by yourself except for the first and last hour of your shift unless you're closing, then it's just the first hour. If you have a question about something that you weren't trained for you can call the management team but that doesn't mean they'll answer when you call so you're left to figure it out on your own. No one communicates with each other even the management team, so if we're out of something you have to take 15 minutes to look for something that we don't even have. A typical work day also includes being cursed at and degraded by the customers. Management rarely shows you how to do anything. They automatically assume that the employees know how to do everything, and when you do something wrong they cut your hours which we are only allowed to work part time so that's less that 25 hours a week. I rarely see my coworkers. The hardest part of my job is trying to get all my outside work done while helping customers and doing my inside work all by myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i get off."
bad,it was a ok place to work except the kiosk was a pretty tight squeeze.
bad,"Management that acts like high school kids, lots of drama, rude to inappropriate co-workers"
bad,I learned that Murphy Oil corporation is a weak company. There management is unfocused and not knowledgeable at all. The co-workers were good individuals that have the right to proper training and coaching. I feel sorry for them that they will not receive  this training. Balancing work and life is hard for the fact that if you are a so called assistant manager you are on call 24/7. I feel the hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and the easiest was that work was more of a game them actual work.
bad,I was hired to work approximately 18 hrs a week which is what I wanted. Shortly after I started working there the manager was fired. That left me and 3 others. I was constantly being harassed by the so called assistant manager to do more than I was doing. All the while increasing my hrs. I complained about it to the DM but nothing was done. The other assistant manager became the manager and I thought things were going to go better. Then the other worker was fired and they started piling the hrs on me. I am 61 and a hard working woman but they were constantly wanting more than I could give so I am now looking for another job. That one was killing me.
bad,"Most weeks worked 6-7 days a week. 70+ hours a week, but was salary and got paid for 45. Benefits were not good at all. You could not plan a life, or make personal plans outside of your work schedule. District managers, had a couple of good ones....but had some that thought the company owned you."
bad,"there was no breaks, the customers could be pretty terrible, the no full time positions, but there pay was decent and the pay upgrades were better"
bad,They terminated me because of a mishap Murphy was a nice company to work for but when it came to employees on a certain level they had their picks and chooses. I'm talking about the DM's of the company.
bad,"Everybody, lest this be your first job ever, please read the reviews and take them into consideration and STAY AWAY. The management is horrible there and the company is #1 and the customer is second, always, but they will not say verbally, however working there for a while it will become rather obvious. The management will give you a whiplash, they say one thing, the district manager says another, Murphy OIL tech support will say else otherwise, so pretty much your screwed if you do or screwed if you don't. Unless you are doing what I'm currently doing and sticking with this job 'til you find something better, I highly suggest staying away. However, if you don't take these reviews in heed, you'll find out first hand. I'm not scaring anyone away from trying to get a job, I'm just saying please think before applying here and prepare yourself."
bad,They will cheat you anyway they can. You bust your butt for them and they dont appreciate it. You are replaceable and they do not care about keeping you happy even if you work hard for them.
bad,I didnt like the hours or my co workers. People steal gas and you get in trouble. Its hard to watch 12 pumps..
bad,The people are nice to work with but you are by yourself too much. There are only four workers and three of them are management.
bad,The company was great to work for. The pay is good. It's not very many hours with working six days a week on average. Management is a joke. You're not well informed of changes and there is virtually no training. The only training I had was two days and only consisted of eight hours of training videos. The professionalism from co-workers is also a joke. They keep poor store managers (at least where I was) just so they don't have to train a new one. Overall I would not suggest this company to anyone. The pay was good and that's about it.
bad,Good place to work and fun co workers but management needs a lot of help. Management is terrible you barely knoiw when your gonna work.
bad,clocking in counting register customer service stocking and cleaing at night closing reports . running of the lotto and credit card michines
bad,"Murphy Oil is a weird company to work for.  Depending on the mangers you answer to, they change frequently,  your boss could be a stand up boss tough but understanding or a self centered my way or fire you way.  The company as a whole sucks in the sense you have numerous people to answer to and one may love your work and another hates your work."
bad,My day would be okay. But I didn't care for the high school drama. Another thing was that so weeks you would work 50 hours and then be dorp down to like 16 hours a week. No time for family at all. Also don't think about getting sick there is no one to ever cover your shift at all. Don't get me wrong I loved my custmoers but just wasn't worth all the time I losted with my Kids
bad,"it was okay"
bad,"I traveled to Murphy USA gas stations around the US working on their computers and wires and such and I enjoyed my job very much.  Although of course there were nights I wish I was home because of the area I had to work in, I couldn't ask for much more in my job.  As far as the store workers go, I rarely heard good things.  Most of the workers in any state I was in looked dog tired and still tried to keep a smile on their face because their job depended on it.  That is no way to be if you ask me.  Instead of getting to actually be happy, they had to put up a front because of lack of management, rude customers, and not enough time to get all of their duties completed in a reasonable time.  I would never work for Murphy in a gas station.  I would only work at the home office again as an employee or contractor.  Not worth it just thinking about the workers faces."
bad,"Typical day: come in, do shift change, start stocking and helping customers. "
bad,"Worked there with a manager who constantly changed her mind about the schedule, and everything else. 2 days off requests a month, set schedule! No days off requests EVER, no set schedule! Assistant manager every other weekend off, Assistant manager mandatory every weekend! So on and so forth. Wonder why people constantly quit? Because it's that bad. It's a VERY corporate place run by a big home office full of corporate people. I loved my customers, I learned that I can take on any job thrown at me because I just dealt with an intensely awful one."
bad,"Meeting and greeting customers doing credit card and cashsales; learn how to run numbers for weekly lottery; supervsion was not the best, most of the co-workers were descent people; hardest part dealing with messed up moods and attitudes; learning new skills and cleanliness of store"
bad,"poor work environment, no breaks in 10 hour shifts district manager always demeaning manager and employees in front of customers"
bad,"Poor planning and management do not reward hard work or stand behind their employees.  You are only as good as your last job and treated everyday as replaceable commodity.  They pay well, but only because they have to - a revolving door."
bad,"All about politics, They dont like your opinion, they will make your life unbearablel until they find an arbitrary reason to fire you ot torment you into quitting,"
bad,"Job was a good one for a high school student, the pay was decent and the enviroment was fun at times. Learned a lot on customer service and how to deal with any situations a customer had."
bad,excellent pay for management. too much a workload in one day with not enough hours. company with a very hight turnover ratio in cashiers only due to the pay and workload they have to do. If the pay was better for them i think the turnover ratio would be very low. 24hr 7 day week a job. No time for family at all.
bad,"If you take this position, get out and wash windshields and talk to people face-to-face.  I had one DM that was supportive and another who was not.  If you are training, keep in mind you can go 3 months without hitting payroll, so don't burn yourself out."
bad,"A company that is reimagining itself.  I'm the near future I believe that it will once again be a great company to work for. But right now corporate cut back payroll hours until the store can barely function.  Personally, as assistant store manager I have done my best to support the district and store managers but now it's time to move on."
bad,Unable to have set schedules.
bad,"Murphy has great compensation.. unfortunately there is absolutely no work/home balance. you are expected to have nothing but Murphy in your life.. duties pile on and nothing is ever good enough. the companies policies and procedures are open for interpretation as they come down the chain of command, so you really never know who to listen to. I am a store manager for them, and although I love my job, after 8 years and 14 district managers, I feel its time to move on !"
bad,Not the kind of company you want to work for if you're fast paced. Job was mediocre. Flexible schedule. Don't recommend if you don't have retail experience.
bad,"Mananger was not the best due to attitude but the job was decent would not go back to that location. Main duties are ringing up item, pulling cigarettes and breaking register"
bad,Working with customers are a delight. I learned how to work with customers.
bad,"Come in clock in work with customers make sure everybody pays for their gas card anyone under 40 for cigars etc. Management was ok they need to be more organized, co- worker I didn't really get to know because I worked by myself at night doing closing. The hardest thing about this job was selling substance such as cigars, cigarettes and I don't agree with it. There was nothing enjoyable about this job when  you are a woman closing form 5 to 11 at night by yourself and anything can happen."
bad,Very enjoy place to work to meet different people and to know their does and dont.
bad,"I learned P&L, how to schedule multiple employees."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of working in a specialized computer program. I learned how to make changes to financial statements and how to do the month end closing process. Management of Murphy was very inadequate. The people I worked with were great. The hardest part of  the job was the down time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everybody was together and hanging out.
bad,"I liked the company but I did not like some of the things that went on in this place, personal reasons."
bad,"If you like a job where you work 8.5 hours a day with no breaks, no lunch, barely get to make it to the bathroom and having to work by yourself with no help then go for it.... You work day will intell clocking in counting down the safe and your drawer then get right to your customers. Not a problem. Then the shift before you leaves and then you have to stock all your cigarette sleeves and cartons. Count every carton and pack of cigarettes that is in the entire building, stock all coolers, sweep the parking lot, change all trash cans on the premises, do fuel surveys ON TIME even if you have customers waiting in line, make sure paper is in all fuel pumps, and make sure customers are served in a timely manner, all this with no lunch breaks or breaks period. All of this has to be done or you will be fired. If this is something you feel you can handle go for it! But me myself was not taking it anymore you will work like a slave and bust your behind for a measley 8 bucks an hour. I will never work for them again if I had to nor would I recommend this company to anybody.... Good luck!!"
bad,The manager made me do all his work. The assistant manager and the female cashier stole products. I was promissed two promotions and never received them.
bad,"A typical day at work included sales reporting, cash reconciliation, and inventory audits. I learned to be a better troubleshooter. Management was easy to work with. Co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the working conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with regular customers."
bad,It was a fun place to work for you have your regular customers everyday that you know their names. Also you meet new people everyday.
bad,"it was too busy for such a small store, bad management. the hardest part of the job was keeping up."
bad,I was fired over a false allegation that had been brought before me and was proven to be false. You used me until the end of the holiday season and told me I was fired because I smoked in my car. They play major favoritism
bad,"I wanted to work part time while I attend school full-time. Well for almost two months they had me working 40 hours, about 16 of which were in a city 40 miles away. The work is actually not hard, just running the register and stocking and cleaning. The management doesn't listen to their employees though. They don't really care about their employees and give no feedback unless it is negative. One of my coworkers gets complained to every day regardless of how hard he works, while I get no feedback except from other employees. Our manager won't give us feedback to our face, instead they complain to other employees. The hardest part is trying to get everything done in an eight-hour shift."
bad,Work was fun and easy the company takes care of you. Company meetings and Managers meetings are always fun. Very family oriented.
good,"Very easy job, working a cash register cleaning bathrooms after heroin addicts leave dirty needles in them, i should also mention that if your there for too long and are due for a raise you will be mystery shopped every day until you fail"
good,"the manager of Murphy oil relies to much on her employees to do her work for her and requires her employees to cover her absences and sometimes work off the clock when things are in a bind. I was told many times ""I will make it up to you next week"" but it never happened."
good,had a lot of customers but managment didnt care about anyone but them for example my grandmother died while i was at work he told me to leave but to make sure to be back by a certain time and wouldnt even give me the day off for the funeral its sad
good,"It was an alright environment to work, stayed pretty busy with a diverse customer atmosphere.  The manager could use a class or two for constructive criticism."
good,Typical day started off changing shifts and balancing my own register. Enjoyed working with customers closely
good,i enjoy working here because im a people person but as far as management or the way they give you a chance to advance is so un ethical thats why i quit due to favoritizem and i was doing duties to be the next assistant supervisor but was passed up because her friend had applied for position
good,I was only there for a short time. The management was burnt out and needed a vacation. There were a lot of issues with management and other employees.
good,Its amazing how i worked so long for them but when i was going through a life crisis it was if i didnt even exsit and how easily i was replaced didnt help matters.
good,"It took a whole month before i got my first pay check. You dont get breaks and they expect you to NOT eat for an 8 hour shift. Their was never a set schedule, you played it by hear and hoped you weren't doing something important when they call out of the blue and say they need you. the pay was okay but not worth the stress. The whole store would shut down at random times and when i would call the manager on my cell she would tell me it was her day off and not to bother her so i would be left with a lot of angry people on my hands. And you work alone at night,"
good,"Tiny, cramped space, terrible management, and they ask too much of one person."
good,"The customers were great. Management not so reachable. There was never enough employees so I'd be the lucky one who would open and close. There was nothing bad about the job but the management was not good. There was a manager whom hired me and two weeks later never saw her again. For the next year it was an assistant manager and myself doing most of the work, That is what finally drove me to quit and go to Hess,"
good,"At Murphy Usa , learning is a everyday experience , This is a customer based job , It like all jobs have there up and down."
good,All about numbers. Only as good as your numbers. Upper management some were great to work for others not so great. They like to change your locations a lot. If you don't like counting this is not the job for you.
good,I worked at the Lucedale location and the manager was awful. Promised me to keep my hours after I financed a car. I called out and went to the emergency room because my sugar bottomed out and she still wanted me to come in and work the last 2 hours of my shift which I wasn’t allowed to as the doctors said. She cut my hours. We had curfews out by the county police department due to snow no one allowed on the roads got written up because I called out.
good,"Ringing up customers, must have knowledge of products. Customers become livid over trivial things. For example, their brand of cigarettes are recently sold out and they can not wait until the following morning to purchase them. Management looks at employees to avoid drive offs, but doesn't want employees to stop the pumps. They continue to make the pumps post pay and scolds employees for having a drive off. "
good,"I worked here for 5 months and I enjoyed my job. The problem was a district manager always threatening your job, never helping you, or not being detailed in what he wanted. He was always assuming every employee wanted a free ride. I was told by 2 store managers that I was their best employee they had and when I got injured I was treated like a criminal. When I asked how to report the injury no one told me how to or tried to even report it correctly in fear of the district manager who threatened everybody. I feel I would of stayed with the company if it hadn't been for the district manager and had people known how to report an incident (certain things aren't covered properly in training since you have to remember a lot in a short amount of time)."
good,"Worked alone with no one there to help."
good,"...But if you're working in the Pasadena, TX or Houston, TX areas, and your district falls under someone who shares the name of a popular friend of the Barbie Doll, your day is going to be hell, particularly if you're female, non-christian, or a person of color. Oh you're working for a promotion? Not if he can help it. Nothing slips past this guy, except what you think of him. Thankfully, you get some of the best co-workers around. The store management can be iffy, at best. You're likely to get a salty veteran or a noob of a store manager, with a combination pair of a street smart assistant and their companion tends to not know their face from their backside. The job's so easy that it doesn't require too much thought. It does require multitasking, which makes for interesting shifts. However, the job doesn't pay much and this sad excuse of a company doesn't want you to live without government assistance or a second job. You will not be paid more than $10 an hour or work more than 20 hours a week unless you're management."
good,Very fast pace and you have to multitask. Management has to have a great work ethic and have patience as well. You have to be aware of time and your surrounding at all times. I did enjoy my customers so you have to be a people person.
good,"My review of Murphy Oil is no room for advancement, also no benefits were given after a year. Great people to work with                  -Employees-  Must have reliable Transportation"
good,"I learned a lot about management at this company.  However, while running 6 stores at one time and only receiving a commission check from 1 store I was also training someone else to actually be my District Manager.  My typical day started at 2 a.m. and was not over until approximately 11 p.m."
good,They place too much work on a small amount of people. Instead of outsourcing the mechanical and maintenance work that needs to be done on critical items they use untrained employees to fix the problems which result in more problems. Murphy Oil states they pay more on the hour because they do this but they need to get it together as far as allowing enough employees to work throughout the week so the general work load is not such a burden on the management only. They will not allow cashiers to work more than 25 hours a week due to benefits.
good,The murphy's I worked the current manager was very discriminating against me. That is why I choose to Leave the Company.
good,If you want to go back to the un-needed drama of your high school years then this is the place for you. If you want to have a mature work environment where your information is kept private then this is NOT the place for you.  No boundaries when it comes to confidentiality and they are very rude. The hours are not consistent and never good.
good,"A typical day at Murphy began at 3:30 a.m. when I came in to start inventory counts of every and all merchandise including cigarretts and grocery items. Daily accounting which included opening safe to count money from previous days work, routine maintenance on gas pumps, receiving and ordering merchandise and gasoline....doing the daily deposits, updating work schedule for my employees, shipping items out to sister stores that they may need.........making sure all our customers had a satisfied experience with our gas station......Made sure we were active in our community to help those families who needed it, etc etc. I have high standards of work ethics, work morals and integrity."
good,"you cannot do anything at this job, the law says you have to get atleast 15 min break per 6 hours, you don't even get it because your always by yourself"
good,Management only out for herself. She would leave with the gas delivery driver whom she was dating to go to home depot and look at floor tile but God forbid you have a frozen and busted water pipe in winter and call in as then padshedrives past your
good,"fast paced environment, little to no benefits, not a substantial income, expected to sell sell sell with little to no reward, this is a job for someone in college or just out of school still living at home with parents"
good,Customers are great hours ain't bad no insurance unless you are in a management position  which stinks there is no balance in work and personal life job is not for everyone
good,"The job itself is very easy, fast paced, and fun to interact with regular customers.  However, the management style of the store manager made the job environment very hostile and stressful.  Unless you possess a strong personality and are one of those people that can stand up for yourself, I do not encourage you to apply."
good,Get there and Clock in. at that point i would find out what i was doing on top of my regular duties. most of the time i would have to clean the gas pumps and pick up the parking lot.  some times i would have to train a new person while i was working since the Managers where just to busy to do it.
good,Can be a hostile environment and  the manager is not willing to make you feel safe when you work overnights by yourself.
good,Murphy does not care about their employees at all. They do not properly train you .
good,"There were 3 other cashiers. two of which were very nice, the third quit without me getting to work with her very much. The hardest part of my job, was when I was pregnant and having to lift the cases of 20oz drinks out of their storage area to fill the coolers."
good,"Clock in, Count cigarettes, count money in safe and register for shift change, do shift change and restock for my shift. Then I would help customers, restock coolers and cigarettes, count cigarettes and money and get ready for my shift to end. I do the extra things management ask me."
good,"Come in and count down the register, help customers, stock shelves, take inventory, clean. Store managers were great but higher up was awful. Made employees do more work than paid for."
good,Very multi-tasking performance. Register countdown and inventory of product sales. The opening of operation by checking facility and surrounding area inside and out. Small work area and very difficult shift change. Operation of business still flowing in the middle of shift change as well as monitoring the gas monitors and cash drop. There is also commission sales on certain products as an incentive. There is a fear of safety at night shift if closing alone. The pay is not equal to the liability of the job and I moved from store to store without clear understanding. I also had a very uncomfortable and inadequate encounter with one of the district manager which lead to me not accepting the job opportunity.
good,"This was a filler position while waiting for better employment. At the time the district manager and store managers were not approachable, both wrapped up in their personal lives and problems instead of concerning themselves with the business. Both have been replaced since."
good,"solid place if you are in high school or are looking for a part time work experience. First job in high school and while the pay was bad, the experience wasn't too horrible."
good,Sorry I have nothing to say about working at Murphy at this time.  Great co-workers. It was a good experience.  Massive reduction in work force.  No job security.
good,"- 100% Face to Face Customer Service"
good,"completing paperwork, payroll, ordering merchandise, weekly inventory, assisting customers at the register, working with cash, sweeping lot, cleaning bathroom, cleaning pumps, stocking and front facing merchandise, maintaining the overall look of the gas station."
good,"A typical day at work for me is assisting customers with their purchases as well as cleaning, stocking and maintain the sales floor. I  have to make sure that the store is ready to open for the next morning."
good,I learned about the gas business and how the market goes up and down from within. I also learned that hard work pays off but when the upper management does not stand behind the staff it makes for a very disappointing workplace. the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the most unpleasant part was the poor management.
good,I had fun at my job my co-workers where great. Management was not so well. The hardest part of the job was the work space and having to unload truck and still deal with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was always meeting new people and have the old ones come back again and again
good,"When I first started, the manager was okay. He wasn't nice, but he wasn't mean. After a day or two, he would snap and say 'are you stupid?"" and act like a jerk. He would expect the best out of me but why should I show someone respect when they aren't showing me any? I understood that this was his first job ever but that doesn't mean for him act this way. He didn't even train me properly. I had to call two different people for help. And whenever I saw him he would point out what I did wrong. If he wasnt yelling at me about what i did wrong that woukd be one thing. But he knows no respect. I wasn't trained adequately and tried my best. Its no wonder the turnover rate is much higher than the average median for this position. I like the company, but I didnt like the manager. People skills should really be a must for a manager in my eyes. Everyone else I worked with were nice and understanding."
good,"Very fast paced, had to learn pretty much on my own all the ins and outs of being an asst, manager. Not good benefits at all. "
good,stocking cigerettes constantly
good,It is a good job for people that can multitask and good with time limitations.
good,"I was proud of the work I did at Murphy USA because it was the most physically demanding, time consuming job I had ever held. As the manager, I was expected to work 60 hours a week on salary. The commissions were good, if you got them. They depended highly on your employees not making a mistake during the month. I loved the outside work, the sales, the customer service, but there were several jobs that were very physically demanding. It was a tough job for anyone who couldn't be in 3 places at one time, because, most of the time, the employee was working alone. Again, I was proud that I did well at Murphy USA even though I wasn't used to the hours or physical aspect of the position."
good,The old manager was great. Liked the hours and seeignthe regulars as well.
good,Murphy is a low cost operator. They operate on a day to day basis with the bare minimum staffing at the store level. Making it hard for Management to be management.
good,It was okay for a student but wouldn't want to work there long term. Pay was minimal and job was kinda depressing but other than that it wasn't to bad.
good,"There was not enough diversity at this job. You had to be one of the guys to get the good shifts. Very few people of color ,very few women.I enjoyed being apart of the bigger picture."
good,Management didn't seem to care for it's employees much. If any situations arose the employee was immediately blamed. Working conditions were cold and damp. Poor management.
good,You work alone and do not get any breaks.  Going to the bathroom is a battle.  I can not agree with that. especially for 8-10 hours.
good,"I was responsible for counting the deposit, doing the data entry, stocking and cleaning.   I  liked working with the customers.  I learned many things such as entering invoices, managing money and  overseeing other employees.  The hardest part was working entirely alone."
good,A typical day at this work place consisted of providing excellent and rapid customer service. I learned how to up sale without feeling uncomfortable. My co workers were very easy going and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain my work schedule and school schedule. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the different customers that came through.
good,"•a typical day at work- Very Fast-Pace"
good,"A typical day at Murphy USA would usually consist of organizing products,tending to customers, maintaining work area, and delivering fast, friendly, and speedy service. Management is inconsiterate and tends to put most of the work off on employees but my co-workers were very friendly and always worked as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was tolerating customers over the age of 50 curse you out about being I.D'ed for tobacco purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Nice place to work. Good district manager. But poor management. Hates to be bothered with questions and expects everything to be learned on first try. . Basically,  figure it out yourself theory. Takes advantage of good help. Cant keep employees. Not enough payroll allowed to cover what needs to be done right and for proper training and also to take care of customers in a kind and courteous manner. I really enjoyed my job. The customers was my favorite part of the job.Slow on that quarter raise {supposed to be 30 days}. And I was basically told to fix it myself online. Excuse me but that is a bosses responsibility."
good,"The job is wonderful, especially if you like to work alone, but management does not know what they are doing. Especially current store manager. Awful training, not experienced, and demands things. Definitely missed the memo in her training about humble leadership. Upper management will also tell you about possible advancements, then renege on their word."
good,My typical day at work would be slow and steady. I learned mostly everything on my own. I wasn't trained properly. My co-workers we ok. Management was not great. There was no hard part about the job and the most enjoyable part would be interacting with the customers.
good,"non stop sales ,no lunch or bathroom breaks ,i learned to take care of a lot of things,while taking care of customers at the same time. I did not think much of management ,there were things that really bothered me about that! the hardest part was being there all by yourself , the most enjoyable part was getting off and going home !"
good,was just a basic gas station job to pay my bills worked by myself.
good,"While the company generally had good management, it was clear that they were more focused on the results of everything you did, rather than how you did it, or how much your customers enjoyed you."
good,You often work independantly and are stuck in a tiny cubicle all day. I was not fond of working alone at night at a gas station. Benefits were offered but a bit pricey. Plenty of room to advance into management.
good,"Good, fun job.. As long as you do your work and make the customers happy your manager is happy. 5 to 6 days a week and only 30 very sporadic hours makes it very time consuming, and no health benefits is defiantly a minus. They promote team work, which is a great help with this type of work.. and I love the customer service side."
good,"Murphy USA is just a job, I'd like a career! The company has taught me a lot about working under pressure, especially when technical difficulties occur. Doing customer service jobs helps me to deal with people with respect even in tough situations. This company has made me strong!"
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Liked working the 9 full hours Monday through Thursday, and a half of a day on Friday. The people are nice, but management could be better."
good,The job itself was ok the people i worked with werent but theyre no longer there. The major thing i disliked was youre there alone at night in a tiny glass box with no way to protect yourself. Theres no emergency button or mace or anything also the bathroom held the inventory as well so on truck day if you had to use the bathroom you were out of luck. And putting away inventory by yourself while also helping customers and cleaning and stocking got a little hectic and at the end of the night when youre supposed to be off by 11 sometimes doing daily inventory of the cigs took hours especially when people cant get it through their heads that its closed.
good,"Worked as a temp for 2 years - enjoyed working at Murphy and liked management and co-workers. However, HR would not consider me for full time employment."
good,"Pay is low, but my manager is enjoyable. Some assistant managers are underqualified. Breaks are unlikely. Thirty minute lunch breaks are deducted from shift pay, but are not available to be taken. You may eat on the job, but are not given an actual lunch break, despite having your pay deducted as if you were taking one anyway."
good,"I enjoyed working there, my co-workers were great, the principals of the company are the same as I believe, and the customers were wonderful.  My major complaint is that the balance between work and family is very off balance.  I understand working hard, but there needs to be a better balance and support of that from the management."
good,cashier job was good lots to do and no stop customers.needs better upper management they like to tell you one thing and go behind your back and do other
good,"A typical day at Murphy's usually included a lot of cash handling, providing excellent customer service, stocking and cleaning of the facility. While working there I learned that patience is key. Various and sometimes very overwhelming circumstances arose and being the only person there in the kiosk and having no one else to turn to in your time of need was a bit challenging, at times, but if you learned to have great patience and the will to see out any problem, then that only made you a better and smarter worker. Management for us, at the time when I first was hired was awesome! My co-workers were some of the best people I had a chance to work with. They made work fun and taught me many new things, when it came to the cashier position. I caught on very fast which in return allowed me to start running the store, on my own, in little time. The hardest part of my job would have had to been having to watch 16 pumps, that at the time allowed you to pump, before you payed. On a busy day, such as a Friday night made it quite easy for thieves to perform drive-offs. Not a fun situation to handle, whatsoever. On a better note the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the people! The time I worked there allowed me to meet all types of people, which some became regulars and some of the regulars became my friends!"
good,"my typical day at work was getting on the register doing transactions  and cleaning i ,learned how to use different tools on the register and how to deal with customers on a regular basis.I really did not like the management did to much like the attitude she had and very unorganized my coworkers were great we got along just fine. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that cursed you out daily the most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,A lot of opportunity to help the company grow in the fuel retail world to be a leader in their industry. Company is currently at 1268 locations and growing at 60-90 sites per year.
good,"A typical day at work is highly stressful. They cannot keep upper management and it is constantly changing. Management has no compassion in any situation and does not like to deal with any issues they feel are beneath them. The chance for advancement in this company is slim to none unless you are willing to relocate down south, and even then it is highly unlikely."
good,paid the bills got me home every night...good group to work for
good,The customers really cared about me and I care for them. The customers were always pleasant. The customers made me want to be at work when I was there. And the customers made it fun environment.
good,"The manager made it clear when I asked if I worked there long enough if there was a chance of moving up "
good,"It's your typical 9am-5pm job, therefore there's not too much to mention. You can however move up within the company fast with hard work and dedication."
good,"Not a good work/life balance.  You have to be available 24/7 365.  Hard to make plans.  Customers are awful, very rude.  Working with very limited labor.  Too much to do with very little help/resources from upper management"
good,There was nothing wrong with working there. Unless you are a female. I was working for the place for a year and I got skipped to be Store Manger with the other Asst. Manager that was there only for a couple of months.
good,company as a whole cares more about its sales and promotions than their employees. employees are expendable and customers are not.
good,i was the assistant manager the new manager took over but didnt want to work i had to do all of the gas surveys and always fill in then basically got called lazy and her daughter that didnt even work for the company started calling me lazy on social media website. if it wasn't for that management would have been a 4 instead of a 1
good,"Was a good place to work while it was growing."
good,The best thing of my job was my boss.She would let us know when we did good.I got along with everyone.Go in open store and turn pumps on count the money for the bank.
good,"I would stay in a little area and stock and wait on people through  a little hole,i had to go out a wipe pumps and signs off and clean bathroom, the hardest part is when the system shuts down and you have a line full of people and that happened alot"
good,Not many employees would stay very long so the days became very long and when we lost our manager it was a lot more difficult because it took four months to get a new one in.
good,"Iworked for murphy for 6 months, my store did not have to be open the extended hours the company or dm wanted. Had a high rate of drive offs because our parking lot was not secure enough. Also we were in an area with indian smoke shops,in a small town we could not compete with carton prices."
good,I learned that being in customer service industry you can't please everybody.
good,"Pays good, but is about like the government - a big bureaucracy. If you are a new employee, basically you have absolutely no chance of advancement or getting a leg up on anything, You will always be at the bottom, regardless."
good,You can move p in th compnay and you can also get a lot of hours and promotion. They are very strict and monitor you very very closeyly so make sure you are following th rukes
good,"Murphy Oil Corp was an overall fair experience. Long hours, harsh and dangerous environment. Important job because I believe the oil and gas industry keeps America on its feet."
good,It was a corporate company that was profit motivated instead of showing more benefits to employees. Expected to work 50 hours and not rewarded for working additional
good,"fast paced gas station, you eat and take breaks in a kiosk, not in the best neighborhood. constant manager changes. i was there for almost 2 years and went through 4 store managers."
good,It was a okay job.. I worked for a few months but had to move so I didn't stay long but as I was there everything was good due to my hard work.. I enjoyed it as much as I could..
good,"This job is super easy, watch out though and make sure to card EVERYONE. They always want you to upsale things like candy on the counter and promo deals for gas. Keep an eye on people outside as well to make sure you don't get a drive-off. If you do get one, you have to review the camera and fill out a drive-off report."
good,"Miscommunication from Executives to front line management,  I've never seen a company so poorly managed with no sense of direction.  THe company wastes money, and then when there is a downturn lays of its valued employees, where if they were more strategic, and managed their money better could retain much of the valued staff."
good,"Started off great. Got a raise every month and advanced to asst manager in 6 months. Now its like a rut. No more raises, no good cashiers so you wind up doing all the work. Messy environment where no one wants to take orders or do their part and new division manager who cares nothing about his employees. You will never get 40 hours although you were promised before you start. Only person who gets it is store manager. Most customers are rude but you do get some that make your day."
good,"Go to safety meetings go to our area. I've learned how to use tools. Management was great. Co-workers was good people to work with."
good,Growing company with the typical growing pains of a Fortune 500 company. Enjoyed the day to day interaction with all the store managers and developing them to their potential. Company that did not rule by intimidation but by teaching and training. Would like to have had more time to spend at each site within the monthly requirements. I really enjoyed seeing the rewards and accomplishments of my associates moving up in the company.
good,I am responsible of creating the weekly work schedule waiting on customers stocking shelves creating store order and other misc duties
good,Loved the type work I did but new sites were opened no new employees were added and it was tough and almost impossible to complete my job duties correctly in the time allotted.
good,I was asked to assume temporary management of store during a time the store manager was on medical leave. The hardest part of  this time was the challenge of dealing with other managers. This occurred before I had completed my first 90 days of employment. It was demanding but rose to the challenge even though I did not have all the tools I needed at the time. I enjoyed most of my coworkers but its a transient type of work force. I would still be there but family obligations caused me to relocate.
good,"This job taught me responsibility. As it was one of my first jobs after I graduated high school."
good,"Very easy going and flexible hours. No breaks, but you have down time when it's not busy. Rapid growth, creating excellent advancement opportunity. Quality of life, transparency from top down. Principles and Core competencies create a phenomenal culture. Upper management truly cares about all team members. You can pick up the phone and call any of them and they will give you their time."
good,"I had a hard time to get my roles and responsibilities from my manager. nothing was ever written in stone, the work schedule was always changed. this manager was a mirco manager . you could never do thing right for him. we parted ways and I am happier"
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot. It was fast paced, time went by pretty fast, and the employees were nice. I loved the nice customers and it was always nice giving a helping hand to everyone."
good,"Normally a work day consist of interacting with customers and helping them with anything that I could. I improved on my customer service skills while working at Murphy USA. Management and co workers were fine for the most part. Hardest part of the job was it wasn't much to do, and the best part about the job was the friendly people."
good,I was a cashier at murphy oil corporation my enjoyable days are when the manager tell us upsell and winer will get a reword from the corporation and 2012 our store come second for the holl USA  but again to dell with customer is very hard
good,"Greet customers as they enter the store"
good,"a lot of stress "
good,You meet lots of new people everyday. Managment was wonderful.
good,"managers are not properly trained, no one is properly trained for that matter. high turn over. they are only worried about their money and not their employees."
good,"A typical day at work with Murphy Oil, would being with a shift change, stocking products and would continue throughout the day; assisting customers with purchases and any inquiries they may have had. Maintaining a clean and organized working environment. At the end of the day, the drawer would have to be balanced, inventory on  all tobacco products."
good,It was not really like work there. I loved the customers as well as the people I worked with. Sometimes were rough but it was only when we were super busy. I really enjoyed that job
good,I've done a lot of jobs while working within the Sparks regional medical hospital dietary staff and i must say they were all pleasant
good,"Wait on customers, stock merchandise, clean bathrooms and gas pumps. I got along with all of my co-workers.  My manager was awesome. I learned to be a lot more patient with others.  I was going through a lot when I worked here.  My late husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He passed away in April of 2011."
good,"I loved the job, but the pay was low for the amount of work, and the lower level employees were given little incentive to stay."
good,Usually a day consisted of cleaning and stocking. Lottery players usually are the only customers. Rude managers and ok co workers.
good,"Murphy requires a lot, a lot of patience. The pay is excellent but it is a  very stressful work environment."
good,"Company offers incentives (contests) to make up for lousy wages, lousy hours, no benefits and no breaks. Work required is sometimes manageable if you can manage your time wisely in between customers. My team is on point, we get along great work well together. Management takes into consideration our sociable activities outside of work. And accommodates as fair as possible."
good,"I Enjoyed the fast pace, but I did not like the fact I had to work by myself at night and did not get breaks or lunch for the duration of my work hours."
good,"The company as a whole is very customer orientated,however I would not suggest that they are very worker friendly."
good,"Challenging fast pace work environment, overall great company"
good,"I really enjoy working for Murphy, the only downfall about my job is having customers become upset when I ID them."
good,didnt like like upper mng and they didnt know how to run the company
good,"counted deposit stocked coolers, made schedule, and sent out payroll."
good,This place was very busy you didn't have much time to think or get some of your work done. I did bank deposits paperwork cleaned the pumps and ran the register.
good,the manager within the store are great but corporate is horrible.
good,"worked in the downstream retail side, not a good as chevron but it's in retail, a lot of turnover"
good,But the management requires a lot from the workers and does not seem to view their store managers/assistants as more than glorified cashiers. The woman who was manager when I worked for a Murphy had been with the company for almost 12 years and her knowledge of the company granted her nothing more than a headache. The higher-ups held her responsible for cashier/assistant blunders rather than on those who actually messed up - which I can understand to a point but when you see it from the inside it goes beyond a manager being responsible for the store. When I got promoted to assistant I found the pay to be considerably better and could better fit the challenges expected of me.
good,"sumbit financial reports in a timely manner. Communicating effectively with retail store managers and district managers on a daily basis. learned how to meet monthly deadlines,"
good,"They passed me over for a promotion becausse of where i lived.  they did not give people who make mistakes a second chance, they do no appreciate hard workers."
good,"Unfortunately my time with Murphy took place during a commodity downturn. Otherwise, I could have seen myself finishing my career there."
good,"I really loved my job at Murphy, but I was fired for making one mistake, and the Division Manager who heard about the incident and fired me right around the holidays, knew NOTHING about me or how I worked or anything. I could have been suspended without pay, but no he just said fire me and that was that. The ""big guys"" care NOTHING about their employees but my District manager was great and he was very understanding and does his job very well."
good,"Open. count money and inventory"
good,"do gas survey, get to store input competitors prices in comp., do inventory counts on tabbacco and store. open up the days sales and close out the day before sales. email all work to the home office, open store ,check all pumps and nozzles, inspect the lot, start the day selling gas and merchandise."
good,"At Murphy, you tend to grow into a family with all other employees which makes the job easy working together, helping, and looking after one another just amazing. At times you will step into some difficulties since you are in a wide open community, dealing with the possibilities of robbers. Safety is enforced and everyday is a day of being cautious."
good,"Management likes to use the fact that you need a job to coerce you into doing work that isn't your responsibility. Have no issue taking your job. Decent pay, benefits and co-workers."
good,"Worked for this company for a little over a year. Good pay, with milestone raises. I worked for a walk in version of the store. That being said we were kept constantly busy. I liked my coworkers and such but management was a nightmare. While I liked my manager, he was leaving constantly so we'd bounce between getting a substitute manager, to just our assistant managers, to having our normal manager again. It would generally happen when the normal manager hired someone new. There are no breaks, at least here in Texas. And they will try to get you on a twelve hour shift when you are short staffed."
good,A typical day at work was sometimes fun unless a customer came in and had a attitude . I learned how to always turn a customer bad day into a good day and how to talk to people better. Management was pretty good until corporate started changing the policy. Co-workers when we work a shift together it made time fly by and made the day fun. The hardest part of the job was closing cause you had to do a lot prior to the shift before you if they don't make time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the women that came in and got to flirt or get their number.
good,Expereince depends on your superiors. Could be great or horrible dependent on that fact.
good,"Typical day at Murphy USA was busy at the start of clocking in, at least on second shift.  Before shift change, I had to clean the lot of any debris.  Next I had to empty trash cans, wipe down the dispensers, and clean the restroom.  Also I had to make sure that the coolers were stocked with merchandise.  All of this had to be done in a short amount of time (typically less than 30 minutes)."
good,"But I'm sure the manager wished the company wasn't about 15 hours a week at $8 an hour -driving away good people that would have stayed with the company long term otherwise."
good,"I liked my time at Murphy. Overall the people were very good to work with and for. Very typical of a US owned company, though, with the strings being pulled from the US. The US doesn't necessarily really understand Operations in Canada and it shows with some of the decisions being made. Fairly political place to work so you had to be somewhat careful but not as bad as some places I've been. Overall not too bad which is why I would give it an average rating."
good,"Murphy oil offers good pay to district managers and above. Unfortunately general managers, assistant managers, and crew members get the short end of the stick. The company is set up to make very gas station self sufficient. I work in a small building with two other female managers and we were required to fix/change/replace doors, locking systems, fuel filters, fuel hoses, signage, the pumps themselves and it made for very little time to take care of customers sales and day to day duties. I loved being a large part of the community though, you learn everyones name in the general area that frequents the store and its very tight knit, almost mom and pop- ish. I wouldnt work their again, but it offered good experience."
good,"Get to work and count the entire store, open the safe and count the cash and lottery do the deposit enter all this information into computer, wait on customers, clean whenever their wasn't anyone in the store from cleaning the pumps to cleaning the bathroom, stocking the shelves and getting the cash drawer ready for the next shift, checking in inventory, pricing it and putting it away. The girls I worked with were great people. The hardest part of the job was when the station closed. The customers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I was in management for Murphy Oil working an average of 70 hours per week. The pay is extremely competitive, but for the amount of hours worked, it makes it not worth it. If you are a person with a family, you will never see them, and in the rare occurrence you are home, you will be constantly answering phone calls. The turnover rate is also very high, which puts a struggle on the employees that are still working. I will say, the opportunity for advancement was very good, and the higher ups are very friendly and very hands on."
good,Great customers and management. Very flexible shifts and good hours for a second job. Great pay and always receive raises
good,"My day starting out doing inventory and getting store ready for customers, daily paperwork, selling products to customer.   Learned how to multi task many different tasks.    I hired and trained my staff; I had one staff member that had been with me for years.   The hardest part of this job was turnover.   I loved spoiling my regular customers."
good,I learned a lot about the Oil & Gas Industry and what to expect from management.
good,The job paid well and offered good benefits but the corporate office didn't mind throwing management under the bus. The would also find a reason to fire people in order to bring in others at a lower rate of pay
good,Grew and developed overtime with work. Easy environment to work in. Customers were super friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Recruited, hired, trained, and developed employees."
good,"good benefits, great team to work with pay is balanced from what I've seen from competitors. Don't like the environment of customer on site"
good,Typically a very busy work environment and you most generally worked alone.  Advancement was very easy here and this company constantly praised their employees.
good,"While the money was great, I felt there were issues within the company that needed to be addressed before the company could be all that it had potential to be, especially at the location where I worked."
good,"You work a shift alone, so therefore, you run the store by yourself with no lunch break. You will gain a great relationship with customers, and co-workers. I learned many different skills, such as, money handling, routine maintenance, customer service and much more. The hardest part of the job is keeping customers happy, along with completing all neccessary work. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and forming long lasting relationships."
good,"they work with your schedule, the managers are friendly. working there for a year some could possible earn the managers position."
good,"I enjoy working for this organization! I have gained a lot of experience in sales, management, and customer service. I have been with the company for almost two years."
good,"great advancement opportunities"
good,"LOVED working here and had a great staff and alot of wonderful customers , easy and fun job and a wonderful company, sadly the downsized and closed our store."
good,Working at Murphy was a wonderful experience. It taught me how to work at a quick pace along with how to manage time and taught me new communication skills although there were times that were stressful.
good,One woman who has been there for 7+ years knows the rules and still wont follow them. She has been wrote up more times then one and they wont fire her due to her seniority.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and co-workers were nice to work with once you got to know each other. As far as management, I really feel that I was looked over for advancement more than a few times."
good,Went from 40 hours a week down to 15. Cant support a family on that.
good,"Nothing good or bad to say just an ok place to work......"
good,"stocked coolers,  cleaned parking lot, cleaned bathroom, got rid of spilled gas, checked pumpes, checked in product, inventory of product, cashed people out"
good,It was almost always busy. I learned to work in a very small space it was a small cubicle that we worked out of a window also.The managemnet was very dishonest she would allow her other workers to come in late and do what they wanted. The hardest part of my job was in the cold we had to fill the coolers at the end of our shift and man it was awful.
good,I loved my customers & the people I worked with.
good,"Depending on what you want out of the job and the company, it was a decent place to start working until I could do better. I would recommend it to start out and it may be a good fit for you, if you like that kind of work. It can be fast pace and the customers can be grouchy because they have to stand outside, but all you can do is your best and of course every customer is not grouchy of course."
good,"I totally liked my job but I could not get more than 7 Hrs due to the Affordable Healthcare Act, so I had to find another job that would work me over 30 Hrs."
good,"as a manager my typical day consisted of assisting customers, answering customer complaints, balancing accounts, banking, inventory control, scheduling shifts, supervising and cleaning store exterior/interior. "
good,"very nice work place but no body inforceses the rules and duties, manager very nice and the girls try and get over, that i dont like."
good,"A typical day if there is one I come in exchange info from previous shift, Check to see if anything needs stocked after my counts are done while attending customers and there needs.As the day progresses I work at maintaining the lot and store changing paper at pumps trash cans change and stocking coolers, Some days we have added tasks to perform such as changing signs and putting up banners ect. At the end of my shift its as if I am starting over with the counts of products and monies."
good,Its OK if you can stand in a cubicle all day serving customers gas . I Actually Met Alotta People While Working There . and it taught me a lot about customer service
good,"You have a lot to do and very little time in between customers to do your duties besides customer service. Basically you work your shift by yourself, except an hour at the beginning of your shift and at the end of your shift."
good,Management at my last location needed to learn how to treat the employees. There was no team work at all. Need better benefits for the amount of work they expect from employees.
good,"Murphy Oil has a history of great jobs and work atmosphere. But in the last few years it has declined. Benefits and extras were cut short or out because of the decline in Oil prices, which is understandable. I had tried to promote within the company twice, but had a supervisor that would not agree to it.  By the time Murphy Oil had their first lay off (which I unfortunately was a part of) it was very hard to be excited about going to work. And I loved the people I worked with, but the cut backs and the taking away of incentives made it hard to be excited about working there. "
good,I enjoy my time at work because it is fast pace and I get to meet new people and see alot of my retuning customers atleast 2 times a day.
good,Opening the store extremely early in the mornings requires someone to get up at 3 in the morning in order to do fuel survey and open on time. Just because you clocked out doesn't mean your day is over. You are required to do fuel survey until 6 pm at night. This is a job that you don't do for the money but for the customers that you love.
good,"it wa sok for just a something to do job, isnt really a career move."
good,"I liked working at Murphy, i wasn't there long and advanced to Assistant Manager, great job! until the company hired new management, the new management got rid of everyone and hired all new employees, that was VERY unfair!!!!"
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people, and no day was ever the same.The customers were nice."
good,Murphy Oil is a good and friendly place to work they just put the wrong people in management positions.
good,"A place you would never get bored because its always busy, a great fast paced environment."
good,"Manager is great! She is considerate and understanding. Pay isnt that great, but good company to work for. Benefits are decent as far as insurance goes."
good,customers make the job fun and tolerable. management can make things difficult especially with advancement. managers should follow same rules they implement
good,Paid good for working a lot of hours and putting in a lot of work. Great benefits and for the most part good upper management.
good,I ran 14 stores in three states and got to learn the gas industry.  Not as different as you may think from the restaurant industry.
good,"Murphy's was a great place to work, it kept you on your toes as you always had something to do. It was extremely fast pace with the amount of customer base they had. Plenty of room for ooportunity"
good,"I would say that I kind of liked the job. I worked 7-10 hour days, 5-6 days a week, and had plenty of overtime. the customers were good, the workers were good, but the time was slow"
good,"A typical day at work includes providing customer service to a diverse community work base."
good,Running cash register and making sure all duties were done by the end of your shift.
good,I have been with Murphy oil for four years. I enjoy my job especially the customers they make it enjoyable. Just looking for more opportunities in my life
good,"I went from cashier to an assistant manager in just 4 months. I had to learn a lot in a very little amount of time, but it was doable. The huge setback for me was the fact that the store was open 24 hours a day, that meant that if there was a problem overnight, or if 3rd shift was late or a no-call/no-show, I had to come in the middle of the night and take over. Even if that meant I had a double shift coming up at 5am. I felt left behind a lot. Other than that, Murphy's a good and fair workplace."
good,Constantly cleaning and stocking. To watch pumps at all times is the best part yet stressful. Friendly customers made it worth staying at odd hours each day
good,"As GM Finance for the Eastern Hemisphere, it was a pleasure to work with many different people in a variety of cultures. Overall, good people, challenging work."
good,it was great creating relationships with customers  however management didn't have it together and it is all about favorites and if you aren't will to agree with district manager you will be reprmended
good,"Working for Murphy's in the Summers were a great opportunity for me to learn many things. A work day there was some what complex you have to be a go getting person. Leave the emotions at home.  Learned how to work the lottery machine, learned about the product also how to be more ethical.  At the time my manager where a nice lady and always fair with all of us. The most hardest part was people driving off with the gas."
good,"It gave me experience with management skills, also boost my customer skill, I enjoyed managing and being over the store when the store managers wasnt working i took charge."
good,"Murphy USA is a wonderful company and is located in El Dorado, AR.  The town and company are both wonderful and I have no issues with recommending either place to anyone."
good,"Interesting place to work"
good,"The job is great just wish they would built more in Memphis,tn ."
good,"Good place to work.  Experienced operations team, however early retirements (mid to late 2015) have/will knock out 100's of years of senior experience in the US, West Africa and Malaysia.  It will be interesting to see if the next generation can grow the company production, cashflow and reserves as much as the team accomplished during the past 8-10 years."
good,very productive work place. i love helping customs. I learned new things as far as working registers and all. my coworkers were all around my age range and we got along perfectly fine. The hardest part of the job at first was learning all that came with it. But I know I can do anything I put my mind too.
good,Definitely need to be able to multitask while working their. Was a very fun but overwhelming job site. I loved working with the employers and giving wonderful customer service and working with the customers.
good,"I began working at Murphy USA as a cashier, but within six months, I was promoted to assistant manager. I enjoyed to job, as I am a people person, and it was different everyday.  I learned how to manage for profit for the company and how to order inventory by reading report sheets of how much was sold previously.  After a time, I took over as temporary store manager of two different stores while new managers were being trained for the position.  It was a very good learning experience, because the stores were not doing so well at the time.  One of the stores in particular was back into the profit margins they should have been in within a month after I took over."
good,you learn how to handle your employees and your customers and the different situations that arise. Everyday is different. The hardest part is keeping up with the gas pumps and making sure people doesn't drive off because it can get very intense at times. But the best part was getting to know the customers and knowing what they wanted.
good,"cashier, ran register daily, stocked as well, learned money management, had great co workers, management not good."
good,There was never a dull moment working here.  It was always busy and there was always different types of customer to interact with.  I did enjoy the management that I work with.
good,"Well put together comnpany. Great people, and a motivated crew."
good,I would recommend to anyone looking for a good paying job with decent hours especially to college students.
good,very fast pace and challenging. Very good at recognizing accomplishments.
good,"It was okay, I associated with customers and handled the cash register."
good,Work is steady; good corporate citizen; nice offices and work space.
good,Enjoyed meeting new people. My co-workers was the best. There was nothing hard about this job.
good,The enviroment was very busy which made the day go by very quickly and the interaction with the customers and co-workers was very enjoyable for me.
good,"Started out as a cashier closing the store. Got promoted to assistant manager after one year of employment and learned what it took to run the store. It then took 6 years in the assistant manager position to get promoted to store manager. After being promoted to store manager, work/life balance went south. All I did was work constantly, leaving virtually no time for myself and my daughter. District manager is a great guy, and he was a pleasure to work for. The hardest part of the job was working 65-80 hrs a week for 3 months straight with only 3 days off the entire time. Most enjoyable part was meeting all the friendly regular customers and making their day by having their orders ready for them when they got to the counter."
good,"A typical day at Murphy USA involved managerial duties including: opening tasks, inventory, reading fuel pumps, and scheduling. I learned how to effectively run a schedule for multiple employees, and how to keep track of inventory in an organized fashion. Management was not hands on, and i have never met them but i could call if i had a question. The hardest part of my job was trying to explain to customers i had no control over the rising price of gas. The most enjoyable part of my job was my wonderful staff, we were a tight knit group."
good,Everyday was a fast and productive day. The manager was one of the best managers I ever had. My co-workers were very understanding and nice. The hardest part of the job was closing. The best part of the job was meeting new people.
good,I don't find this company employee friendly. Not enough budget hours are provided during a typical week to cover all shifts. Company is not willing to fix equipment problems within the stores. Many stores are out dated.
good,when schedule was printed out you seeen which department you where assign to. daily tasks running register and assisting customers with purchases and location of items.
good,"Many friendly customers, got along well with all other employees, got duties done when needed, impressed district manager."
good,"I was an assistant manager with Murphy oil, from part time cashier, and then stepped back down to cashier in neighboring town. I enjoyed my job and position very much, however, i was overworked and underpaid toward the end. This was at no fault of the company itself because i had covered shifts in out of town locations multiple times and the experience was much better. District management seemed to be overall helpful and concerned with each location beneath them but there's only so much that can be expected when you don't have access to each location daily. My locations were Cornelia and Toccoa, GA. I've worked in Alpharetta, and 2 locations in SC and the experience was very different."
good,"I was in line for assistant manager but my hours where cut to 15 hours a week."
good,"A typical day at work involved opening the store and counting inventory. In the midst of doing all my counting, I handled customers at the window. Once the second employee arrived at work I was then able to count the money in the safe and safely transport it to the bank for deposit. I would then return to work to finish paperwork and make sure all the numbers added up and if they didnt I had to figure out why. I would normally get that down around 1pm. Once completed I was able to then take my time to improve our store. This involved cleaning, painting, and minor repairs. Sometimes my day involved minor maintenance to the pumps. The only thing I didnt do was the schedule for the employees."
good,"Its a great place to work, as far as the atmosphere. A more challenging experience to advance your customer service skills. Cleanliness, very organized, and a great managment staff."
good,"I was Asst Manager. Some days I would open the business, but everyday I was involved in promoting sales, placing orders with sales reps, inventory audits, cash handling, daily reports to home office."
good,"I worked as a gas station cashier. I would stock coolers, cigarette cases, sell gas, etc. I usually worked alone because it was a one person job shifts. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and helping them with what I could. The hardest part of the job was having to work until 12a.m. alone."
good,cashier so you wait on customers faced paced but easy for energetic person that loves people. My Co-workers were exceptional. Going to work was enjoyable the customers you get to know them after a while coming into to the store
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, clocking in, counting inventory, and getting to work. You would have several or no drive offs a day."
good,"-10 hrs a day, made up of cleaning, paperwork, stocking  and cashier "
good,Co-workers were fun with lots of energy.  The hardest part about the job was high turnover on employees which resulted in numerous training sessions.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to drive to multiple locations and provide support to my team. I would further develop them and discover ways to improve business. To be honest there really is not a typical day being a Murphy USA District manager. I have learned a lot during my time with Murphy. I have gained experience in every aspect of the business world. Being a District manager I had to know about Human Resources, Local Laws, how to be a successful leader, Sales, Accounting, and Management. At Murphy we always had a team atmosphere and I can call anyone in the company, and they would be willing to help regardless if it is their responsibility or not. The most difficult part about the job was that you never knew when something would go wrong and you would have to drop everything and attend to the matter. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility and the challenges provided. No two days are identical being a District Manager."
good,I have enjoyed my time with Murphy USA. I love a fast paced working environment.
good,"I enjoyed my job until the management changed. Overall, it is very flexible, has a nice pay and is easy.The register is easy to work and the duties of the job are very easy to complete within the eight hours or so you're scheduled. The customers in my area were friendly and made my day and job even more easier. Those who attend college, if you work at this job for a year or more, they reimburse you for school ."
good,They expect you to work with all crafts. they preach safety but it's always production first. they are slow to promote and do not give praise when deserved. the guys you work with is the only reason I stayed as long as I did. it is hard to stay at work for 14 days but it is nice to have 14 days off.
good,"Worked with over 5000 vendor invoices. "
good,"I had a good experience at Murphy, I loved the people I worked with and the schedule was pretty flexible most of the time. And advancing to a point was very easy if you are willing to work for it. All in all I meet a lot of good people and got a lot of good experience for working at Murphy USA"
good,"people are great, friendly. great company they just cant give but part time hrs, I need full time"
good,I have to serve customers on a professional and timely manner. I check and make sure that equipment is working properly. I audit inventory on a weekly basis and keep track of coupons and money. I make sure that our store is a clean and friendly environment.
good,"maintained daily paper work, managed employees, serviced fuel pumps when needed, constant customer interaction"
good,"I enjoy all of the new people that I get to meet and interact with. I have my regulars that can bring a smile to my face. However, you do not get lunch breaks so you have to make time while working. The pay is pretty low in the beginning, but I believe they want to make sure you are dedicated to staying before they pay you more. As for management there are good ones and there are bad ones like any job."
good,Great place to begin a career and to save money for school. Flexible schedules and great management.
good,It was very fast moving but very enjoyable. The other people are laid back and willing to teach you the ropes and what you are suppose to do while you are there employed for them.
good,I was a fill in while the regular employee was on maternity leave.  the company was very open and everyone was very helpful.  I would work there again.
good,"Experience with repeat customers was great, managers tending to subordinates needs, exhibiting responsibility of tobacco sales but lack of breaks were only negative side."
good,I love the rapport that I have built with my customers and familiarity that I have based upon my customers as indiviuals. Work days as in any job can be hectic but to see a happy customer return due to your pleasant attitude and willingness to serve and exceed expectations. I truly enjoy my job but have much desire to move up in the company.
good,"Professional work place and learned a lot from my supervisor. Balance job vs. personal, respect each other, and enjoy working with diverse ethnicities."
good,"Learned a lot by attending several Microsoft classes."
good,Typical day at work is cashier.  Learned how to count money. Management poor. Co workers horrible. Nothing was hard about the job. Nothing was enjoyable.
good,"Murphy's is my first job and I'm glad it is, it's been a great work and life experience. It's fast pasted and there is no time for free time. It's taught me to speak up, how to communicate effectively, how to stay organized, manage my time, and now to multi-task effectively. Management is very supportive and positive. The hardest part of the job is how fast paced it can be especially on the weekends! But that's also the most enjoyable part, being able to greet people, get them what they need, and wishing them a great day!"
good,"no breaks, no lunch breaks, basically only one there most of the time, straight 10+ hr shifts gets exhausting after awhile, customers are great, great people to work with."
good,"Typical day in my department consists of many ad hoc management requests and long hours."
good,Murphy Usa offers benefits to all employees full or part tim. Holiday pay as well. Flexible schedules for students. Training programs in place. Advancement possible. Bonus incentives. Murphys runs contest where every employee is able to win.
good,"worked there for 7 years , enjoyed working with my co workers, and also with my customers,"
good,"Very small stores, and fun. a lot of traffic and a lot of things to keep your eyes on."
good,"I worked with a strong staff down to earth with the best hands on training. At first I felt I was thrown to the wolves but I enventually learned so much on my own, that i had respect for the trainers. "
good,i loved all my co-workers and mangers but it was a stressful job at times. gas drive offs and cigs counts
good,"Very busy work place. Customers coming regularly buying gas, drinks, cigerrets and etc."
good,I enjoyed My job at Murphy.. i really enjoy working with the public and meeting new people..I learned a lot in the managing out take of the company.
good,"Good company to work for the management team in  the Tupelo ms store is very bad. we as employee have not been train well. plus the store manger has way way to many personal problems and bring them to work. she only hire her lazy friends, she talk about other employee be hide there back and stir up trouble with other employee. tell personal store business to everyone. I almost hate to go to work when she there."
good,"There is no typical day at work, you never know who is going to come to your store."
good,I worked from 2pm to 10 pm on a busy area off the interstate and I was only one person taking in thousands of dollars in just a few hours. Loved the job and the people but the safety of myself was questionable in the area I was working.
good,"I loved working at Murphy's, my co-workers were great. We all got along which in a small establishment is essential. The only thing I can really complain about is the manager that took over when my hiring manager left. She claimed to have the knowledge necessary to do her job but when it came down to it she knew nothing about running a gas station and refused to listen to those of us that knew what we were doing."
good,"A typical day at work involved 5 or 7 hour shift. If you worked the evening or latenight shift, you were the only employee on site and work could be very hectic. You did not get any breaks and you were not allowed to take a lunch due to being the only employee on site. You did not get bathroom breaks because there is nobody else on site to relieve you of the register and you are not allowed to leave the register unattended when busy. Due to the fairly reasonable prices the store is always busy, so if something goes wrong and you have to stop and fix something, you have to put the store on pause and fix whatever is broken. This would lead to a huge pile up of cars at the pumps and unhappy people waiting in line. Nobody likes having unhappy customers. Despite all of the minor problems that came with being the only person on site, it was a fairly decent job. I enjoyed the work and I enjoyed working for the company."
good,My manager was awesome and would cover your butt at all times! She tried to help out and understand any personal reasons you needed to be off or call in or anything like that. Everyone there was like a big family. The pay was not that great once you got your mandatory raises you didnt get another one after that. The hardest part of the job is stocking the sodas it sucks and drive offs!! most enjoyable part is the customers and being in the air conditioning!
good,The management was very helpful in getting me acclamated with the position to where I had very few questions.
good,"I have been with Murphy Oil for 5 years. I enjoy being around my co-workers, managers, and my customers. We make it fun and also get a lot of tasks accomplished in our work day."
good,I would work sunday thru friday with saturday off from 5am til 3pm. Not much room for advancement. Staff was great to work with.
good,"Staff was friendly and inviting.  Everybody was always happy to help.  Can be a sweatshop at times, but there was always something to do.  Will do a lot of work"
good,I enjoyed the Job and the lovely people I had the privilege to work with. You have to be able to time manage well and work fast. They mean it when they say they are an equal opportunity employer and will hire you if you agree to the Job qualifications no matter what. If you have a disability that holds you back I would not recommend this.
good,"Management was great they showed me how to do inventory and payroll. I also learned how to count deposits and do schedules. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who steal gas and merchandise. The best part of the job was being able to manage employees. A typical day was a learning one, I must say no day was the same."
good,I liked it. much room for advancement. the employees were always wonderful and the customers were always a joy to see and work with.
good,"Murphy USA, was the best paying job I had ever had. The pay for all employees was better than most jobs around. It was the most fun of a company that I had ever work, interacting with the customers was very rewarding in my vue of things."
good,"I enjoyed working at Murphy and particularly my international assignments which included Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Namibia."
good,"I show up to close down the store for the night. I learned the procedure for closing and what to be aware of in the oil companies because it dictates the prices. My co-workers are fun, but some are lazy, which makes it hard. For example we get our truck and if I'm not there working a mid shift the cigarettes won't get put up, and that takes away from me doing my other duties during my shift. The most enjoyable part is when the team meets sales goals."
good,The Murphy I work at is a good place to work. They always try to accommodate my schedule and I work with good people. I hate to leave but need something with set hours.
good,"can be fast passed "
good,"I am not sure about any other experience, but I love working at Murphy USA! You meet new people. I was able to make my own schedule. My manager is very communicative and understanding. The customers are regulars! I love it!"
good,I loved working here because I like the services that are provided to the community.
good,I'm sorry this was a contract position.  The gentlemen I worked for was a very nice boss!
good,"During a typical work day I was to Manage all employees, weekly schedule, daily paperwork, daily deposits, make sure the store is set per ""plan-o-grams"", weekly inventory, investigate shortages, customer service."
good,"It is a really good job, but i woul love to find something that would be better to spend time with my family"
good,Working for Murphy was very different. Everything you had to do on your own and nobody there to help you. Working here i moved up to become an assisant manager which helped me for my future.
good,My day goes well (good are bad) as I service the customers with a big beautiful smile.
good,Company that is growing fast and will be around for the forseeable future.  Its a nice place to work and the people are very nice.  Small town living is great.
good,"I am a consultant so I come to work everyday with so many programs on my plate right now."
good,Murphy's for the most part is a great company to work for for the most part. They work with your schedule to a certain extent but if you're going to school or have another job this is not the place for you. The employees and customers are great people for the most part and that helps the day go faster.
good,I was happy to go into to work everyday. I ran a small store with about 6 employees. We ranked nationally for upsale percentages. I had a secret weapon. We understood the savings deals and relayed them to every employee. We had a culture of helping each other. There was no task above none of us. We got the job done.  If I had to ever go back to retail management Murphy Oil would be my first stop.
good,It is a good job especially because my manager was always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that we where all comfortable with all aspects of work. I would definitely work for her again.
good,It's a great place to learn newer technologies and reporting tools!  Great place for business analysts to learn more about the company business practices.
good,Fun place to work. Flexible hours. Great CustomersOnlineSupport. Good communication. Work was clearly communicated. Good training program. Paid vacation and paid sick leave.
good,"It was as good as working at a gas station could be. Good management, competent employees. . .  Not a difficult job at all, but also not much room for advancement."
good,"A fun place with high integrity and respect to each other."
good,"Murphy can be a demanding job that isn't for everyone. I enjoyed this job. I've had many customer service jobs. It can be a physically demanding job but not in an unreasonable way. The customers are usually awesome and very loyal which helps more than you know. Yes you will have to change trash, fix printers, stock EVERYTHING, and deal with customers, which isn't always the easiest thing to do. Murphy is a good company with room for advancement. You earn what you work for. If you're a whiner or complainer and feel so entitled that you can't do simple tasks like changing trash or cleaning a bathroom then this job isn't for you."
good,"Great independence in your work activities."
good,District Manager for 1 year in New Orleans area.  Company wanted me to move to New Orleans even though I lived an hour away.  I was not willing to move due to wife's job and children in high school. Stepped down to store manager.
good,"Assisting customers with every need and product."
good,"Great Team environment, very interactive exploration team. Very independent with freedom to develop and put forward your ideas."
good,It was a real straight forward job. Come in and open a register and begin to work on your shift until your relief comes the next morning
good,"fun place to work, great supervisor.inconsistent hours. Great customers. Great employees, good working environment. Had most holidays off."
good,I really enjoyed this job because of the interaction of the people. I met people traveling from different areas of the globe that were site seeing or on a new adventure.
good,"the time i worked for murphy was very great people working for them , love the management . very easy work , would love to work for them again . great benefits."
good,Excellent benifts and paylllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
good,"You have to be fast paced to work at Murphy, fast on your feet, fast learner, great listener. As a head assistant store manager I would normally go in about 530am and work to 2 or 4 pm depending on the day. We do not get breaks so that is the main bad side so you have to eat and use the bathroom when you can. If you have the heart and mind for it you can go far with Murphy, although I have seen some people get passed over for no reason at all really. The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers you have to be nice and small and take care of their needs when you really want to tell them off and smack them. The management and co-workers are normally great, in fact other than a few that couldn't make it we all thought of each other as extended family. I love that we saw the same people every day and most of the customers become your friends. I worked for the company for almost 6 years and know nothing of the high up in the chain (corporate) other than what was rumored."
good,"A typical day at work was chaotic and very fast paced but I loved it. I learned how to become a great Assistant Manager from the best manager I have ever had. My manager was pretty tough because she had to be, the company set some pretty high goals for the overall stores to meet. I trained most of my co-workers and I seen a lot of them go because this job is not for everyone. The hardest part of this job was being cussed out by customers because our gas or cigarette  prices were too high. It was a constant battle because convenient stores for some reason are a lot of people's one stop shop for gas, cigarettes and unloading their anger. This is the place I grew up and realized just how different people are and no matter how bad it got it was very important to hold my head high and keep smiling. The most enjoyable part was the gratitude from my customers and management. It was very seldom that the good out weighed the bad but when it did it was a good day."
good,"Easy job, you just deal with a lot of different personalities. You have to learn to be quick and efficient if you aren't already. All in all, a fantastic company to work with."
good,I have enjoyed working here its fast pace and pays the bills.
good,"fast and friendly hands on experience. team player, interesting."
good,"Typical day i would open my cash register count the money and then attend to all the customers needs."
good,"Good benefits and nice company. If you dont like people or working alone its not the job for you, but other than that i enjoyed my time at this company a lot and would overall recommend it."
good,convenience store environment where customer service is fostered to give customers the best experience possible.
good,It was a great experience. I learned a lot of skills i will need later.
good,A typical day at my work place is very fast paced.
good,"I have two typical work days. The things that are consistant in both the days is that I run register, upsell, clean, stock. There is usually one person schedule to be there by themselves per shift with a hour overlap. I also have to fix any problems that arise. Example being pumps not working, pumps being out of paper, scanner not working, register not working, back office not working, while trying to keep customers happy getting them in and out. When I open I am also responsible for the days paperwork, deposit, change for safe, and daily audits. I am also responsible for checking in vendors and ordering on the days I work for which these fall on. I also get calls from co workers when they have a problem and don't know what to do. I have been under three different managers since working at Murphy's. They all have different systems of running the store. I have learned something new from each of them. Some have ways that makes keeping up with counts and paperwork easier. I like all of my co workers. I have had to do write ups on some of them, but they understand why and we get along well. the hardest part of the job is when I have to pull a double with no break. The second hardest part is when vital problems are occuring and I am on the phone with help desk trying to get problem fixed and simultainliously having to wait on a line of customers, with some of them upset because they can't get what they want right at that moment. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to work with my co workers.From my different managers I have learned better ways of communicating to people"
good,A good job with great benefits and incentives to employees.
good,Working at Murphy Oil USA was a very pleasant experience for me.
good,"A good company to work for.my co-worker,s were good team to work with, manger was great to work with.A typical day was greeting customers ,stocking,cleaning pumps,sweeping,moping, running cash register,locking store for the night,"
good,A typical day at Murphy's is very busy and productive. I have learned many things from using new technology with computers to knowing how to make orders and receiving them as well. The employees make work fun but we all know that the customers come first and there are things that need to be done. I haven't really found anything to be to hard that I couldn't handle or be able to relay on other employees to help out if I have any questions. The best part of this job would be working with the public.
good,"I enjoyed the work, flexibility and the opportunity to work with many different departments. The opportunities included Regulatory reporting projects and optimizing business processes at Murphy."
good,"Great place to work part-time, although there is little to no room for advancement. There are no discounts for employees, including merchandise. The management has always been great, as well as the co-workers. The only times you may become irritated is at some of the customers, but that comes with working with the public. There is a lot of work to be done, and can get pretty hectic if you're working by yourself."
good,"Good place to work for work and life balance. I enjoy the office location that is close to the restaurant, etc. easy to cool down from daily work activity. The team I work with are great and we are having fun working together. Having a team leader that act as helicopter parent is not so great."
good,"Working in Malaysia was a very good period of my life and I learned allot. The people were fantastic and I enjoyed my time there."
good,At an individual store there is a sense of community. It always seems like home office doesn't care if you have a problem. We are under going a lot of changes and upper management are leaving.
good,"I loved working a Murphy's USA the people I worked with always were happy and ready to work and all were really helpful when i first started. After working there a month there was a new store manager who loved her phone and facebook more than her job, but assistant managers were on their ""A"" game. the store got a new manager right before i left."
good,Its a pretty easy job. You usually work your shift alone and its almost never too busy so you'll find yourself with a lot of free time to work on other duties. The employees that work there are very nice and inviting and they also train you quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of working there though is not getting a lunch break but on the other hand you can always bring lunch to work because they do provide a microwave that you may use in between customers.
good,Murphy USA is a fast paced gas/convenience retail business.  The company is proven to drive sales through employee training and engagement.
good,"Starting off was a little rough, at first I was not able to balance both work and school.  Once under new management it was a great experience and enjoyed working there.  I most enjoyed the opening shifts because it was nonstop work, there was always something for me to do compared to other shifts since I normally had everything already done.  Hardest part of the job was finding out the types of people you encounter.  I encountered people who would lie, manipulate and go the extra mile do so.  From this job I learned how to deal with people and I have become more open than I was before the opportunity to work here."
good,"Very busy and fun. I learned a lot, ordering/checking in product, counting tills. I loved working with my coworkers lots of team work."
good,"Clock in held a motivation meeting everyday for 10 minutes. Advise crew what needed to be done. Once we met our production goal, we cleaned up and clocked out."
good,"Nothing really wrong with Murphy.  The oilfield is the oilfield, and it dries up from time to time.  The only reason I'm not there is because of the crash of 2016.  Lots of room to grow if you keep your head down and your butt up.  Just do what you're told, and everything is fine."
good,"great company to work for  "
good,A Typical day at work I mostly work with the field i help Manage Tickets i take calls and Help Store managers find Employees I help with the Hiring Process such as Paperwok and Drug screens and Background checks

good,Everyone was great and fun to work with. The hardest part about this job was learning how to maintain and fix the pumps.
good,great place to work at with good staff. easy work with nice pay. gives lots of chances to win other gifts and prizes with contest throughout the company
good,"have a great interaction with customers day to day. Learn many different things from fixing equipment to how to handle invoice deliveries.

Your co-workers become like family, help each other out with completing task and any other issues that my come about. there is nothing really hard about this job. the most enjoyable part about this job is being around great people."
good,"A typical day at Murphy will be interacting with customers and providing excellent customer service experience."
good,"Good work environment with job growth potential. We were given great management training and the annual training seminars were productive. Great opportunity to get to know the host company management on a regional and national level.  The sad part at the time Murphy pulled out of the U.S. and retracted back to Canada their country of origin. I was the first self Serve gasoline station in the state of Kentucky and after renovations, I was the first convenience style service station to market groceries and liquor sales. In fact I was the legal test case in Kentucky regarding the sale of Gasoline and beer at the same location. We (The Kentucky Gasoline Dealers Association and myself as Owner Operator of Convenience store with Gasoline operation. I was pitted in court against a powerful political family who had a major financial interest in the now defunct Convenient grocery store operations in Jefferson County and various counties throughout Kentucky."
good,"On a regular day at Murphy, I would open the station, count inventory, do paperwork, and cashier at the same time. I have great customer service skills and always keep a smile on my face. I learned something new everyday working in the retail business. I had excellent co-workers and taught them to work as a team. The best part of working at Murphy Oil was being able to work and still have a personal life also. There really was no hard part to being the manager, sometimes it could be overwhelming if something needed to be fixed or cleaned and you were the only person on duty."
good,"Loved working at Murphy USA up until my District Manager had a hard time with working with me when my husband was deployed.  For the last month I was there I was starting to work 80 hours a week and on salary that just wasn't cutting it.  I was having to bring my daughter in to work with me, which is a company no no.  The day I had to work from open to close and then be back at the store in 3 hours to reopen after already working 70 hours was the last straw.  My husband called from overseas and said to just quit.  I've been much happier since.  But I know there are wonderful District Mnagers that work for Murphy and you dont have to deal with that I did.  So if I had the chance to work there again.  I probably would."
good,A great job that pays very well. The owners are awesome and caring. Job advancement is there. The employees are energetic and happy. The customers are easy to get along with and always make you feel special afterword.
good,"Very good company to work for. The management is great in most stores. Some need improvement, I do enjoy the company for the most part. Just ready to advance in my life and my career."

good,"Great place to work"
good,"At Murphy USA they taught me the right way to perform all duties inside the store as well as outside. I learned up keep on pumps and even how to wash them. We did all duties by check list that each person had to do at set time while one person worked the front. We also learned how to do other task with out help working the cashier, proper timing is required. The management gave days off, as long as notice was put in and you called in before scheduled time to work. The people that worked left all issue not pertaining to work at the door, all other issue were discussed in private area. "
good,"start by 4am banking , store audit ,sidework duties, stpre order, dealing with vendor and Many Customers."
good,this is a blood sucking company ran by the she devil anti Christ. would be good if they terminate every higher up and promote good workers
good,Great place to work. They seemed to have a solution ready for every problem that could arise. The help line takes away a lot of stress from the position.
good,Management on store level is great. Corporate level needs to come down and work the floor more. Expectations are extremely high when it comes to extra tasks.
good,"Job was cool laid back, some times fast pace. i didn't like the fact that only one person close at night time with no security."
good,Nice place to work. Typical day at work was working hard on all issues. I thought myself the Murphy way with any help so be prepared to be learn on your own.
good,I enjoyed working for the company. They start you off with $8.00 per hour then you get a 0.25 cents raise if you be with them for 30 day then 120 day u get another raise so working for them was a good experience for me
good,"Good place to work. However, had problems with one of the other employees. Management was almost non-existent when it came to working out problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the regular customers that came to the store."

During the time I worked there, there was about a month to a month and a half where the assistant manager and I were the only ones working at the location in Storm Lake. I never really saw my co-workers but they were also good peoples. I don't know that there was really anything hard about my job with this company. I did get to meet lots of new people which I do enjoy."

My management and co-workers were incredibly nice, and extremely helpful. There wasn't really a hard part of the job but the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,Very unique and awesome place to work. The owner works beside you daily and is one of the kindest people i have ever met.
good,"Typical day at Murphy USA was running cash register, up selling items, stocking items, cleaning the restrooms and your work area. I learned that there are some great customers that come to Murphy USA and that it is a good job if you like to be alone. The hardest part was being alone and not knowing what to do when you are still being trained. The enjoyable part of the job was never running out of things to do so a normal work day by yourself would usually go pretty quick."
good,Every day was a busy day but I loved it...cause I love keeping busy..I learned a lot at this job management wise and personally..the manager was pretty nice and my co-workers were awesome...I would say the hardest part of this job was the customers every now and then you would have a bad one out the group...but If I had to do it all over again I would go back

good,the most enjoyable part of my job are my customers they always put a smile on my face and we know each other by name
good,Working here was wonderful. Customers were wonderful and patient.
good,Great place to work. But i want more... I dont feel safe. A bunch of crazies come into the store and i was told that i just have to deal with it. I witnessed my employee get physically attacked and when i asked what should we do in that situation i was told to smile and thank them and tell them to come back. I had a guy whom ive had a restraining order placed on come in and got written up for telling him to leave.

District Managers and Corporate Office allow individual manager to take ownership of their site and promote Murphy values, training, exceed customer expectations while meeting sales and financial goals.  Murphy expects much from their management staff but rewards them accordingly. A dependable and well trained staff certainly makes the job that much easier.  Seeking to understand before being understood, setting goals and having a advanced vision for what the business needs would are just a few things that I have been successful in mastering. Our customers have become our extended families as we see some of them numerous times throughout the day. I have enjoyed being a coach and a mentor and seeing those that I have hired mature and learn."
good,"I learned how to deal with many different types of customers I've had some good and bad days my manager was real cool and very understanding I didnt have problems with my co-workers they were very helpful when they we're there because, we always worked together as a team the hardest part of my job was working nights and trying to maintain getting everything done on my own in so little time with it being a gas station but the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with my customers I loved them dearly especially my regulars ."

I learned to be quick with counting, being nice is always the route to go. Being a manager isn't easy. My co-workers were always friendly, same as I. The job really wasn't hard.

good,It was always a new challenge fun and exciting for the most part. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning new things on a daily basis.
good,"Depends on what time of the day you work as to what a typical day is like. Mornings is alot of paper work and counting, days and evenings is stocking and cleaning. I loved working with a co-worker cause it made it easier to get everything done and still give customers good service. There wasn't anything hard about the job except you need to have a good sense of humor for some of the customers."
good,"On a typical day at work i service more than 1,000 customers stock the store and keep it up and running in good condition. I've learned a lot mostly how to multitask; it's a must working in that type of up beat environment. The management is great he/she tries to work with everyone's schedule they're always on top of things. I could go to them about anything. I hardly ever worked with any co-workers, but when i did they were always pleasant never in bad spirits. The hardest part of the job was the long hours with no break.

The only complaints I may have about the place is that there were next to no benefits for starting employees at part time (the only position you can get starting out) however, unexpectedly, posibility for upward movement in the company is very possible as they only hire from within for higher positions."

We had our breakfast, lunch and dinner, then it was time to go home. The management was nice although I knew my head director was running five daycares by herself so she did the best she could. The hardest part of the job was giving the parents daily reports of their child when they were misbehaving.
