rating,review
bad,I would not recommend anyone working for this company. The supervisors and leads are snakes! Dont trust them with anything they act like they are for you but would spread your personal information around and when your personal business get back to you they act like they never told anyone anything about situation.
bad,"I would not recommend this company for anyone , they have a lot of preference for people that have been there for a while . And of course call centers are just very messy in general ."
bad,The company has a market reputation that is widely acknowledged. Leadership isn't physically present a lot ... direction gets lost in translation. Embrace the tech world to really compete.
bad,4 years ago when the new technology for the chip card readers went into effect was the most rewarding time. The national account I was responsible for got their rates raised with no advanced warning. This was not good and killed the account. This account was supposed to be exempt from this and apparently that was not the case. They lied.
bad,Management chain of command is a problem. Company is stagnant due to inability to organize and communicate. Call center is dog-eat-dog at its finest and management are the worst offenders. Don't cross the wrong member of middle management in that dogfight or your head will roll for a minor nuance. Unemployment sided with me.
bad,"Management treats employees as slaves. No respect to employees. Makes false promises and breaks them at will. Work Life balance is horrible, even management asks employees to work overtime and not pay them."
bad,"I have worked for this company for over 10 years"
bad,"I was one of the many people release from Vantiv due to being in the same time zone as HQ- Cincinnati. "
bad,"Run, this company likes to outsource.  Every time you think that you position is safe they cut more and more people."
bad,"Vantiv is struggling to find their way.  Sales have been fantastic but the back office is a disaster.  Management ""know-how"" is lacking or nonexistent.  "
bad,"This job is great if you are a grade A suck up, but for the people that attempt to let their hard work show for itself end up being taken advantage of or forgotten. They expect you to work above your job title and not expect anything above your job title"
bad,"easy to start, learn new procedures every day, wonderful manager nice co-workers, Brakes and lunches was variable every day, and schedule change every four months, like to answer Spanish call and help with information about credit cards"
bad,"In my interviews I was told that there would be extensive training, however, when I came on-board everyone was too busy to follow up.  They gave me a binder and told me to read it.  The industry was interesting, but there was not much information about how to translate general, global industry info to the work to be done."
bad,"Management hard, stressful environment. Worked for over 5 months, but had to quit due to the amount of stress that I had to go through to keep working there. Employees aren't treated very well, but that could just be because of a certain sub set of people and not necessarily due to Vantiv"
bad,"I started here when they had won the title of best places to work in Cincinnati in 2012.  The place has declined markedly since then. There is no fun; no support; no training for employees and no loyalty.  They let people (10%) go annually and expect the remaining employees to take on that work and maintain the level of efficay and happiness.  The morale is bad,  They do not clearly communicate goals and when those are communicated, they change soon afterward,  There is outsourcing off shore and those left onshore are expected to oversee what happens overseas and also correct mistakes done offshore while completing their own tasks.  Those that are left here in US are helpful and nice people but stressed beyond what a person should be asked to do.  While workers show up and put in over 8 hour days, managers in the same area take long lunches, leave early and arrive late."
bad,Long periods of staring at the computer screen. Very much like a call center environment the employee moral is very poor everyone seems depressed or has something bad to say.
bad,Work was frequently not the focus and phone and computer maintenance often was.  Pay was low given the complexity of skills needed for working there.  Competition for moving into other departments was frequently limited to men and millenials.  Truly awful environment to work in
bad,"Company moves too fast to make sound decisions"
bad,Direct reports lacks industry and basic Payment knowledge. Lots of politics and unproductive behaviors. Think long and hard before entertaining this organization. Management unaccountable for their actions.
bad,"It's a position where you get to decide how much you want to make. They give you a 30k salary and the rest is commission. "
bad,"If you like being watched like a child this is the job for you!"
bad,"Management is always trying to cut costs, so they cut employees.  This makes the remaining employees' work lives much more difficult, so they are also leaving the company."
bad,"This company is growing which is a good thing depending on your location but, it is growing too fast for its own good. They are so busy trying to become the largest payment processor that they have forgotten about running the business effectively. The internal processes are beyond broken. I feel sorry for the customers because untilmately they are paying for it. "
bad,"Jobs were ""lost"" do to off-shoring. And those same positions were re-filled with either off-shore or contract posotitions and even some full time employees."
bad,"A typical work day is basically the same. I have not learned the different applications that is offered by the company. I have asked several times, but management have not put anything forward to make sure that the applications is learned. There is a lot of favoritism which make it a very uncomfortable to work in. There is nothing hard about the job."
bad,HR is the worst in vantiv where
bad,"The job itself is fun and energetic. However, the work environment and the structure make the job more stressful than necessary. There are things that could be improved that could make it an A+ job. As it stands I have to give it a C."
bad,"I loved working for Vantiv if I could get paid. They do not believe in PTO, Holiday Pay, Overtime,Night Differential Pay.Everyone in my department was totally lost on what was going on.I had to each month borrow money due to Vantiv could not pay me what was owed. It took several weeks after I resigned to get paid what was lawfully due me.It was nickled and dimed to me."
bad,"Busting your butt to try and satisfy the demands of users"
bad,their training program is non existent they just throw you into the job and expect you to be productive. poor management.
good,"Very aggressive company when it comes to acquisitions."
good,This place was partnered with 5/3 bank at the time I worked there. The workload is way too much for one person and the amount that is added does not end.
good,"I enjoyed my position at Vantiv but layoffs happened frequently and essentially no department was except from these layoffs besides phone agents. "
good,"Time flies when you're having fun.  There is no such thing as a typical day at work.  On top of the mundane daily tasks we are required to put out fires and make split second decisions that affect the performance and well-being of the company.  Every day a new situation arises that requires a new analysis and quick thinking.  The managers are there to support the teams and the employees all have to work together to make sure that partners and merchants are happy and taken care of.  The most difficult part of the job is making sure we remain in compliance with our customer contracts and card brands.  Even though this is challenging, fulfilling this role and keeping the company out of trouble is the most interesting and enjoyable part of the job."
good,this company was ok was working as a temp very independent but that's it pay was low not worth the money for the stress they put you through benefits were ok
good,"Typical day at work."
good,No review on this company there’s a lot of pros and cons alot of good and bad and depends on u ur role and supervisor if u advance or is offered a raise if one of the three dnt equal up than u dnt advance
good,"Fast paced sales enviroments and huge territory. Paid training back in OH, but very little one on one training."
good,"My typical workday consisted of making 50-70 outbound cold calls a day to obtain monthly credit card statements from business owners offering them a complete side by side savings comparison on their current credit card rates."
good,Job was not difficult very repetitive and extremely boring but the company did offer great benifits including 401k immediate paid time off and plenty of overtime. The environment itself was laid back and pretty comfortable.
good,"They systems that are in place do not communicate, customers get billed for services they do not use. The information from the application get's changed during on-boarding."
good,Great place to work hard and learn the payments ropes. Few advancement opportunities into management roles. Reorganization in IT areas make for chaotic structure and slow adoption of changes and technologies that could bolster company and competitive growth.
good,"Somewhat difficult place to work. Voids in leadership with large amounts of turnover, but benefits are good and pay is competitive. Consistent change and not a great deal of flexibility with technology or tools to get jobs done."
good,"Very cliquey; exceptions are only made for those who have worked there a long time and have friends in management.  Very high turnover; new employees are not properly trained.  Work, life balance is subject only to work load."
good,Not a bad company to work for.  The quality of management varies greatly and the company values consultants and new employees over existing employees.
good,"This is a company that will afford you the opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of a call center.  The time-off package is more than generous which should give people the opportunity to have that balance that they need away from work."
good,"This company moves fast! That can be good and can be bad, there is a bit of wheel spinning but people generally seem open to new concepts & ideas."
good,"Good job when first starting out, the company grew too quickly for its own good.  Unfortunately with no space in advancement a lot of the team mates I started out working with had to look for a different job within a matter of a few months.  Also, after the re-structure of the company, many co-workers whom had been working there previously got laid off or were forced to do multiple tasks that didn't offer any additional merits."
good,"Contact center provides minimal training and minimal pay. Relaxed environment and friendly co-workers make this place great. However, if you have bills to pay and/or value training, this is not the place for you. Great for recent high school or college grads with low debt."
good,There are several pros and cons to work for Vantiv. It is a growing company. Their HR policies are not very up to date.  Management is not very professional.
good,"Duties:"
good,"Good company, but very poor work place culture.  High pace technology environment. Very technically challenging environment with great self-reward. Really good people and great diversity. Lower management staff lack leadership, management skills, and vision."
good,Managers were brought in with little to no industry experience so there is no support to the sales staff. There is no sense of urgency. Just not a work environment that promotes increases in sales numbers. Company does not promote from within.
good,"I have been here for nearly five years and I am looking for another employer. The people I work with are fun, but I believe majority of them are drained. We do the best to make our situation better."
good,"My overall experience with the company is good. However, 2 of the 3 managers I had in less than 1 year were far from even being ok. Initially I was hired to do one job. Then without notice I was assigned a completely different job.My managers also changed. Almost immediately I was place on written warning stating my work in my old position was not up to standards. This information was never provided to me and I have an email stating I was being moved due to   nothing I did. I was terminated 30 days later. I never had a chance. My first manager to this day will say I was a good employee. The others are just waiting for retirement."
good,This job I enjoyed doing but as for the company they were not very organized. I did enjoy my superiors as well as co workers while at the job. I think the hardest part was having answering phones back to back with no time for breaks in between.
good,"Vantiv was a great company to work for with excellent pay. If you like the fast pace call center environment to grow with a company, Vantiv is the company!"
good,"Calls can range from steady to insane back to back calls for 2 weeks straight. The metric system works against you because if you use after call it works against your performance the limit is 10sec for the month else you considered a poor performer, if you are helping a customer and it passes your break scheduled it works against you and decreases your adherence, customer service surveys if they average lower than a 7/10 it can impact you negatively like I was denied a raise due to adherence. When I found out the black/white about adherence you are basically a number. The PTO IS GREAT!!! Great Medical benefits, 401 K match! There are opportunities for growth but who wants to stay around and fight for a raise.Going to the bathroom except on your breaks also affects your adherence and if you arrive late or car breaks down they use a point system which if they increase can cause a write up even if it's is out of your control eg you get sick, meet up in accident. Great place to just start off get ur money at the door."
good,"Despite their rapid growth, they were letting so many people go when I worked there.  A number of executives didn't live in Cincinnati, so weren't in touch with what was really going on."
good,"This company has a lot of potential and can be a great employer, depending on your department.  Operations and sales feel like a completely different company when considered along with other parts of the organization. I worked on cross-functional teams and I was always amazed at the lattitude that other departments experienced on a daily basis. If you are considering a role in operations, don't do it! You'll find yourself in a silo with no room to advance. Other parts of the company function well as a team; in Operations leadership is only concerned in covering their own tails. There were no development programs or feedback mechanisms. Offering solutions often leads to reprimand.  There's a reason why people frequently leave here.  It's a great place for the culture in the short term, but I don't anticipate retiring from here."
good,Poor internal communication.  Time wasting co workers.  Team leads did not face reality.  Social events more important than results.
good,"Management was upfront in stating you have to hit sales quota by self sourcing; but also stated untrue facts about new bank referral partner that did not end up producing and was very time consuming to work with and try to educate and develop into becoming a business bank.   Management also stated during hiring process and after being hired that they had ""out of the box"" thinking and development of referral sources and once hired this was not the case at all - unless in fact their were ""out of the box"" referral partners but they were never shared with me.  "
good,"This is an OK job, it's pretty boring, just staring at a computer screen all day long.. It's not inspiring or even interesting in the least.. management is cliquey and seems to play favorites a lot. If you're looking for a 9-5 job, then this is for you. They offer OK pay but a ton of vacation time and are very flexible when you have to go to dr's appts etc."
good,"Vantiv is a stressful place to work, when concerning the customers finances. However, Vantiv has a great benefit plan with 401k, and flexible hours that suit you."
good,"I'd rather not review this job, because I didn't enjoy it very much."
good,I enjoyed my hours and the work place as well as co-workers. Offers positive feed back but does not provide it in compensation. Maybe show to the empkoyees going above and beyond quality customer service and assistance by promotions financially.
good,good compny.  lots of growth.  they are also into acquire mode big time. will continue to grow and be #1 in the country soon enough. probably will go global soon
good,"A typical day at work starts with logging onto the computer on your time. They do not pay for the 10-15 minutes required to get your systems up and running, but you must be ready to start taking calls at your start time. "
good,"Great job, but once Management changed the job went down hill. The new Management had know idea what our mission was for the clients. Changed a lot of processes and caused several clients to close their accounts."
good,"My everyday task was receiving calls from customer that wanted to pay their credit card or helping them with something wrong with it, and assist with they issue."
good,Okay place to work.  Recently changed to an agile work environment so planning your workday is pretty simple.  Co-workers are helpful when time allows.
good,I assist incoming calls from with businesses with issues processing credit cards using equipment provided by Vantiv. A typical day consist of updating software and downloading it into the terminal. I learn about new software updates and credit card processing. I have wonderful willing to assist co-workers.
good,bank partnership is crucial to the success of this company. i foster a positive environment for my employees and promote positive relationships with bank partners.
good,"Not a lot of advancement opportunities unless you live in Cincinnati, OH.  Nice people, nice managers, lots of turnover."
good,"If company had possible positions to excel and offered job security, would have great employment ratings"
good,"Vantiv's work environment was that of a call center servicing credit cards. The supervisors and team leads cared a great deal about the employees and everyone worked hard together towards a common goal. The most difficult part of the job was often the type of work itself, but it was also the most enjoyable when difficult situations were rectified and the customer walked away, if not happy, satisfied."
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Lots of hurdles to complete your overall daily job functions. Too many departments that don't have clear direction or tend to pass the buck onto someone else.
good,I never felt welcomed in my department. Manager inexperienced. Long hours and off hour support. Handled multiple concurrent (18-25) projects. Documentation difficult to locate.
good,Growing company slowly improving and now more full integrated with all the acquisitions in last 5 years; Organized now more like a real Fortune 1000 company
good,"Vantiv is a good company to work for with excellent benefits, but the work life balance for my position is severely lacking."
good,"Solid workplace, quiet environment, team oriented, schedule can be flexable at times. "
good,I personally work in a department that is very appreciated and valued with the company because of a great management team my department has. There are multiple departments with management put in place because of seniority and not abilities that are struggling because not only do the departments not feel appreciated but are asked to do more because management is showing a high output level of work with a low employee numbers so the higher ups look highly on the departments management without actually knowing what goes on in the department.
good,"Card Fraud Detection department welcomed all process improvement ideas, not just from leadership but as well as from agent level.  Our dept. strived to improve upon our success daily.  Upper management listened to our ideas and we were giving free-range to implement and challenge existing processes.  The landscape of fraud changes with new technological advancements.  We had to recognize new trends and develop tactics to combat.  Training of new processes had to be accurate to ensure potential monetary losses were mitigated.  As a people leader I took great enjoyment in developing agents.  Some agents needed more guidance than others and some needed to be challenged consistently.  The biggest reward was seeing those agents I've inspired receive accolades for their hard work and determination."
good,"I learned a great deal about partner management and the business side of customer care.  Led hundreds of hours of projects and helped with several process improvements int he company.  The hardest part of the job was workforce management and finance disagreements.  Always a battle get the proper number of staffing needed, but either way, my team performed and exceeded expectations. We helped win customers."
good,Most of the typical days at work is the first day of the week after long weekend. It happened so that I was coming back to Ohio from California my flight got delayed so was I and had to take unplanned leave.
good,Strong Company with good training. Nice people to work with and tools for success available.
good,"In Houston, there's not much room for advancement. Everything based on favoritism. Pay is lower than Houston average. Quantity over quantity. Great place for a newbie to learn business, but not so great for more experienced employees."
good,I have learned a lot about monitoring routers and managing customer connections. There is a wide variety of responsibilities and expectations of a level 2.
good,"The culture at Vantiv is different than it was at Litle. It is unfortunately more silo-based than it used to be. The people that work here are still really great, although attrition rate is the highest I've ever seen. Management is more focused on the window dressing than job performance (meaning what hours you are here and that it appears you're working hard, rather than focusing on actual work being done). It's a shame because Litle was a great company to work for."
good,"Very little structure, management style very laid back. Very little accountability. There were so many opportunities to improve the business structure"
good,A typical day at work included getting to work being on your headset ready to take a call. It took communications skills and patience.
good,"I like jobs to work ,  flexible time to work and Great people . Manager are very helpful and making sure that the customer are help.  Only 30 min lunch break"
good,Good company to work for. A typical day consists of inbound and outbound calls. Assist merchant in updating terminals or troubleshooting. Creating files for downloads. The work place culture is very diverse with a sense of good relationships. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing good customer server to our merchants.
good,I had the chance to work for a few departments and overall was satisfied. Some of the compensation plans were not great and would always hurt top performers.
good,its an ok company The hr department leaves something to be desired
good,I would still be working there if they did not relocate the business. Hardest part of the job was getting calls from upset clients when their cards were lost or stolen.
good,this place is good for you to learn how to mange you bank and avoid fraudulent transaction. Company is very care about the employee. They have flexible schedule after you work their in a few month.
good,Quite a good place to work as an entry level computer technician. I had a good chance to learn hands on laptop troubleshooting and repair.
good,"A typical day at work in Production Services starts with meetings to review overnight metrics and special notes about coming events.  The day is split 60-40 between reactionary work and planned work.  It's not a great ratio, but par for the course for a growing technology company.  I learned a lot about the cultural differences between the Midwest and just about every other part of the country.  The management is intent on trying new processes and progressive changes to make things better.  There are some growing pains because of this, but they seem to be honestly trying to make the business and the environment better.  My co-workers were the best part of my job.  It's a true community at Vantiv, and the people, for the most part, genuinely like each other.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changing nature of the business and technology."
good,"Assist customer with filing disputes on fraudulent charges that they noticed on their debit cards. I enjoyed assisting customers file their disputes to get their money back. Overall, it was a good assignment to be on with a good company."
good,"A typical day at Vantiv is different each day. I take phone calls from credit and debit cardholders whom have questions or concerns about their account. My supervisors and teamleads are great to work with.. Whenever there is a question we do not know the answer to they are always there to help us. My co-workers are so much funny to be around. When the day can get stressful because we are busy co-workers make the day easier because we can laugh and calm each other down. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry cardholders whom are rude and disrespectful, you have to realize why they are made put yourself in their shoes and calmliy deescalate the problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying cardholders beyond their expectations, especially when dealing with our security system. Cardholders are really appreciative that our security system blocks fraud charges and that we call to verify the activity with them."
good,"High Energy, fast paced, nice people.  Very good place to work, enjoy it.  There is no typical day here at Vantiv, very fast paced and ever changing. Hard to put it into words."
good,"Vantiv is a great place to start your early job career to gain experience. For me personally, I learn more about my career path than any job i work for before."
good,"fast paced, challenging environment with exceptional support staff // minimal opportunities for advancement within Sales, RM and Business Partner groups"
good,"My typical day at work is interacting, leading and developing the call center staff.  I operate on a monthly budget to ensure the company is protected and the staff Is happy and engaged."
good,"I enjoy working for Vantiv the company is always giving away gifts, having raffles , and food aside for that the work is easy as long as you're doing what you are supposed to do you will enjoy working for this company."
good,"You can't really describe a ""typical"" day at Vantiv. Because of the nature of the Merchant Services industry, everyday, every phone call was different. Because of that, you never really knew what your day would be like, but did know that you were going to face a lot of challenges. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to get a different shift even though I was a full-time employee and extremely dependable. They just didn't do shift bids, so you were kinda stuck with the position you originally accepted. And the most enjoyable part of the job was definately my co-workers!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is actually completing my daily tasks in a fashionable manner. I enjoy working with others. Working with a team of supporting people, working well together, completing issues. A job well done."
good,"The environment we worked in was very fast paced.  You had to be flexible and able to multi-task.  My team assisted everyone on the floor with a multitude of things.  We had to be accommodating in every way possible: knowledgeable, friendly, empathetic, helpful, and have the willingness to get the job done.  Through all of that we always managed to find ways to create a fun / positive environment to work in."
good,"Good company and fun work culture, but compensation is not enough in todays economy. assignment was temporary through temporary service."
good,"inbound outbound calling for customers who didn't have insurance on file. I learned how to communicate better with the elderly actively listen for small clues, and management and co workers were cool compensation was great. Hardest part of the day was realizing at some point I will be elderly. Most enjoyable part was seeing how just and simple conversation can make and elderly person day."
good,"Constantly busy with request from sales, internal and external."
good,Very different than most corporate jobs. Easy going and respectful to their employees. The management team has really changed over the years and has become a very respectable and reliable unit.
good,"Fast paced and lots of room for advancement, Learned how to work well in a team environment and work well in a hard but rewarding position.  Workplace culture was fun yet hard paced.  I enjoyed working with customers and being able to help."
good,Nice place to work. A lot of unexplained turnover. Management does an okay job at making new hires feel at home. During month end closing they feed you.
good,This was a very good place to work. An environment conducive to fun and productivity. I miss this job.
good,"Account Executive Atlanta."
good,"Buen horario, buenas instalaciones, buenos beneficios"
good,I love working at vantiv . I have been here for almost 2 years . I love being able to grow with the company . I enjoy being able to learn something new everyday with vantiv.
good,"A typical day at work is very chill. You do not have to worry about someone hovering over you, you pretty much work solo and if help is needed, you will be able to receive the help that you need. A lot of overtime and a great environment."
good,"Nice people, good management. The pay was decent for how easy the work was. It seemed like the management actually cared about everyone."
good,"Positive place to work, I was only a contractor. Boss was very nice and co-workers very helpful and positive. not much more to say, was only there two months for a project based assignment."
good,The Managers are very understanding about how difficult and time consuming our jobs can be so they arrange fun activities to do together to balance it out.
good,This company has great potential.  I find that the manager really cares about his employees but its a bit unorganized.  The company itself offers wonderful benefits and is very flexible.  If they acquire some bigger bank relationships they will be a force in this industry and amazing place to work.
good,I process VISA & MasterCard disputes. I eat lunch @ my desk & rarely take breaks. We have a large workload.
good,I come in and see what my queue looks like for the day and then I start on quality checking my co-workers work that was processed. Then see if I have any high prority work that has to be done first. Then more on to the other work I have. Some of the managers are willing to let you come in early and take a 1/2 hr lunch if you have children that get out of school early or if you go to school after work. The most enjoyable part of my day is being around people I like that makes the day go by faster.
good,Internship. Learned a lot and helped the company while advancing my own technological skills. 4.5/5
good,"Home office, outside sales,great sales support with the Gem Team"
good,"A lot of nice people work there including management. Management was always busy in meetings, but still made time to answer any questions or discuss any issues arising from our daily tasks.My job was stressful, but most financial positions are."
good,"Associate Fraud Specialists aid in the prevention of Debit or Credit card fraud losses for over 1,000 Financial Institutions. Specialists will field inbound calls to finalize cases of suspected fraudulent activity. After brief questioning the Specialists may permanently block a card to mitigate additional fraudulent activity or remove a block to facilitate legitimate spending at the point of sale. This interaction is often the first interaction in a sequence and is critical in the overall resolution of the situation"
good,Vantiv was a great company to work for. There was decent opportunity to make good money and management was always willing to assist in any way the sales representatives needed.
good,"A typical work day consist of following up with enduser via phone callback, emails and voicemail. Resolve assigned tickets via remote support and deskside support. I have learned to work under pressure and maintain an excellent repore with the end user.  "
good,"Best place to get call center experience ."
good,"Typical work day was busy, but not overwhelming."
good,"Very good and helpful people and they use latest technology."
good,"Responsibilities"
good,I LOVED working here and hated that I had to quit! My boss and co-workers were absolutely amazing! 
good,"⦁	Represent the bank and the Card Services area to Credit Unions and cardholders in a courteous and professional manner."
good,I loved working with Vantiv. It was something different. Although did not like being monitored every second of the day. Merchants can be very difficult to deal with.
good,"It was a blessing to work there, unfortunately there were application issue for the last year that have yet to be resolved. This is a huge monetary issue for the business"
good,"The company overall is good as it's adapting with latest methodologies, organizational structure and up to date tools/softwares through migration often. Throughout Vantiv I had to work in Agile fashion which was both hectic and enjoyable. Had worked in multiple roles, played in highly technical shoes sometimes. Gave workshops and presentations for Vantiv's big clients/customers who are within US that are Banks and Merchants, answered their technical and critical questions."
good,Great company loves there employees the companie always offering extra was to make money and will reward your good work. Fun clean work environment. Training is amazing so you will never feel lost and will always have a great team to help with any questions are concerns.
good,Work with banks with our proprietary software.  Learned about credit card disputes when we were servicing credit cards.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of the job was learning the technical side of the proprietary software.  The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with the bank clientele.
good,"I enjoy my job. I am looking for something in the day now with a se schedue, monday thru friday no weekends"
good,"Very collaborative workplace culture. ability to work remote. great work/life balance. "
good,"Management is extremely good and always work on a challenging projects that sticks with the vision and growth of the business. The hardest part would be the adoption of SDLC methodology, like transformation from Waterfall to SAFe agile was highly difficult. As the cross train coordination was lacking."
good,You love it at Vantiv. It's a great place to work. The employees are helpful and supportive.  I enjoyed my time and training.  This is not a very stressful place to work.  They are pretty laid back and they don't micro manage.
good,Learned alot about leasing credit card equipment and my manager and co-workers where friendly and good helpers
good,"•	Build interchange reports for Relationship Managers"
good,"It's really feeling great to work in good organizations.. "
good,"Receives and responds to incoming calls, pages, and/or-emails regarding debit cards"
good,"My responsibility as a Bilingual Customer Service Representative is to professionally solve the issue of the cardholder that is calling in. That could be that their card is blocked, or that they want to know why a transaction is not being authorize, or to report travel or to make a payment, or to have their credit limit increased to desired amount and things like that......"
good,"Vanitv is a great place to work. They hire the best and brightest, maintaining the highest standards in the processing industry. Everyone hired as a contractor strives to be hired directly because of the friendly atmosphere and high business standards. (Plus the on site cafeteria helps!)"
