bad,"Cant keep any drivers in Carlsbad,  so Hobbs drivers were forced to drive 2 to 2.5 hours, haul a couple short loads, then 2.5 hrs back from White City offload.  Until recent, paid 0 extra for red loads, now $10.  Red loads cut your check in half,  "
bad,Company doesn’t care about the drivers safety and the equipment! They don’t pay for sleeping in the truck if you run out of hours to get your next load. The pay the sux (14.00 hr) plus commission per load. Manager doesn’t know anything about LP and likes to yell at you as a conversation.
bad,"The management is vindictive, the pay is below market average , off days are normally weekday leaving no time for family on he weekends management never takes responsibility for their actions when they are incorrect instead passes the fail on to the drivers by taking from their bonuses"
bad,"Watch your back, too much inner office gossip, favoritism, dispatchers are very big polar. Horrible communication.  Drivers are nice but management us horrible."
bad,"Management is horrible, and you have to time off of work to spend with family. They just cut the pay I went from making 26.50 To 16.00 And hour. This company has nothing more to offer me. Im not afraid of change. Something better has come my way."
bad,poor management breaux bridge woman has her favorites will get poor runs when slow you stay home no pay.mess up get treated worse than a dog.
bad,Current management does not value it's staff manager-constantly belittling people
bad,Management expect you to be flexible with them but nothing in return. Work late hour but not everybody can get comp time.
bad,"a typical day involves a minimum of ten hours or more, when a supervisor is on call the hours can add up to 80+ hours and you do not get paid anything extra for your time. You get called out at anytime during the night and be up all the next day doing paperwork. The upper management doesn't care about your safety and gives very poor raises. The work culture is get as much done as possible in a day without any type of break."
bad,Enterprise is a difficult place to work if you enjoy a work/life balance.  OT is somewhere in the 20-40 hrs/week range and could last an entire year without a break.
bad,"Its immature company who made it to fortune 100. Being a computer programmer, its sad to have worked there with a very Bad work life balance and No flexibility. You have to forget your family or If you have insomnia, its a good place for you. Very difficult to move up in career. Even in worst days of weather, you have to swim and make it to office."
bad,"I have been in O/G for 25 years.  In all my life I have never had a raise o 1.9% that was across the board.   Socialist type management.  No reason to work hard cause the slacker gets the same raise!   "
bad,"Need to know right people to get promoted. No training. No accountability for management. Highly stressful work environment, unless your manager's pet."
bad,"Rarely got time off and when you did it was cancelled even if it was turned in advance. Worked more than 16 hours per day - violating DOT Regulations. Got in from working 32 hours, notified my supervisor that I was going to sleep and rec'd phone calls from coworkers and then the supervisor wanting me to come in to work 2 hours later. Never received any proper training and would be reprimanded for things I asked for help on but did not know how to do. Violated HIPPA regulations - can't go to the doctor without them wanting to know what exactly you went for and would write you up when you had a valid doctors note to miss work. They will actually ask for your doctor contact information. Would insist you come to work anyway to ""supervise"" and tell you to sleep in the truck. SLEEP IN THE TRUCK!!?? - in which they would later write you up for doing if you actually did. When you need to work as a team, it is encouraged only to have them abandon you to take the fall. Double standard in how they treat employees - old dogs get the benefit of the doubt and get away with things that you, even if experienced will get written up for. Manager of San Angelo area needs to be reviewed and written up for not properly training new employees, violating DOT regulations/having employees violate DOT Regulations, violating HIPPA and taking advantage of his employees. They are real quick to cover up accidents/mistakes to avoid violations. There are many other companies to work for out there that will take time to train you according to their company standards and treat you better."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company, the pay is great but the leadership and culture is terrible. Not a great place to work....."
bad,"....Unless you like an uber competitive workplace where you have to watch your back...I've been gone from there so it may have changed, but when i was there..if you didn't party with the right kids, you didn't make it."
bad,"Where a peson can by fired for someone elses mistakes. The management will reword anything and everything to fire someone, even when the facts state otherwise. This yard has lost good people one right after another, from drivers to a supervisior do to no reasonable reason except district, and area managers need to feel superior in their position. The new puppet that they have hired as the terminal manager will soon learn that he has no control or say so in any decision that is not approved by  upper managers. Since enterprise bought teppco there has been 8 terimal managers in this yard. Most employed in this yard are looking for other jobs."
bad,"Never have I worked for a place that seems to do everything in its power to be less productive, earn less money, and have the nerve to blame their employees. Ask any driver in the West Texas region and they will tell you their either looking, holding on to get fully vested, or hoping someone with brains will take over management. Were getting less, loads thus less money for us and the company. Consolidated yards were some employees are forced to drive further from their home to work. Then take their trucks back close to home to haul loads burning more fuel and a waste of our time.  They have cut pay and benefits. Moral is low, and it just seems to get worse as each month passes. Honestly don't see how this company will last. Were losing a little money, and Enterprise is losing 100k to millions, losing our customers, and losing any pride or respect from its employees. A drastic change in management needs to be made before these morons sale us out or close the door. I see very little hope for a future with this company."
bad,This is a place that wants you to give 150% and you get nothing in return. Are you a hard worker? Independent thinker? Problem solver? That will only get you buried in more work while office politics advances others careers lightning fast meanwhile you'll be over worked and under paid...and don't you dare bring up the need for development or address your concerns you should be thankful that you have a job...the culture is toxic and will be the undoing of this company. Top talent flees!
bad,"Worked for this company for 3 years.  Rules were always changing.  Management was always changing,   Co-workers were always changing, Job was not challenging at all.  The best part of the job were the drivers that I dispatched.  They were all friendly and helpful.  The days were repetitive.  Same thing, day in and day out.  Other dispatcher was very lazy and seemed to just not want to work."
bad,I was a contractor working on commercial applications.  It was a company trying to act like a large company but needed a lot of help.  Needs to set standards and software needs to be updated more often to stay current.
bad,It was a very good company to work for at one point but now they made management changes and it's going downhill very fast. And the supervisors are sabotaging the drivers on there trucks like taking away safety items you need at in the field and next day they want to write you up.
bad,"Company has changed dramatically in the past few years. It used to have a family feel but that has given way to a profit over personnel mentality that leaves a fair amount of employees seeking opportunities elsewhere. This has led to a revolving door approach in several departments. There are still some good departments that are led by longstanding employees but those are diminishing as retirement comes or they are pushed out of the company.  Ive met some great people but the higher up the ladder those relationships  go the more underwhelming they become. I suppose this could be true of any large company. Be wary of any commercial or distribution positions if work life balance is important to you. Excellence is expected at all times but rarely rewarded unless you are in the right social niche. Was surprised that a fortune 150 company so closely resembled a Jr high cafeteria with all the cliques. Micromanagement was definitely the norm in my experience. Be very careful when dealing with Sr management as some often seem to have agendas focused more on self preservation than the good of the company or those they employ. Again, there are still some really good departments, but I'd have my eyes wide open before accepting any role within their commercial groups."
bad,"Long hours, high stress. We were recently told that the entire company region is up for sale. Job can end at any time without notice."
bad,Opportunity to learn new technology and challenging work environment
bad,"Begin working when you arrive. Hardly any breaks, expect excellence all the time, demanding and inexcusable. The bosses are overrated and under-qualified."
bad,"Come in, go to work, don't talk."
bad,"I worked at enterprise for seven years and never once saw a driver move up. This company does not promote from within, they would rather hire people off the street and pay them more than promote CDL drivers to non cdl positions. "
bad,"it was ok to work for Enterprise Products they didn't offer much work incentives,jobs are overrated and no room for growth unless your willing to transfer"
bad,Tried many times to apply for a position there with no luck at all and no way to contact anyone other than an automated machine. so frustrating!
bad,"horrible safety culture and the management had the Good ole Boy mindset and was bias and created a uncomfortable work culture......."
bad,"people suck for the most part, supervisors and other workers are not as qualified as you are but are in charge of you. dumb, mindless work, sooo boring!"
bad,It was cool until new management took over. They encourage snitching and they are a bunch of backstabbers...everyone is out to get you so be careful.  Benefits are nice too.
bad,"I have not been here long enough for a solid view on this company, just know that it is not what I expected from a company this well known."
bad,Busy day at work
bad,"Enterprise products as a company is not geared towards the transportation side of crude oil.  They’re mainly focused on the pipeline side.   Transportation and the drivers are merely an afterthought for this company.  Marketing has little or no interest in obtaining enough crude to haul to make this a financially appealing job. Supervisors and immediate management are easy to get along with, no complaints on that end."
bad,"Good pay, good benefits but not a very good working atmosphere. Employees were uptight, always looking over their shoulder for next shoe to drop.  Different groups treated differently."
bad,My operation supervisor was horrible!! Do not work a Hobbs station in Seminole Texas. It was his way or the hw. He had is favorite employee and no one els got any OT. The one guy could do nothing wrong but everyone els was a failure. If I could work for enterprise somewhere else I would in a heart beat
good,"Management doesn't care about employees' concerns. Advancement is on a ""Who You Know"" basis. The good ole' boy enviroment still exists in the corporate world of Enterprise."
good,"Enterprise pays you a little more than most pipeline operators. Trust me your going to earn it. The culture is do more with less resource. Thus, you will do your job as well as lots of administrative work in association with your role and the role of your department. Working 7 days a week is expected as necessary. With the amount of pipe they have if you support operations, compliance, HSE etc. Expect the phone to ring nights, weekends, holidays, and during vacation time. You are truly Never Off work, that's why they pay for your cell. After giving them all of you for 10-11 hours a day enjoy the commute to and from downtown Houston,  And for that open manager role... your chance to move up. Forget it, they will call their buddy from back home to fill that."
good,I was in an ambulance on way to hospital on a conference call with boss about a job. This is how it was after going full time with the company. Very High Stress and long hours
good,"emphasis on micromanagement."
good,"Low pay with minimal benefits. No bonuses and a nearly unmanageable workload.  This is where those who can't make the cut at the majors come to slave away.  If you put in your 80 hours a week and manage to outlast your competition, you will advance here....but you will do so at roughly half the salary you deserve."
good,"Great company to start out at but due to shift in company policies it is losing it small family feel for a more corporate outlook. Currently have flexible hours, but they are moving away from that."
good,Money is decent if you have experience. Good’ol boy is strong there. No advancement opportunities. You are nobody just an employee number. Management doesn’t care. No bonus program. Systems are overloaded and employees overworked. If you land in the right department you can throw a ball around control room or pitch some coins around. Be wary or stay away. Push out new systems on weekends with minimal support staff available.
good,"Enterprise prides itself on its work hard business culture.  It is not a fit for everyone. It is fast paced, dynamic and stressful.  For some, this is a culture that allows them to excel; for others, they will likely burn out."
good,"If your coming to the Marine department stay away. Management is poor to say the least. They treat you like kids, no matter how good of a employee you are. There is no room to grow no matter what they tell you. They have a high turnover for mechanics. The good the Health insurance. And somewhat descent pay."
good,stuck at same job for 3 years with no pay raise or advancement.  would not allow me to apply for other jobs cause they would be unable to replace me for my position
good,Morgans point was good but west Texas had a hostile work environment. Interview was done in Houston area which was good but West Texas was not as organised. Also their were aggressive people out in Midland Texas facility .
good,Good place to work... If you don't mind being the only one who cares about the job. Raises are not sufficient to actual cost of living and no one will fight for you
good,"review cost over the mandated contractors"
good,Management training was lacking with regards to managing people.  Appeared to be a lack of promoting within in some departments.  Great opportunity for learning and being exposed to new things.
good,"The company itself wasn’t bad the only real issues I had was with management they really love to micromanage the employees. The pay was great and the benefits were not bad at all, but one bad manager can make a company fall."
good,Bait and switch.  This oil company had not honored the salary at which I was quoted before I relocated. They claimed demand slowed in the week it took me to relocate.
good,"Duties are ever changing. I like the environment overall. However, I am looking for more of a professional challenge."
good,Staff are required to perform their duties with the minimum amount of guidance.  The job is fast paced and can be stressful.  There seems to be a lot of turnover.
good,"it was a good job. a lot of over time"
good,"I was working at another job when the position came up.  I enjoy it and just wish I could have stayed there until I retired."
good,"A competitive, fast paced environment, but good compensation for the work expected. Most employees at all levels are talented and work hard for the company."
good,"Old fashioned management style reminiscent of the 1980s, but company is very successful and continues to deliver lots of value.  Great IT management and leadership."
good,A demanding workplace that allows you to grow both professionally and personally. Ability to gain exposure to different facets of the business.
good,"I was a contractor with Enterprise Products LLP, which only last for 6 months under the directions of the Director of Transportation.  Within this short time-frame, I learned the Pipeline business relating to regulatory guidelines and processes."
good,"Enterprise is a fast paced, diversified oil & gas company.  The company tends to run lean which requires employees to put in the extra hours to get the job done.  Enterprise does recognize their employees with good compensation and benefits package.  Enterprise allows employees to grow and experience new opportunities."
good,Learned a great deal about the various instruments involved in the construction and maintainence of a pipeline.  Supervisors very helpful.
good,"great place to work"
good,Could be better... Way better.. I Dislike shiftwork and unfortunatly it comes with the position i hold.
good,"Better be on your P's and Q's here, after your sucked in to the Eprod web of death, you will think that you've made it and finally have found a place you can hang your hat and kick back. THINK AGAIN, matter of fact don't even reach for your hat, management (in the department i was in) is more corrupt, disrespectful, and backstabbing than ""CONGRESS"". You will not move up or out of your position if your not a ""RAT"". New Idea's or better way of getting your work done ""Forget it"" you work for EPROD now it's their way or the highway. Turnover rate is extremely high. Not all departments are like this at Enterprise. Be very cautious."
good,"Management is no good. They have buddy system in different divisions where if you're not liked, you'll more than likely get treated unfair."
good,Great place and location. Would retire with the company if I could. Having to leave due to the facility closing down and no other job openings available in Louisiana.
good,"Productivity required, however, their unwillingness to put the Millwrights on shift tended to load a lot of overtime on to the crew.  So much so that many could no longer live without it."
good,"Not too stressful. Pay is subpar and raises are not competitive. The company does focus on safety. Overall, I would recommend this place to get your foot in the door."
good,"Company had good working relationship employees"
good,"- Good benefits, but compensation is below average."
good,"Tough culture that demands results. The amount of experiences and various tasks is irreplaceable. Overall, I would recommend and candidate to pursue an opportunity at Enterprise."
good,Great job and great pay when working. Not so good between jobs so when you are working better save up because the money goes quickly.
good,"There are worse companies to work for. The pay isn't top tier, but it is somewhat competitive. They sold their offshore holdings and I was hired by the new company."
good,I have nowhere to go from my position. I would more challenges every day and someway to grow. I would like to be with a team that works together for new projects and support existing installations.
good,"I worked for Enterprise for a little over 1 year. Turnover is high in some departments, a lot of that has to do with management and people with bad attitudes that contribute to an unhealthy culture. There were a lot of learning opportunities, but not I did not see any opportunity for advancement in the near future."
good,"A typical day at work included countless hours at the computer sending/receiving emails and fielding phone calls. A majority of the day as a project manager is spent interacting with vendors and field operators. These interactions are an enjoyable part of the day since social encounters can be both challenging and rewarding. Co-workers tend to be very friendly and helpful. However, sometimes the managements can leave something to be desired. Overall, the experience was very rewarding as the project management and business communication skills learned will be invaluable going forward."
good,"Good company to work for, you will learn alot and get paid well for it  but if you happen to work under a micro manager get out quick!"
good,"Fast paced, stressfull and felt like the sky was falling every day but that may have just been my group. I enjoyed the job, but our work load kept getting to be more and more, but no people were addedl"
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"I enjoy working here but there are constant changes going on, nothing is consistent and poor communication. The moral is horrible but I must say the benefits are great."
good,"Could be the best place to work with a few improvements. Facilities are great, and equipment is 5 Years new. With a management change and the addition of a bonus program no one would ever leave."
good,problems making decisions on the simplest of things. Hectic work days. Safety fall by the wayside when money becomes involved. area manager requires us to use certain contractors even if they don't provide the best service or quality of work.Plant supervisor can not make a decision without checking with manager first.
good,Overall a forward looking company well positioned in the industry.  Current top management is excellent.  Local management varies greatly from good to bad.  Overall is a good company to work for.
good,"A fast paced work environment. Very stressful. Depending on your department and managers, it can ether be an awesome company to work for or a really stressful environment."
good,Enterprise products started as a very good job we worked 4-10’s And had plenty time with our families. But the more the company begin to grow the more challenges we had to except from upper management. Never really felt like management was for the workers. When I was on call I would work all day and half the night for one Week straight.
good,"Great compensation and excellent benefits for staff.  Great support from drivers, mechanics, Field Supervisors, and Dispatch Supervisor.  Beyond that level, management out of touch."
good,I truly enjoyed working at this company. The team was very easy going and helpful. I learned more about the Oracle system and more of the inventory side of the energy field. The down fall about this job is that it was only contract.
good,"Days are long as the only LPG Export Coordinator; weekends are required to be on-call, including proactively monitoring email and communicating with customers/terminal. Reports/updates are delivered on a semi-daily basis, to upper management."
good,Productive environment with competitive pay. A good place to build relationships and learn the business. Quite a few opporutnities for advancement in the company.
good,I have been taught a lot and been given the chance at growing in the industry. I thank Enterprise for all of the opportunities that they have given me.
good,Good job for anyone ready to work.Plenty of O/T available due to company expansion. Great job for someone wanting to put in a lot of hours.
good,Great place to work. Good people to work for. Good hours. sophisticated company.
good,"Enterprise Products has offered a good consistent job with a vast amount of skills to learn and practice as a measurement technician. I work a 7 day schedule, so for 7 days I fly to a location approximately 80 miles offshore to live. From there, we follow a testing schedule for meter testing other platforms in our vicinity and fly to those locations over the course of that 7 days. On my 7th day, I return home for 7 days and enjoy living with my family. I enjoy the responsibilities that I am able to take on as an offshore measurement technician and have learned a great deal concerning the production and measurement of natural gas. The hardest part of my job is not being able to come home every night to my family. It has been fine for the pass six years, but I guess it is starting to weigh in on my conscious."
good,Enjoyed my tenure here at EPROD. Friendly group of hard working tallented employees. Sorry to see many of them go due to unfair treatment and compensation. Maybe one day Enterprise will realize this and will appreciate and recognize great individuals when they see one. Takes an act of congress to get a promotion. I have gone past my expectations and over achieved my goals and still in the same place I started several years ago. Raises range from 1 - 3% supposably reflects cost of living increase. No such thing as merit based raised. I enjoyed my stay and doing what I did best. Little to no training. No career path. Loss of any previous aquired skill set due to lack of application. No training to maintaing an edge on latest software and applications. Processes are ridiculous here.....Politics lots of it. I guess that is everywhere you go.
good,Good company but bad management they put customer over employees. Good fellow employees which makes it a good place to work. Good equipment and you can make good money.
good,"Unlimited overtime, they run really lean manpower wise. Great Company to move up and over with. Supervisor and Manager were great to work for, and really helped accelerate  my career path. Fast paced, and sometimes hectic environment, but overall great place to work."
good,it was a great place to work i was hired through tpi but was let go after i was told i was going to be switched to a enterprise employee 2 weeks later i found out i was pregnant and the company let me go
good,"Good benefits and a good place to work depending on which department you work in. Some departments get rode hard and put up wet and some have a pretty easy go of it. I gained a lot of experience since I have been here, but now I am at a point where any advancement has been shot down at every turn."
good,"This company is a great fit for highly motivated, skilled, take charge individuals with brains, talent and the ability to multi-task.  However, the workload expectations placed on employees far outweigh realistic levels.  As such, it is inevitable that employee burnout is common.  The company employs some of the best people you will find anywhere; but corporate management is fixated on increasing shareholder return at the expense of their own employees' quality of life.  I would not recommend working here unless you are prepared to become completely overwhelmed by the workload and can deal with limited support.  There are much better options out there for people who value a work-life balance."
good,"Good place to start and get on your feet, training on the spot. Helps out employees. All around good place to work just away from family to much and missing out on home life."
good,"I learned a lot there and created new business and personal relationships. Got on the job training, lots of certifications, and training courses. Learned a new skill and multiple trade skills."
good,"Steering a boat 6 hours, cooked for crew ,then slept Challenges when going in and out of locks "
good,Fast-paced progressive company. Challenging with not a lot of opportunity for advancement. Very engineer education oriented so there is not much opportunity to advance based on work experience. Good highly experienced people to work with to make an enjoyable work environment. Typical big company politics.
good,"Everyday was a change"
good,"HR was very hands on with training, they made sure that you knew the programs and the work that was required in each unit."
good,"Gained a lot of experience in different departments of the company, and learned a lot. Always happy to go to work. Everyone was warm and friendly. Job security was not really there at the time, but if management and everyone loves you then they will do everything they can to find a place for you in the company. This was my experience."
good,Highly dynamic and collaborative work environment. Plenty of opportunities to learn from talented and and experienced individuals. Work/life balance varies depending on group/department.
good,"Lots of work and overtime"
good,"This is a really good company to work for. There is a a lot of job security; for administrative assistants there is a lot of movement with management. Never consistent - pay it decent although I believe it could be better. Working hours are long and the benefit of having the opportunity to leave at 12:30 Friday isn't really a benefit when you usually have to work later. Position is hourly, prefer salary."
good,"Enterprise is a great place to work. It challenges their employees to be better. I learned a lot about budgets, DOT and environmental regulations. The people are a pleasure to work with and recommend Enterprise. The hardest part about the job is finding the balance between work life and personal life. I really enjoyed working with the people at Enterprise."
good,"great work experience, learned alot about the company and how hard each person works to keep it thriving. They were able to be flexable with my hours and were always kind and considerate."
good,"Asst. Chief Inspector for 155 mile portion of the Front Range Pipeline, which is designed to provide takeaway capacity for growing production of natural gas liquids in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of northeast Colorado. Experience includes; Compressor, Power and PRS stations, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan for Battery Tanks installations and maintenance. Additional responsibilities consisted of pipe alignment, spacing, preheating, coating, right-of-way clearing and grubbing, lowering, in/tie-in crew including sandblasting, coating, clean-up crew, dig ups and caliper pig anomalies."
good,"Great place for those who are self starters, High turnover of workers although the Management is good to work for,"
good,"Not very much opportunity for advancement, where i was stationed to work. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"good place to work, good benefits, good pay, good people. Lots of overtime, not alot of offtime. workplace is relaxed and people are calm. good equipment."
good,"Excellent location to work as it was close to home"
good,"I am happy at EPCO. I've had ample advancement opportunity, my managers are great people. Safety culture is great. Compensation is great, but a bit low comparatively in the area."
good,The company has a great benefits package with very competitive pay. Management is hard to work with and the job can be very stressful for no reason. Lower level staff isn't always treated fairly.
good,Constant friction between supervisors and personnel. Changes within the department that don't benefit anyone. Within the past two years there have been at least 10 people that have either been fired (1) and the rest of them have left because of being singled out by management.
good,"Enterprise Products is a fast growing company, good management, co-worker were great we worked as a team. The most enjoyable part was developing groups to work together as teams to accomplish daily scheduling goals."
good,"Enterprise products has been a great place of employment working with the PM's,   Work has been plentiful up to the barrel prices dropping,   Most of the work I have been doing has been with well ties and new pipelines being built."
good,"At any given point in time I am asked from all aspects of the company; (i.e. Commercial, Accounting, Engineering, Field Operations, Distribution, and Legal) to solve ""the crisis of the moment"" This usually requires my department to coordinate all aspects of the activity, and to provide the technical support required to accomplish this; Finally report out to Executive Management on the outcome. I would say that this is both the most difficult and most rewarding aspect of the job. Difficult because of the high volume and high exposure associated with the role, but the ability to see the entire company and work across departments not very often in my working career have I every had the complete understanding of a company from the valve to the financials"
good,Great employee team work that accomplished goals and overcame challenges. The best teamwork I ever had the honor of working with.
good,"Good safe place to work, some overtime available, low stress environment, job security is good, company is growing at a fast rate, good 401k with profit sharing"
good,"Its a good company to be with.  Always trying to keep up with technology. When traveling they are not cheap, always the person is first and take security seriously"
good,"Enterprise is a very large company that seems to function quite well in spite of its size.  The assignments were quite varied, and it is possible to advance or move to other positions within the company, even if one was a contract employee (as I was)."
good,"enterprise products was a great place to work, it was a mail room position and it was located downtown Houston. So therefore the role of the mail clerk was fun everyday."
good,"busy workplace, good work enviroment. Different accounting software. Output of vouchers entered in system. Being a team player."
good,"I enjoyed working here, there just wasn't any work available.  The contract that they had was fulfilled and they haven't been able to pick up any more at the present time."
good,"A good job..dispatcher assigns loads go out to lease pick up oil..easy job..average 550 miles a day, two loads a day..uniforms and boots provided..descent insurance..cheap for the whole family.."
good,Great company with hardworking people. Learned a great deal. Great work/life balance too. 9 hour days on Monday through Thursday and half -day Friday.
good,"Manage all commercial aspects of a gas gathering and NGL processing facility:  Negotiate gas gathering and NGL processing contracts; Manage customer relationships, gas, and NGL settlements; identify new gas supply sources, spearhead/sponsor capital growth projects; manage pipeline interconnects and well-ties.  Coordinate commercial activity with field engineering, operations, gas control, gas scheduling, legal, and gas marketing stakeholders."
good,Management really cares for there employees and goes out of there way to make sure every employee is taken care of. They want to see you succeed.
good,Atmosphere was great the job was easy work learned alot in that year to be a pipeline operator worked well with others in handling oil samples an tickets worked on scada as well
good,"A typical day or DayShift may sometimes require jobs that consist of new equipment for the plant, monitoring screens, making sure evverything is running as it should.  Night Shift its usually or most of time easy as long as you stay up and catch things before something happens. I learned a lot about the process of gas to liquid & liquid to gas as well as normal pressures, normal temperatures, exchangers, towers, certain tanks and what they consist of, filter changes when a filter tank plugs up, cleaning field pipes or ""piging"" and getting the plant ready for the liquids that come in, hazards to look for when and if a situation occurs, daily rounds of plant.  My co-workers are good group of guys although 2 need to be more reliable.  The hardest part of my job besides the ongoing learning involved is the living location it is very hard on your days off to enjoy yourself when you live in a small town and everything is 45 minutes to hour or 2 hours away. The most enjoyable part of my job is the company which them being family oriented makes it a lot easier to enjoy and be there and let you leave when and if a family situation occurs."
good,My point of contact has been very open and receptive to comments.
good,Profession atmosphere
good,"Job security even in a down market, management is attentive but does not micro manage. Good benefits including greater than industry average paid time off. Good work like balance and flexible schedule."
good,"This would be a great job except for the guy you are with everyday.  Job is easy, but your coworker makes it difficult. Some travel involved, company pays all expenses."
good,Excellent company to work for. Provides excellent job work/life balance. Management excellent in providing mentorship and teamwork in the departments provides an excellent work atmosphere.
good,"Overall Enterprise is a phenomenal company, I unfortunately just had horrible management.  I know many others that were quite happy with their managers.  I loved working for Enterprise, just wish my management was better.  I highly recommend anyone, to work for Enterprise Products."
good,"Great Learning Environment for seasnoned and new employees in the NGL, Oil and gas business.  Many options for experience in a variety of job categories."
good,"job position very demanding, job responsibilities very important to the company day to day 24/7 operations.  so many technologies as a communications technician to learn and always have to stay on top of all issues to ensure the reliability of systems and the data that is gathering. management and co workers are very helpful and can always count on support. Management understands and will do their best to be there. Very rewarding job."
good,"Must have Ged or high school diploma to work there, I guess you need to check your dispatchers thoroughly, they're not being completely honest with the company..."
good,"was a good company to work for. Great people,  great benefits, always had something in the works to motivate employees. I recommend working at Enterprise."
good,"Started in March 2011. It was great the employees are wonderful men to work for. They have wonderful knowledge to learn from. Working with these men was very special. I was told from May 2011 up to December 2011 that I was going to be hired. Because management then thought I was great for the T4 Permit desk. In January 2012 a new director came in and said my papers were still waiting for signature. But in May 2012 the new director decided to toss my papers and to combine my desk with another desk and then he hired someone else. Because he needs a better speaker who can set up meetings, lead meetings, and train. There is a better job for me somewhere else and I am ready for it."
good,they have great pay but the paper work is out of this wold to do a 5 minute job it took five sheets of paper work. then if you had to do a little changing of the work you had five more pages to fill out they thought that the paper work was more important than the job
good,"Work closely with my Measurement Specialist on resolving loss/gain as well as quality issues with crude oil."
good,For me it was tough I wasn’t used to being away from home and it finally got to me. If you can manage to do that then go ahead this would be a great job for you.
good,"Enterprise is a large company with many different areas of operation.  "
good,They took me in green to their line of work and taught me everything I know and I am very grateful for that. They helped me earn all my certifications showed me the ins and outs of the industry and I plan to take my learnings elsewhere and expand my knowledge.
good,Nice work place to be at. Supportive management makes me more efficient at work. Able to have break anytime. Can work overtime as need arises.
good,Work was hard and hours long in West Texas. Dangerous traffic. Pay was great and co workers helpful. Mechanics were supportive and equipment was fairly well maintained. Slight lack of organization in the office but not a big deal. Had to leave due to personal issues or I’d still be there
good,"I was a field supervisor in hobbs, and overall ....i loved my job. The terminal manager  and area managers were laid back, and let you do your thing, without much micro managment. They were really   cool and would back the field supervisors in most situations. there were a few cons to the job though....be prepared to work long hours....way past 40. this is a salary position but be prepared to work 55-60 hours a week. also be prepared to be on the phone constantly...most drivers act like children and will call you at all hours of the night. their way of thinking is if theyre up and working,,,so should you be. it can be stressfull and challenging at times. and lastly, if even one supervisor out of the team doesnt pull their weight...say their never at work or get preferential treat...it makes it exponentially harder for the rest of the team to do their jobs. now for the pros: you get a compqny truck to take home, the pay is good, and the benefits are wonderful....despite the cons. i highly reccomend this job."
good,"this is a pretty good job the benefits are great and the pay is ok too, but the advancement to other career fields isn't so good locally, you'd almost have to relocate with company to another state or city for a change in occupation with the company. your primary job location may be 25- 55 miles away from home. I work a seven on and seven off rotating days and night shift between off days"
good,I enjoyed my tenure with Enterprise Products. I was new to the oil and gas industry and a number of work colleagues took time to mentor me. Their insight was beneficial to my development and allowed me to be very efficient in my assigned job tasks.
good,"I hauled Hydrogen Peroxide to paper mills, chemical distributors, chemical plants.  Good equipment! Home weekends, time off for medical appointments,"
good,"Good work environment  and good benefits "
good,"Worked on a 152 mile pipeline on Texas express pipeline #2, was a safe place to work."
good,Enjoyed working there.  Had lots of flexibility and great benefits.  They sold all their California assets and laid off the California team.   We were given the opportunity to move to Houston.
good,"I worked at South Rail Terminal for 3 years, and depending on the day, our shift (days or nights) could be working the full 12 hours, or simply do nothing but monitor the unit every hour. I learned more at this job than I've ever learned anywhere else. Management was back and forth on their ability to take action on suggestions, and supervisor turnover was higher than expected. The hardest part of the job was the demanding physical work expected of you. But they are extremely safety oriented and your health is the most important factor above all. Loved the friendly approach that everyone had to each other, and most of the operators did their job."
good,Enterprise is a great company but very competitive. Be prepared to work long hours in challenging situations. Best effort at all times is a must. Be prepared to travel as required and training is continuous.
good,Its a good job with good benefits. The only negative is that the work is on a rotating shift between days and nights. It pays well and the people are friendly.
good,Although the job was redundant the company took very good care of us.
good,Great company with a lot of locations and opportunities for advancement and the culture is good.
good,"Work day consisted mainly of daily data gathering and analysis to build supply and demand forecasts. Customer interaction to gather data for forecasting purposes, ensure contract execution and issue resolution."
good,Should of been workin here a long time ago instead of water haulin good place to work for and big company.
good,Great place to work. Gave required training and additional training as needed. Safety conscious company. Good pay and benefits. Friendly environment. Great people.
good,"Days can be long if you don't like the job, bad part of the job,day can be long any way, a typical day starts about 4 am and ends about 4 pm, all you have to do is drive from loading point to unloading station, if you do your job by the book , nobody will bother you."
good,Great place to work. Human Resources can be inflexible at times. Many of the bosses refuse to make tough decisions and allow their subordinates to take heat rather than on them.
good,I would love to work at Enterprise but live in Texas. The opportunity hasn't presented itself for me to relocate so I am shopping around. I will stay with EPROD until I find a job worth moving for.
good,I have been with Enterprise for 9 years.  It has been a one of the most educational and enlightening experiences of my life.  I have learned so much from some of the best mentors in this field.
good,"I loved working at Enterprise. The pay was very competitive, the benefits were great, and the culture was good. As an operator, the days can be long and the work can be hard, but that is how it is at any company."
good,"Great management, benefits, and co-workers offset the relatively low pay. I've enjoyed both positions and managers that I've had with the company and am glad to be a part of Enterprise."
good,My time at Enterprise was very fulfilling and educational.  I learned alot and definitely added to my admin skills.  I am seeking employment in something similar.
good,They gave me an opportunity with no experience in oil and gas. They invested time in training me and made you to always give feedback. I learned a lot at enterprise and will be forever grateful for that opportunity.
good,Excellent place to work. Great place to learn about Midstream Oil & Gas. I would recommend that anyone who is looking for an entry level position into the oil and gas industry to try Enterprise Products Land Department.
good,"A typical work day is very quiet. Great environment to work in. Management is by far the best. Very helpful, thoughtful and always encouraging you to succeed. Nothing really hard about the job unless you have trouble meeting deadlines. Their is enough work to keep you busy through out the day which makes the day go by quick."
good,"My typical day was a lot of Administrative/ Clerical work as well as  payroll, processing invoices, greeting customers, assisting Management & employees at our facility as well as other locations.. I'm a reliable employee that can work with others as well as alone.  Management traveled a lot and expected us to get our work completed without them standing over us.  Since getting laid off, my co-workers  have continued keeping in touch with me as friends. The hardest part of my job was being very cautious and careful when entering payroll.  Although I had to be cautious and careful while being responsible for payroll, I definitely enjoyed the payroll responsibilities, taking care of administrative responsibilities and communicating with all the employees/managers. "
good,Productive and good management.  able to progress in chosen field.  Value Diversity and Respect to all employees.  Would recommend this company.

good,Enterprise products is overall a great company to work at. Room for advancement and career growth. Happiness depends on your specific work location and problems within that location. Pay is standard with industry. Operations starting in mid $30 range with no experience. After passing COBRA test you will interview and hear back within two weeks. Onboarding process took a month to complete. A good place to stay long term.
good,"Enterprise Products is the best company I have ever work. As a pipeline Technician you get meet landowners, you get to work out on the right of way the work is steady great the learning never stops."
good,"A place where you have guidance, support and direction in terms of doing your job correctly. People acknowledge your hard work and everyone enjoys their time working there. You have the ability to interact with many others in your department and everyone is hard working though amiable and pleasant to speak with. I would, without a doubt, recommend this company to others."
good,"At Enterprise Products you are always busy and the work load is very versatile.  A typical day would start out with meetings and coffee  to coordinate the day.  The workplace culture embraced change, communication and collaboration with benefits and perks.  I enjoyed every department I worked in and mostly my coworkers who became your friends while enjoying picnics, bowling, mud races and much more."
good,"Helpful and knowledgeable colleagues. Setting is very professional. Manager of Help Desk is fantastic at his role, professional, considerate and quite respectable. Everything is communicated in this department. Gray areas are few and are addressed immediately. Customer satisfaction in this department is key."

good,"Great company to work for, good management, excellent benefits, top of the line pay scale for the Energy sector, only drawback is no bonus for hourly employees"
good,Good place to work if you are working with the company and not contract labor. Contract labor is the first to go if the economy takes a downturn. Good people to work for and with.
