bad,Long hours with little training for new hires.  One of the hardest parts of the job is trying to find the correct contact for information needed to complete your work.  
bad,"It's not the work but lack of training, you are expected to work as a if you are seasoned employee who has been there 20+ years without being provided with training. The gossip, the drama and fights are worse then being in elementary school. Small staff of 16- 20 at most. Extremely hard to take aday off even on your day off unless you are one that is part of the ""click"". Don't pre- announce anything if you want it to actually happen like a day off. HR is Florida ðŸ˜‚ No lunch breaks, eat at your desk"
bad,no room for advancement and only Hispanic males are in charge.  This company has no incentive to make you feel valued as and employee.  This is not a good company for upward growth.
bad,Company doesn't respect family the needs that come with it.
bad,"Chiquita is one of the world's leaders in commodity fruits and vegetables. Perishable foods commodity companies operate on extremely thin margins and a very fast paced business culture. Employees had to be nimble and work around change as it occurred on a daily basis. The company was rich with intelligent employees who supported each other, but manage struggled with transitioning the company from a once value added product to a commodity as consumer penetration became high and private label changed the segment. As the company has consolidated their corporate head quarters and transitioned to a new business model, they are positioned to regain significant market share, rebuild corporate culture and succeed in future endeavors."
