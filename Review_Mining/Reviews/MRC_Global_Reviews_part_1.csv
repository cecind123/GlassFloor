rating,review
bad,"They dont follow safety ..."
bad,The atmosphere was tense and hot no room for advancement at all tried many times to advance just to be cut short and never to be thought about again for a position in the company
bad,"In review I had a bad experience with this company due to the balance of work and home life not agreeing with one another, which in turn lead to a hard time to not only adapted but to excel."
bad,The management is terribly uncoordinated and out of touch with the people on the floor. They don't care about their employees if you get laid off don't expect to be called back when they need people again. No room to advance unless you're friends with management. No room to get a raise they will always tell you raises are improvement based and you haven't improved enough to deserve it. I worked there for 4 years and was laid off while on doctor ordered light duty because they decided I wasn't worth their time anymore I was cleared for work the next day. They treat you like scum of the earth for every incident instead of working with you to improve their process. Not worth your time or energy.
bad,"I worked for MRC for 5+ years in multiple roles, in that time never seen a raise/bonus, management is a joke, the overall morale of the employees has gone out the window, the regional and managers think buying pizza every so often makes up for their lack of being present on the floor, or their lack of listening to their employees problems/issues. Unless your friends with the management there will be no advancement in this place. DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME!! way better companies out there! Disappointed in myself for even staying as long as I did, hoping it would get better.. loved my coworkers but it doesn't make up for a bad work environment..."
bad,"Too much stress for low pay.  Went six years without a raise and then got 20 cents. We outperformed every warehouse in the US every year, but are being shut down so they can make up for spending a huge amount of money on new warehouses."
bad,"Worked at MRC for 6 years and when new management took over 4 years ago (2014) things went downhill fast. In the position in North East Alberta management made it nearly impossible to succeed and service clients the way they should be serviced."
bad,"Thought it would be a great change in my career. Found the company has improper training, lacks professionalism from management to coworkers, and poor work and life balance."
bad,Don't work here.  They are liars and run this place out of fear and threats.  You will never get higher than a 3 on any review and after 5 years there have been raises totaling only .83 cents.  Poor management from the bottom to the top....CEO Included!
bad,"Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. No work/life balance, very rare receive pay raises, expectation of long work hours with little gratitude from management. Don't expect advancement."
bad,"I was fired for taking time off for a funeral and oral surgery. I was treated poorly by my manager. He treated males better than females.  The training is bull and they get mad when you don’t do it the right way! Yet they don’t train you, they expect other employees to train you. Bull company with bull managers!"
bad,"HR and Management are not on the same page and turnover will continue until they decide to come together and support the employees, lot to learn from employees."
bad,"No home and work life balance. Supervisors have too much power and will often make racist jokes inside and outside of work amongst employees. No job security, and favoritism."
bad,No raise no hours young supervisor no respect company not loyal dont give a what about the warehouse workers treat the warehouse workers like dodo lies not a good company to work for at all unless u are in the front office I wouldn't recommend my dog to work there
bad,Thinking I had a great job. I took a pay cut so I could work remotely. After three weeks I was told I no longer have a job because it was off-shored. Apparently the documentation I was doing would take more than one person. Instead of hiring others and letting me work with them I was let go.
bad,"I worked at MRC for numerous years in many different roles. When they let go of the Regional Manager earlier this year and replaced him, this is when the domino effect started. The morale was absolutely atrocious and affected almost everyone. Many managers and quality employees left soon after. I cannot wait to leave"
bad,I worked here several years. This company is about who you know rather than how hard to you work. If you aren't buddies with someone in management you will never move up in this company. No raises unless you really fight for it. It's all about production which will never be good enough. Year's of wasted time.
bad,Just a bad experience all together hired to do one job ended up doing something else kept hearing as soon as contract is signed problem they have been saying that for over a year very disappointing
bad,"This company doesn’t care about the employees, they offer great benefits however dealing with the management is the worst. Was let go for taking time off for a funeral."
bad,"I loved the team atmosphere, until they allowed young inexperienced management to run the branch. Tore the team apart! They do not follow labour laws and try to intimidate you and threaten your job! If you chose to work for them you will be a number and another notch In Their ungrateful ways! No job security's the all!"
bad,"The company as a whole was good to work for.  However the local facility was poorly ran.  The manager showed extreme favoritism towards certain employees and looked down on everyone else.  Every request for additional job training was met with false promises or denials.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the warehouse/drivers.  The hardest part of the job was feeling like there was a target on my back everyday,"
bad,taken over by accountants and a loss of respect for all employees not on the executive board. Canadian operations are deemed as a anchor and not an important asset.
bad,"short staffed...no promotions,,,no rasies ...no overtime...no equal share work operations...no back harness...no bonuses..bad attitudes..no growth within"
bad,a million dollar company need more than 10 people to take care of its accounts. little to no training and you are expected to keep up with all the incoming monies
bad,"Upper management was always about the dollar and the advancement of ""special"" projects. Most recently was promoting a son through the steps of advancement so he could move on to the big title, in the process they managed to run off my Boss and myself. Did the company care? No. Lost well over 40 years combined sales experience and the Branch tanked..."
bad,Worked Monday through Friday eight to five. Was nice to have the weekends off every week. The manager had huge favorites and was hard to get past that sometimes. I did make a new great friend.
bad,I loved working there but new management came in and they were not trained in change management and made it an extremely negative work environment to be in.
bad,You will be over worked and underpaid. High turnover rate means more stress on you. Its an ok place to work if you want to be treated like a pawn instead of an employee.
bad,"This could be a great place to work but anyone who works there will quickly realize that the entire Canadian operation is run negatively by 2 people. These 2 are not open to original ideas from staff that aren't thier own. If you do speak up you are labeled and removed in the next round of layoffs. I worked there 2 years and in that time they had several rounds of layoffs and branch closures. The Canadian operation is so mismanaged that even 1 slow month they are not able to weather and will always cut staff. I saw no other cost cutting measures while there except cutting staff and closing branches. All while hiring sales people and giving them brand new trucks. I was an upper level manager and was not given any decision power, it all goes through the 2. Took 5 months to backfill a $20/hr person and then I had to hire them through a temp agency so some VP in the US didnt see a headcount increase. It's all about the bottom line at MRC. Another US company that is out of touch with its Canadian operation and market. Raises were barely cost of living if you got one at all. In the end they let me go just before raise time so they wouldn't have to give me one and then the next day advertised my position online. They will pay someone much less to do my same job.      STAY AWAY."
bad,Enjoyed meeting all the people that work there.  But now there is no job security in this town. The co. has a internal cafe to eat at resonably and lots of free parking on site . Beautiful view in the country of widelife and trees.
bad,MRC Global management cancelled everyone's yearly bonus cheques and Christmas parties after the FIRST year of officially purchasing Midfield Supply.  That same year the company became a publicly traded company which all revenue must be posted on their official site where it was discovered that the CEO of MRC had received a 5 million dollar bonus for a year that was supposedly not profitable.
bad,"Poorly ran, to many presidents, managers etc.  Not enough workers, priorities based towards greed. No appreciation for the hard work of the average worker."
bad,MRC is a good company to work for if there is wonderful management like there used to be before the realignment due to the oil market.
good,"Come in and print tickets for next days deliveries and pull product for those deliveries.  Lots of different types of nipples, valves, and connectors in natural gas."
good,"work 8-10 hours "
good,MRC is a highly rated global company offering a challenging environment with good benefits and opportunity to advance if you are willing to relocate.
good,very little training .  No loyalty to employees.  Nepotism.  .  Did feed employees well in meetings and outside safety meetings. Safe company
good,it was a stressful work place for me maybe because i was expecting more due to were i use to work before this place and i was also going through a lot in my personal life at that time.
good,"Management is somewhat fair."
good,The job was being able to operate a forklift and pick up a good amount of weight to get your sweat going the pay and work was fairly easy and simple the work employees and managers were just not my place to be involved.
good,I work hard and management keeps you from moving to different positions because they have their favorites. No raises in the last four years.
good,"I admitted to mgr. And supv. At interview I had medical issue, they said not to disclose, and had harassment at work from coworker, that set off my medical issue , while working with mgmnt. For my medical excuse they fired me and would not accept my medical time off, nor did they pay my wages to this date for my last 3days at MRC. And mgmnt. Still won't return my calls regarding my last employment check."
good,"Neither of my directors were into micro-management.  I had a job to do and they let me do it.  If I ever had questions or issues they were there to answer my questions or direct me, and if there were issues they had my back."
good,"The daily requirements are rarely the same, this add a nice level of flexibility and creativity as to what needs to be accomplished and local management leaves it to the warehouse to achieve the days goals. However, the Regional Manager was arrogant and self-centered thinking only his ideas were valuable. He quickly shot down good ideals only to present them weeks to months later as his ideals and force the implementation of them. Many of the people the Regional Manager hired had no experience in the business or industry and were given positions over more seasoned employee, which resulted in seasoned employees leaving the company. The annual turnover of employees exceeded 100 percent. The high turnover causes training issues and quality service issues."
good,"Oilfield supply store in Artesia, NM. Home everyday but the pay isnt that great. Good people besides management. Good for a stable job"
good,"Corporate seems to be cutting people left and right. Warehouse and drivers are overworked since they are understaffed."
good,some of my workmates were awesome people. i will miss them. sometimes you just need a change. i felt like it was time to move on.
good,It's a BIG CORPORATE LIE! They have training but it's not hands on. Your are left to sink or swim and hope that other around you know what they are doing so they can show you. Managers are not around too much. So if you need them you'll have to wait your turn.  Plenty of nepotism within the entire company.. the only thing good thing I can say is . I work well under stress so this job for me has been a great thing.. taught me who I can and can not trust... and really to push myself to learn as much as I can to show my kids the corporate world will eat you alive if you allow it. My Bill's are paid and I'm a home owner... BECAUSE I DO MY JOB
good,"Decent company to work for, just unfortunately, they are closing the location in which I work at.  Only a select few are going to be given the opportunity to relocate to another location.  Sadly, I haven't been with the company long enough."
good,"I enjoyed my beginning years of work. after that, I was overworked and the stress level built. Direct management was good. I got burnt out after 5 years into my last due to no life personally. worked weekends."
good,"Unless you're willing to relocate there's no room for growth. The moral under current management is very low and they would much rather hire from outside than to let employees excel in new positions. It does offer good benefits, not very good salary or raises."
good,"Start work at 6:00am- go to 5:30pm.  Expected to answer your phone at all times, even when you're on vacation.  Corporate management above store level is HUGE and cumbersome.  It becomes very ineffecient and not customer oriented."
good,"Great company with great benefits and the other employees were awesome to work with. The only problem was the branch manager of Odessa wasn’t ever trying to help people advance to higher positions because he didn’t want to have to find another person to fill their spot. He wasn’t very open and didn’t feel like a manger you could go to when you had questions or a problem. He would lash out at his employees due to the stress that was put on him by someone else. As for the regional side, they seemed to be treated with more respect by their managment"
good,MRC pushed its employees too hard to meet unrealistic expectations. Management was continually checking on progress of work rather than having confidence that employees would complete the task at hand.
good,"At MRC you don't get ""thanked"" for your contribution to the company and your roll, it's always wanting more with less guidance."
good,"Fast paced, high stress, long hours.  Big company.  Easy to get lost, hard to move forward.  Decent pay.  Good benefits.  Good people.  Still maintains a good 'ol boy mentality in more than few areas.  Employees can be distrustful and a tad paranoid of newcomers and hateful of those who move on.  It can be tough to feel accepted or appreciated at a big company like MRC.  Still, pretty good overall place to work."
good,"At one time MRC was an outstanding company that showed great loyalty and investment in it's employees.  However, after the current CEO came on board, people became the last priority of the company.  Now the environment is one of fear and ""find your corner and keep your head down"""
good,Typical inside industrial sales job.  More time spent working reports than actually selling / taking orders. The addition of a sales assistant would make this job 100% better and more productive
good,Great salary but your more of a number than a person. Managed from the US and seems they have no sense of business sense in the Canadian marketplace.
good,"quiet, effective, and work which brings out the best in people.  great learning experience during my tenure.  energy market downturn was difficult time for company which had many workforce reductions"
good,The people and environment was a good place to work in.  I enjoyed talking with customers and vendors.  It was a high paced high stress job at times.
good,MRC Global is an industry leader in MRO distribution. Opportunities across multiple branches in the United States and Global.
good,"Was never sure where you stood.  Prices were pretty much fixed"
good,"Nice people,busy atmosphere. Enjoyed the job for the most part. Would've liked to move to sales."
good,"There is no stability for employees."
good,"Fast paced environment, needs to fix work life balance issue, insurance will start first day employed, always busy, being on call is good money, but not fun"
good,the company is very good to work for but in the industry they are in you have to be willing to move if you want to stay with the company and or move up
good,MRC is fortune 500 company and I have been with MRC for more than 5 years. Happy working place and the management take care of employees. Enjoy working in MRC.
good,"Management is stressed and it trickles down from there.  Distribute daily, weekly and monthly reports; Perform efficient and accurate data entry using MRC Global specific software related to customer order processing, purchasing, receiving, inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable/invoice auditing, and miscellaneous office processes; Confirm accuracy of purchases with vendors, including shipping, billing and customer support, Learn new business processes and office procedures as required and serving as a resource to others; Establish rapport and provide prompt responses to internal and external customer requests using written correspondence, proper phone etiquette and other effective interpersonal skills; Maintain confidential information pertaining to normal supervisory duties, personnel issues and customer issues."
good,"Good company to work for, lots of overtime and room for advancement, laid back work environment, pay is decent as long as you increase your role in the company."
good,"Regular customer service day for oilfield work."
good,With the oil industry being down right now MRC is very short staffed. All raises and hiring have been on a freeze for a while now. No telling when business will pick up.
good,Low wages.. Good place to work. Laid back great balance between work and home life. Good benefits no complaint about those. Just pay is very very low.
good,I love the flexibility that this job has to offer but the lack of Managerial  strength at this company causes stress and strain amongst the employees.
good,There were many different tasks to be completed in one day. It is a very self taught environment where everyone is so busy there is very little time to train new employees or help grow existing ones.
good,A typical day is filled with stress of the ignorance of others around the company. Work at MRC is very stressful and not worth the little amount of money that you make to deal with it.
good,needs more employees per store management does not stay involved. way to much red tape from the corporate side you have to deal with. dont wont to hire more employees or give them raises.
good,"Excellent local management. very willing to listen and work with the staffs needs.  Co-workers  are great."
good,"It was a great opportunity to work with such a amazing group of people l, took on long hours and lots of new task also lots of training on the forklift"
good,Overall great group of people to work with.  Make sure we met our on-time delivery. Worked 8 to 5 Monday - Friday and could wear jeans on Friday's.
good,"nothing bad to say about MRC.  It is a good place to work, just don't feel like i'm compensated for the amount of work I do for this company.  They are a good stable company to work for."
good,"for as long as i've been there , you never know if you are gonna be laid off.  The management never care how their employees are doing, they never say great job , its very depressing."
good,"Day to day is okay. Overall, job security is the biggest issue. I don't enjoy wondering if this year's sales are going to be enough. Management is great for the most part, but there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,"Decent company to work for here in Tulsa, OK.  Presence in Tulsa is currently dwindling, and a lot of outsourcing is occurring to other states right now."
good,"All in all, a good place to work for.  Good team work."
good,"I liked working at MRC, the only downfall I really remember outside of us being under staffed in the warehouse was the changes they made limiting the inside salesmen from being able to negotiate pricing on quotes/bids to customers."
good,"A typical day at work was preparing quotes, taking quotes and turning to orders."
good,MRC Global is not a bad place to work. There are a variety of personalities but everyone generally treats each other with kindness and respect.
good,Prima bedrijf maar wel Amerikaans dus hard als het gaat om ontslaan van mensen tijdens mindere tijden.
good,The benefits are great.
good,Knowledgeable staff will meet your needs within a moments notice.  Dedicated to servicing the oil and gas industry with perfection. Staff is very orientated with the products provided.
good,"Good co-workers work good with one other,"
good,"MRC Global is great Organization! However, they are being effected by the price of oil. Management team was strong and invested in developing their team members."
good,"Great place to work! Your opinion matters. Very flexible with working times. Learned a lot in regards to pipes, valve and fitting."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced with lost of learning i've learned to make material reports on PVF parts,bill of ladings, and of lot of safety  tips its a very safe place to work good management i really enjoy working"
good,"A typical work day depends on the department in which you work, but it's a friendly environment, and always an opportunity to laugh.  My co-workers are great!  Happy, fun people with a great sense of humor.  The hardest part of the job is that you often have to train from a written SOP which can be difficult for those of us who learn better being shown and then doing it.  The most enjoyable part of it all is the way everyone bonds and works together."
good,"MRC is good."
good,Well it was pretty steady. Had to pull orders for shipping and in the afternoon I loaded trucks shipping out orders. I learned to work with all my co-workers and got along with all of them. They were a great group of people it is a shame they closed the warehouse.
good,From the time you started working there. The time I left I gained so much general knowledge in the industry that I had no idea it would project me to other job careers with the knowledge I gained.
good,Working at MRC Global was busy and had many challenges from day to day to meet deadlines. I learned how to manage my time better and build relationships with clients to make my job easier. The work environment and management was good. Doing team building events help moral in the company and it got the employees to maximize their productivity. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines. This meant working late and coming in early to meet bid deadlines. The best part of the job was my coworkers and the team mentality that developed in our inside sales group.
good,"I was new to the industry and this company took a chance on me.  The chance paid off for both of us.  I started out as a sales rep so I could learn the industry, but due to the oil boom that was taking place, I was fast tracked into the field and got to learn on the fly.  Management supported their employees and were always concerned about the safety of all employees.  I was promoted twice in less than a year and that came with more responsibilities and more salary.  The only thing about the job that I did not like was that there was very little time off and I wasn't able to use all of my vacation either of the years I was there.  Unfortunately they did not pay me for those missed vacation days."
good,"Busy, fast pace environment, good for time off in needed, paid vacations 401k medical dental benefits, must be able to work in many work conditions."
good,"A typical day started at the office at 7am speaking with teammates with focus on filling and delivering pvf material orders for our clients.  "
good,Overall it was an enjoyable job. Management would back you on new ideas and try to implement them into our daily job. Additional training was available if you were interested in improving your work and knowledge of new  products
good,Awesome people to work with. Very fast paced and use safety precautions in every sense. The people there are full of energy and eager to welcome new comers.
good,The atmosphere is at MRC is relaxed and worker friendly. Everyone is friendly and works in a cohesive fashion. The biggest complaint is that the pay is behind the times.
good,"I loved working at MRC, had great managers and staff.  Good group of people. When it was family owned it was a totally different company and it was so rewarding working for MRC.  Like most companies when they go public it just screws up the personal touch and appreciation of management."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. Learned many safety guidelines.Loved all my co-workers, I now consider them family. The hardest part of my job was driving from Scott to Searcy."
good,"Good company to work for, great atmosphere tried the very best to get the job done.  Learned a lot dealing with different suppliers and customers.  Hardest part of my job was learning the sales position."
good,"steady environment, knowledgeable staff, good people."
good,Enjoys working with MRC Global. MRC Global has been a great a experience for me. I have learned more working at MRC Global. As an employee of MRC Global I have advanced in ways like no other.
good,"With over 100 people working at MRC Global, there is a lot of different cultures that I work with.  I am very positive in my position and handle all situations with positivity."
good,"typical day includes coordinating freight, scheduling deliveries and sales calls to customers.Take telephone calls from customers procure items as needed and arrange shipment. Prepare quotes as needed.  Meet and exceed sales budgets.  Provide excellent customer service. Sometimes required to work evenings and weekends if there is a turnaround or emergency."
good,Lots of great people to work with. Definitely stressful which all jobs are going to be from time to time. I would definitely go back given the right job.
good,"Great group of people to work with. As long as you do your work( which everyone does) you should have no problems. The branch manager takes care of his workers, he understands when life sometimes gets in the way of work, ie: family matters, sickness, ect. Anyone there would give you a hand if needed with out hesitation."
good,I love what I do and they have been extremely good to me. Have learned numerous new skills and have been able to apply skills I already am knowledgeable in. Couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with...we have become a close knit family and look out for each other.
good,great company to work for which introduced me to multiple learning experiences and different positions within the oil and gas industry
good,"My day is very very busy from start to finish. Always plenty to do from small more personal tasks to large company deadlined tasks. "
good,"Monitor monthly reports for 13 branches, managed a multi-billion dollar credit account as a Department Specialist, made sure safety procedures were being followed, work with Accounts Payable and Receivable to distribute funds accordingly, assist in training local branch admins, helped branches with any questions they had with the MRC system, help with sales, organize paperwork and reports, pass vital information to upper management, correct customer required data, and talked with customers on what issues they might have, branch safety coordinator, and fixed the issues at branch levels."
good,"Worked for MRC for 5 years and thoroughly enjoyed working here and with the people I worked with! Great culture, work environment, travel opportunities and many perks!"
good,can be fast paced and stressful at times. Managers very helpful and listen to ideas and complaints.follows osha rules and has drills often. Offers classes in different areas to be promoted if willing
good,"excellent benefits, working environment.  only left because of downturn in business otherwise would still be there..  I have no additional comments"
good,It is a well established company to work for. The hardest part of the job is the lack of employees. Work culture and management are great with the amount of employees and work load they have.
good,"great place to but some days it will be a hand full paid vacation. harsh work environment and some people or out to get you and don't wont you to full your job duties. a lot of he said she said and blaming each other for mistakes instead of owning up to it.lots of lazy slackers  here who will try to con you into doing there work. good benefits,"
good,MRC Global is a pretty good place to work for. Just do your job and things are alright. They have a good benefits package for their full time employees with dental.
good,"Challenging, fast paced industry with many various positions to transfer into. Locations all over the nation and world, great opportunity for anyone looking to work in the energy industry."
good,"Good learning experience in this field of work. "
good,"Everyday seemed to be always fun, even tho we always had deadlines to meet with loading times, getting the ""right"" product to the customer the first time as returns are very costly."
good,"- great salary"
good,MRC Global can be very stressful but what job isn't. This is a wonderful company to work for. Unlimited training is provided. Their incentive program is very generous and rewarding. MRC is a fortune 500 company. The hardest part of the job is never having enough time in a day to finish your work. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that your job feels secure when you a great job. This company has been wonderful to work for and I'm so sad that I had to relocate.
good,Busy branch operations. Multi-tasking expected. Company and product knowledge important. Supporting team activity and awareness in customer expectations and delivery commitments critical to maintaining sales volume.
good,"great benefits, laid back workplace. management can be a little high strung but they me well. i really enjoyed work there most of the time"
good,"MRC Global is a Pipe Valve Fittings Distributor. They have branches in many states and other countries. They are one of the top distributors of PVF products in the industry. They are well structured, they have a clear vision and great customer service support system. They operate based on  QMS and safety based."
good,"I have worked for MRC Global for the past 5 years."
good,Great Company all around!! The work is easy in my opinion and if you are a team player advancement is very possible. The job can be physically demanding at times but all around is well worth the salary.
good,Productive and a great place to work. I couldn't ask for better co-workers. Management and supervisor were always available and were responsive to workers needs. I was able to gain a vast knowledge of industrial PVF and customer requirements for refinery operations. I highly recommend this company.
good,"Only downfall is the stability of the pipeline or lack there of.  MRC is pretty much the middle man between pipeline companies and the vendors. If the pipeline has a period of no projects lined up, then your job can be at risk.  There’s a 50/50 chance u could stay or you could go."
good,Great benefits when I worked there. Had an awesome cafeteria downstairs and even workout equipment and pool table upstairs free to use on your lunch or breaks. Very happy working there.
good,I worked for them for 26 years and they we're great to me.last year they closed up in michigan and we lost ower jobs.I they reopened a store in michigan i would be the first to apply.
good,My whole work experience was great. I learned so much about the Oil & Gas Industry in such a short time. My bosses and co-workers were great. Atmosphere is accepting yet competitive
good,"Good company to work,people are awesome,I learn a lot from this experience as my first job as a warehouse associate, i will highly recommend this company to my friends."
good,MRC was one of the best company's I have ever worked with the company as a whole took me right in and treated me like family  I loved the time I was blessed of have in with them at 185
good,"what can i say its the best place that i ever work in my life, its hard work and you need put a lot of attention in what are you doing or you cant hurt somebody or somebody can hurt you"
good,Well maintained fleet . Team environment . Coworkers are always willing to help. Management always has your back . Safety truly is number one at this company !
good,"i have learnt a lot of working experience with MRC"
good,Excellent organization to work for with all the bells and whistles with respect to benefits. This company does a great job of promoting from within as evident by the internal job opportunity postings.
good,"good company and great atmosphere to be apart of "
good,"Upper management was always open to be able to talk to , and always willing to help with any issues you had.   The team I was on was amazing, and we were very willing to help each other if we ever needed it, or if we were out of the office."
good,"Mrc was the best company i worked for, it offered a vast variety of things to do so wouldn't be just there waiting for something to do. It was a learning experience every day and you met new people every day you went out the field."
good,MRC Global is an amazing leader in the oil and energy servicing industry. The comppany afforded me 7 years of useful information and training that I can use in future endeavors. Had the company not closed the location I was working at I would still be working there.
good,"So much to learn, on the job training, self motivated training opportunities, networking, great coworkers, growth opportunities, quiet location, fun employee events."
good,every day was a hard day but work is hard learned a lot i worked with vary smart people great co-workers most enjoyable part is the end of the job when you can stand back and see all the good work you did
good,"At least learning to drive the equipments is a lot of fun and being a guys is always a pleasant experience.Than you have  the management that goes the extra mile to make sure that staffs/workers are happy,one can't ask for better employers than them."
