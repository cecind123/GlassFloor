rating,review
bad,Not a good place to work. Management is not professional. The whole business is not professional. Spend a entire year working your butt off just to get punched in the face by management. Not a good place to work.
bad,Only worked there for a very short period of time.  It was not what I expected at all.  I was put it in a different position each time I showed up for work.  This was not a good fit for me.
bad,Unprofessional environment with no security or respect for each other. No job security. Very flexible hours but bad manager relations. Practical environment.
bad,Supervisors will cuss you out and talk down to you. The turnover rate is at 43% for a good reason. The loaders and unloaders are the back bone of this company and are treated like garbage. Oh and the benefits are great if you're able to last long enough to get them.
bad,Working at ups as a part time supervisor is a joke the rest of the employees are union so no matter what you do your wrong. Upper management is out of touch with how the day to day operations of the wearhouse is run.
bad,"Do not work here. It is soul sucking. There is no full time hours, you are not appreciated or encouraged. There is little to no communication between management and staff. There is a vague job description that will have you subjected to duties outside of the necessary parameters. There are no benefits, no time off, no overtime."
bad,"I had worked there and recently got FIRED! I was a supervisor that missed a total of 2 days in the almost three years I worked there. The ""reason"" for my termination was that I got the FLU!!  Called off ONE day and the abuse, threats and out right bullying began from the higher ""ups"". S.D.!! Because I would not let them treat me like I was in a communist country, try to force triple time on me or telling me to walk out.  I did neither. I am not easily bullied or threatened which they relized and then told me I was fired.  (PLUS they are fighting my UNEMPLOYMENT!!!)  But on a different note,  the employees on my belt where very hard working and always put 100 percent towards their day because I appreciated them and showed them I did. If you are thinking of this place as a career choice or even a part-time job and you are a descent person---  Don't do it!! Cattle being lead to slaughter are treated more humane then the higher up supervisors treat you!!!"
bad,"I have not worked for this company for three years. I was there for almost twenty. I doubt anything has changed for the better since I left. Other than being a student to get your classes paid for, I wouldn't recommend this company unless you go into a union job."
bad,"If you work there thru agency you mean nothing to them. Especially if you are foreign. Not only management, even regular permanent employees will treat you like s***"
bad,Very unprofessional I suggest never to ship or work for them they are very poor at there jobs this is ups in Harrisburg PA. They do not care about your stuff or you as a person
bad,The employee MUST keep track of their own hours and rate of pay (it is common to get shorted on hours and have your rate of pay decrease if you don't pay attention). It takes over three months to even be considered to apply for benefits. The work environment is overall toxic and the days are feel very rushes. Find yourself lucky if you get a ten minute break!
bad,It's a fast paced environment but upper management will constantly belittle you and insult you. There is no room for growth. People with less experience tend to move up. Alot of favoritism within the upper management when it comes to putting someone over for a promotion.
bad,"You know a company is bad when people tell you you're better off leaving. UPS will work your fingers to the bone. Your best is not good enough. They expect too much too quickly, you won't be given enough time to learn the job functions. If you're not a superhuman, you're worthless to UPS."
bad,I do not recommend people working here if they seek a career advancement its not going to happen since majority  of these UPS STORES are franchise only.
bad,"If you like throwing boxes filled with peoples items you didn't pay for or leaving them out in the open for people to steal then this is the job for you.Poor management on all levels, poor wages ,poor work conditions and a poor attitude from all employees. i would never recommend working for them. specially in the kitchener location. management bullies, harasses, and fires people they simple don't like personally and will turn a blind eye to workers they know personally out side of work.they don't care about the quality of your package as long as its out of the building and on route be a specific time. one manager while i worked there hired his girlfriend and five of his buddy's, and wouldn't even look at a resume an employee would give for a friend for some reason. they will guilt you into donating to some fundraiser ever year which is the only reason they get so much cause they have your boss boss come through and give you a look and say "" will you be donating this year ? "" and if you say no your on the soon to be fired list. horrible place to work with the worst management one could hope for."
bad,Never got paid .i could not take my lunch  my boss was rude. I was always on time but my pay check was really short i did not see my self working there long
bad,The managers are stuck up and will fire anybody for no reason and will not let you have your job back no matter if you apologize they are very rude and non-sympathetic they dont care how long you have been working there you can and will still get fired. I was fired for no reason and couldnt even get my job back thanks to the pathetic jerk of a manager.
bad,"I worked there three months before they let me go and it wasn't what i was expecting"
bad,"No room for advancement, constant negativity, micromanaged.  UPS does not allow employees to advance unless you bring in a big deal. Once you do you are put into a position where you do not make commisison"
bad,I worked during peak was receiving 60 hours a week then they dropped me to absolutely zero hours my manager tells me to call in at 3am to see if they need me and it’s always a no I can not support my sled with this employer
bad,This company is an awful place to be they do not encourage you did not help you succeed they hire you and use you they do not give you enough work to make sure you make your 40 days of so-called trial. And then they use a lame excuse to fire people do not work for UPS
bad,The entire building is full of backstabbers and snitches not worth your time most of the management team are a**h***s who won't give you the time of day in less they're firing you or writing you up for something
bad,this company wants to work you to death and pay you very little for all the work you put in. They do not care about you having a family or things going on outside of the company.
bad,"As a 100+ yr old has a lot of upgrading and re-organizing, Technology, Procedures, Policies and within staffing specially higher & lower management, Also cleanliness.Employees work and stay working because of no choice of their own, disrespect have grown so unbelievably stressful between management and employees. Corporate only cares of the boxes/cartons that have to be delivered and possible  the rate of Insurance, uses misinformation & deceiving methods that no one or a few only knew what happens next. Gap between management of departments.Now I understand and know why a Union is needed. "
bad,people walking around doing nothing getting paid the same thing as people working hard loading multiple trucks very unorganized and understaffed they need better managers
bad,Wrong management.Management never treat us right.Very rude.Does matter what we did was always wrong.Newer cooperated with us.What we asked for something always make a excuses.
bad,"DO NOT do seasonal or any kind of work for that matter unless you are really in need of cash. they will act like theres a place for you, and lead you on and will not notify you with time that you are no longer needed."
bad,"Utilized the appropriate computer system to verify and update residents or guest request and activities  "
bad,"Poor place to work, horrific actually. Lied to from the start. Promised apples, given sprouts. Staff turnover is high. New drivers are given impossible runs, not knowing routes, or given adequate time to train. Even managing to plan your route on your own, which amounts to a modern day sweat mill, is a task in itself and that’s just the first part of a hellishly long day. Learn to be worked hard, cretin! And, no, we won’t accept any discontent, peasant. Management, gutless, unkind, clueless and flippant.  Sat navs are non existent, as they want you to use paper maps like it’s 19 freekin 87. And don’t reverse too much, because that’s a cardinal sin and only for the unfaithful and be clean shaven, proletarian, we own you. Be proud of the brown uniform, urm... the only brown at the end of the day is the auburn tinge of my once clean pants. Just say no!"
bad,"The place was a mean, never appreciated Circus show.  Horrible place to work for… The pay is terrible for the amount of work you do, and you get no appreciation at all for your hard work. The managers could care less about you. Horrible place to work."
bad,Not good people and they skimp checks so watch your hours they dont give you breaks sometimes and dont really treat you how people should be treated at sll
bad,"very unprofessional company, broke alot of labor laws, treated their employees very bad. this ups needs a good looking into especially there management"
bad,I left d2 se?ual  harassment  they moved me as if I was the problem but others were complaining as well. They didn’t give us a raise as promised. More like boot camp for the army the way they yell at you  stay away.
bad,"Although they were always making sure water was provided and they fed us at meetings with great food the work was a bit too tedious for me"
bad,I went in as a full time they change my status supposedly be to help me make more in the end I'm jobless now and they only look out for them selves like all corporate your only a number if it weren't for those who already are union it's not a good environment. Good pay but not worth the amount of expectations that are sometimes impossible to accomplish.
bad,"Bad communication skills , Bad pay for the amount of work you’re putting in. Only a 30 min lunch break for a 8-11 hour shift. Unorganized , no set schedule"
bad,"If your new then there gona try to fire u for the smallest things,always yelling at u like ur nothing,such disrespect they have and dont care management doesnt care about workers just about money,i got sick and i know i made my hours up and they cut my check i.n half and fired me for asking"
bad,"They over work everyone and underpay everybody. Constantly checks are being cut short on hours every week owing hours to employees. Over working everyone from 6 to 7 1/2 hours a day with no brakes at all. Constantly screaming and they have no appreciation for there employees hard work. And there is no such thing as acknowledgement, recognition or promotions.horrible manage.ent"
bad,"This place is cut throat and ran by Teamsters... Do the research on these #criminals . They will starve you out and waste your time, they will also forget your address for final check and or forget to hire you after initial paid training and leave you wondering wtf is going on. Run ...run fast"
bad,"Upper management = disrespectful and worthless. I can handle disrespect, but if your disrespectful in whatever you're doing and then go back on your word and completely contradict everything you've already said I find it extremely difficult to even kinda sorta take you serious. People who still load trucks understand the grind and when they speak they actually make some type of sense."
bad,There is absolutely no room for promotions in this industry(unless someone retires) . Employees are treated like livestock and if they are not vigilant their working hours are stolen. The only thing keeping the employees from being exploited even more is their union who knows that ups would pretty much prefer bankruptcy than to give their employees the benefits that they rightfully deserve. Ups is a dying dinosaur and amazon is about to make them a living fossil.
bad,"only work a few hours, its a certain amount of time to wait on a driver. only give certain helpers more hours than others."
bad,It’s was alright. You work hard and work little hours so your check is 100-200 if your lucky. Over worked and under paid. Unloaders train sorters which makes no sense. That’s why the sorters suck.
bad,"I would unload next day air packages, boxes from cans that came in off the airplanes. Placed them on a belt to be carried to its final home. "
bad,"Working families can not survive off of 3 hours per shift, basically if you're not a driver or administration it's not worth the time. "
bad,Unorganized and they didn't pay me correctly also the manager fave me a disconnected number to get paid for a day that i worked. Some of the drivers where lazy and rude
bad,"Working at the Huntsville location was pretty disappointing. The supervisors are rude, disorganized daily. Poor communication. My check was incorrect due to their error.  We worked 12 hour shifts and were only given one 10 mins break on the clock."
bad,"No training.  Thrown in and expected to keep up loading trucks. From time I started I never kept it a secret that at some point when it slowed down, that I needed to have foot surgery. Everyone I'm the office kept telling me to work it out with the sup, so I kept him informed. "
bad,"My check was due to me almost two weeks ago. Even after being denied three times in person and have several emails that have not been responded to, they have refused to pay me waiting time fees and still haven’t even gotten paid from work completed almost a month ago now! Also got hurt At work and was told not to work for a couple of days  which I was also not compensated for. Human Resources has been no help"
bad,Everyone at UPS is a brain dead moron and the pay is dumb. Should have been 16$hr for the amount of boxes of garbage that people order. My god. Avoid this job and get something else
bad,UPS never pays you correctly. Always trying to steal time off of your paycheck.  Uses time cards for attendance but not to log hours.  Overworked from the minute you get there while others “permanent hourlys” stand around and talk.  I was personally offered pay for my travel time to and from “they took that away after the first week”.  Supervisors are appointed merely weeks after being hired.  Horrible place to work.  Human Resources never helps with anything.
bad,"I have worked for 2 different owners at 2 different ups stores and both were terrible. I was treated very poorly and never seen such a disfunctional business. Owners are worried about the money before anything else. If your a favorite, you get away with everything. Working hard means nothing and people mean nothing. Everyone is replaceable but cant find people to fill positions. Never will work for ups store again"
bad,I took this job thinking I would get to work. I worked a total of 6 hours and wasnt given anymore opportunity to earn. Very disappointed in not being able to work more.
bad,"Horrible management, and culture, non progressive, pay, and time to work, no training, supervisor are basically teenagers and older managers are hateful and distant"
bad,They do not care about people the teamsers union sucks you pay your dues they donot take care of you wil not tell any one this is a good place to work
bad,"Worked one of their non union contracts for 10 years, traveling 320 to 360 miles every week. Awarded the contract to black Horse Carriers, I was not even considered for rehire. Cast away like a red headed step child. So much for dedication, one sided, from the employee, but not from the employer."
bad,Terrible job if you need to work. They ask if you can work then don’t schedule you. Only work 1-2 hours a day. Management takes days to respond to your messages. Drivers are very rude.
bad,they yell at you like you re children and in a slave ship... U Poor Slaves..... that is what UPS stands for.... Under Paid Servants...UPS.... they have no RESPECT
bad,"Was trained for one day and expected to be a master at the job. "
bad,"UPS is a horrible place to work if your a supervisor. Upper Management doesnt give a shiz about supervisors. If production isn't met, upper Management will make Supervisors life miserable."
bad,"Ups does not offer any benefits for 9 months, the management has a military type attitude. The job is very strenuous and stressful and they stand over you yelling, even if you’re a good performer. It was a nightmare and I think they need to change the way they treat their employees."
bad,"Find another job if you want extra money for the holiday in Athens ga . The helper coordinator is rude an don’t know how to do her job. They promise you your gonna work every day an you don’t. They can’t never find a route for people. But their steady hiring but yet you won’t get on no route. Then when you call they get a attitude. The whole company just need to be thrown away, just rude unclassy an trashy"
bad,"For the hard work the drivers and helpers have to indure, should be paid more than what they get. When I worked there I started with 10 an hour. Unacceptable! Helpers should start with 20_ 25 an HR, drivers 30-35 an hour."
bad,The management team was terrible no help and no respect for the employee they also have very poor raises they were very inconsiderate when it come to family issues
bad,UPS does not care for it's employee's or their well being. Hey work you to death with no break's. They expect you to be a robot and work till you drop. I was forced to work with laryngitis and they wanted to fire me for using the bathroom during peak.
bad,"Late checks "
bad,"I’m shocked.  I don’t know how this company functions.  There was no training, no phone number to call a manager, the scheduling app was never emailed, the truck is constantly disorder.  I was flat out lied to about hours given (told 6 hours daily 6 days a week...lucky to get 3-4 a couple days a week)."
bad,"I got a call the day of from a private number and couldn't call back or contact anyone to help me. So, manage call me from a private number and it was unfair that I didn't  get a chance to work or go to another area to work."
bad,"UPS was a great place to work and earn steady income. But I never got the feeling anyone there truly cared about the employee. This was my experience in their Overland Park, KS Human Resources Services Center. Good money. Bad experience."
bad,"Worse HR, supervisors, and management  ever! They over work employees at the Oakland International Airport. The union also sucks! The safety on the facility was the worse! Watch out for yourselves out there on Under-Paid Slaves!"
bad,Couldn’t handle managers abuse. Full time they don’t tell you is many years away.8hours of work has to be done in 5 hrs.no flexibility in shifts.the workers are a revolving door
bad,The benefits are the only reason to work here. The pay in the warehouse is horrible! We work very hard and people are not compensated for what we do. The only way to make money is to be a driver.
bad,"I was working as a seasonal,perminate employee,qell le me tell you I will never go back there again as long as I live,the supervisors in my area are no good, sorry excuse for so called woman,i hope they both with they kids and family end up in thr hospital with health problems, sorry sacks of human waste. Gone lie on me y'all need to close down"
bad,The management lies to you about everything. They care only for themselves. Never work here ever. Told would a come date for school but was not. Was unethically let go from company due to school.
bad,"Like it!! Would continue to work under new conditions, better pay, new way to communicate, equipment working properly, Load stands used properly and other people working as a team."
bad,"These lazy fat pigs need to be beat down where they live. Worthless deadbeats with zero skills,  the manager who works in the warehouse will not see years end."
bad,"The pay was ok at the time because I was a full time student, when I got injured away from work and my doctor told me to stay out of work a while longer to  heal. They said ok what they did say was that they were blacklisting me. I applied for a position a decade and a half later for the holidays I was told I cant work here and was never told why. None of my calls were returned."
bad,"They bad people  managers, ad supervisor not respect employees at all they do. Not appreciation  your job plus they are not good people  to work there plus union do not back you up."
bad,"Mostly filled with perverted Elderly men, and young people who OBVIOUSLY aren't used to having a Job. PERSONALLY I felt like as a company they need to work on their people skills. The Supervisors are very rude, and tend to take their positions to heart. This make it almost impossible to work in such conditions. So to avoid any further free whistle blowing I'll just leave with this. THEY SUCK!"
bad,"the work and hours is not bad however the job itself requires so much heavy lifting without any assist, managers don't care how long you work there. they wont let you switch positions inside unless they favour you"
bad,Basically everything about this place is bad I work here for about a month and a half they work you like dogs nobody helps anybody (especially management) all they do is yell and mess around belts get jammed constantly and most of the time people are just talking trash to each other (DO NOT WORK HERE) it isn’t worth the stress for 3.5 hour pay
bad,"the hardest work i ever had to do, management was horrible, supervisors where not helpful when it came to work tecnique, supervisors explained the duties differently so it was nt really clear how they wanted things done"
bad,UPS wasted my time. I go in to an office for an interview and orientation and told I was going to start monday for a seasonal driver helper. Havent heard anything and apparently I’m not available for rehire. Very unprofessional company and a waste of my time.
bad,"you will have just as many managers as you will have package handlers griping in your face every time you show up for work. I think for every package handler that shows up for work , there are at least that many mangers. When everyone is your boss, no one is.  If you like getting told you do not know how to do your job right on your first day of work, which can be done by anyone with a pulse, then hasseled, and tossed into 7 different trucks in 3 hours time, this is your place. Its run by teenagers."
bad,"Loading trailers for 2 weeks or so now. The pay is fine, but the hours just don't make this job worth it. I've been working maybe 3.5 hours a night. "
bad,"I hate this company. The employees are extremely uneducated and disrespectful to packages. My manager was very power hungry and tried on multiple occasions to get me in trouble with her boss. I felt overworked, unappreciated, underpaid,  and cheated."
bad,"Some of the actions of Management are not wise grudges are held, we get 15 minute breaks for working 5 or more hours throughout the day which is illegal, the work schedule is not what I was told was going to be they want us to come in whenever they so, not being prepared is something anybody who asks anybody at UPS knows that we don’t know what’s going to happen next it’s very sadactually."
bad,"They are too political at the place I worked."
bad,"Management is awful. I’m pretty sure ups pays for them to go through a course to make them this terrible. Two of the managers are for a FACT drug users, so the fact that the center is completely upside down shouldn’t be a surprise. Management has no idea what is going on, and they could care less. They get bonuses for your numbers. They aren’t friendly, they aren’t supportive, the management perverts a racist. Runnnnn from this job!"
bad,"UPS treats seasonal drivers like third world citizens.  Management does not communicate working hours to the drivers until the last minute, and sometimes sends seasonal drivers home, and overloads the regular drivers with too many packages."
bad,"They call you after 2 to 3 weeks later to talk about the job that I applied for and "
bad,"Too much stop/day, too big areas, on interview agreement £100/day but they paid only £90/day, very stressful job. The ""big boss"" is phlegmatic, the little bosses, good guys."
bad,Good job to work it work your muscle and also memory this job if like one of the best job I ever had I will love to retire there and continue my grandad tradition of driving trucks
bad,break your back in a few years less than minimum wage pay... 4 hour shifts some days send you home whenever they want. supervisors walking around doing nothing.. getting payed 5x what pre loaders make
bad,They gone work you to death don’t care about your wellbeing. If anything was to happen to you tomorrow they’ll replace you quick. They lie about the pay and the money sucks without the bonus that’s why I left.
bad,"You won't get hours, management wants  you to work hard so they can sit around. Expects you to get things done quickly, just so the union guys can sit around until it's time to leave."
bad,"6,000 people applied for the seasonal package handler jobs that were posted on the job boards for the lehigh valley area prior to black friday. This amount alone shows how bad the job market is for job seekers. When you have a corporate giant like UPS getting this many applicants the end result is forcing more work upon the existing employees because everyone is a dime a dozen. Use and abuse, then discard is the company theme. At UPS you have mangers doubling as package handlers because the tilted supply and demand for employees dictates that people will do anything for a paycheck, even a small one. I regret ever working here."
bad,"Worst company ever... I have a couple of more years and I am outta there...Cliques, and BAD management which they are strong on promoting instead of getting rid of.  Moral is low!  People think they have good benefits and the pay is good.  Only If you are a driver and are part of the union!"
bad,"As a package handler at ups you will be exposed to extreme safety hazards and risks that are not worth the potential life long injuries you will have. There is a don't ask don't tell policy if you get hurt, because once you report it as per actual policy you will reap the rewards with a termination phone call, because they can't man up and say it to your face. The building manager is a particularly viscous and hostile human being who would probably fit in perfectly in places like Guamtanamo Bay. In no other warehouse that I have worked in, have I seen the safety hazards that exist at UPS. It is not uncommon for dozens of boxes on conveyor belts to flip over the sides and fall 15 feet to the floor, with 70-100 people working nearby. It is not uncommon to see people climbing the chutes and walking on the belts to free box jams. Its is not uncommon to be dragged from a loading dock because a 53 foot trailer took off while you were in it, because there was no yard jockey available at the time."
bad,"I am not one to post negativity because it breeds more negativity but this place, this place is a joke. Young, undisciplined management who will raise awareness when a package is sent down the wrong conveyor belt but when it comes to pay day, they sit comfortably with their checks in their bank account but when your check isn't there they look down at you trying to explain ""payroll must have made a mistake"". Sad, most people count on a part time job like this during the holiday season and yet they'll push you and not pay you o  time"
bad,"managers are very rude. Ph get treated like garbage. No matter how fast you do, or how hard you work it is never enough and they let you know it. you will not clear $200 in a week, and the degrading atmosphere isnt worth it"
bad,I worked as a drivers assistant which  is and awful job position to work as. the driver i was assigned to was an a cool dude but i just wasn't able to keep up with his awful work style.
bad,The way they pay you is not cool its like a 100$ they hsve favorites they only you 4 hrs a day it take years to go up as a driver i didnt like it early mornings for the lil money the hard work i wouldnt tell nobody bout this job its not even good for a first time job person i just recommended noone to go there they have benefits but the pay will psy for the benefits an you just be worjing for free
bad,Ambiente stressante dopo 8 anni mi riusciva difficile recarmi al lavoro. Responsabili incompetenti e arroganti orari flessibili a loro piacimento.
bad,You are not getting paid to work out. You are literally a human forklift. UPS is modern day slavery. They should be in violation to every labor law known.  Do not fall victim to a toxic work environment for very low pay.  Love yourself enough to stand up and say no.
bad,"Gross incompetent personnel, unprofessional, unapologetic, and should be clerks at Macdonald's not HR reps at UPS.  Communications between UPS and potential employees either doesn't exist or is painstakingly slow.  Asked in interview as to when I could start, saying Mon., its Weds. and still haven't started work.  No calls, texts, or emails as to why.  All my personal information for payroll was provided and haven't started."
bad,"This job was physically demanding with not enough pay. They did not train the new hires very well and would only give everyone a 10 minute break for the entire 4am-10am workshift. The hire ups would yell at us and threaten to fire us if we didn't live up to their standard. If you wear that blue vest you will be treated like garbage and if you are lucky you will be sent with the employees who get the small carriers but if not you will get stuck in the ""Green Mile"" and load 5+ 18-wheelers by yourself. The worst part of this job was that the ""Green Mile"" was so unsafe that one of my past co-workers had gotten clipped on the belt and his clothes were torn. The floorboards had holes in them that while carrying heavy boxes you would have to carefully avoid falling and if it rained the managers only thought was to put some water adsorbing gravel material on the floor and hope for the best. The only good thing about this company was that if you made it to get hired past seasonal then you would get benefits and my co-workers made the job better as they were the only thing I was looking forward to seeing when I arrived. I can't remember how much they paid per hour but it was enough to buy presents for my family for the holiday. Good luck."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and do not even waste your time with UPS. I have never seen or heard of a more absurd place to work than this one. From the level of incompetence that started from the moment I was hired to the reprimand and firing for taking a 10 minute break , amidst thousands of back breaking packages I stacked in 2 hours time, all I have to say is this company enjoys the hoards of people lining up for work at their career fairs like  a Texas cattle call, only to fire people at the drop of a hat, right after starting. Show UPS the door and don't bother."
bad,Poor mangement but good hours and easy way to earn a living. Never a gain the application process is unsatisfactory and the virtual video lags all day and the managers can't keep uyour schedule right.
bad,"Horrible place to work.  The worst place I ever seen, did not know it was legal to do what they do!  They set you up to fall!  The person working there before I came did not like me and kept running to the manager saying I was doing my job wrong!  Management would give lots of hours to him even though he would come in 4 hours late and the manager would lie about that!  I was never late and I worked the whole time there and even helped out in other departments!  I did my job exactly as I was trained!"
bad,"Very greedy in for theirselves ! And a whole new level of Rude. Do not listen to your needs, no benefits at all and raises are hard to come by unless you bug them to death."
bad,"You will walk into a 20 degree truck and be doing the work of 6 people as boxes pile down the chute onto the rollers at a rate of 40-50 per minute. While you are trying to imitate hulk hogan to lift mostly 50-75  lbs boxes by yourself in a safety hazard environment, you will have multiple miss- sorts, which means the boxes you just scanned dont belong in your truck. Now you have to remove them, and put them back into the area that they belong .  As you trip and stumble your way over and around boxes that have flown, fallen and piled on the floor, you will have boxes that split open, with material spilling all over the floor. When you get to the point that your heart rate is 200 beats a minute and you are about to drop dead,  do not be surprised if you get scolded by an 18 year old nit wit supervisor who is wet behind the ears , short on information, with an ego the size of New York. . If this waste of time and physical hazard sounds good to you, then by all means sign up. Your workload is enough for a full 8 hours but because of the speed and lack of safety , you will be done in 3. There is no amount of money for this type of hostility and abuse. People leave faster than they can be hired, yet no one in management cares because there are always another 200 people filling out applications every week."
bad,I would rather work somewhere else. I do not prefer a warehouse environment. I prefer to work in an office environment. I have an office assistant certificate.
bad,"You will never get 20 hours a week at UPS, more like 10. Place is filled with workforce opportunity tax credit hires and affirmative action candidates. Some look like they've been homeless for a long time. They let the package handlers listen to music during the shift which is nice, but when you see your 20 year old boss jammin and doing the moonwalk on a 2nd story sorting platform, and another hiring manager actively suggesting other places of employment to apply to, one decides....yeah, no. Your paychecks will be shorted by 50% and the follow up required to get it fixed is a second job in itself. Not worth the long line at the hiring event."
bad,"One of those companies that started out on the wrong foot and will never be fixed, demand perfection, very military-like with orders, over worked, management has unrealistic expectations, and it all falls on the little guy, the list is endless. Like I said just DON'T."
bad,They garuntee people 4to5 hours but once you start the job they continually send you home early they have come there just for an hour of work.i need as many hours I could get
bad,"The truck was freezing cold and you have to jump on and off the truck about every five minutes for the entire shift. You don’t get a break. I was hungry, cold & dehydrated because drinking water would cause me to have to use the bathroom and the truck driver doesn’t like to stop-"
bad,"I would never recommend anyone black that lives in a small town to work here."
bad,bad experience rude managers mishandling of packages its so much I could speak on but this is just scratching the surface….I will not ever recommend this job to anyone looking for serious employment
bad,A lot of angry unhappy people seem to work there. Like a lot of companies like UPS hire and fire a lot of people. Thought the communication skills of the supervisor were poor; its hard to communicate with someone just talks down to you or looks at you like you are a number.
bad,"No breaks."
bad,"Immediate management are narrow minded narcissist, No performance review, treated as disposable pawns, work place environment resembles a kindergarten play yard."
bad,Warehouse just open up a month ago but yet its run by terrible managers and supervisors who does not know what they are doing!  Yet why are yall hiring people just to waste gas to only work 2 hours or less on the regular bases when the warehouse is apparently overstaffed yet they keep hiring more and more people who will later find out  that you are not going make any hours because they hired so much people in order to save labor hours for a multi billion dollar company. Their are no bonus of any kind in this location even though it was advertised to have bonuses. They also make you take a test before you even hit the floor because of OSHA regulations with Ups. First of their is a class about safety you have to take which is about 2-3 days before you hit the floor and start doing work. The safety class is useless and a bunch of unnecessary information you would not need because its common sense. Your also are forced to buy work shoes which they did not mention until day 1 because if you do not have it by day 2 they will kick you out of the warehouse to send you home which is ridiculous. The leadership preach so much about safety yet even though if you do take the safety precautions at your job seriously you will get yelled at because your are not going fast enough so you are going end up with a injury due to the fast pace. Management and the higher ups does this on purpose so they can save labor hours. Other than that you be lucky if you can make 3 or more at this location. Great co-workers!! Terrible leadership as of the moment.
bad,"The days will start with other employees doing less than what's expected of you. If you do a good job, they want you to do better, until you injure yourself. Then you will be blame for the injury and make you feel as you are lying. Management are hypocrites they preach safety comes first but its not true, production is always first. If your young and educated and looking for a decent, respectful and caring employment do not work for this company."
bad,They hire friends before within. Can't get to full-time only 1 person full-time and person been there for years so will forever be part time. It's people been there 7 years plus still awaiting to go full-time. Pay for clerks is 11 bucks. So below economy standards. Great for 2nd job but this can't be your only job trying to survive. Union sucks. Benefits sucks. Drivers are there only winners.  personally would never ship my freight because they damage to much. they uos
bad,I enjoyed working there but they haven’t given me any hours in quite a while. I oriented and worked a few more weeks. Then I woke up every morning at 4 am to ask what time to come in and they’d say there wasn’t enough work for me. They told me to stop Calling they’d call me when they got busier
bad,"The managers there other then the safety supervisor were horrible. The managers literally refer to the workers as ""bodies"". They will literally put you in situations where you can injure yourself. The disorganization is ridiculous as mangement is a bunch of young guys who never been a supervisor and will literally walk around all night aimlessly. The turnover rate from people quitting is based  on how the supervisors deal with employees. I would not recomend this for anyone who has an IQ  of over 5"
bad,This job at ups doesn't have to be hard but the management makes this job unbearable. Supervisors are chosen by if they were good workers not good leaders. Benefits are great! The pay and hours not so much. I been with the company 24 years and never offered a full time job. I cant even bring home $500 a week after spending half of my life here. Would not reccomend
bad,To hard for me and was having breathing problems. The employees was very rude and made me take the buckets with the mail to the caviar belt. Just was to tough for me.
bad,Management sucks terribly. They don't care about if you are sick or if your family or kids are sick either. They care more about management instead of their employees.
bad,There  is no way to address this in any other way than to explain it like this:  They are using the Job Center to get people to work there because they cannot attract anyone in otherwise.  If you go there to work you will be a temp that how it is.  From pay to company culture you will find yourself lacking
bad,"Management was ignorant and main manager a drunk with a serious lack of social skills. Customer counter employees were competitive and petty and a horrible work environment. HR was a butt kisser who went along with whatever management decided and they were also sycophants who couldn’t make decisions of their own, but rather deferred to whatever the main manager decided in his drunken stupor"
bad,As soon as you hit top pay they try everything to get you out of the door I've never work for a company that wants to fire all of their employees so bad.
bad,"THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO WORK!!!!! Please read before u apply to this awful company. The problems first stated when I got called in for an interview I went in to the HR office for my interview and wasn’t seen by anyone for an hour and 20 minutes. Someone, who happened to be the Director of HR, saw me waiting and gave me his number to assist me and told me someone would be calling me that day. No one ended up calling me so I decided to call the director. Again, he tried to help and couldn’t even get me a phone number to contact the HR office. What kind of director are you???? Then I finally got a number for HR and got in touch. The job went downhill from there. Terrible treatment, terrible pay, and terrible management were just some of the ongoing issues. I could have been applying to 30 other jobs that would have giving me the opportunity to at least get an interview while waiting for UPS. Worst place to work don’t ever work here"
bad,got injured at work and they did not help me get back to work they don't care about there workers. very loud place to work and very cold. rude management.
bad,"As i said they sent me a 4 expired checks which took $800 from my account i almost lost my apartment because of it they did not help me at all to try fix it so I quit, I could stongly advice against working there"
bad,Play favorite.....have there pets lies and more lies hours hit and miss cold as heck in winter hot as heck in the summer hard on your feet standing on concrete.
bad,"The work you like dogs, the work load is just too much. The pay is just too little to even keep you going, I could barely make $100 a week."
bad,"Would not recommend weak pay , no hours "
bad,I work for the ups in monrrow Georgia. Lack of Traning. Stressful work enviorment for little pay. No paid holiday's no benefits and no job advancement not a place to grow.
bad,I didnt like UPS they wasnt organized they mail always backed up and the drivers are very lazy especially during Christmas season i would never go back to UPS NEVERRRR
bad,"Don't do this if you don't like this type of work, being treated like a slave or have bad feet. me and one other guy had to load 3 trucks on a seasonal shift and it was swarming packages. People fling packages in trucks and to top it off you can't even stop to take a break to eat your lunch. in fact. there was no lunch. Just keep checking those lables on down time. Seasonal shift sucked. Its probably alright during normal hours but unless you are absolutely desperate don't do ups seasonal."
bad,Weighing trick on the scale each and every truck till the shift is over . Keeping records on every truck and reporting everything to the boss or manager at the end of the shift
bad,They have all of these driver positions listed at $18 to $21 an hour then get you to the interview only to tell you there are no driver positions available.  You will be in the warehouse. Very deceptive practices.
bad,"My direct manager was amazing. The problem was reporting to three to five more tiers of managers above the people actually aware of the local situation who spent their entire day looking for ways to justify their job. I spent literally two hours a day in phone calls explaining decisions and reasoning on the exact same topics topics we had just discussed less than 20 hours ago with the exact same people. UPS, in my eyes, is a ""last resort"" type of company."
bad,niet echt me werk wegens de druk van 7 uur smorgens tot 10 uur sávonds leek me toch wat veel
bad,They treat you  bad wasn’t good at training and give new ppl no time to learn the job even tho they are new at it me personally would love to stay but they make me wake up at 3am 4 times in a row to tell me they don’t need me and I have bills to pay and 10 hours a  week isn’t enough I’m a hard working and willing to work hard and learn new things
bad,The worst job I every had we used to be there at 3am and they worked us to death and when I found out I was pregnant they told me I couldn’t work there anymore like they basically fired me because I was pregnant remind you I was only 4-6 weeks so I was still early
bad,1st. The supervisor is a control freak for the night shift at Brampton warehouse. He thinks this is a military drill always talking about punctuality but not giving a care about your safety or breaks. 2nd Minimum wage and they try and force you to stay there past your schedule 5 hours if your new completely overworking you and burning you to the ground 6.5 hours at this garbage place will equal to a 13 hour shift.
bad,"Work life balance is the worst. Company is truing to change and get with the program but is very hard to penetrate old ways here. The pay is horrible seeing that hours expected do not get compensated if on salary, and the unexpected where they will put you next is not fair, they can transfer anyone up to 70 mile from home and if you refuse you can be fired."
bad,"The owner had to fill in for missing employees and he did NOT know how to do anything. Working with owner was hectic and extremely stressful. He always hovered as well. The pay was bad, and I got let go because I asked for a two days off in the month of may. Seriously? Never again. I would NOT recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Stressful environment, started off great but over the years things changed. I learned the oracle system all of the ends and outs. Worked a lot with excel and word."
bad,Did not work here long enough to give an honest review of it. I do not know if I would recommend it or not. The drivers were not the nicest to the temps.
bad,"I tried calling several times to resolve never receiving my paycheck and no one returned my calls or tried helping me with this problem, the job itself was extremely unsafe and definitely not worth what you’re paid"
bad,"I was hired with UPS on June 24th, 2019. In which i gave my 2 week notice at my other job. I was told i would be working 6-8 months constantly which at that point would bring me past peak season then would fall back to a cover driver and have to call in to see if I was needed. Well the week of Aug 10th I was finally sent to Massachusetts for training. So thats already 1 wasted month with no work, now we are at Oct 5th and I have only worked 6 days. Been called in 1 time and sent home with no pay because they called in too many people. So after my car insurance was cancelled and my phone was turned off I have decided that UPS is a joke and like a car dealership. They hire a hundred people all at part time. They do not work those people because if the worker doesnt get their 30 days in by Nov 11th then the worker has zero union protection. Which means comes January 15th they can be let go and since they havent worked you hardly then you cant claim unemployeement because you dont have the hours in. Overall im not sure unless you know a higher up how you make it in UPS. They have lied to me since day 1 starting with HR telling me I would work daily to the supervisors that tell you they want you to work but when you call they have nothing for you. On top of all this UPS will not let you have a 2nd job because they consider you on call from 7am-7pm and will fore you on the spot if they find out you do have another job. How they expect there employees to be able to pay bills and take care of a family is beyond me. They dont care about you as a person, your family or anything that happens"
bad,"Poor place to work at. Franchises owned so it’s not an actual UPS, instead it’s a third party retailer. Owner was not pleasant to work with. Low pay was another issue."
bad,Fire you the first chance they can. Let you go while in hospital without remorse or compassion for another human. Even after my termination i never received my papers.
bad,"Since part time management isn't represented with no union unlike the rest of the employees, prepare to work at a very toxic, dishonest workplace. There is no work-life balance, and they will keep you from moving up if they need to keep you for their operation."
bad,"I honestly hope I never have a job as bad as that one. My coworkers were rude, disrespectful, creepy, and all around selfish. The management was absolutely terrible."
bad,Not worth the stress no life of you own outside of work two faced management and team members if enrolled at a college your GPA will fall tremendously
bad,"AVOID AT ALL COST. ""Make some extra cash for the holidays.""  It is a SCAM. "
bad,"The time I worked here there was only 1 person who worked there for over a year excluding management. Turn over rate is extremely high and the hours are ridiculous for being a ""Part-Time"" employee. would never suggest working here unless you have no other choice for employment."
bad,"poor management "
bad,The culture is extremely toxic and the pay is low. There is a union but they don't take care of anything. The working conditions are horrid and extreme.
bad,"They suck & don’t give you no hours really & you already part time meaning u work 4 or 5 hours but they send u home only 2 hours into ur shift smdh... the team leader suck, the supervisors suck & trainers suck too"
bad,"This job will send you home early, they say you get paid 14 an hour but the paychecks be 100 and something, They send you home when they feel like it and they treat you like trash it sucks"
bad,Get picked up and start your work day for a couple of hours then get dropped back off that’s it and you do the same thing every day if they have work some times you might get two hours of work and that’s it the pay was little to nothing
bad,Every lead manager or higher up are all weird. They  Micro manage everything and there isn’t much to do. The managers just want something to say to feel empowered
bad,"The jobs states you work from 4am-9:30am and hours may vary a little depending on the load, however, I never started at 4. Most days started at 12 or 1am. Supervisors do not train well at all."
bad,this job sucked working on trucks all day. didn't like working there the management team was mean. they over worked you.the hardest part was that  they had no air and very hot. they did give out water some times and the people was cool that worked with you.
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked, clean warehouse, unorganized management, work days are streaky, great for temporary job, attire is anything with boots, if you’re not a supervisor or higher this job would break you. Pay isn’t worth it for loading. You can miss as many days as you want because they need ppl just make sure u call off. They need improvement on the structure of the job. It would be more soothing for employees."
bad,"I have nothing to say at the moment, don’t feel comfortable to reply. To what is being asked only because i feel if u have nothing good to say don’t say it at all"
bad,"I love to work im from Texas, social, punctual, full of life, but UPS was the worst job too much lifting, over50lbs injured twice.Lack of help always alone always stressed, impossible to advance unless sorry to say but not worth your body parts to diminish."
bad,Wasn’t very beginner friendly very fast pace your expected to understand how to work at the pace required as soon as possible but the pay is decent and it does come with benefits
bad,You work your butt off and get talked to like trash and get put down every day you do nothing right people would be not working and the supervisors would do nothing
bad,"A typical day at work was something that should be expected. I learned a lot but at the same time did not learn a lot. The management did manage, but in another sense, did not."
bad,Stay on your feet all day. move fast. stay focused. Finish all the work in front of you or you might be asked to go home if you are not moving fast enough to get everything finished
bad,A typical day at work for me will be in the back of a truck loading packages for 5 hours. I learned my manager did not care about me. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
bad,Deliver packages to customers at there addresses and ride around in a specified route with the doors open in all kinds of weather. Very physical job and a lot of heavy lifting and strain on limbs and back.
bad,"Hostile working environment, no air conditioners. No ventilation, fights would happen everyday and supervisors stole . Not honest. Liars about everything"
bad,Mgmt expected to work 7hrs but not pd for over 5.5 hrs day. Union emp against non union mgmt. Union gets away w/getting pd for slow work milking clock
bad,Need a whole new crew and management because some have people been there for a while they show a lot of disrespect. Instead of the drivers going to the bathroom they'll urinate in a bottle and throw it around the warehouse. Disgusting place.
bad,The policies in the UPS policy book are rarely followed. I spent a lifetime at UPS and was treated very wrong in my last few years by my management team and watched other long term dedicated employees receive the same treatment. Older employees are continually denied promotion opportunities and are required  to train younger less expensive employees to do the job.
bad,They have no moral for the people or customers they damaged all so many hoods and didn’t care long as we got packages out. Customer medicine would get stolen or busted company dint car peole TVs broke and the name of it was send to them
bad,"Modern day slavery is the best way to describe being a preloader in maspeth. The pay is a joke and they ask way too much of you. Also, most of their supervisors panic because of the workload and make it worse for the workers."
bad,"I worked my fingers to the bone there. I had to do several trailers by myself ,every single day for 9 months. If you're a hard worker they will use and abuse you. While they let less motivated and lazy people have the easier jobs. It was very frustrating being one of two people who actually worked in the unload. Management was terrible there very unprofessional and unorganized."
bad,"There are lot of packages coming down and you don't have enough time to catch up, so you have to literally throw the package by your car and load it later. Too much work for one person. They have you load multiple cars at once."
bad,"Hauling hazmat very flammable materials, long drive non union management doesn't care about the drivers unless there's a safety meeting or accidenta happen."
bad,Management is slowing running the office into the ground. Advancement opportunities are a joke. The place is a circus with no structure. Training is non-existent and all over the place.
bad,"Working for ups in the summer was a bad idea, it was extremely hot and unpleasant. Although I made a few friends I was unhappy with the job and quickly found a new place of employment."
bad,The hours were only part time and at the time I had a young son so the money and opportunity did not match for me to move forward. In order for me to take care of my responsibilities I had to move on.
bad,Conditions are horrible. Management is a real piece of work they can’t even do the job that they want you to do. It’s like being in boot camp being yelled and screamed at constantly
bad,"Management sucks, get maybe 3-4 hours a day with pay that isn’t comparable to the amount of work and bullhonkey  there is within the company, would never recommend this to anybody"
bad,"Roma Bandinelli UPS ,based in Ciampino, become what it is consuming the bodies and souls of people, not recognizing their minimum rights!it is not fair for a company so big and famous in the world to treat the poles of this company in this way!"
bad,"don’t do it to yourself. you deserve better. poor management. don’t care about employees or work conditions. destroys your will to live, you’ll regret it."
bad,"This  Company  is  Super  Rubbish"
bad,my and my gf at the time got hired there at the same time. i had to watch her fall in love with a guy she met there and and then i got fired. life sucks.
bad,"I gave that job everything I had. I worked as fast as I could, completely pushing myself to the limit, but I was still being yelled at to work faster. It was shocking how undervalued and disrespected I felt."
bad,I did not like working at Ups at all. They are a lot of work and stress for very little pay. The employees are good but the job isn’t worth the time and energy.
bad,"Understanding that this is not an office job, a general disrespect towards employees was had from most of management. Many complaints were ignored, management of staff was poor.  Working conditions included poor to no ventalation, limited breaks, unrealistic pacing."
bad,Don't Work here if you can't lift packages that are 70+ pounds. Not only are the packages heavy but they also want you to finish the trucks in a certain amount of time. I am no stranger to physical labor and I am able to lift 70 pounds without issues but constantly bending to lift packages with different weights will take a toll on your body. The best part of this job is the people you work and not for. The problem I had is the equipment we had was always breaking down and never getting fixed properly only rigged so we could never get the job done right.
bad,"It's a miserable place for miserable people. They try to bribe you with job security, however non existent the notion is when you don't have any real skills. But they don't care because the managers are trapped in it too. A lot of them also tend to spend inordinate amounts of time bragging about pseudo-achievments for this company as if anyone cares . It's pretty depressing."
bad,Management does not allow call outs even for emergency. Hurt on the job and seemed to careless. All they need is your body in the warehouse. They don’t care about health or accidental injuries. Never again.
bad,"100+ degree heat with immature, noisy and unprofessional employees who don’t help. Managers that constantly say you are never good enough. Constant threat of injury, physical and mental turmoil because they work you for long hours at a time. NO ONE can work 8 hours straight lifting heavy packages in 120 degree, dusty trucks. But they have their quota to keep and they don’t care if it kills you. Totalitarian mind set given their own devices. (If it weren’t for the union, employees would be screwed). Even with the union  - If the physical labor doesn’t bother you then the psychological treatment will kill your reason to live."
bad,I DO NOT recommend this job to anyone I was hospitalized for 2 months because of the foreign dust in the air. Also managers don’t care about you or anything else.
bad,Lack of leadership very hot and you only get one break the pay is not what it should be for the work they expect you to do very little to no training let to figure things out your self
bad,"Not well didn't like it. They didn't have a job for you, so sometimes they would send people home and it is most likely the new people. They were not good to work for."
bad,"Overall, UPS is a good company to work for, however, the location where I worked in Jonesboro, GA was the worst ever!  I have never worked for a more unorganized company before in my life of working!  They have the WORST management/supervisor's ever.  They are very unorganized, no communication whatsoever, very ""clickish"" is you will, very unprofessional, lack of knowledge on almost everything that you inquire about, very prejudice, overall, just ""NO GOOD!"""
bad,"Very High Stress and not worth the promotion to management. Don’t ever do it. "
bad,"It sucked. They lie. They are all about taking care of themselves,relatives and friends. Good money, but an ugly lifestyle. I’d rather be poor and happy."
bad,"never got to take real lunches or even breaks"
bad,I worked fiendishly for this company. I helped run black belt and ran it exceptionally. However they allowed my authority to be mocked. The Twilight supervisor was buddy buddy with the previous shift supervisor. She had viewable personal relationship with this person and allowed her to basically take over not only her shift but my shift. They would walk around for hours talking about things that weren't related to the business while she ran my shift and stepped on my toes and was extremely rude to me. I never was able to get the hours that I requested but she was. I always came in early and was basically scolded for show interest in my job. And then after there after I was told to come in early so scheduling is something of a mystery! The pay was decent but it only working under 30 hours a week it's still basically like you're you're making a high school salary but again their favorites can get the hours. After working extremely hard during peak season I'm magically got transferred over into a supposed permanent full-time position which was snatchd and  taken underneath me in an extra hostile and racist work environment off of 31st Avenue and Thomas and given to one of his favorite people. The atmosphere is trashy the culture is trash the supervisor use inappropriate language in curse words like it's the correct way to run a business not somewhere that you want to go unless you know somebody there that's going to promote you based on their your friendship.
bad,"I’ve been a supervisor at UPS for almost a year and it has been the worst year of my life. Constantly getting screamed at for things I have no control over, constantly getting screwed over and to top it off, some weeks you’ll be working for free. I’m only working at UPS for the college pay and I advise anyone to do the same. Very little room to advance to full time. It isn’t worth the pay or the benefits   The full time management staff doesn’t care about you or anything that’s going on in your life. They care about themselves only. It’s a very toxic environment that I would not wish on any of my enemies. From forging government safety documents to not paying the part time supervisors, I hope this company has what’s coming for them."
bad,I worked as a temp for Christmas and was treated very badly by the driver. I did all the deliveries and he sat in the truck playing on his phone. No matter how fast I went it wasn't fast enough for him. At the end of the day he would sit in Yankee candle parking lot playing on his phone till it was time to go back.
bad,"Not designed to provide a living with the hours they give you plus the pay is not worth it unless you're fresh out of high school....................."
bad,It's extremely fast pace and extremely hot and you get yelled at just for trying to get a drink of water and you jump from one truck to the next non stop
bad,UPS used to be a company that cared about its workers but the company has gradually turned into a slave ship. Management is beyond horrible. And the work is just too much effort to be complete in one day. Compensation starts low and all the benefits do not kick in for at least a year. My advice is seek something that will not destroy your work/life balance and bring you down physically and mentally.
bad,Might as well pick up some Mexicans at Home Depot UPS. My first day I worked 7 hours and had to ask for my 30 min break. When I asked about breaks and mention the law I could tell by the managers body language I was being a hassle. I called and asked HR about the situation. Came back from lunch and I was told that I called HR and was complaining halfway through my shift. This place is a joke they don’t give you the proper breaks. They just wanna bend you into what they want
bad,"The UPS Store. The job can be easy. There is no room for advancement. Pay is low and there are no benefits. Management is okay, not the best. The hours required leave you with no social life and no time to do ANYTHING outside of work. You can make more money at any other company literally. They only give you hours you want when they NEED you and change your schedule based on what they want. Pretend to care about your life or situations or needs at the job but never change anything. Culture is TERRIBLE."
bad,"There is nothing more demotivating than watching your co-workers do nothing while you have to pick up the slack. If ""you"" consider yourself an individual that likes to cry discrimination when asked to do your job, this is the job for you."
bad,I didn't like working for UPS very poor management and no proper lunch breaks the employees was rude to there co worker not a good experience for me I was not happy working for UPS
bad,"Short days with less than 20 hours a week. How do they expect you to live? "
bad,"The Teamsters Union is a mafia that steals checks from immigrants and treats their members like cattle. They take your money with a smile. "
bad,"Nothing is good about the company when I joined the company I had high thoughts for being such a big company..."
bad,"no training at all/throw to the wolves"
bad,"Terrible culture!! During my orientation, we were informed of a stabbing!!  There are police officers in that building every week !! My boss was telling me that I need to throw people under the bus!"
bad,"Horrible company to work for, disrespectful managers and supervisors. The Drivers are disrespectful and rude ti the loaders. Horrible, Horrible company and low pay. You definitely do not get paid what you deserve."
bad,This job was more of a everyday work out I didn’t make a lot of money the checks was very small I could make no living off them I was trying hard to become full time but after December there never sent me another schedule
bad,Worst place to work management is more worried about making the number then employees and packages. They undercut the operation causing packages and employees to suffer. Packages get destroyed due to them stacking up because people are sent home on a daily to make production. Employees are expected to keep up with loads that require two employees causing packages to fall all over the place. Not worth it for $250 a week after taxes.
bad,Sink or swim. Don't have any expectations as for training.  15 year old vhs tape that was way out of date offered me zero guidance. Don't expect for left hand accommodations either.
bad,Teamwork isnt in this company's vocabulary.  Very unprofessional work environment. If you are looking to waste some of your time then this is a great place to work. Dont recommend for future advancement.  Constantly was harrassment and intimidation at this work place they dont care about the drives drivers family.
bad,Poor management. Unstable work hours. Had a Monday - Friday schedule with a mandatory weekend day if needed. Problem was we never knew if we were working that Saturday until Friday afternoon. Never a 24 hour notice.
bad,"I worked as a preloader for one day at the Myrtle Beach location. I would not recommend this job to anyone regardless of their situation. They lie about the hours during the interview process, the management team just throws you onto the job with no training, and the physical demands are absolutely ridiculous. Do not apply for this job."
bad,A bad place to work management do not care about workers rights I would never work here again drivers are misused ware house workers have to sit in warehouse to have breaks no separate facillitys
bad,"The next thing I know is they told me one thing then they did another one , when I took the road test they said I did multiple mistake more then 13 witch I knew it was a lie I have driven in other company perfectly fine the best and in this company I did how many mistake it was a lie I know for a fact careful who gives u the road test this company it’s looming for people to work in other areas they try to confuse u"
bad,Ups is possibly the worst company to work for they use temp agencies. with inadequate candidates for all positions throughout they are non union and threaten employees jobs daily!
bad,Worked there from 11-3 am. The training was just sitting in the room and listing to them speak which didn't help a job that was 100% physical work. Had a bad kidney stone at the same time as I started working there they didn't care let me go.
bad,The benefits was the best thing about working for UPS. Besides that I wouldn’t recommend hard work for a low wage to anyone. UPS isn’t ideal life you want a career.
bad,"If you find something better take it. Pay is horrible, hours aren't great. Work is hard. They always change the start time and expect you to be on time & give write ups for those who are late. Very dangerous environment. Benefits only after a year of being with them."
bad,"Some of The UPS stores are franchises so you are under the rule of the owner. There is no job security, advancement or benefits. You’re never guaranteed hours And you get no real lunch breaks or any break for that matter. The money Is terrible especially considering it’s a small business you make a less than minimum-wage If it’s privately owned. You work extremely hard and it is very physical on your body.If you Work want to work for UPS work for the corporation not the franchise."
bad,There is absolutely no room for promotions in this industry(unless someone retires) . Employees are treated like livestock and if they are not vigilant their working hours are stolen. The only thing keeping the employees from being exploited even more is their union who knows that ups would pretty much prefer bankruptcy than to give their employees the benefits that they rightfully deserve. Ups is a dying dinosaur and amazon is about to make them a living fossil.
bad,I feel like UPS could be ran better and that the employees could be paid better.  I’m not saying  UPS is a bad company but it definitely needs to improve.
bad,It was diffidently a boys club. I worked at a UPS store which is individually owned but most of them are ran the same. They are in it for just money and do not care who they walk on to make a dollar.
bad,"al menos en Puerto Rico, el ambiente de trabajo es deficiente y la compania esta desorganizada. Cuando te entrevistan te dicen una cosa y cuando comienzas a trabajar es otra. La gerencia tiene mucho espacio para mejorar en cuanto a comunicacion entre ellos mismos y con los empleados se refiere."
bad,"It's always the union vs managers "
bad,"Physically demanding. The hours are short, and you only can work 4 hours at a time. When you do work a full 8 hour shift that is considered a double shift."
bad,"Good for those gym rats or work out freaks, but the way people talk to each other is disgusting. No common respect, and most people there lack common sense."
bad,Management doesnt work together as a collaborate unit. always understaffed. work place culture is negative. the most enjoyable thing to do there is leaving at the end of the day
bad,"I was there for the launch of the new building . What a nightmare.  How things were done changed daily, and no one would communicate that to the employees. I worked in a certain section and it seemed like every day our list of duties grew longer and longer, all the while, management would cut hours.  No one knew what was going on and there was a shocking lack of management. Employees would smoke outside of a door that was next to a bunch of bay doors so one section would smell of cigarette smoke.  The shift that ended before mine would leave massive messes from time to time.  The section of the building responsible for unloading the trucks would often unload everything that they needed to re-load and leave the volume that was destined for the section I worked in till the end.  That ensured their employees got to go home on time, but screwed the area where I worked. "
bad,Ups was the worst job i ever had there wasnt no guidance or ways to get help if u dont know how work something its a bad work place to much labor for less money
bad,"After working over 1 yr for UPS as a part timer no option to be full time but working 40 hrs a week for over 90 days. No vacation days and if sick for a day returning the next day with a doctor's note still given a work suspension with this being the first time missing a day of work after a year. I called in as instructed to report being sick. In the summer they ""go on strike"" and part timers get nothing...no compensation no work for 2-3 wks then called back to work like nothing happened. If they complain then you are told to find another job."
bad,"Typical hard labor that a machine should do, not a human being. Not to mention they treat you like dirt. They still owe me a check/pay and I doubt I’ll ever see it. They like to fight tooth and nail anything that goes against their norm, even corrections."
bad,Don’t work at UPS its an absolute terrible place to work. The union atmosphere is horrible and management compounds the problem. Just dont work for this company it will be the best decision you’ll ever make
bad,Worst of the worst next to walmart. No care for people and if you come in holiday season get ready to be treated as lower than a slave on the line. You complain about them not paying you on time they will threaten to fire you. The district managers will try to start fist fights when told not to belittle and cuss out supervisors.
bad,"This is a franchise owned shop. It all depends on the owner. UPS is a great company to work for but the owner calls the shots at the end of the day. Make sure you work for a professional, competent and sane owner who values your work."
bad,"A typical workday is not knowing what area you’re going to run with half the staff and no assistance but still held to all production forecasting. The managers do nothing but yell and belittle others with no accountability. What poor management and no investment in workforce or supervisors. "
bad,"12h de travail à tous les jours, trop de stop/colis, mauvaise condition de travail, luniforme brun qui n'est pas confortable et adapté au condition de travail, endroit de travail sale, management pourri. En gros si tu aimes passer 12h de travail sans pause ni même pouvoir t'arrêter pour souffler 2min parce qu'on va tengeuler d'avoir manqué des livraisons en levant des colis qui excédent le poids de 60lb qu'ils disent que tu ne dois pas lever, mais il te le foute dans le camion quand même hen et yen à pas qu'un, ah et en passant il remplisse les camions jusqu'au toit alors pour livrer chaque colis, tu vas chercher et chercher et chercher et vider et remettre en place..Ah et pour un maigre 16$/h pendant 4 ans avant d'avoir le fameux 30$/h,si tu te rends là, bonne chance"
bad,"If you don’t mind being bullied or cursed out by one of your supervisors,Humiliated in front of customers and other coworkers you will fit in great. Drivers and office staff are Miserable working for this company the gossip is terrible"
bad,"Working on the ramp using equipment to load airplanes can be a very fun and rewarding job, but the management is terrible and your coworkers are lazy young adults who just want to get paid while they sit on their butts doing nothing and the supervisors do nothing about it when you bring it to their attention. I can't tell you how many crew members that were rotated through my crew that would literally get a vehicle everyday to just sit in it and not help out the crew, making me and a few other hard working crew members pick up their slack. I am a veteran and I am accustomed to working hard, but I refuse to bust my butt when others are doing less than half the work I am and getting paid the same. I tried and tried and tried to get my supervisor to do something about only making certain crew members work and letting others sit around and was told ""my job is just to get these planes loaded and sent out on time, I'm not supposed to tell people to do their job you guys need to talk it out"" which obviously wasn't working. I put up with as long as I could before leaving to find other work, even though I really did enjoy the job itself."
bad,"Working at UPS was very fast pace, but no recognition by manager. No training and worst people I every work with in my entire life. The union environment is so bad that worker disrespect manager."
bad,"Ads says salary at $15-$16/hr but when you get there they will slap you with $11/hr. They will break your back with work and provide no gears, not even gloves or safety shoes. The only one thing good about the job are the people you work with until the supervisor will scold you because its late and she wants to go home and oh, you can't go home until everything's unloaded/loaded."
bad,"A typical day consisted of sorting and loading mail onto the trailer, lifting and carrying freight, and scanning & recording all freight. Washed package cars"
bad,"UPS under pay’s you and slaves during your employment with them. You only get a 10 minute break and the money you receive a week is just terrible, it is nothing to live on, you might as well get hired under them as a second job."
bad,"The UPS store was an absolute joke! The prices are so far inflamed that people literally would walk out the moment you told them. The work environment was always hostile because the manager had little person syndrome and liked to think she carried the load of work around the store. Just a FYI she didn’t do a dang thing! She would sit in her chair and look at things on the internet or read about what another store is doing that “she wouldn’t do..” like how about you get off your butt and help? The other coworker and I would be the rocks that held that place down, all while she needed to smoke every other 15 minutes and stank like cigarettes the ENTIRE day!"
bad,"overworked and underpaid poor management, no compassion, care or understanding. no team spirit combined with unhealthy competition, and favoritism towards male employees"
bad,"The work environment was crazy. The people that worked at the job was cool(well some of them). Overall, the job is stressful and underpaying. I would not recommend anyone to work at the UPS Hub."
bad,"I felt I was expected to know things they didn't teach.  When you asked a question, supervisor seemed upset. Took word of angry customer over mine, even when I had notes to show I did what I could for them before the line was cut. They said I hung up on this person. I've been in customer service for over 22 years at the time and I'd never hung up on anyone."
bad,"They never hire directly, you can work years for the agency and you will never get paid time off, sick or holiday pay. DEAD END JOB! They overwork people and try to cut hours whenever possible."
bad,"dont waste your time here... stay in school."
bad,"Management is not willing to help you succeed because I took the CDL box truck deliver test and I did well, but the management person failed me for no reason and remind you I have a CDL license so I know how to safety drive a BIG RIG!! I can definitely drive a SMALL BOX TRUCK."
bad,"Inept management. Employees forced to work in flooded work areas with electronics in the affected areas. Employees forced to work in areas that are filled with cigarette smoke. All the management are the biggest smokers so the provincial rules meant nothing to them. "
bad,I like that the time went by fast I didn’t like that we only got 4 hours a day the pay didn’t match the labor. We only got a 10 min lunch break and had to wait a while for the transportation they provided
bad,Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was poor supervision. Their supervisors was immature wasn't worried about the workers health. Wasn't clean enough and didn't pay enough.
bad,"I really liked it but they pay was only welve dollars which is not a lot for a family of six. I typically day is loading trailers. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people,"
bad,Job is stressful with poor management.  Drivers are forced to take blame for any mistakes made throughout work day.  All employees are not treated equally.
bad,I wish I would’ve listened to these reviews before applying.  Ups is extremely unfair and slave work.  They told me I was going to be supervisor for months because they wanted me to stay.  It’s all about seniority there I finally realized after 7 months that they were just bsing me.  I was a loader and they would have me finish one truck and just send me around the whole building helping other people.  I was sore every single morning I felt like I was a 60 year old man.  Don’t work here it’s a scam.
bad,"UPS hired people with FALSE jobs; told us that after peak season they'd move us up or to different buildings and pay would increase; but in actuality, they changed our shift from 1st to 3rd with NO warning, the pay DECREASED $5, our manager even quit and his replacements were HORRIBLE; some nights we had to stay HOURS LATER with no overtime pay. We didn't have the proper tools/loaders to get the job done efficiently. And they even began CONSTRUCTION while we were working in there!"
bad,This place was a joke poor management they want you to quit loading trailers south little help no type of consideration for staff everyone looks out for themselves management is a joke old retiress whohop just hate everyone
bad,"Don’t do it! Slave work at its best. Promises of advancement and more hours are nothing but lies. Management is the worst! I cannot stress that enough. They don’t care about the employees, breaks are pushed all the way until the end, if given any at all. I thought this was going to be an opportunity where hard work could pay off but I was only kidding myself. Honestly you’re better off working any retail/ customer service job that pays the current minimum,"
bad,does not care at all about their workers and if you work harder your granted more work and not respect from employers. it feels like your a slave till your back gives out and then they get a new one
bad,"Terrible"
bad,I was training a supervisor but was the lowest paid manager in the building. I was ran to the grown and set up to for failure because my team wasn't supposed to last in the company.
bad,"While I worked at UPS I felt like we were treated more as slaves than employees. We were told to do things in a not so nice way. We would get one 15 minute break after our first four hours then we had a half hour unpaid lunch then we'd get back from lunch around 1pm-1:30pm and we worked until anywhere from 5pm to 7pm and we wouldn't get a break. There were a few times where I had to tell them i was going to take a break."
bad,It was not a good job checks would be. Missing an not received on time bad management very unprofessional i would not never work there again the work is hard an the pay is low
bad,"unorganized place of employment"
bad,The work was fine when the supervisor wasn't breathing down my neck calling me profanities Non-Stop and harassing me. Management did nothing to stop this. UPS is one of those places you go if you've been in jail almost your whole life because you have no self-respect or respect for others and people's things. Because the people at the UPS Warehouse in Easton Pennsylvania were highly unqualified to work there. Save yourself the trouble and don't even apply.
bad,"super,visors are required to work more then 60 hours a week, the goals and standards the company sets are unobtainable, there is a poor working relationship between the teamsters union and managment"
bad,It’s an ok place to start as a job but you have to many people trying to be the boss and the management doesn’t do there job as required. It’s not organized and could do better.
bad,"As a package handler you work your butt off. You leave hurting every night. It's not worth it unless you drive for them. You would start in one spot and the supervisor would make you go somewhere else while your packages start backing up and dropping all over the floor. When somebody couldn't get into their spot to load/stack packages they would walk all over them... HENCE WHY YOUR STUFF IS BROKEN WHEN YOU GET IT DELIVERED. Getting bathroom breaks was impossible and you would make the supervisors mad when you took one and it was a hike to get to the bathrooms.You need to supply yourself with water and Gatorade for the whole time you are there. You get judged for the way you stack. Your taught one way then somebody else tells you to do it another way. They would change hours everyday. You are given a time to start everyday and its always different. Some days you start at 4, next day you will start at 2 and so on. Going home was always like pulling teeth. That was different every night too. Some times you go home at 7 or 8 or 9. Sometimes up until 2am on holidays. THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT AT ORIENTATION. The only thing I learned was that I understood why my stuff was broken when I got a delivery at home. You could see the foot prints all over packages. Management sucked. They didn't do much but watch you struggle. The hardest thing about the job was getting the nerve to go back the next day. There is nothing enjoyable about the job. It wasn't fun to go home in pain every night. KIDS USED TO GET HIGH IN THE PARKING LOT AFTER WORK FOR THE PAIN AND DRIVE HOME UNDER THE INFLUENCE!!!"
bad,I know this use to be a good company but it’s not what it use to be and the (bullying) coming from upper management is ridiculous. Human resource is not there for the people.
bad,"ups was a good place to work for the first five years. but after that the union would never help me with management concerns. very short breaks, no graditude from management,very little money for the type of work you are doing"
bad,"They have lots of safety issues. You can have no room to put packages and they dont care. Then, they fall all over floor. They claim there is room for advancement and then when someone asks, they're told they're in a hiring freeze."
bad,The warehouse is filthy and they don’t train properly how they want trucks loaded they wanted us to just throw packages in the trucks with no order so the drivers were mad at the loaders
bad,The hours are unpredictable and changes week by week with no warning. The management sucks its more or less like high school and there is no standards for anything. This is a very stressful place to work and it doesn't even pay the bills.
bad,I don’t reccomend this place to anyone. Ups is trash.  Its only part time. You only get hours if I have been there for years. It’s based on seniority. And those who have seniority abuse it.
bad,It's ok for some one that doesn't have a family to provide for but management sucks very unreasonable work condition short breaks some what understand safe working condition
bad,"My biggest pet peeve was that when we would work 6 hours we would only get one 15 minute break! That's it! the rest of the 5 hours and 45 minutes were spent slaving away, straining your self and trying to work as fast as the boxes were coming down. The supervisors and managers expected you to just be 100% everyday and give 100% everyday, which was not always possible especially after a previous busy shift. Over all it really sucked and was depressing. The only saving grace was that fellow coworkers were really cool and chill."
bad,"Due to lack of employees to do the menial tasks in the hub ie. load trucks, they will make you do the work of the preloaders which leaves no time to do safety training and supervisory work/paperwork.  Then they will bust you for neglecting to do your basic supervisory work.  Which you won't have time to do because you are busy loading trucks.  If you try to stay longer than your shift, in order to complete your paperwork or train the preloaders when they are completed loading their truck, UPS management won't allow it because of trying to stay within their budget.  Basically they don't want to pay you for extra hours that might be incurred while trying to do your own job, because it eats into management's bonuses.  Really, really, really cr&ppy place to work.  Also, look out UPS; because your processes are so antiquated, that Amazon is not going to use you any more, once their shipping/transportation services are set up.  I've given UPS a try twice and had to resign twice.  Not going to make that mistake a third time.  They place no value on humans whatsoever.  One of the supervisors even lost an arm in the machinery, because of the constant push to be on time loading trucks (lack of personnel) and not having a certified employee on site to do equipment maintenance."
bad,"My day would start out with my supervisor demanding me to go to a certain door.  They expected a 1000-1200 unload speed (20 boxes or less a minute), and whenever that speed was reached, the supervisors screamed for 2000.  Now I understand 20 boxes a minute isn't hard... if you're unloading laptops.  But when you have hardware to move to the side of the truck or 65 pound boxes to put on the belt, it takes more time.  I was yelled at and cussed at every night.  I was also harassed.  The hardest part of my job was the harassment.  The most enjoyable part of my job was walking to the time clock to punch out.  I recommend you do NOT work for UPS.  You are over worked and under paid!"
bad,someone has to body the shipping industry...but if at all possible dont waste your time here and use your brain to learn somwthing that will pay and be fullfilling and doesn't take advantage of the less fortunate so aptly...pay you just enough to come to work and do the ingragiating stressful labor dousing you with packages with little regard and culture is nothing to write home about...it's a complete waste of time if you don't desire to be a big corporate accountant or foreign linguistist but it provides a service for those not born rich seeking pt employment
bad,"Management only exists to cover there own butt, and yell at you. They scream safety but, violate multiple OSHA regulations every day. Unsafe place to work, I would not recommend this work environment to anyone."
bad,I had work there for 4 mouths.  They under pay all employees. They told you after 3 mouths you woll get bonus that was lie. I work in building in Brampton that warehouse was very very cold.  I got very sick. When you try to reach out to management or supervisors i got no reply.  I was better off working for McDonald's
bad,"For the short time I worked for UPS I was very unhappy I was always stressed out, even when I was on time and working hard I was being sent home because the supervisors enjoy favoritisms  towards their family members.  No matter how well I would do on loading the trucks or sorting the packages it was never enough for them and the supervising team is very rude"
bad,"Managers pick and chose who they want to train, there is no type of communication. regular employees train managers, Managers don't know how to talk to employees. Manager will take sides in employee conflict"
bad,Wouldn’t work here. Management is rude. They don’t know how to talk to there employees with respect. Very stressful work environment. Steer clear from here.
bad,This is a terrible place to work. You're treated like you're nothing but a slave and expected to work in awful conditions. I will never go back to UPS.
bad,"don't work hard here, they will just give you more and let the slackers slack. I showed up early and left late because when I finished a task, my manager would tell me one more task and you can go home, after that task he would say the same."
bad,"Management is horrible, doesn't about employees rights.  Treat you like a robot. Management yells and belittles employees making a unwelcoming unfriendly work environment."
bad,The management sucks! They work you like a slave and don’t want you to go home! If you come even 5 mins late you can’t work. They don’t tell u when there full so u waste time and gas coming to work when it’s overcapacity. They try to make you work 3rd and 1st which the make you do 1st shift mail. Lack of respect or appreciation for employees!
bad,"I really enjoyed my time here but it seemed to be very short. I started on January 25th at the White Flint (5268) location. My first day, I was told that I would get a schedule. Week by week, my manager took days away from me until I finally asked her “ When would I next be needed to work, to which she responds “ Sorry I don’t need any help now”. This morning, she posted an ad on indeed for a position at her location and it has been over four weeks since she last spoke to me. I don’t even know If I’m fired or not but the lack of communication is very disturbing. All in all, managers can be hit and miss."
bad,They will tell you about getting into driving and making more money but when you study these so called saftey questions they want you to know before they send you to driving school you will get not even half way threw reciting them then they will say you dont know your safety questions and then disqualify to go to driving school witch is the only resone why i took the job was to get into driving so long story short if you like bad abusive management lots of saftey issues on the job no advancement and sub standard pay this is the job for you ups under paid slaves ill add another one a broken and bout union owned by ups
bad,The work environment is nothing like the orientation videos. The supervisor only cares about numbers not the workers or your packages. They hire and fire people until they find a person that will work unsafe for minimum wage. It would rather your package be thrown an damaged for time quota than time taken to properly unload an load it. I got hurt and was treated like garbage then two days after I returned to work I got fired.
bad,"Entered into the company with high hopes of a company that is structured and well managed but found out very early on that the only thing that matters is working people as hard as they possibly can without the regard for anything else. During the holiday season we only got a 15 min break when working 8+ hours. Employees are always looking for reasons to file a grievance with the union for anything. I have never worked under a union contract but the system seems broken to me. Management doesn't appear to be very engaged with employees which in return employees do not trust their managers. The emphasis is only on production and production only, this facility has outgrown its location and really needs a bigger building which creates a whole other set of concerns. At the end of the day, it feels like the only thing that matter is the ole mighty dollar and ups is making plenty of them, too bad their employees aren't."
bad,The people that I work with where temporary position package car handler like me. The manger said they where going to  hire us that  worked in the bad part of the ware house. The working environment was great we it came to the people that were tems  4  main hire but the rest of them didn't care.  They promise us getting hire full time to make us work harder and to come in when ever they wanted us.Constantly  ask them if we where going to get the job they said they didn't know. Work in the cold pouring rain unsafe work area on unstable plate form that had the light plunged in water was getting all over it though I was going to get electrified. They said keep  working they are going to put in a work order in to fix the  the problem they never did  or care they got mad because of most of the people got sick and call out  i still came to work the next  day. The only way to get hired full time is to work as a tem if you kiss up even when the company  is not providing safe work environment . If you think they going to hire you working as a driver helper they will not they just won't.
bad,I honestly had a few fun times but afterawhile the cons way more than the pros ! Not having no paid sick leave let alone paid time off sucks. there is no 401k. work for corporate !
bad,"I'm honestly a chill guy who does what hes told and doesn't like to cause commotions, but this job was the one to break me. You have people who LITERALLY do nothing while i'm out here doing the hardest trailer in my PD. Don't get me started on supervisors and upper management. I've gotten 2-3 supervisors in the 6 months that i have worked here all have quit. Upper management is beyond clueless who like to spout ""safety"" but the whole loading trailer is beyond safe. I've been injured so many times but never said anything because the work requires some scratches here and there so i walked it off. I'm appalled at how these fools even got there position when all i see are people who do less work and get promoted versus people who do hard work then get stuck doing the hardest trailer. UPS execs need to investigate this place because I'm 100% sure they have broken so much rules."
bad,They over work you and not giving u the amount of time to give u on your breaks and they work u with low pay and it’s not worth hurting yourself for them
bad,"They pay tractor trailer driver's $18.75 hr once you go full time, you don't make any kind of competitive wages till you are full time for at least 3 years... No set schedule sit by your phone, and then when they do work you they micro manage you... For 18.75/ hr...... No thanks"
bad,"A typical day of work started with an unsustainable 2000 box loading minimum daily. Work hours were from 4 PM to 9 PM and provided little to no break time at all. We were overworked and, in my opinion, underpaid."
bad,No one knows what they're doing and the supervisors expect everyone else to do their jobs. UPS was one of the most awful experiences ibe ever had in a job. The only time it was plausible to work was when there was your friends there. If not the days were dreadful. The work environment was awful and hostile. Everyone was yelling at each other (supervisors) because they didnt know what they were doing. After a year they cut the amount of money they give you because you lose a bonus of $200 for showing up all 5 days. M-F. That money is double the amount I made while working every day. To think that you make 120 for working everyday but new people make near 500 a week.
bad,"-Poor/no training leads to accidents on the job that they blame you for (and wont let you get WSIB for)"
bad,"Worst company to work for , they only hiring delivery drivers for the holidays season once the peak season is over they will tell you that they don't have any job for you . so you have  wait until they got a space and you will never receive a call from them again. Impossible to get into the union because the time that they hire there's no way to makes it.  Believe me and do not work during the peak season if you are not in the union . The load is very very very heavy and they dont care about you the only think they care about is there package to be delivered . Also they dont appreciate all the hard work that you do because once they dont need you they will act like they dont know you ."
bad,Worse place that I have ever worked. I was written up for not coming to work the day my father died of cancer.  CACH facility needs more oversight. Terrible treatment of employees .Numerous employees died at that facility while working and it was hid from OSHA.
bad,"It's a slave factory, if you're lucky you can get over three hours a day but if you're not a senior worker you'll get looked over, they don't care if you work your butt off they don't appreciate anything you do, management changes more than the weather and instead of giving existing employees more hours they hire more people and then cut everyone's hours. Worse place I ever worked..no wonder why Amazon is taking over the industry !"
bad,just anotherday at rushing me to do my job. making sure you dont get your full hours that they promise. i cant stand this company like really.  never could get extra hours
bad,Very low pay and you get little hours every week checks usually be 250 a week on average they help there is very bad supervisor don’t help out all everybody at the job is very lazy
bad,I don't recommend the ups store. its a mcdonalds job in professional setting. I have nothing good to say. No benefits or flexible schedule. I don't recommend working for any franchise struggling for money.
bad,They will work you like a slave until you get hurt and avoid reporting it so they can save thier own behind They are baised even if you are the hardest worker they will choose the person they talk with to move up in the company and also do construction in the warhouse so be ready to work with ashes falling in your eyes and be ready to have breathing problems
bad,Just been outside in the winter is torture! The majority of workers and the management staff are whites and the descrimination level there is like a gas chamber!
bad,"I have worked at UPS for ever a year and I can say that it is one of the worst companies to work for. Hours are few, and we have been OWED money on a retro check we haven't received in months. Every day I work there they find some new way to save money and screw over the employees, it's going downhill don't apply and if your already working there get out if you can, before you mess up your back for these thieves."
bad,"Very little pay, for very large amount of work. Might as well save your back for a job that pays a lot more than this does. Managers are corrupt, supervisors are mean and they dont care if youre hurt."
bad,"This is a terrible position.  You are treated like total dirt.  Always fighting between management and union.  Always have grievances filed for doing work that union employees are too lazy to do.  Drive at UPS, do not go management, you will regret it"
bad,"My experience here is good to an extent. I am very organized, I am a people person, I am also a team player. I am the one who will do whatever it take to make our customers happy. I feel as if we all did the same this company/store will grow to its best."
bad,"Unappreciative supervisors, low pay and the hours weren't enough to provide living expenses for daily needs. The time working there was not pleasant at all."
bad,"we flew by the seat of our pants."
bad,"Every single word on the UPS jobs website is a lie."
bad,"Been with the company almost 20 years. It is all about who you know, who you hang out with, not about how hard you work for advancement. Believe it!!!"
bad,I can’t say it’s a bad place for getting back on your feet however. It’s not very safe. They cannot guarantee the little hours I was told at the orientation.
bad,The absolute worst company I have ever worked for in my life. Mean spirited management and culture. Among management personnel I never seen so much turnover in my life. Everyone is looking for a way to get out. It all comes down the legacy high school educated middle managers that are dishonest and use fear and intimidation as a form of compliance. The culture follows suite.
bad,Was a good place to work but was only part time and did like to work for UPS. The company of UPS is a great place to work for where the employees are all hard working.
bad,"a typical day at ups was busy, a lot of moving packages in the warehouse. it was very fast pace and long days.the most enjoyable part was the co owrkers"
bad,"Awful Patheic VERY SAD NO ETHICS WHATSOEVER....... UNBELIEVABLE  Profanity, Vulgarity Pushed shoved...No schedule come and go  told to go home there is no work........ABSOLUTELY THE WORST"
bad,"Ups doesn’t go over the work environment well enough during interview process, it’s more work and less employees and poor management. Only given one 10 minute break during 8 shifts"
bad,they lie to get you in the door. then once you are there everything changes. you quiet your job to find out your 1st week is to qualify for the job. if you don't qualify you don't have a job.
bad,"My experience at ups was not good. The job itself is not bad, but the pay is very low. The managers work u really hard for a 3 hour shift. It’s rare that we would even get a lunch break."
bad,"This was the worst franchise I have ever worked for, upper management was sloppy, never got paid on time, the hours were long, never had enough staff to cover shifts"
bad,the job is good but the supervisors could of done better communicating with the custommers as well as giving us directions.and I never received my last check.
bad,The equipment is outdated in all three centers I worked at so I know it is consistently this way.  The outdated equipment is dangerous and caused injuries.  They have a horrible HR department and they have a collection of sign off sheets and management loops to protect the company and uppers NCAAW anything unfair happens to base employees - gross dirty environment - one center Inworked in had maggots in the bathroom and trash was overflowing and never taken out and most people I worked with were drug addicts
bad,"My pay checks were always wrong, the teamsters are union so the pay is different,  I am still trying to get money that is owed to me. I worked 8+ hour shifts and was given 1 ten minute break during that time."
bad,The UPS store is very high paced company. Requires heavy lifting. This company never offered benefits. No room for advancement. This company was very high stressed coming down from owner.
bad,work hours are little to none 8 per week for almost 3 months for a full time driver position on call each day. little notice before start time if i had work or not. highly disappointed with how a big company handles new hires after being sent away to school
bad,"This company does not support employees. I experienced a hostile environment at work, harassment and discrimination. They don't provide any benefits and the hourly pay is low."
bad,"If you want to go to work everyday and look at some schmucks with unrealistic expectations who do NOTHING but tell you to do better. "
bad,"Limited training is provided, more to job than is described in summary, not as many training hours are provided as are needed to be successful as many different scenarios are present, no leadership or professional management skills are present"
bad,I was only there for seasonal back in the fall of 2016. I was put on the rehire list but the never called me back or I had to reapplied  I guess.  UPS is dirty and unhygienic.
bad,"LTL Diver doing pick ups and delivers."
bad,"No hands on training, rude “family” members. Snotty attitudes and fake attitudes for certain customers. Lazy. Forced to do actual work that I thought was required by all hired employees, but only for non family members. Nasty."
bad,"This place is horrible. Everyone tells their stories of working hard and success at UPS but it is honestly trash. My manager was intimidated by the fact that i submitted my resume to become a supervisor. There is a high school culture here. Drama, back talk all that is present here. I do not care how good the benefits may seem this place is a horrible place to work. Avoid it at all costs."
bad,While working at ups I worked my tail off everyday and the lay was completely horrible their excuse was “well at least out benefits are great” I found the job to be great but the environment was negative the managers didn’t want to work at ups I remember two of them telling me that the facility that they didn’t see themselves their much longer!
bad,UPS dont care about how hard you work if you a cute female you will get the job if your seasonal and a pretty women they will make sure you get your hrs.
bad,"After six awful months at UPS, I realized that I was being pushed to my limits for next to no benefit. After taxes and union fees you wind up being devastated for all your hard work and such little pay.  I'm a mother with three children and had pretty high expectations- because they talked such big talk, leading me to believe that hard work would pay off. I consider myself a hard worker. I definitely worked harder than the supervisors walking back and forth.  The overall experience was terrible. I would not recommend this job to anyone. For any reason. They jerked me around over raise and back pay for six months.  Took away incentive pay, which was the only reason I stayed as long as I did. Safety is a joke. Watching your superiors stare at you work, and work hard, nonstop. Watching other female workers get lighter work loads. Listening to co-workers complain.  This job is a joke."
bad,"job was expressed to be full time but it was not. hours were posted on a day bay day according to volume. I was unable to balance work and life and bills,"
bad,hard labor too much for a young person back pain is going to increase and you do not get paid a lot due to taxes being taken out and they take a lot out
bad,Just a job nothing more nothing less. would never work for ups again. to much stress put on the body for not enough money its not worth it to me so i wouldnt recommend it.
bad,"Omg! Stay away! Beware! You have been warned! They work you like dogs or cattle and they do not care! The lower management is a game of who's liked best and if they don't like you, you're out of luck! They work you to the bone and strip your soul. This place will drag you down to the very depths! Soul sucking evil pit!"
bad,I enjoy working there the people were very friendly the supervisors were very understandable and the hours were very flexiblehi and the people were very respectful it's just a job that I really enjoy doing and kept me busy and kept me motivated looking forward to coming to work every day
bad,Don't do it. This job will kill you and is only worth it if you need the benefits. You will go in and work harder then you ever did in your life for minimal pay. Its gross.
bad,"You are required to work there 5 days a week for at least 3 hours. This takes up a good chunk of every day and when is loading boxes in a hot trailer it feels longer. The work makes you angry especially when a manager comes in your trailer and say move fast. There you can cuss out your manger so it helps to vent a little. At the end of your shift your hot, tired and ready to get out of there but your manager won't let you leave because he wants to finish a few trailers so he can get a bonus. The pay sounds good but its no you work 5 days a week and take home under 200 bucks a week."
bad,Do not work for UPS. They do not care about their employees and only care about their customers when they have to. The management is only concerned with making their job/life easier.
bad,"They rush the training/safety for the first week of work.  Then throw you to the wolves the remainder of the time there.  Management was the worst.  Dollies would get stolen from the rental trucks, and they did not care or do anything about it."
bad,They mistreat those who are handicap and ask for accomodations. They will over work those who have different disabilities compared to those who don't have any and talk to them like they are stupid.
bad,"They preach safety constantly, then put you in situations where you are unsafe. When you report a safety concern you get put on their hit list."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Not great pay, poor working conditions, only positive is tuition reimbursement. The management team yelled at the workers and were very unprofessional. Just go to FedEx or Ford instead. Don't waste your time."
bad,"Not worth the $10.35 an hour. "
bad,"Stay in school, get an education otherwise this is your life. Getting paid is exhausting, they constantly loose my payroll check, getting the promised bonus is a struggle."
bad,The owner is very rude and does not appreciate nobody. The pay sucks! No benefits whatsoever! He overcharges everyone! You can be done helping a customer and he will come out of nowhere trying to charge the customer a lot more!! He is GREEDY!!
bad,"No appreciation or respect for loyal and long term, hard working employees "
bad,Boring predictable routine day-to-day. Loud office environment with lots of favoritism.  Learned that collections was not what I wanted to do.  Management  wasn't very reliable in the fact that there was no open-door policies.  The hardest part of the job was working on the phone 8 hours a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to go home at the end of the day.
bad,"UPS is great for full time management, drivers and part-time loaders, but for part-supervisors, just be ready to get raises followed by your hours cut. UPS will give you a raise and then cut your hours to make less than you made before."
bad,this place will hire everyone it is easy money and quick money as well but i dont not find this job resorcefull it is not work it working here but u can give it a try
bad,"This company is ideal for teenagers seeking their first job. If you haven't been there for years, you really don't stand a chance at earning a decent living wage."
bad,"Total joke, no hours and never know what's going on.  Don't waste your time. Make promises about hours and never fulfil them, sit around waiting for them to call, or show up and driver doesn't. I could go on for days."
bad,They forced me to resign .they dont pay you for your worth and time .they dont care about anything but their numbers. I worked few hours and was never given overtime
bad,"I worked as a full time season help but found out each morning I called in and never had hours to give and the management was beyond losin their titles and totally misunderstand how to operate and function as a team...pay checks lost, hours never there, drivers are getting used and never have proper help"
bad,I took the seasonal job. I figured it was the holidays and I could get some good money. Came in did the 2 hour orientation and before I could make it out of the parking lot they were calling to see if I could work that day. Unfortunately I had some matters to take care of from my last employer so I could get my last check and had to decline but I would ready to go the next morning. About 11:50am  the next day they called and asked if i could take a last minute route. I said sure met driver worked 5 hours and went home. Driver said someone would call me the next day for a route. We seemed to work well together and if there was a problem he didn't show it. Next day came and no call. I tried calling twice and no answer. That was Thursday. Saturday afternoon comes and she calls me and asks if I can work Monday. I tell her definitely. Monday comes and nothing. Wednesday afternoon narounc 3;30 she calls me to see if I can work right then. I was unable to since I was at a doctors appointment for my mom but I could the next day. She tells me ok I will call you 1st thing in the morning. Again no call. Three strikes you're out.
bad,I applied for a seasonal driver helper.  From the first day no one knew anything.  I had a problem with my hours on my check I call the center no one knows who to talk to about that they transfer you to hr you leave a message no one ever calls you back!?  I got my first check they deducted $74 for init fee don’t know what that is I never signed anything agreeing to this nor $47 deductible for  union fee wtf is that.  So after that my take home not even $14 was it worth it no!!! Don’t do it!!
bad,"Adverse behaviors vary from hub to hub, so be wise to do some research on your own before applying and accepting a part-time role at any specific hub location.  Some hubs strongly follow internal policy guidelines, others apply attention to policy only after instances of poor behavior occur - i.e. as a means of rubberstamping continuance with broad warnings against inappropriate behaviors of staff, supervisors, and sometimes managers as well.   If you are hired on as a permanent employee, be aware of all of the benefits and perks which apply to your employee level.   Don't take it for granted that your supervisor or manager will walk you through all of the right things: on day one, you should have safety training; you should have a badge; you should be given a document which clearly states all of the objectives which apply to your role; you should also know when your health benefits will kick in.  Eventually, especially in the cold weather months, you will need to visit a doctor when you are not on the job. Rationale:  most people get sick with colds, flu, or worse during this timeframe.  You will eventually get hit with a nasty little bug during the peak season, so be proactive in seeing your doctor for annual inoculation vaccines as soon as possible.  If you do get sick, you shouldn't lose out on pay, but if you do get sick, it is better to have a doctor's excuse or receipt for your visit depending on your manager's/supervisor's style of leadership.  Not all managers keep the employee's best interest at heart.   Some managers/supervisors do play favors, especially with other"
bad,"I have tried for 17 years to make things work at this company. It will never happen. The situation has continually become worse with each passing year. Management is heavy handed and doesn't listen to its employees. I have NEVER had even a cost of living pay increase in almost 18 years. They seem determined to make everyone's life miserable, while management soaks up extra stock and makes everyone work night and day and weekends. I was recently called back to work during my vacation due to bad management planning and ineptitude. I would never recommend that anyone take a job there."
bad,Longer you work there the the harder ups tries to get rid of you. Bad health insurance. No more pension. Mostly first shift jobs. Ups international has not had peak in the last six years.
bad,"Je n'ai pas travailler longtemps pour eu, mais c'es déjà trop. À chaque semaine, il me manque au moins 3 hrs de travail, car il se trompe sans arrêt. De plus, il ne paye pas le salaire conclut à l'entrevu (c'est environ 125$ de moins par semaine). Et la direction ne peux jamais rien faire... Compagnie à éviter."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"Dåligt ledarskap, HR i princip aldrig tillgänglig, arbetsrättsliga övertramp mm."
bad,I was promised to be paid one amount but when I noticed I was not being paid correctly they told me to talk to human resources. I kept trying to but it was never resolved so I left.
bad,"Honestly working at UPS was one of the worst jobs i ever had. It was unfair conditions , also the supervisors are not nice or professional at all. Worst working experience ."
bad,I would never work there again not a good environment to be at they work you as if you are slaves the pay is low for hard labor work. The manager only care for numbers and to get to there goal.
bad,Being a package handler requires one to work odd hours and be subjected to strenuous labor with hardly any compensation. Health insurance is available but will not start until you have been employed for at least a year. Very weak management structure and organization as well.
bad,"i was harassed by my manager and they did nothing about it and allowed it to continued and that same manager asked me out, i was warned by many employees that if you stand up for yourself they come down harder on you when you work and it continued and they kept trying to make it hard even when i tried to help some other departments that other employees did nothing and that was taken away from me cause i stood up, and so there good productivity is not there priority."
bad,I’ve learned how to sort packages management could’ve been better especially speaking to employees the hardest part was when they changed the procedures consistently everyday it was something new and they expected us to know right away without guidance.
bad,It's a ok place to work but you have to work 10 hour days during the holidays and the ins is not good. It's a good place to get billing exp and other exp.
bad,My Experience unfortunately was not a great one. I beleave I was targeted harassed and attacked based off of online cyber attacks. Every week my check was either missing hours or they would tell me they couldnt find it.
bad,"Told lies at the induction about wages. When it came to first wage £80 missing from account. The inadequate lying supervisors and HR woman told more lies to cover themselves."
bad,"Mostly unfriendly work environment, no growth opportunity. Non flexible work hours. Hostile behavior from managers. Low pay scale, no opportunity for moving ahead and learning. Very labour oriented company."
bad,I just completed the package handler training and my grandma died Dec 2017 right after and I didn't handle it well. You think UPS would show some compassion. Nope so when I did try to tried they said no because I had a negative rehire status. So I reapply this year Nov 2018 and explain my reason was valid. Nope still would not change it.
bad,The work is ok I love the job but the pay rate need to go up of the job and the work I love the people that work there they are very responsible and respectful
bad,Very hostile environment. Inconsistent hours. Over worked during the holidays . Managers were never satisfied even if you were doing a good job and they had their favorites.
bad,"There are no words to describe my disappointment with their efforts to try to find work near where you live. You are supposed to meet the UPS driver at a designated location and time. Sometimes, they want you to travel over 20 miles each way to meet a driver for as little as 4 hours worth of work. Dispatch is HORRIBLE."
bad,"I was excited to work for UPS, until I found out how high the turnover rate is.  They can not keep employees because the pay is extremely low and the work is back breaking. "
bad,"Worse place I've ever worked. You're treated like a slave. You can work 10 hours standing in you feet but get only a thirty minute lunch break. 10 minutes if that is waiting at the clock to punch out, another ten to get your food or find a seat by the time you sit down it's back to the cotton field!"
bad,This is not a job I would recommend to anyone. This job is only for people who wanna work for ups for a long period of time . In order to get good pay at this job you have to be there for over a year. The way u get promoted is through seniority meaning you can only get the job if someone else doesn’t.
bad,"The job requires just sitting all day. Not a positive environment to work for. The Managers start out really nice until you become an employer. It feels like they are more interested in getting people in the door, but after reaching that point your are never acknowledged for your hard work."
bad,"UPS posted a job for 25$ an hour, went to the job orientation and they said they paid 12$ an hour. That's less than half of what they claimed to pay in the posting.  What a waste of time."
bad,They laid a lot of people off without warning. The company didn’t accept the contract and now several families are without jobs during the holidays with no anticipated return date.
bad,"one of the worst experiences, rude staff rude management (alot of angry old people, probably mad at the company too) ,"
bad,"I never in my adult like worked for a company where the culture was one of playing favorites.  If your supervisor liked you and you were really good at kissing their feet you were allowed to get away with anything.  I never got my breaks, lunch was always cut short because the ""favorite"" always had a reason to leave when I was still on my lunch hour.  "
bad,"The shop in Victorville is run by High School dropouts (literally) the number one factor for your hire is if you know somebody there. They don't want anybody that is mature or has any college education. They do not tell you that they are going to take $400.00 from your check for their union. You must have a cell phone so they can SMS text you because you are on call all day and no matter what you are doing you must drop everything and go meet the driver.. When they call they expect you to jump in your car and meet the driver at some location of their choosing if you are one minute late the driver leaves and you will never be called again. Also, they will call you in for a few hours in the morning then send you home and call you back later that afternoon and give you a few more hours then maybe a few more hours at night. If you have a beard or any facial hair at all you will have to shave it off. If you have any tattoos at all that is not acceptable. They tell you what to wear, clothing with any logo or pictures etc. or shoes with a logo are not acceptable, no hoodies or baggy pants and no faded jeans. You will have to be dressed this way all day because you are on call. They encourage you to be the drivers best friend because if he likes you and you get some time with another driver and the other driver likes you then the drivers will fight each other to get you more time (if your a pretty young woman they will fight over you so they can try to date you). When I say that this place is like High School that is no exaggeration. Extremely dysfunctional environment."
bad,"UPS was the type of company that although I was a trainer for new employees, I was not compensated for the position, I had even created & updated UPS training module that is still in use today"
bad,They Do Not Offer Full - Time Employment And Not P)aid Enough For the cost of living. Only Recemonded For A College Student Or Someone Like That. Their Competition Pays More And Treats Employees They Way They Should Be Treated.
bad,"Nothing matters to this Company but production. They will push you and push you. No matter how well you do, they with just throw a higher production quota on you."
bad,"Very Poor Management, Favoritism, Poor Training, Unprofessional, THEY DO NOT CARE about there employees, They are all about NUMBERS not QUALITY, Unfair"
bad,As a loader you are asked to work too much for the level of pay you receive.  UPS does do a good amount of training to stave off work related injuries.  Work during the peak season is stressful and full time.  The only good thing about this kind of UPS job are the Union health benefits which are very good.
bad,I didn’t like working there. Not enough people . Also manager never keeps there word to nothing they say . To many trucks they want you to load by yours self. Not heat in the winter time so it will be freezing . It just was a bad experience.
bad,"There was no support from management (Owner)"
bad,"I took a position as a part time package handler due to the hours 430am-930am.  The recruiter repeatedly stated I would work 430-930am M-F, and these hours wouldn't change. The site HR manager also repeated this, that my hours would remain the same. The first day of orientation, the manager directing the group informed us we would need to start as early as 1am-2am and this would vary greatly. I informed the manager  of what I was told by the recruiter and HR manager. He told me this was incorrect, and the hours were not set. Three people left the orientation and quit.  This is the carrot on the stick to get the 200$ ""bonus"" for your attendance, you must jump through their hoops at demand."
bad,Don’t bother applying it’s not worth it. I wasted 7 years of my life there. The union and company are no better than amazon. Everyone at UPS deserves much more pay for all that manual labor we do...we get cheated out of money we rightfully deserve. And plus most companies pay you more when you work graveyard shift or twilight hours. Or any terrible schedule you work they pay you more even a few cents more Its better than nothing. So I’ve been working 7 years graveyard with nothing to gain. UPS and the teamsters purposely try everything to keep us people who are struggling at the bottom. It could be better but the teamsters made it clear no strike get back to work. Nobody cares about us people struggling in life. We don’t exist we don’t matter to them. Unfortunately the UPS acronym is true... Under Paid Slaves. It takes 10 to 12 years to go work full time here in southern California. Other states it takes less. So don’t sell your soul like I did. Billion dollar company and they don’t know how to treat their employees right. Corporate greed
bad,The superviosrs would be rude a lot people wouldn’t contribute to their duties I would be kept till pass 10 which is when I get off and wouldn’t go home until around 1 and this was everyday if not every other day. I was disrespected ok multiple occasions they were highly unorganized and the job didn’t pay well for the type of work we were doing.
bad,Worst place to work..  Supervisors are always on your back they call you a body.. Or just a number  That's what you are to them.  Very rude staff looks more like a prison than a company.very unorganized and poor management.
bad,Send you home real early if they feel they have no work. They will tell you that you will work your normal 9-5 and either send you home or keep your long without telling you
bad,"general mindless labor, loading trucks, unloading trucks, loading planes, unloading planes, pushy managers and working outside in the elements, was not fun"
bad,"Delivery Driver:"
bad,"Ups is great for if you are going to school. Ups is a fast pace learning environment. The company helps you grow. This company also, helps you realize people's potential's, and to see exactly what is that they are capable of."
bad,At UPS I felt like I worked twice as hard for what I was being paid. I also worked 6 days out of the week with no benefits. I often acted as the lead worker with no assistance and when the store was busy (especially during the holiday seasons) I was left with no help.
bad,Not a good place to work. People are very unfriendly. Poor pay with no benefits. Horrible management. The hours suck and so does this job. Would not recommend.
bad,"UPS was a good starter job, but does not pay well for part time employees. The amount of work expected for the little pay is unacceptable. Most people only work here fork the amazing health insurance the company provides."
bad,You deal with stifling heat in the summer and bone-chilling cold in the winter.    Employee retention is horrible so they have potential new hires walking through weekly.  Most people only work there for insurance that they used to make you work a year to get.
bad,"it started off beautifully, then we was schedule for a remodel and the store just went down hill. management is poor they dont care about their employees. we had mold in the store and the owner told us he wasnt paying for a air filter test. just a horrible experience"
bad,"The job was quick paste, unorganized, and some what stressful.  Even though  the work environment lacked certain professional  work ethics the employees were very helpful."
bad,"Jobsicherheit zero"
bad,"supervisors are young, do not know how to manage the people and know the operation of how the belts and shipping works. Supervisors cut down employees by talking ugly to them , they have no respect."
bad,"They will cheat a lot of people out of money. Let people clock in early and stay late, but the hours will not show up on a check. it was not the best place to be."
bad,"Out of all the jobs I've had this has probably been the worst due to the manager. There was an extreme lack of follow through, understanding and integrity from the manager. When trying to communicate frustrations with the manager and the owner no one took responsibility and the blame was always put back on the employees. There were multiple employees other then myself that had issues with the manager and owner but because I was the only one that was willing to speak up about these issues, I was ""let go"" due to ""personality conflicts"" between myself and the manager. "
bad,"When I worked for ups I was miserable. Got yelled at for trying to do my job. You dont get any breaks at all, you have to work in hot or cold temperatures there is no temperature control."
bad,"Don't buy in to the ""you get paid to work out"" BS you will over work your body here and be exhausted everyday and the pay ain't worth it. Poor working conditions bad air quality, you will get sick and if you call out you will be fired. You will go insane by the amount of boxes you move in one night. When I worked here some nights we didn't even get a break and when we did it was on an 6-8 hr shift with a one 10 min break. My experience was at the Windsor warehouse in CT, it might be different in other states. I pray you don't try to work here and if you do good luck."
bad,"The owner of my location is horrible. It was handed to him by his father; whom I heard was a excellent boss. He refuses to learn anything, but complains about Everything."
bad,Do not work there if you believe in respect should given to those who deserve respect. They only care about the amount of packages you help get in and out the building. No matter what it takes.
bad,"I did not enjoy the work here. it was long, hard and a lot of heavy lifting with no help from co worker or supervisors. i would not recommend anyone for this position."
bad,"as simple as I can make it, they sucked hard, never work for them it will not be worth it, ever. the entire company needs an overhaul from the inside out.  I look forward to Amazon replacing them entirely!"
bad,they treat you like nothing. i don't understand why people would want to work in a place like this. i really have nothing else more to say about this place.
bad,"Havent worked with ups."
bad,You're better off working anywhere but here. I had to unload trailers. Management constantly yells at you to work faster. It's hard enough to move fast when you're hot and sweaty and lifting a ton of packages some which are very heavy. It would be better if there were always 2 people in a trailer at a time helping to unload. One person stands and scans the packages after you unload them into a belt. They yell and cry if the labels aren't facing a certain way. Wow big deal who's the one unloading all those heavy packages. You get a 10 minute break which is really only 5 minutes because you have to be back 10 minutes from when they tell you to go and it takes a couple minutes to walk to the break room so it's really only 5 if that. Thank God I found a new job right away quit after a week worst job ever hands down
bad,I didn't want to work there nomore cause it was messing up my back having to bend over and pick up the boxes. I wouldn't go back if they paid me 100 dollars.
bad,"If you’re looking for a job with terrible pay and barely any benefits then work here. the only real thing they have to offer here is mediocre health insurance. The hours suck, the people suck, supervisors are brain dead and couldn’t care less about safety all they care about it getting work done in a time based manner and best of all is the fantastic pay of $11.50 an hour for 4 hours a day and the promise of a raise of $.50 a year."
bad,"I had worked at a UPS location in eastern, PA and it was a far better place than the Harmony facility.  Harmony is a joke... there is no leadership.  They preach the importance of safety but 'supervisors' will watch as employees struggle to keep their egress clear.  They will stand and stare at you... it feels as though you are being bullied.  They need people yet you only work 3 days a week because they want to meet their numbers.  They have their goals and will do anything to attain them... regardless if it makes sense or not.  The place is a revolving door because of low employee morale.  HR should try working the morning shift to get a sense of why they are fighting an uphill battle."
bad,"This is by far one of the worst jobs out there. Its not for anyone. They shove 7-8 hours of work at you in a 3 to 5 hour period. No raises. Ive been here for 2 years and I make 220 a week. You can pick up trash in a city for better pay. They'll steal minutes from you to keep your check at a certain pay to keep they're incentives good. Managment is corrupt and the union is worse. "
bad,More work then money. Bad work environment. Too hot to work in there doing the summer Time. To be a 6 billion dollar company employees don’t get treated with respect or paid with respect.
bad,"As a driver or loader your hardest work was never good enough.  Management was generally abusive. They would bully them to try to get them to be more productive. In recent years it has gotten much worse. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable was dealing with my customers."
bad,"Worked here 7 months as Package Handler."
bad,"This treats women and minorties very bad even if you do a great job"
bad,unload packages on to conveyour belts. seperate packages by shipping area. help drivers load trucks. hardest part of job is to maintain a fast pace. most enjoyable is to interact with drivers.
bad,High paced under paid . No sic days and very hot work inviroment. Dirty and in clean bathrooms. And no sic days for a year . No time off for a year as well as no insurance for a year .
bad,For someone that is resistant to work this is the job for you. One week in the warehouse and you'll be happy to work in any retail store. The hours are strange and the pay isn't nearly worth the work put in. UPS is a last resort.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company to anybody.  Most of the guys I worked with we're great, I guess we all just embraced the suck together, but the people that run the company are a joke.  They don't care about their employees or the safety aspect of their centers; we had a guy vet his arm ripped off at the center I worked at and there wasn't even a safety meeting or corporate walk through regarding it.  Overall, the worst time I've ever wasted in a corporate setting.  I feel like I wasted 5 years of my life working in a setting that takes no skill, pride or determination to get a paycheck.  They take advantage of hard work and reward uselessness."
bad,I did not lie working at ups because it is poorly maintained it is a dirty wear house and everyone is rude it is hot you have no training and everyone talks about each other
bad,I wasn't a fan because of the time I had to work and I would only work 3 hours and I wouldn't be able to pay my bills and go to school it just made my life more crazy.
bad,It sucked and I hated it the management never did anything for me and they all lied to me on many occasions they claim to care about customers but it doesn’t check out
bad,I know it is hard to believe. Someone is saying Ups worse company of my career. I thought me getting into Ups Freight was going to change my life. I knew that I was going to have to work my way up on the pay scale. Every year was a closer year to top pay but I only made it 6 Months.  My interviewer told me was going to be slow here and there but most of the time 50 to 60 hrs a week. Once training was said and done. Told me had to call in the next day to see if they will need me or not and that day forward. Not what I was told but what could have I done. I just guit a 22 year job I had trusted the supervisor that had lied to me from the word go. The only reason the Ups Freight department hasn't shut its doors is because it says Ups on it. Because if there was a name that wasn't so strong they would have closed there doors by now. How the supervisor run Freight is terrible I feel. The equipment worse equipment I've driven in my 22 years as a Truck driver. Please please do yourself a favor go work a different company then Ups Freight!!!
bad,"I am laid off and will never return to work for this company.  I was bullied for several months by my direct supervisor and when I reported it to management/HR, they told me that I was solely at fault and laid me off."
bad,I cannot believe I stayed there for 7 months. It was literally the lowest point in my life. The work hours were terrible because sometimes they would send you home after only an hour or two.
bad,I only worked here to get through school because they have a programs that pays for your tuition in full. The college program is the only good thing about this place. Very disrespectful management and supervisors. Most of them are very young with no experience in supervising.
bad,stressful not worth the pay. offers some benefits but they cut most of them. they have no problems treating their employees very poorly. the union at ups does not help you out
bad,"A typical day working at UPS could be ok and bad but never a good day. I learned that inside some warehouse industries, they can be very unorganized with how they conduct their work. The Managment was not so good. The workplace culture was unfair. The hardest part about the job trying to unload 40,000 packages within a half an hour. The most enjoyable part of the day was when it was time to go home."
bad,"Sweat shop like work environment, fast paced.  you are basically loading or unloading trucks for the entire shift,shifts were either 5pm to 10pm or overnight.  if you slipped up or are going to slow you got yelled at and name called.  the hardest part was keeping up. most enjoyable was that you had time during the day to get other non work related stuff completed."
bad,"Contractors treated like second-class citizens.  There to do the work and that was it.  "
bad,I didn't like it because of the lack of pay. And they work you to hard for low pay. Ups sucks they dont provide you with water. It's like a salve shop
bad,"the listing for the package handler stated:"
bad,Fuhh ups they treat their customers like slaves. Lifting 100-200 pounds out of a hot trailer for little to no pay. And the supervisors yell and cuss at you if you move too slow from being tired and sweaty. Ridiculous. We only get paid about $180 a week and that's if we get lucky enough to make THAT much. Fuhh this company and all they have to offer. I would recommend working for Amazon or FedEx. They treat their employees great.
bad,i worked there overnight and it was too tiring but i dealt with it i dont have a review to give because people will have to come to their own conclusion
bad,"If you want to be poorly paid, overworked and complete 200 stops per day this is the place. The benefits weren’t too bad and it is unionized but you have to keep in mind that the human body can only take so much."
bad,Place is like a sweat shop never work here everything is better than this “job”. This is literally the worst place ever they don’t care about you and they don’t pay you. Don’t fall for the weekly bonus 💩 they don’t even give it to you half the time they owed me like 3 weeks back worth of bonus and I still have yet to record them.
bad,"Need more workers,pay more money and accommodate the workers more,they need better equipment,they need to stop letting employees walk around and do nothing and the employees that is working they overwork them I feel that this is unacceptable"
bad,"At UPS there are never enough workers to get the job done on time. Management is always late, the start time is always 30 to 40 minutes later then when the workers arrive."
bad,"UPS has 3 different shifts. The earliest one is from 5-10 pm, the latest is from 4-9 am, and the shift I was on was from 11pm-4am. The workplace culture was very strict. The only things I enjoyed were weekends off, as well as New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Black Friday, and Christmas Eve. We also had barbecues the night before Memorial and Labor Day weekend and the night before Independence Day."
bad,Not a very good place to work. They want you to do so much in 4 hours. They will have doing everything. Good benefits but weak hours. So people will not stay long they can not handle the fast paste.
bad,"UPS feels they own you.  They talk culture, safety and family, but rule with an iron fist.  A full time supervisor can expect 16-18 hour days, six days a week.  I was actually told, ""I own you Monday thru Friday, you can see your family on weekends!""  There is no proper training.  Everything about their ""culture"" is fake."
bad,"This job itself was more of a mind thing , once you set your mind up on the important things everything you do in the work place with come easy , & less stressful"
bad,It was terrible working at UPS because of all the weigh you have to carry around and it will hurt your back eventually. They are not considerate at all.
bad,a lot of effort goes into this job. you will sweat and you will sustain injuries no matter how strong or careful you are. it is a dangerous environment with low pay and high stress levels. you are getting paid to work out.
bad,"Being a driver at ups is living the dream. Perhaps in other hubs, it is better. Just not where I worked. Hub work is part time, dangerous, and 8 hours of work is crammed into 2 hours with no break. The hub i worked in, also paid contractors minimum wage, which was 10.35 in Missouri. You won't get benefits  until the year mark. Hub work is part time and temporary, and is meant for the worker to have another job on the side to go with it."
bad,"The place was hot , and the pay was not fair. Some people think it is okay. Working at ups was not my best experience because their was a lot of favoritism towards people."
bad,UPS doesn't believe in giving a time off so the times you work over 12 hours and you have no life it's Monday through Friday the supervisors and management team does not care how long you work they keep saying we have no out time which means and turn you have a life there
bad,Na I don't like it something happened at the job in the manerger did not take manner in hand  I don't won't to go back at all I don't have fun to say that is all I have to say about ups.
bad,Unsafe and they don't practice the safety guidelines they teach you in orientation. Its about numbers and not about safety or even the fairness of equality. The worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,it was a great job it was in a good area the staff was nice i was getting paid over time my manager was nice they trained me for everything i just loved it
bad,This has had to be the most stressful job I have ever been at. You are up at insanely early hours to move 40+ pound packages alone. One quick break. Definitely not work the pay.
bad,"The supervisors would yell at you, stress you out, and the work environment was unsafe and too fast. People would quit constantly. Never had a good week."
bad,they hire so much help for the holiday time and have no slots open to make anyone full time if you need money for the winter months do this cause that's all you will work a few months
bad,The management was horrible. He would scream at his workers in the hallway behind the store while customers can hear him in the store. Very unprofessional. Training wasnt available you had to figure it out.
bad,"Looking for a new and exciting career, meeting people from all around the world and visiting some of the most amazing destinations that the United States"
bad,"The managers  weren't doing their job to best train you. Its like they wanted you to fail, The first day I started as a preloader they gave me  three trucks to load and each trucks take up to 300 packages that's just to much for one person to handle and they give you a Short break 10 minutes. UPS just want to over work their employee's. Lousy managers, lousy pay, lousy company."
bad,nothing about working for UPS is good in my opinion unless you tough it out for the benefits. the work can be extremely hard there no ventilation its hot and the pay is worth it starting off
bad,My typical day there was ok. I've learned  alot about the job. There was nothing hard about this job. And the most enjoyable of this job was riding in the truck and making deliveries.
bad,horrible boss. No hours. pay sucked. no benefits what so ever. I would not recommend this job to anyone with half a brain. Don't expect to be able to pay your rent or any of your bills. Just saying
bad,It's not the best job however it's a job until I can find a better one. Extra hot company don't provide no air area on nun to drink.. good benifits but the job is not something I wanna do forever
bad,"Not a great experience. workers were disorganized and manager could never be found. Most of the time, some packages are misplaced or belong in another"
bad,Not enough hours. Poor management. Was told hours are 4-9. Worked normally fr. 4-7 or 7:30. Supervisor likes to yell at you. Overly fast paced. Rude management.
bad,If you currently work for ups and are having a grand time there this post is merely my opinion and that's all to be honest i really don't hate this company but they made stupid decisions that's all
bad,"Management screams at employs to hurry up. Packages are not treated with due respect. People do not try their best in the warehouse. The company makes changes to overtime, and tells no one. The shop steward is not that helpful."
bad,"The location I worked was horrible. No room for real advancement. They advanced ppl, if you want to call it that, based on who you knew not your experience."
bad,Full time supervisors DO NOT know how to do their job. They get rolled over on and can’t make simple decisions. They have favoritism there and will do anything in your power to fire you on the spot if you don’t like you. The supervisors talk a lot of things about their employees and have no confidentiality what so ever there . Would never be able to trust or communicate with them to know word wont get out to everyone . Not a professional work place . I regret working here .
bad,The amount of stress associated with the job did not equal the pay. The company has a micromanagement policy for the supervisors which translates to them standing around yelling at you.
bad,"Horrible unfair pay. New trainees are getting paid as much as me and I've been working for 5 years. The company has done nothing to solve this problem. The hours are bad, they are strict to the bone about your hours. I barely ever make over 20 hours. Supervisors constanly reminding you to hurry up when you are already cleaned up. 10 minute break is not long enough. NO rewards for breaking your back for wicked company."
bad,"I did not work for UPS, I worked for a franchise owner. They work under a whole different set of rules There is no advancement, no benefits and no one to go to with complaints.There are also no schedules for pay raises. It's a dead end!"
bad,depuis que je suis employe chez eux j'ai travailler juste une journée comme helper
bad,"UPS in Chicago is very unorganized , though I did learn some very valuable things about loading and unloading merchandise. Their management was very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay professional even though everyone else on the job wasn't."
bad,"Impossible to work when in school, even though it is catered to people in school. Tough work for little pay, not worth the extendent college for lack of pay"
bad,it was a horrible place to work. we were treated unfairly we were over worked. we worked in bad condition even bad weather. we had to complain to get any heat or anything done for us.
bad,They are very rude at the DC location on Lst and in CLINTON me. They owner is disrespectful and a pervert. The manager rashida is a thief but blames everybody else. They was hard to work with. They only give you like 5 hrs a with 16 to 20 hrs a week. Don't ever work for those locations
bad,The hours were very tough. The work was stressful. The atmosphere was terrible - lots of yelling and very demanding. It was a reliefto leave the job. I was sleep deprived.
bad,Only a good job during Holiday season. Good hours pay and lots of overtime. Lack of communication amongst management. Disorganized place of environment.
bad,"no raises ,alot of favortism, point system with no pto or sick days. Weird off days Sunday and Tuesday , very hot during the summer . I wouldn't recommend working there. Employee's taking work positions to the head."
bad,"this jobs sucks, they treat you like a slave, they steal from you, dont pay you what you should make. There are no breaks, no restroom breaks. They are terrible to you. No pros,"
bad,everybody was hard workers pay rate was about 9$ an hr. could pay more considering all the hard work everybody does with no a/c its very hot in the warehouse
bad,"If you don't mind     holding   a   chisel   Sharpie®  in your right  hand    and  a  RING  scanner on your left hand  WHILE  flipping over hundreds of random  packages  looking for ONE  miniaturized  TRUCK    label   ... well then ... UPS is for You ."
bad,"Work life balance at UPS does not exist.  You are required to be on numerous conference calls throughout the day, you are expected to answer your phone at all hours of the night.  While on vacation you are still called and expected to answer your phone.  Customer Service Center has access to any phone number associated with you and will call you anytime of the day looking for help with customer issues.  You are given unlimited sick time however it is frowned upon if you use them.  You are expected to be in your office at 06:30 and not leave until 20:00.  Weekends are never yours and you never get the chance to enjoy a Holiday.  Prior to becoming a publicly traded company UPS was a great place to work, now they seem to only care about share owners and could care less about its Management team.  Union work force has more rights than Managers and Supervisors.  Sad to say this company is going down hill, the founding fathers would be saddened by what has becoming of their beloved company."
bad,I have been a p/t cover driver for two years and have been laid off to be put back inside your pay decreases when you don’t drive. I don’t even know why this post is here I’m willing to drive every day and yet they are still hiring p/t drivers.
bad,"Long hours, fast passed, safety driven work. Military like work environment, appearance standards, uniforms, dress standards, etc. Work as directed and get the job done."
bad,UPS isnt a good job if you dont like standing for long periods of time. The job itself pays good but the hours arent negotiable and sometimes you can tend to get antsy and tired of working there.
bad,i  will  never  in  my  life  work for ups  ever  again  that  is  a  very  horrible  place to work manage ment  team  team  is  very  horrible working  at  ups  can  be  very  fun    and  relaxing    great  benefits  meet  great  people  learn  new  customer   service  skills
bad,"Way overworked and underpaid. Someweeks you might get as little as 12 hours, others you will be expected to work as much as 60. There is no room for advancement."
bad,"Lets start with the supervisors clearly need help from head office with organizing floor setup. "
bad,Horrible place to work. The managers think they own you and talk to you like you're their children. i wouldnt recommend this job to anyone unless youre driving the box trucks
bad,"Everyday at that job is stressful, management really don't appreciate hard work. They don't give enough hours, they don't pay much, its hard to pay bills working there,"
bad,very busy day at work and a lot of work every day. only work 20 hours a week part time. It's not a job to make friends at. You just go in and get it done.
bad,"Terrible work atmosphere, you are replaceable they make sure you are aware of that. Everyone hates their jobs including the supervisors. They give no benefits until you have been there an entire year. Yelling, screaming and constant belittling of your pace. No benefits offered and you will never get full time unless you are there for 15 years. No incentives offered, no kudos. I have never worked for a worse company!"
bad,this is one of the worst experiences ive ever had with a job. the supervisors are very disrespectful specifically at the new lyndhurst location. i was treated like garbage along with many other workers. when the union reps come around we are told to work consistently as if we even get a chance to take it easy. dont recommend this job for a single soul. hopefully no one else has to go through what i had to deal with.
bad,"Highly stressful, fast paced they dock you if you are late."
bad,Pension has been taking. Expect you to give up home life. Managers and sups are liars. Insurance has changed in worst way hours are very inconsistant.
bad,"The management sucks!!! They don't help address any problems, just point blame. I worked for 4 weeks with no paycheck because my boss went on vacation and didn't out in my hours. To this day they haven't paid me."
bad,Horrible horrible company. Management treats workers like slaves and its all about productivity. Will not tell anyone to ever work here. Nobody knows what there doing.
bad,a lot of nepotism management they were ruthless and embellished things and ganged up on you when they didn't like you if you didn't produce numbers for them regardless of the reason they pushed you harder and made your job extremely unbearable and stressful
bad,"I do not recommend this job to anyone. You will meet so cool people, but management sucks. They do not carry about their employees. I like working in a slaughter house."
bad,"No room for advancement, no coverage for when emergencies happened and an employee was unable to come in. It was not in the budget to ever increase my salary as a manager."
bad,"The turn over rate is ridiculous a year is a long time im the longest employee there 5 years poor management , low pay , poor work hours would not recommend , to place to advance your career"
bad,Doesn't matter how are you work or how long you've been there new hires get paid more and do half the work they expect in reasonable goals that are impossible to meet and the leadership is very poor
bad,Ups is the worst place to work. the pay is not that wonderful. the staff is very rude. you work 20 hrs a week in the hub as a loader for $100 a week and thats ridiciouls and they need to increase the pay. to atleast $15 an hr. its not a wonderful job and its nothing but hard hard labor. i don't recommand ups to anyone.
bad,Management does everything they can to harass employees even going as far as making up rules just to write people up. Their saying is the most important stop of the day is your last stop. Home. But they actually couldn’t care less about their employees.
bad,"The hours they gave the workers was not good at all. We had to sit around and wait to be called to work. Weeks passed with no call, then after those weeks a random call comes along. This job was not good to me at all."
bad,"There is no such thing as full time if you are not management, a full time driver, or an employee of over 15 years.  You are treated as an expendable resource.  Too many managers, never enough employees.  Not enough resources to do the job to company mandated standards.  Poor scheduling in both work hours and schedule of flights/ contracts.  Employees, are scapegoats for management error.  Extremely dangerous work environment.  Forced to pay union dues, but never received correct union aid.  Pay was not comparative to expected work output.  Scheduling manipulated to prevent overtime pay.  Not enough facilities for employees.  There are to many infractions to list in this section."
bad,"No work life balance very unorganized, there is no accountability, bad customer service, management makes no effort to better work situation. No motivation."
bad,"Mein Mann arbeitete das Jahr in der ersten Hälfte des Jahres war eine Menge Stress, aber das Problem ist, dass Sie im ersten Jahr keinen Urlaub bekommen .. wie der Chef sagt, dass alles bereits geplant ist. Du kannst auch nicht krank sein. Mein Mann war das ganze Jahr über 8 Tage krank und erhielt daher keinen Verlängerungs- und Arbeitsvertrag. An Ort und Stelle weiß ich nicht, warum nicht der Arbeitsvertrag verlängert wurde. und finde den Grund dafür, dass es keine Möglichkeit gibt, da es von der Zentrale kommt. obwohl das Internet wert ist, was sie brauchen, ein Paketträger"
bad,"Terrible management and even worse supervisors. Potentially one of the worst places you could work. The supervisors are lazy and don’t actually help unload the trucks like they are supposed to, they make an excuse to stay inside rather then get in the trailer to help. All the company cares about is saving themselves . They also treat packages like garbage , wouldn’t be surprised if people received damaged orders due to the negligence of the ups supervisors throwing stuff around carelessly."
bad,"i absolutely hated this job, the hours almost made it impossible to get home and you had to sleep during the day to be rested for the night shift, the people in the job created so much drama there were fights outside and inside of the building i worked in and there were people doing drugs outside the building after work. I repeat myself i would never work here again."
bad,"Been working there for only a few weeks now. I've had a few jobs before but this is the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. For one they treat peoples mail horribly. The workers just throw and stuff the packages everywhere. The supervisors say they technically cant touch the mail which i feel is absurd when all they do is walk around doing nothing being on their phones and running outside to continuously smoke cigarettes. The staffing has the worst turnover rate I have ever seen. When i started within the first week a supervisor and five other people quit. Very uneasy to see after just starting. In my interview I was told different hours from what we work. People show up when they want and leave when they want. If your a good worker LOOK OUT!!! They will encourage you to work fast and when you think your done you have to turn around and help someone else out who had been playing around all day. If you are a good employee and complete your work on time like they ask it doesnt matter cause your still have to help the slackers who just want to talk and play around all day. Management calls this ""TEAM WORK""!!!. This facility is very unsettling to me knowing that they deal with "
bad,I do not recommend working for UPS Package Handler because you will be treated like a slave and your safety and well being is not taken seriously by management.
bad,It was not a fun place to work and people were treated poorly by the managers and coworkers.  So many people had horrible things to say about people there.
bad,"Ups is the worst job i have ever had. I regret the day i steped in. They treat you like dirt, while they pay you with dirt. Every ones job is always on the line"
bad,They kill you working here pay is low. Tell you lots tasks at once. No ac summer days will be wet in sweat. This job is not a career it just temporary.
bad,"I left several months ago and haven't seen what is owed in pay. Labor board sent an investigator and they had employees work off the clock as I claimed. Labor board ruled in my favor. "
bad,Worst job ever. Talked to Union rep and nothing happened. Management wasn't helpful at all. Blamed the dock workers for thier mistakes. I would recommend this company to anyone. It seemed like they would cut hours when it was busy but give hours when it was slow.
bad,"The job is a lot of hard work for under $200 a week "
bad,"Lifting the heavy boxes without help some times can get annoying. But overall I do like working at UPS. number one, it pays good. Number two, you are getting a good exercise."
bad,i really didnt like working at ups cause they wasnt paying well and they kept sending me back home every 4am in the morning and i didnt want to work nomore because it was stressful
bad,Underpaid slaves. They do not care about their employees. They only care about safety when there is an audit. You have no life because they do not care about work life balance.
bad,"Without fail, the day for a UPS driver begins at the local warehouse. While trucks are loaded, drivers assemble for a morning meeting.A driver might average 120 deliveries or more a day. The route is defined by UPS. Computers inside and outside of the truck tell the company if the driver is staying on schedule. The little black box that customers sign when a package is delivered serves as a computer that records time. The UPS truck itself is computerized to show when doors open and close. ""You're trained to have a sense of urgency,"""
bad,Management staff is constantly overworked and underpaid. Hard working employees are passed on promotion. They only promote when they need to fill a position. Training is not consistent and you often have to figure out things on your own.
bad,"This was a horrible place to work, I was promoted and never paid for my new position and when they finally decided to give me my pay raise and make it retroactive they only paid me for one month versus the three months prior."
bad,The manager was a real jerk and very unprofessional conduct.  I was told after showing up for work to go home I was not needed.  Gas is not free and I needed this job . I was never told it was seasonal just very unfair
bad,"i haven't worked for ups but we owned a Ups Store. A typical day was you don't know whats next. Sometimes slow sometimes busy"
bad,Always have to correct others errors Management does nothing to correct any issues owner is never available and does not supply the store properly so customers are never happy.
bad,"ok place to work, not enough  hours offered , but overall ok place to work , great benefits. Good place to start out if your going to college or just want part time"
bad,"management is terrible, they don't pay nearly enough for the amount of work they want you to accomplish. its a complete mess they forget to give you pay stubs and mess up your pay."
bad,So many times my check was wrong or I had to wait for it to be found because of irresponsibility on staff and other higher personnel the hours were terr4to make for an unsteady paycheck
bad,"this job doesn't respect its management and always puts us in dangerous situations with hostile individuals. They also don't respect our personal responsibilities in life. I went to all my bosses and told them I needed to change shifts because of care giving to my nephew, even showing supporting documents and I was brushed off."
bad,"The ONLY consistency is inconsistency with the Poughkeepsie office.  I was hired as a full time Personal Vehicle Driver after a grueling hiring process only to be used as a part time Helper.  HR will tell you tales of 8hr minimums, mileage reimbursement and gauranteed overtime. "
bad,"It took a lot of hard work for this place. Everyday it was the same consistent hard work. It took a lot of perseverance to work here. I was hired during peak season, so it took even more."
bad,From the start to finish completely unorganised plus had to fight for 3 months to get paid for overtime which their machine didn't record. I had the driver give a statement but it wasn't excepted.
bad,When i was working at the airport i had gotten my check and i had noticed that it was a mistake on my check and that wasn't the first time that they had messed up my paycheck so i laid off myself
bad,Awful place to work. Terrible work. I'd rl Recommend a sweat shop in Thailand  before this place. I also don't rwccimed using them for shipping as they destroy everything they touch
bad,"poor management, poor pay,poor work environment, union sucks and upper management is worse that lower, all around bad place to work would not recommend"
bad,"No communication between management and rural employees. One employee likes to gossip about others and tries to act like the boss, it definitely ran off previous employees and myself, and I am sure if nothing is done with said employee she will run off future employees."
bad,"The worst company to work for, UPS is unsafe ,supervisors are badly train,no respect for the workers.They harras there workers sexually and verbally  is a mess UPS to be honest."
bad,I recommend not working for the Ups stores they are individually owned and are a hit or miss with who your management will be and mine was awful i was not a fan.
bad,"poor conditions, unsafe environment, management was horrible lack of experiences in supervisor positions,team leads, and management.   also attitude towards employees."
bad,showing up to work your buns off at a job that doesn't recognize effort and asks you to go above your pay grade on a daily basis.  Poor raises were handed out and gratitude for effort was never shown
bad,"Wages Are Not Correct When Paid , Weekly Bonuses Are Not Processed , Managers Use Foul Language Against Employees & Other Co Workers , If You Get Hurt On Job Your Forced To Continue Working Or Be Terminated , Worst Place To Work EVER"
bad,"A typical day was getting up at 2am. Learned how to drive in Washington DC and the Maryland areas. Management is really a joke. They treated me well in the beginning then the floor caved in. Hardest part of the job was not knowing where you are going everyday and dealing with those tight spots that a tractor trailer is not supposed to be. The most enjoyable part was getting the bonus every quarter and getting paid for the holidays. Do Not go to Front Royal, Va. this is your last warning!!"
bad,This place is horrible I don't suggest or wouldn't recommend nobody to work here. The job is a back breaker frfr and not enough pay at all...they play with your checks sometime
bad,The HR manager only hire unattractive women or older women because she hates competition.She hire girls but only for part time only for seasonal help.
bad,You may be thinking to yourself. I would love to drive trucks and deliver packages. You might have heard it's a great company with great Benifits. You may have read awesome reviews and a great star rating. Well that's what I thought too. I was wrong! It takes a year part time at 10$ an hr. To receive any type of Benifits. Including paid Hollidays. It's next to impossible to get hired on as a driver because they promote from within. With that said you have to withstand being over worked and mentally abused untill you get your shot. Then they set you up for failure. Mabey it's different at other centers. This one I was lied to cheated and treated like a prisoner. All because I wanted to be a  ups driver.
bad,"Unless you stay part time for ten plus years to go combo you will be paid garbage wages and be overworked, the only upside is if you have poor work ethic you can not get fired from that job unless you really mess up"
bad,it was too much yelling and too much stressful because unloading and loading the truck on human wasn't easy cause human is not a machine and wasn't really friendly people in the building.
bad,there was a driver smoking weed on the job and I left the truck and reported it. The managers were mad at me. They said i should not have left the truck. Lastly the driver must have had a friend in a high place because he was not punished. I was not called for two weeks after I made that report. they also lied about overtime pay.
bad,Some supers were extremely harsh on workers. Understaffed and some procedures were dated and stupid. Unreasonable hours during busy seasons that make it hard on those with other jobs.
bad,"Very discriminating company, no care for your personal life, if your a hard worker they will take advantage of you. There is no reward for being a good employee. always expect the impossible from there drivers"
bad,"I will take a minute and say that training was terrific. After that... no organization. I could never get in contact with the right people. I never got correct phone numbers of management. I was hired as a seasonal driver. Never got my uniforms. Never got called to be a driver. I got called once to be a helper, and i only worked for 3 hours! I continued to try and reach out to the phone numbers provided to me, but i never got answered any callbacks anything. i worked only 3 hours for the entire ""season"" So much disorganization. I spoke to 5 different people with different supervisory ranks from both branches in Westchester. Each of them heard my complaints and told me they would call me back shortly. Then provided me with my check, they decided to stop it, and take the funds back right from my bank account. Thanks UPS for the worst job experience ever!"
bad,"This is minimum wage sweatshop. the employees at Bangladesh and China have better working conditions and is not in a union."
bad,"I will take a minute and say that training was amazing. After that... no organization. I could never get in contact with the right people. I never got correct phone numbers of management. I was hired as a seasonal driver. Never got my uniforms. Never got called to be a driver. I got called once to be a helper and i only worked for 3 hours! I continued to try and reach out with the phone numbers provided to me but i never got answered no call backs nothing. i worked only 3 hours for the entire ""season"" So much disorganization. I spoke to 5 different people with different supervisory ranks from both branches in Albuquerque. Each of them heard my complaints and told me they would call me back shortly. Well its been 3 months since those complaints. Thanks UPS for the worst job experience ever!"
bad,"I like working there at my job just don't feel valued for it , poor management the hardest part of my job is doing more than one task and taking up the slack for others."
bad,"Dont work here, chances are this posting is misleading. They will hire you and let you go without any warning before your 90 day probation because all they care about is cutting costs. They dont give proper training and expect you to do the job efficiently, management is terrible."
bad,"Not a pleasant experience, management yells about unavoidable thing, and thing that have nothing to do with you as an employee. All together very low moral, no lunch breaks, no sick time or paid holidays"
bad,No communication no order they treat you like your expendable long hours and low pay. Almost every week its a pay roll problem. Supervisors are never available when needed
bad,bad company to work at into looking for any job. it will actually kill you if you are not careful into working and going home. this job is the worst it will really rip you off the money system.
bad,"They don't really care for their employees, job security is very low and if they feel you need to be replaced they will. They don't pay their workers all the way, which is just wrong considering how big of a company it is."
bad,Good workplace i loved it. Its was a quicklearning process.Managers i got along with very good.I was a mail scanner at Ups.It only have one break but it a good job
bad,"UPS is a very physically demanding position. Pay is minimal, and employees are not appreciated by management. Safety is the last thing on their minds."
bad,"So far I can't say I really like the job but is ok,I just have some real problems with transportation to get there and it make the job more hard for me"
bad,Was suppose to be a job where I had control in my position. That was a lie. Put down consistently and felt like my hands were tied all the time. Best part of the job was when they told me I was no longer needed.
bad,"I hate to say it but the oakland location is very bad, it has very poor management styles. I noticed people arguing everyday, it was a very toxic work space for me."
bad,I wasnt a big fan of UPS but its a really good job if u been there a long time it has health benifits for you amd your loved ones such as dental and health.
bad,"UPS is one of the worst places to work for unless you are in there for the benefits. They eay the worst out of all the other logistic companies. I left my corporate job due to some personal reasons and started working at UpS. They promise you fast advancement etc.. but it is all a lie. They need workers to do the tough jobs and will not promote you. In addition, they lie about promoting within.  This company has a lot unnecessary middle management and needs to change it structure."
bad,This job was by far the worst job I ever had. Especially for the pay. I would never recommend this job to anyone. But if you do suffer through the bad pay and hours for a couple years you might make good money as a driver....MIGHT!
bad,Ups isn't all that great yeah they talk a good one but I guess depending on were your located it can be a bitter taste in one mouth and they still haven't paid me all my wages.
bad,"ups is a very unsafe place, to much commotion going on to pay attention to what you are doing, you only get 1 15 minute break in your day, managers don't do their jobs."
bad,UPS stand for U People Suck and you only care about management the workers get no incentives to the workers and in order for young people to work on a position they need to know that they are protected.
bad,i on;ly worked over the holiday for three days didn't really gain the full experience from the job like i wish i could have. The time i was there i did random jobs daily not one set thinh i liked being a drivers helper more then anything
bad,"I worked for 3 weeks without pay. We get paid weekly."
bad,"i didnt like it personally, i am not willing to go back loading is the hardest thing to do and keeping up with the pace of the pph learn it and you will be ok"
bad,it was a fast paced stressful environment. I didnt get paid for work days completed even still. No time for bathroom breaks and there isnt a lunch period.
bad,"your the drivers slave instead of hiring for drivers they hire helpers and put all the load on them driver i was with wouldnt even help hold the door open,smokes 2 packs of cigs within 8 hours place is a joke and need better management.The work was easy for me but hard dealing with such a negative driver never do it again or recommend any one!go to amazon!   Under Payed Slaves"
bad,"They lied about openings for a drivers helper and had me drive all the way out there.  Myself and 15 others were there for a scheduled interview and orientation where we were all told we would be paid $13 hr for a 3 hr orientation.  When we got there all of us were told to go home and that they were not seeing anyone.  When I called the HR office the person I talked to said my interview was 10 A.M. the day before.  However, I had not talked to them until 11:30 A.M. the day before and I had a email with the available times.  It was all a scam!!"
bad,"poor management very unorganized, would call me in jus to send me home, after 10 days of no work due to them not having any or a few days when i had strep throat and a wedding, i was told i was terminated for not showing up for over 3 weeks when it hadnt been half that long. will have you running around jus to go home and not work"
bad,I was given very little training on top of higher up supervisors constantly reprimanding me for not being as good as more seasoned employees. Regularly went in to be sent home without working due to no open spots that day
bad,"Low pay, long hours, especially in the holiday season-which makes sense of course. No benefits offered. Upward mobility limited, and criticism a near constant."
bad,"This place is like a slave haven. I would not recommend anyone to work at this place. They do not care about people, all they care about are packages being moved."
bad,A bunch of underpaid over worked slaves fighting for every hour no union they dont care about you all they care about is numbers and their product i hated it with my life
bad,Very poorly managed. a good old boys environment. Become one of the boys or be cast out. Expected to work on your own time without compensation. Very little room for advancement
bad,They expect you to learn everything the first week with just basic training from a no good manager. Isn't a very safe place to work and it's very stressful on your body
bad,"von den Mitarbeitern UPS "
bad,"Way under paid for the tasks you perform.  Overtime is mandatory and so are cut hours.  they have been loosing clients like the dropping of flies and it is due to really bad management and a horrible corporation that only goes by numbers, not customer satisfaction. I'd rate 0 stars if I could.  I'm too smart to stay where I am unappreciated."
bad,This was the worst job I had. The management were just mean to you if you didnt get the numbers they want. The work was way too hard for what they were willing to pay.
bad,"bad company; great people . management not family friendly. Great time management    the jobs are always exciting, and we are always tackling new challenges."
bad,I was able to get the hours needed to survive at this store. The management of this store was horrible. The owners of this store were so self involved that the employees and store suffer.
bad,"Job, Management and working conditions were far from what I was told they would be during orientation.  Facility was poorly managed, hours were never ending AND we were paid salary so we were making next to nothing per hour."
bad,NA did not like working for this company because of location and work production and staff was not happy. I Was being unappreciated do to lack of work and friendly
bad,Working at this company was very fast paced and although they make it seem as though you can advance its not that great of a chance to advance because everyone is trying to do so
bad,Managment was terrible the job itself was so so stressful i woke up for work and didnt want to go in but i had to thats not a job anyone should have to feel like
bad,I did not enjoy working for UPS. Even though I made supervisor I really did not enjoy working for UPS at all. The pay was not competitive and the work environment was very stressful. Still I did very well there and was given awards and bonuses for my performance. I left to join the Navy in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks.
bad,Fast paced and hard to understand at times. Nobody is willing to train anyone how to do anything it feels kind of like a cattle factory or a chicken farm.....all while being yelled at and paid lower than what you should be..
bad,Don't work here unless you have 4 kids and  house payment. They make you work super long hours everyday and it never changes. You get to work and your car is filled to the brim
bad,When u thinks of ups you think $$$ well not at this account. (Symbol mattress)  starting pay is .39cpm an$13.00 a stop. Might work 3 to 4 days a week. And barely crack 1100 miles  per week. Poor Management and organization skills. Avoid this Kissimmee FL.  account by all means. Very dangerous backing Off busy highways not worth losing your CDL
bad,Job with the pull orders and make sure everything was done right using RF scanner guns also had a few different accounts to work when working at UPS long hours 12 hours plus and a lot of bosses that were always in your face always watching you always telling you what to do while working this 12 hours a day Monday through Sunday no days off and then when I ask for Holiday off got fired so no I will not go back or recommend anybody to go back to that slave Factory
bad,"I was a seasonal worker while I attende school. they terminated me without telling me right after peak time was done. managment was basically non existent and changed everyday, didnt even know who my supervisor/trainer was"
bad,"Temporary job but still pay union dues."
bad,"back breaking work for very very little pay.  no fans in the loading trailers,  It seems that you have more than one boss telling you what to do and when,"
bad,Long hot drenching days in a heated truck . working till i lost my breathe only to have a package fall on me because of my partners impatience .The breaks are short and the work takes a while to progress every dollar there is well earned.
bad,"Worked as an Industrial Engineer for 3 years at UPS.  Hands down, the worst job I've ever had.  Pay was ridiculously low, the hours one was expected to work were unbearable, and the management was abusive to employees."
bad,"DO NOT WORK THERE"
bad,the most unorganized place i've every worked at. hardly every got to take a break or lunch. fast paced long hours easily 10 -12 hrs +. the managers are very unorganized and everyone is on different pages
bad,they worked you to hard they never gave more then 4 hours a night the breaks were to short the hardest part was loading the trucks the best part was meet different people
bad,It worked while I was in college but not as a career choice.  As a supervisor I worked about 30 hours a week for $16 an hour.  The insurance is good but that's about it.
bad,"Aux tarifs que vous prenez pour envoyer des colis ou des enveloppes... :-( "
bad,"Very unprofessional regarding the way they treat their employees. A lot of favouritism to certain individuals that don't work as hard as others, but if an employee who gives 100% , it goes unnoticed. The way team leaders and management speak to employees, is absolutely disgusting. Lack of communication between management and employees. Lack of care for their employees."
bad,"Awful place to work for. Supervisors yell at people, work you ragged, which really isn't an exaggeration. You work hard with not much to show for it. Packages are basically handled like footballs in some instances, dropped, kicked, damaged regularly. Things go missing all the time. People get into fights and don't get consideration for having to defend themselves from supervisors. Certain people get to skate out of trouble over and over, instead of being treated the same way you would, if fair is fair. Overall terrible atmosphere, many people who get hired end up quitting soon. The work load and the pace they expect really isn't for everyone. The benefits are really the only thing that would keep anyone there for a long time. They do pay for school, healthcare is great, but what you have to put up with to enjoy those benefits isnt quite worth it."
bad,Fun place to work for and very fast paced environment. good management but low pay. Monday thru Friday and no weekends and good benefits. you get two weeks vacation.
bad,hard work for not a lot of money. small spaces and it was always hot no more than 10 minutes breaks and no chance to move up in the company for years.
bad,I was only seasonal help i did it for 2 years the first year i did it was fun my driver was great and very helpful. The 2nd year not so much my driver was a jerk he did nothing but boss me around wrong answer.I was carrying a package out of the truck and i feel out of the truck and hurt my knee really bad could hardly walk on it but he did nothing but laugh at me didn't ask if i was ok or anything.So i don't do Driver's Helper anymore.
bad,i didnt like that i work more then i was getting paid to do so. you working hard for low wages that cant pay bills....................................
bad,"I didn't like working here pay was too low hrs promise was never given out as stated, workers are very nasty & managers are never around to talk to or ask question"
bad,It was a stressful environment and my co-workers were rude. I worked long hours and helped several driver with deliveries. The management didnt care if i had a complaint about a driver.
bad,"awful -management was only focused on their numbers and crowed about being safety-oriented, but never did I feel like I was ""allowed"" to REALLY focus on safety."
bad,"À éviter, pire entreprise de livraison au monde. Une incompétence qui dépasse l'entendement et des colis qui disparaissent à tour de bras, une arnaque permanente et une ambiance exécrable."
bad,"This contact assignment is a perfect location close to my home, also allowed me to add another skill set to my resume working in the mail room using Mail machine and inserter."
bad,"Management is so messed up. If you get hired to work in the office, be prepared for part time hours, part time pay and a lot of b.s. Labor employees are protected by the union, management is protected by the belief that their superiors have common sense. you supervise people who get paid better than you do. Sure, health insurance is cheap, but it sure doesn't take into account for the daily stress and disappointment you have to endure."
bad,work else where.  Its a cut throat industry where management is run by investors.  Management likes to break their employees and when they get injured blame it on the employee ( and I was management)
bad,"Management doesnt care about work gossip that effects peoples lives. If you are the bosses favorite and that person harasses you, management does not care. They WILL find a reason to let YOU go instead of the culprit even if she has been talked to about her attitude. NOT a good company at all."
bad,"Working is Stressful you on make $100 or less a week, your back an attend to go out, The money is not helping towards rent if you have a home, I learn how to be quick and unload fast"
bad,I left this job because I was pregnant.  UPS treatment regarding my pregnancy and request for lighter duties was unprofessional and border line illegal.
bad,I was asked to be supervisor. It's non union. No health benefits. And no OT. High levels of stress. Lack of coordination. Senior vs new hires. Just a mess. No professionalism what so ever. Anybody can get the job. It was presented to me as a compliment but I took it as an insult. I work as a pt worker. The company does everything to pay you less. Just think about it. The job is 10 and hour but it's well worth 15-18. It's minimum wage for what we do. I already don't feel secure in my current position. You literally have to work for ups for the rest of your life. Literally. They use you then throw you away like trash. This company does not treat their employees well.
bad,"load trucks, unload trucks, scan packages, sort packages to the right location. also work on top of the different belts to ensure packages are going to the right places."
bad,"Job was Manageable, but leadership is very unforgiving and does not give equal attention to employees. You are treated as though you can be replaced. Would not recommend this as a career."
bad,I would not recommend this job place and/or position to anyone. This job was a stepping stone to move on to better things. The pay is not worth the time.
bad,"always on the phone, handling work orders from customers for picking up and delivery of packages, can be somewhat stressful when nature calls,, always on a timed situation."
bad,"Unless you are a union employee, do not take any other job at UPS, especially as a supervisor. The pace is too face, unsafe, and there is no teamwork involved among supervisory staff."
bad,I was given a seasonal job and they work you like a dog. If you call in sick for one day then you will no longer have a job. Your moving every second of the day while lifting heavy boxes. I was getting paid 11 an hour and it was not worth it at all. It took forever to get my pay check as well and they have terrible management.
bad,"ups is something else it was a lot of work and bad work enivorment, also pay was bad no benefits hours here bad and management was bad also horrible working condtions, not worth it to work here thers a lot of things that place needs, lunchrooms where nasty work area dusty dirty and smelly, coworkers lot of slacking off and cursing and being lazy, ups onl gave 10 min breaks after loading boxes from 1 pound o 300 pounds in a trailer that is about 120 degrees"
bad,"I loaded work trucks with shipping products. I also unloaded receiving products from work trucks. Scanned products received and shipped. Cleaning, etc"
bad,UPS hubs are the worse place to work but the benefits are amazing *Crying face! I wouldn't recommend working there if you don't enjoy slave labor for min. wage!
bad,"Poor advancement, poor salary, poor management. Hardest part of the job is knowing all you do and is never appreciated. Never any raises unless you kick up an argument about it."
bad,I would drive 40 miles to work and then they would say they didn't need me and cut my hours. The were rude and hateful people. Do NOT work here. The pay isn't good for what you do.
bad,"No advancement opportunity."
bad,"Not good at all not one person was happy everybody angry. Poor pay it's salary but day's are 12 hour shift's so min wage tops, if you finish early you have to hang around till 5 so 7:30-5 minimum. Expect 48-60 hour working week with a sat on call shift every one in four."
bad,I learned to move at a fast pace. The people that I worked with for the most part were very nice. Management made sure that everyone was able to come and speak with them whenever they needed it.
bad,"i have learned alot working at UPS  talking to customers, filling out paperwork ,getting to know people .Helping unload the trucks and also workig in the warehouse ."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. Management a bunch of lying, incompetents. Very hostile work environment.  Such a shame that one of the leaders in parcel logistics is the worst in employee experience across the board."
bad,This establishment pushes you to your limits and although can be challenging has taught me good work ethic and helped me want to further my career. 50%
bad,management was always helpful.  they reached out to you whether personal or job related.  coworkers were awesome.  company policies were followed at all times
bad,I was a part time operations supervisor which means I made 16.90 and hour while my boss made 80k a year while I did most of his work. Not to mention the workers made 15 dollars an hour. The working conditions were the worst I've seen. Run down shacks with belts on them and port a potties for bathrooms. The managers only cared about how quickly the parcels could be moved and numbers and the blame just trickled down the ladder when the numbers weren't hit. The whole job was a joke don't do it.
bad,"clock in check with boss do clean , lifting , tech , or other work "
bad,Hot in the summer so u might pass out the breakers was also to short I would not tell anyone to go work ther me because they don't care bout ur safety
bad,"the lunch room was very dirty and smelled horrible, there was never a lead or manager on the floor and other employees are very rude when there wasn't anymore work you just stood around because there wasn't anyone around to tell you what to do"
bad,"They hired me in April and never gave me my desired pay after working a year. But they kept hiring people and training them and giving them raises, so employees were making more than me in less than 6 months."
bad,Southeast Missouri division of UPS offers no advancement for minroty workers. You work long hours doing physical labor for low pay. Supervisors do not care until you miss a package or stop the conveyor. Management hires friends a family to advance over minority despite sonority!
bad,This job treats all of their employees like slaves and the pay is not worth it. of the day for a low pay every week. this job is not worth working for.
bad,Big on safety Management does not fallow. Slavedrivers to employees who are overwhelmed with work. Management cares more about numbers than customers and employees.
bad,It is 911 For Packages. No one calls to say thank you for your on time delivery. Angry customers all day. Brutal. Strict time requirements for on desk duty.
bad,"Worked me to death, and union did nothing for me but keep me from getting fired. Disrespectful management all over, and there was no way for me to keep my grades up the semester I worked there."
bad,Overworked and underpaid.  If your not divorced you didn't work hard enough.  Holiday's suck.  Would never recommend working there as life is too short.
bad,"I wish they had better leadership. UPS wasn't for me and that's okay. I think this job is for people in college, just getting out of high school, or who have children."
bad,Terrible place to work even as a college student. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. They treat their employees terribly and have an even worse environment.
bad,The managers do not care out the employees. The working conditions inside are horrible. The pay is too little and they expect entirely too much. This company definitely needs to be fixed.
bad,You are over worked. You are giving more trucks to load than you could possibly handle. The hours are good 4am to 830am pay is ok. And you get a 10 min break.
bad,I work there for a month and was terrible. The boss make you work at a extra face pace. The warehouse was so hot during the summer and winter and the breaks were so short.
bad,the work load is to much for one person. they do not care about safety at all. you dont get befits till after a year of working there.  they expect you to do the work of 3 people but do not want to give you the time to do it.
bad,"Too much too learn,  way too time consuming.... co workers don't work as a team manager does not explain things clear enough..  lots  is needed  too improve this."
bad,"Every day I had to work I would drive 30 minutes to get to the UPS warehouse, clock in and go to my work station. But before I would start they would send people home if they had too many people scheduled which they always did. Almost every night for a month I was sent home without getting to work. They claimed that they send home the newly hired people first and let the older hired people stay and work. My supervisor told me that they would only be sending people home for a week but this continued for the duration of my time working there. My pay checks were horrible, I was making just enough to pay for my gas to get to the facility. After asking my supervisor if they would be willing to let me know ahead of time if they didn't need me in for the day, he said he couldn't because his boss wouldn't let him. I worked for UPS only a little while after that due to being fed up with getting my hours cut constantly and not getting paid well."
bad,"I enjoyed this employer when I had first started, but after about six months I felt that they were taking advantage of my hard labor and became frustrated. After acknowledging my frustrations with management, little to nothing was done to better accommodate the work environment. Will never seek employment at this company again."
bad,This company over works the employee and treats the employees like slaves. There is no potential space for growth and is not related to my field. You can only use the restroom when told
bad,"Owners will just make your life a living heck. Beyond sexist and bipolar. Working their was fun at times but miserable 75% of the time. Typical day at work was awful if the owners were their, can not work their own store but will breath down your neck and question why you do everything you do."
bad,"Pretty much the way it is there, go in load at least 3 90 ft trailers. Probably get yelled at through it all, like you're in middle school. The pay is horrible which makes you sent to move up, but once you move up you became eligible to get fired so to say. Pretty much they befits make up for the lack of pay."
bad,The hours were not ideal but the benefits were good. The pay was good as well and it was weekly. Managers could have been better. In order to become a driver was based off seniority
bad,"Consistent scheduling, moderate hours, good benefits. However, it was a non-union job so the system of rules set in place put your job more at risk than union."
bad,Not worth the headaches and feeling of being worthless! Early mornings and the manager only wants to yell that you're not doing anything right. If you're hourly you can be saved by the union. If you're in management you're screwed!
bad,Its a good job but they are not organized at all i worked there for 4 years i was a good hard worker i just got tired of settling for less i wasn't making no money
bad,"They treat their employees terrible don't do this to yourself you deserve better. They could care less about you as a person, all they care about is their numbers and they don't care what cause they get them."
bad,"Management can be more professional, organized, fair, helpful and promote good employees.  Offer full time to employees that have been with the company for a period of time. Promote in house versus outsidem"
bad,Working at the UPS store was a pain. These stores are franchised and are controlled by the owner. Owner and managers treated me very unfairly and I would not recommend anyone working there.
bad,"No consideration for employees, supervisors only care about number and no about there workers. Terrible environment. They preach safety but do not practice it."
bad,i really hated it pay was to low it was like u was working free it was very hot peoples was disrespect.I needa job thats go help me in life or get me some where in life
bad,"Didn't like it don't want too work there ever again , too far too be working too much work needed in there the work don't match the pay , people are mean and don't really like socializing"
bad,"working 5 or more trailers a night"
bad,"My job was data entry keying in numbers from payroll checks the job was good, the people were nice the most important thing was being able to remember numbers and making sure they were enter right"
bad,"Management did not care about employees, air is not regulated in horrible working conditions. Expected employees to excel at tasks that were unattainable. No balance between home and work life."
bad,Great Place for entry level person and the benefits are great not not a great place for advancement for someone looking to grow in the it field  so after 4 years its lime to move on
bad,"i really disliked the job,it was just a seasonal job and after doing the job it wasn't something i wanted to do as a job.the days at work where ok and short.Management was just sad in my eyes and the hardest part is dealing with the rude comments and how to talk to a person with respect."
bad,The job there was fast paced done a great job just wasn't toward my degree need to find a job more productive and more toward my goal learned honesty how to handle freight how to always help out customers culture was a lot different the it was outside and it was fun driving forklifts all day
bad,"Working for UPS supply chain solutions isn't a good deal at all. You're an independent contractor and you use your own vehicle...not the brown trucks.  There is no set manager, dispatch calls you anytime they have a job for you which is usually in the middle of the night and much of the time they were short jobs. in addition to that, they make demands on you that seem excessive. It really blurs the line between being an employee versus being independent ."
bad,"UPS goes for younger people that don't want full time work because of attending school....with this, they get very young and immature employees, even in management.  The number of hours and dollars wasted by this group is huge!"
bad,"I was promised I was going to start out as Full time back in october, but found out it was only seasonal. So after 89 days they fire you. So glad I found another full time job that has honest management"
bad,"Did the company do anything about the work place injury and damages due to another employees actions. No, They let me go due to my accusations of complaints."
bad,This place was a joke to work for. People come and go on a daily basis. The training they have in place sucks and they favor just a few employees. Not a great place to work. When you become a regular employee after being a temp your pay decrease.
bad,not a good place to work . you have no work life balance or time to spend with your family. its all about the numbers and making money. Your just a number
bad,"No room for advancement, treated employees poorly, mangaement treated employees like your  never good enough,   no incentives for good work, I was treated like a nobody"
bad,"fue la peor experiencia de mi vida no se respetan horarios laborales, si se laboran horas extras no respetan las horas laboradas."
bad,"Une bonne accueil, ensemble très correcte je reste disponible."
bad,"As a graveyard shift truck loader, the pay was less than desirable. The work was backbreaking, and the conditions during the summer time were horrendous"
bad,"From my experience, everyone from the warehouse head to the union rep are worthless. The scheduling of hours changed daily, and sometimes without warning to employees, the work was hard, back breaking and following established safety rules meant the hammer coming down from management for working too slow."
bad,"This was by far the WORST job I have ever held. Management treated you like a number and not a person, they only looked out for themselves. You cant get help when you need it. If you  need time off for an emergency GOOD LUCK. Your better off working at a fast food joint."
bad,"Few hours at night equals a small check that self-sustaining students cant live off of and it presents a problem for time management when students, working there to pay for school, are forced to adapt to a unmanageable schedule."
bad,"The staff is old and racist.After meeting sales goals, I was let go without notice or any real explanation. I was told, ""we do not have any hours for you"" as is there somehow became less hours in the day."
bad,"All positions require endurance,  and focus. The pay is basically fair, with the exception of how management goes about  limiting work hours . The issue becomes favouritism, doing multiple jobs, not simply the one you were hired for. Look out for management team questionnaires. I witnessed extremely deceptive behavior on their part. As a loader you will be required to do your job as well as the assembly line that feeds the packages to you for loading.Good luck becoming a  permanent employee (you need 30 days to get into the union)management has the right to dictate your schedule so if you're close to finishing the 30-31 day probation period, regardless of attendance, work record they will give you some time off. Management will stop you while you're working to ask how to make the work environment better, all along evaluating whether or not you will totally comply to the same saftey standards you have to break in order to keep up with the required production. A false representation of the actual job requirements, as well as the possibility of a permanent position  (in my case the day before I would've qualified for union membership I was told not to come in) made for a work experience I will never forget. I  would advise anyone interested in working with this company to apply anytime other than Xmas, it is a madhouse during this time."
bad,"very stressful very fast paced and if you are not physically fit it is not for you. although after a year it is very benificial as far as benifits, it is hard to get there as a preloader"
bad,"Very cut-Throat, you get in trouble for taking too long in the bathroom. Not easy job, they're unorganized as well, need a plan. There is no balance in this place, they have an onsite agency rep who is always calling you in the office for immature little things, they will fire you on the spot."
bad,"When I first started working for UPS I was very excited to be working to a major company in Chicago, my first day of work I was thrown to the wolves, meaning I was made to unload trucks sometimes alone with no help, or once I finished unloading a truck I had to unload another truck alone with no help ..."
bad,I am a very hard worker .I work hard to get the task of the day done and try to help others when my job is done no task to small. I try to learn all about the job at hand.
bad,Worst supervisors ive ever seen everybody was unprofessional couldn't stand the workers there are worse off brakes were too short workday in the 105° temperature so much trucks only given a couple breaks a day for the hours that we put in
bad,"I worked here for two years before it made me me that sick I left.  The management are bully's who will lie to get their own way.  HR are useless as they will do anything to protect the management.  "
bad,Hard work for pennies the wear and tear isn't worth it. The bust you with as much work as they can in the little hours. They barely give you 20 a week. Not a job for single parents
bad,"A typical day at the job includes punching in, then scanning packages on to the truck and loading them. I learned that this job is not for everyone as it can be very fast pace. Workplace culture was terrible, it seemed like everyone had a bad day and did not want to be there."
bad,"Overall a great place to work. Not enough hours and staffing company leads that are in charge are very unprofessional. Causing problems, and making good employees leave."
bad,"Don't work here unless you plan to go into management or really really need a job. You have a high chance of getting injured, overworked, or not even working hours you want to work."
bad,"Terrible place to work. General Manager of hotel is unprofessional and does not care about employees and their needs. Hotel needs to be renovated, rodents are everywhere."
bad,"I would. I was over worked, underpaid, verbally abused, there was no ""team"" at this facility. The managers had no care for your well being and the employees were unkind at every turn."
bad,There is no good communication between the supervisors and employees. Employees throw work at each other and blame one another on their mistakes instead of solving them as a team
bad,"this is not a job to pay the bills, very stressful, if you are not in shape physically don't even bother you wont make the cut.  Management only cares about production and demands perfect quality at a very fast pace, and the union is a pain in the butt."
bad,"Management are bullies, was bullied and my job was constantly threatened due to my disabilities. Had a death in my family and requested time off, was denied and told to put in my resignation."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone.  Workers are forced to join a union.  As a manager, one must be constantly vigilant to union guidelines on participating in the actual labor. You must not!"
bad,"Management is absolutely clueless."
bad,"I did not enjoy working there, because my supervisor did not like that i was from Kentucky. then he harassed me. The management did nothing about the case."
bad,Really bad workplace and really mean people and they had terrible hours and a super unorganized workplace and the coworkers were really rude and lazy.
bad,"Realmente no era ups directamente, sino una franquicia distribuidora."
bad,schedule was very inconsistent. The people that actually worked and rarely took days off was left with the unfinished work of other employees and never recognized for what they did. pay would have been fine if they paid accordingly to what they said.
bad,It's very fast pace. If you don't load fast enough you will lose your job. They usually fire people right before joining union so they can keep hiring and firing people.
bad,Worst job I ever had. Hired for morning shift which would have been fine if it started like I applied for at 4am instead there wasn't a morning that it started at 4am it started more like 2am if not earlier which made it had to balance school. At $10 per hour this was not what I signed up for that was the reason I quit and the other reason was management was horrible all they did was sit in their office I think I saw the manager or assistant manager maybe 1 time in the 4 months I worked their and that was when they hired me.
bad,"Probably one of the worst places I've ever worked . Employees used drugs and left work not clocking out. Boss is a push over. ........"
bad,Delivering packages and business supplies includes surprises such as boxed office furniture and one safe as well as pairs of SUV tires exceeding  the sixty pound limit required at hiring.
bad,physically demanding in non heated or cooled warehouse. loading or unloading trailers as fast as possible. this job demands you work faster then humanly possible not to mention the injuries
bad,"Worked Between 0 and 20 hours A Week"
bad,"Treated like a slave. Awful company to work for. Expected too much for a tiny salary, won't ever work there again. Don't work for them, you'll hate it."
bad,"United Parcel Service is a worthless company to work for. The supervisors were not but teenagers that had zero leadership skills. You also only got a 5 minute break one time per night. Very poor place to work for, especially for poor pay for the work."
bad,There is discrimination going on at this job when I was there but other than that it is a pretty squared away atmosphere and the pay is pretty good as well
bad,"Good company, horrible management. They dont care about you, all they want is their service done. They harrass way too much and at times things get racial"
bad,"As working for ups,I'm pretty sure location matters. Very rude and unorganized staff high and low. Unloading trucks for 5hrs. Or more w/only a ten minute break, and when they mess up your hours they never want to pay you,it's like getting blood from a cactus,no doing! My experience with this company@this location is brutal and a constant reminder of what scams artists look like an are capable of. I wouldn't suggest this job unless your hiding from perfection.#FACTS"
bad,"As a part of the recruitment process they ask you to come for a ""view"" of the job...which is 3h free graft. Wonder how many people go through that before they would fill the position? "
bad,They are inconsiderate of there employes. The management is horrible they lack care for there employes. Its an easy going job to have but lack communication with one another
bad,Nothing but boxes everywhere and the managers think there empolyees are superhuman and you dont get many hours worst job i've had since i came out of high school
bad,"This place over work people, and if you get hurt there they treat you like it's your fault. They also cheat you out of your work hours, if your luck you might get 2 work hours a day."
bad,I worked hard everyday moving over 1000 packages a day and still almost lost my thumb. I was disappointed in management's handling of the situation.No medical personnel was instructed to speak with me. No recommended hospital visit was given. Supervisor was cause of injury.
bad,"people waited until they were assigned a driver to help we would leave usually at 9a.m only Mondays we left earlier. Learned how to use the machine to scan, sign, and release packages. The managers were very organized and handled their work professionally. The workplace was a friendly environment which was very comfortable to work in. The hardest part of the job was to work in terrible weather conditions and move fast. The most enjoyable part was finishing the job and if we worked long hours get some overtime for more pay."
bad,"Seasonal work, they hire a lot off people. when its christmas time they seem to be hiring a lot. I would recommend this company. ps you will be doing a lot of walking"
bad,"they work you like a slave"
bad,"At UPS Freight i was a loader , no one ever came to help if packages were coming to fast. no one really spoke to one another . and it was hard to tell who management was"
bad,would i recomend for ups.  no never work for this company.  they only care about the top bosses and workers are treated like worthless peices of meat.
bad,"People get mistreated there. Management bullies anyone who is not in the UPS union. It is common knowledge there, if you are about to make it to the union, they will fire you beforehand."
bad,"I worked seasonal and only got to work 3 four shifts.  When I got paid they took out the taxes, union dues (two separate amounts) and some amount I owed someone that they couldn't tell me what.. I got a check for $30."
bad,In my honest opinion this was and will most likely be the worst job experience I have experienced I would not work there again nor recommend anyone else to work there.
bad,I applied for a full time position as a graphic designer with a pay of $13hr when signing the paperwork the owner at the time was the current manager told me after the 90 day training period we would discuss about benefits and payment. Well I went through the 90days but the problem was even asking about it the owner refused to give me full time even though I completed everything he told me everything i needed to  do to get full time.  I will never work for ups again all they do is hand out false promises such as full benefits then refuse to give you them after the 90 days.  Currently I am in the process of finding a new job and one where they don't treat their employees like garbage.
bad,"They don't care about you and how hard you work, you could have a heart attack in front of them and they will let you go and find some one else to replace you. Find someone they can use as a Guinea pig to move packages, that's all they care about is how fast they can move packages not about you. Trust me as I'm writing this December 30th 2016 they let me go at 5 in the morning been there almost half a year, the employees are great the people you work with but the full time supervisors could care less about you, not worth your time,the part time supervisors are awesome"
bad,"Terrible management"
bad,"-Old fashioned company "
bad,If they don't like you they will do anything to make you quit. If you mess up or u do something wrong they won't even tell you they'll just mess with you. They all just go after the people they hate for their entertainment and they gossip like school girls
bad,"as my personnel experience , I really don't have anything good to say . I feel I was badly treated there . but not saying all is bad . for some other people it could be good ."
bad,"Hired me, and never gave me hours.  Told me to go home and that they'd call me in the morning, 3:30 in the morning, if they needed me... not to mention, I ride a bike.  So when I call to see if I still have a job, they don't know who I even am!"
bad,"Hot/Cold Depending On The Weather"
bad,Inhoudelijk is het bedrijf alleen uit voor eigen behoeften. Daarbij werd helemaal niet gekeken naar het personeel. Mij werd een vast contract beloofd. Dit was mondeling besproken daarna trokken ze het in. Dit heeft mijn respect voor het bedrijf geschaadt.
bad,"Company has its own payroll systems, so any previous payroll experience is of no use. They celebrate the mediocrity of tenured associates who have no education, drive, nor ambition to do anything else. All while monitoring your every move.  Office cliques are rampant, due to most people having started working shortly after high school.  Expect low pay with long hours - hopefully the extra overtime during peak season can carry your extreme boredom for the next 15-20 years before your next promotion."
bad,"Over worked underpaid and under appreciated "
bad,Be prepared to be thrown under the bus if you work for this company.  Especially if you are PT management.  The standardized test to take for a full time position is ridiculous.
bad,"Beware and stay away. No good work climate. Poor training. Aweful management. Empty promises.  Unprofessional, unethical and they treat their employees as what they think they are: replaceable"
bad,"if you are looking for a caqreer at ups, management is NOT the way to go. becoming and staying a member of the union is the only real path to success. management starts at part time, and promotions are not based on merit, they are based on a series of tests and tryouts that do not showcase the applicants true knowledge and talent."
bad,Ik heb er geen positieve indruk van gekregen. Het was een bedrijf met Amerikaanse instelling en zeer foute leiders. Het bedrijf was er nog niet zo lang en alles moest nog waarschijnlijk op orde komen. Rommelig en naast de schoenen lopende leiding
bad,Katastrophal...Moderne Sklaverei..was soll ich den Noch sagen wer dahin geht dann selber schuld
bad,People rude and playing politics...bad experience as I was hired for referal fee via police tracking ..never work for this place as politicians rule this place
bad,Isci sirtindan para kazanan uluslararasi duzensiz bir firma
bad,"bad bad bad bad. Treated bad, respected bad, managements bad. Its just all bad there. The workload is way to much for the people and everything together is just horrible."
bad,"Not a safe working environment. High risk low reward. Management expectations are far too high. You are to not only do the work of supervisors but also the work of other positions. Told to fabricate paperwork on a daily basis. Told to fabricate the lunch hours that we are unable to take. Not able to follow the UPS ""standards"" and safety precautions set."
bad,"A typical day at UPS involved being around people who complained all of the time. I learned that UPS has its good qualities, but a thankless job. Management has zero personal skills. They create a culture of making the drivers miserable. The hardest part of the job was the job, very demanding, but also rewarding in the sense that you know you gave an honest day's effort. The most enjoyable part of the job was being out and meeting people."
bad,I got a call for an interview and was told they needed to hire someone immediately!! I hurried to get to the interview with very short notice and to my surprise it wasn't management that interviewed me... I followed up for 3 days straight and got the run around.. this is the second time this has happens to me with this company!!! With them you are hired only for who you know..
bad,Terrible place to work. starting wages are a joke management is a joke If you happen to work its a low mileage run waste all night and barely make $100
bad,"i hate this place because of poor mangers and lack of customer service, the management does not care about their employees all they care about is getting that dollar and over charging the customers"
bad,"Working for UPS was terrible, first they don't allow facial hair of any kind except for a mustache.. What year is this? Business men have beards and it has become a style for many men. Such an archaic rule system. "
bad,"Hallo!"
bad,"I was there for a month, they took me off schedule for an entire week without letting me know and expected me to live off of $100 checks."
bad,"Absolutely horrible.  If you like low low pay,  no hours, and  ridiculous management  this is the job for you.  They hire you for one thing then change your job description to suit their needs. Loader positions are for the brainless."
bad,"A day at ups was the worst. I never really liked that job but i have things in life that had to be done. Working at ups I've learned that a job is not suppose to be fun. The management was terrible, my coworkers was the only reason i liked coming to work. Working at ups was very hard for me because everyone that worked there were men. So you're dealing with comments everyday, jokes about not being able to do certain things, it was just a lot. The most i enjoyed about my job is my breaks and being able to go home."
bad,"Franchise Owner is a joke. Fires people illegally, makes you work long hours with no overtime, abuses his employees and stock by forcing free work constantly. Do NOT work for the one in Vernon."
bad,Working here was complete not fun. they take up half your check taxes plus union fees. getting paid only half of check when I was working 7-8 hour shifts also it is very competitive and they do not acknowledge their employees. I am never working their again
bad,"was promised a part time job permantely, but was let go after the seasonal position was done. i really didnt care for this job."
bad,I didnt like the job. The pay was horrible and management were all drug addicts who did nothing but yell at us. I did learn to build a great wall and I got really strong working there. I enjoyed the workout though.
bad,At the beginning of my day I discussed what activities or groups were scheduled to be served. I discovered early on the demands of  serving members that were upset over some recent changes In dues. Great managers that seemed interested in my success at the beginning. My associates had been there a number of years and had learned each members number and name which was expected of me to do in a short period of time. The hardest part of the jobs was working behind the bar. With very little bar tending experience I was required to learn all types of mixtures in a short period of time. The job was always stressful.
bad,great people you work with - the company is run by ups package managers that do not know freight - they try to micro manage every one
bad,This job was personally disrespectful of me and other people of color. I was not able to advance from part time due to politics and favoritism. In a typical day of work I was asked to do the most strenuous work while others were let slack off.
bad,i hated working there. the co workers was ok to work with but management was really bad. the hardest part of the job is that it was hard to get a washroom break
bad,great place to start building your resume and gaining the knowledge of how you would use different skills and how you would apply them.
bad,"easy day"
bad,"Every single day was,a battle to go to work and stay the day through  every co worker was very opinionated in the worse ways,not friendly Very laborious work back breaking and mind warping If you decide to do this type of work you better be in good shape and have lots of patience's I was glad when the day was over I did not won't to go back I knew I had to find something much more flexible and atmosphere friendly I enjoyed nothing here."
bad,I really had fun working with different groups at ups I really enjoy it when we all had to help each other out. when one person make any mistake we always have to be there for them
bad,A typical day at work was like I was going to prison in the 1900 and was working as a slave. The work place is dirty and dangerous. Everyday you breath in dust and dirt. I used to blow my nose and black mucus came out. There is no team work. HR does not support you and even offers you to quit if you can't make the job / life balance work. The management are abusive and does not know how to be human and even less respectful. The manual labour is divided in 3 section. 1) People that load / unload the trucks 2) The drivers who we worked for since we loaded their trucks 3) Management. We got in trouble if the packages are not place in order in the truck by the driver and the management. We constantly have to fight management with the aid of our union who was understaffed and each pre-loader was overwhelm with the work load. As a consequence of the work load we would not even help each other. I left the job and remained with physical damages that took almost 2 years too heal after working 9 months only. Police were called because employees used to fight and even managers were suspended due to a fight due to racial comments. If there is one thing that I can say about that job is that it made me aggressive and even violent. My wife was afraid of me and could not recognize me. I wish I would have never found that job. It's all about the company and not the people working for it.
bad,"not a fan of management..they are more concerned about saving there own butt,s then safety,or the well being and health of their employees..i should say they are scare of losing their job,s so they will throw anybody under the bus..to save their own neck,s.."
bad,Lacks professionalism co workers yell at each other and lots of cursing.  Too much computer failures and down time to do efficient required work.
bad,it was nice only because it put money in my pocket. it was a temporary job. co-workers were really nice and I enjoyed it. the hardest part about the job was just delivering all those parcels for 12 hours and only getting minimal money.
bad,A typical day at work was an extreme workout ... The environment was less than professional and the typical warehouse dock worker was/is unable to make earn enough money to be self sufficient.
bad,"I've worked for UPS as a driver helper and a package handler. I can say, UPS is the worse place to work at. Management are very unprofessional and unorganized. My experience working there was not so great as I was being criticized by supervisors, being forced to work over time without negotiating and only a 10 MINUTES BREAK. You cannot have a phone with you (even for emergency purposes). I will not recommended to work for UPS."
bad,"THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER WORKED!!! I would not recommend anyone work for ups, they don't care about their employees and they will lose your pay checks."
bad,"wel wat geleerd maar , niet voor ouderen ,,die passen niet bij dit bedrijf"
bad,"Don't be fooled. This is a seasonal only job although they dont advertise it. You will be hired in a group of 4 or 5 people and promised things like benefits, unionized, pension, top rate of pay amongst others. You are only their as a helper to handlencurrent overflow. "
bad,Very Friendly environment.  Can get a little stressful in management.  Great place to work.  Perfect for part time when in school.
bad,I worked the 3rd shift. It was terrible. The warehouse feel just was not for me. Management was also not fair and they were harsh towards their team. Don't work there unless you like being treated like a child.
bad,"A typical day at work would be me getting to the base as soon as i got into the base i was at work immediately. the concept of the job was simple get to work and don't stop until its time to go home, i would work 5 days a week monday -friday. i learned that i needed an education because i wasn't to fond of this job, the supervisor was rough, the co-workers where unbearable the hrs were tiring. I did not enjoy this job what so ever."
bad,"Promotion process is very subject and is quota based. It's not who you know it's what you know. Don't go into management, be a driver"
bad,"great job for a kid or teen trying to get their feet wet, but would not recommend to any adult unless you enjoy being a great slave."
bad,"I worked in a warehouse that received and stored cell phones."
bad,"Rough job, if you're new they'll try to break you by sending everyone home and forcing you to do about four trucks, all alone. Normal warehouse environment, with shady management."
bad,UPS made me so depressed I broke up with my girl of 3 years. I was thinking about offing myself. It was a new aged slaveship.
bad,not promised to work everyday & the mangers suck & the drivers are cocky & if you have any facial hair they want allow you on there truck @ all
bad,"Was a part time supervisor for a year at the hub and it was terrible!  Once the buzzer sounds off, its non stop, go, go, go work. Theres no breaks within the 3 and a half hours of work.  My job was not to touch a box and to make sure each employee was putting away at least 400 pieces per hour.  So if you could imagine someone cracking a whip behind you while you work, thats what it is to work for ups.  They dog you!  They never gave me enough people to do the work and expect your people to run 400pph and do it all but its impossible when the boxes are flowing at a rate of 2500 pieces per hour and I only have 3 loaders which are supposed to be putting away at least 400pph(only the most athletic people are able to do this) and if you do the math....400×3=1200.....it doesnt add up.  There no proper training, they throw you in the fire and fudge/fake your training paper work saying they trained you which is a lie.  Then they will write you up if you touch a box or help...which is impossible not to help because you see these poor guys getting buried with boxes and they want you to yell at them more to put the boxes in a ""perfectly built wall in the truck"" that they half as train you to do and expect everyone to do it pperfect. Its very stressful because they want you as a Supervisor to do your paperwork, train, set up, check trailers, put fake packages in trucks to see if employees will catch it,  ask employees load methods while they are trying to work( yes they give you homework to memorize),  put percents in, etc...but how when you have to help your team put away those boxes in"
bad,"UPS Freight is a horrible place. They have no positive reinforcement. The training is virtually non-existent. They throw you to the wolves and expect you to fend for yourself. Then they beat you down every day when you don't meet their expectations. For the most part the drivers and dock workers aren't bad, but being a hardcore union environment, it can get a bit confrontational. The main problem is the upper management. Even when you do good on an audit they still want you to discipline your employees. Just a horrible work place."
bad,"A month ago I went to an interview and the HR secretary seems to have an attitude and always on the phone, listening to music and talking to someone for the longest time when people are waiting preciously for 30 minutes, waiting for her to finish her conversation. UPS needs to fire her. Very poor."
bad,"Great company, under pay."
bad,"Horrible HD dept., Unprofessional supervisors. They do not pay you when your supposed to then try to say it's your fault."
bad,"No room for growth. Employees unhappy in call center. Training was a joke. Training is wee hours of the morning. Tests or assessments given at 3 am. Strictly about numbers, no real concern for employess."
bad,"Awful management, typical disconnect between logistics systems and practical use sometimes making job safety an issue as well as overwhelming expectations. Long and stressful shifts when not managed properly or when co-workers fail to carry their fair share of weight."
bad,"Don't work here. "
bad,"If you work hard and finish your work load, you pick up the slack for the people who can't handle the work. This happened every day, every week. They hire new people and instead of moving me to my requested position, they give it to the new hires instead. They weren't even trained properly and just made my already difficult position even more difficult by not doing their job correctly. Managers  are rude and yell at you, they don't care if you're tired or hurt."
bad,"Do not recommend UPS Freight Carteret, NJ for employment consideration. If considering UPS, I would suggest applying under the UPS small package umbrella...."
bad,I would come in greet my co-workers the I would go in get my area prepared for the day. Then I would ha an Am meeting then I would go and get my area prepared for the day. Then I would unload in a timely fashion.
bad,"I was only there for a short amount of time. I did not find the Franchise to be worth while working for. There were no polices or procedures, The boss was a pervert and the lady in the front was having temper outburst on a daily basis. Once the seasonal position came to a end , I was happy to leave."
bad,"UPS is the worst company i ever worked for. Management is clueless, they hire you as full time worker and then give you work for 2/3 days a week, and every morning you have to call them an hour before your shift to see if they have work. That is the reason their 70% of new hires leave jobs."
bad,Starting out for this company was stressful. You had to meet the driver at different locations. The employment was short and may work long hours during the day.
bad,"Was promised 5 hours minimum and then only given 4 hours when transferred to closer building. Work flow was increased and new hires were given easier positions with little to no training, causing work to be more hectic and more stressful. Yelled at several times by management when my technique wasn't what they wanted, although I always finished my workload before everyone else and helped others with their workload. 10 minute breaks in between two non stop hours of working on a conveyor belt."
bad,"Do not work here. If you decide to, do not go into management. Union employees make more than us in the long run, have health insurance 5x (no exaggeration here) better than us, and you will be blamed for results of factors out of your control."
bad,"Overall, great company. Old culture, needs to be more innovative with their work practices and employee advancement policies."
bad,This location in Freedom Pa makes their employees work 12-14 hours a day with only a half hour break and two 15 minute breaks. Plus they want you to come in on Saturdays for 6 more hours. If you're not willing to work these hours they will fire you. There is no consistency or communication between supervisors. A lot of favoritism and discrimination. You have to wear specific attire and keep your hair short. It is a very demanding job and they don't value their employees. No chance for hire from temp.
bad,"The retail store in Cutler Bay in the Southdade shopping center is a horrible place to work. The owner is rude/ungrateful and could care less about anyone or anything. All the owner is concerned about is taking peoples monies. NO breaks are offered , even when they see you working past 8 hours,  The owner will do or say anything to get employees, after they are hired you see the ""real"" person . The owner is fake and insincere and tries to buy your friendship.  The owner does not feel like anybody could succeed in life or do better. She's unsure of how you can even survive without her money. She's like to remind you its her money and if it wasn't for her you would not  have . The turn around is hilarious and she could care less. She's unappreciative to the people that actually care and have feelings. She talks/makes fun of customers, charges extra, oh boy I can keep on going . Unless your desperate for quick cash, do not give this owner the pleasure. you'll regret . Her biggest concern in life is, where her next meal will come from and who will go get it for her."
bad,I didn't like working as a drivers assistant because the hours weren't promised but the pay was decent only down fall is the hours and not having a time schedule
bad,"The UPSers are awesome people.  I was the best loan officer they ever had and who took time to explain situations to the members.  Per the members, I made a light shine at the CU.  I always said hello to everyone who walked thru the door and got to know a majority of the membership.    They made me part time for a year, lead me to believe along with the board members that i was going to stay.  Then they laid me off.  Most of the people who work there are hispanic.  I believe the CEO did not want me around for personal reason."
bad,"management very unprofessional .long hard work little pay ..minimum wages is not except-able  for that hard rigorous work ,they should at lease pay 12.50 an hour   ..they never made you feel welcome or appreciated.. big turn around because of little pay. if upper management smiled more and greeted there employee s..im sure more folks would stay!!!!"
bad,they told me i would work one job that would work with my kids and on my first day i was switched without any notice. they didnt give you any notice of over time.
bad,I loved working here. it was hot then it was cold on some days. the management was very poor. I did meet some new people that was very fun & interesting. they made working in that warehouse fun & worth staying at. It wasn't hard at all because I love a job that can keep me working because that's something I love to do.
bad,"Terrible hours, terrible manager. Terrible sales associates. Only good thing is the graphic designers.The facility is always cluttered. The management is unprofessional. checks come late."
bad,played me like a trombone made me look like a fool kept it going too don't believe anything managers tell you or supervisors they sold their soul to the devil
bad,Unfortunately this company values making money over anything else .They dont care about their customers or employees.
bad,"work for four hours a day"
bad,Very difficult hours and it is hard to advance.  You must be dedicated and willing to work odd hours in out of the way locations to advance.
bad,"UPS Edmonton North, worst place ever to work, I worked with them for almost one year but, and they will treat like a slave, they tell you to stay home while they give your work to the new people that they hire. I hear it was a good company before but now they hired uneducated staffs that have any pity the employees, they just trying to fire old employees to get some bonuses. I do not recommend this company for anyone because its really stressful and they will yell at you like a kid all day long. Unfortunately, they don't give any insurance coverage before on year. They will promise you many thinks remember that the profit here is more important than human beings. they looking for the cheap labor to use and to expel when its little be slow. I thing they will go down one day its my very sad et the most worst experience ever in life. I rather die than going to work for this company. Please run a way from it, they mess up your life."
bad,Come in do your Job & Go home. Worked for me. Learned a lot about safety & Hazmat. Management was there to help.if asked too. Miss my fellow workers. They were all good people. the hardest part of the job was driving in the winter months. The most enjoyable part was the pay check...
bad,"worst work culture they carry. many likes no vacations ever, have to go for office in bad snow day or will be forced to take a day off."
bad,please do not work here and find someplace else youll be waiting 20 years until you actualy make good pay and have a good working environment
bad,"Don't work here unless you like your paycheck going mostly to the unions and their selfish greed. All the people who work here have a self serve attitude. If you get hurt on the line, it's like a slave shop where they whip you to get back to work without the safety and care that humans are originally born with."
bad,"when hired, I was told that I would be working 4 days a week with overtime. There were weeks when I would get a call maybe once or twice.  When I questioned management, I was told to be patient and don't quit, the work would pick up."
bad,"When I was employed in United Parcel Services I know that my work will be more complex & pressure since it was a well structured company but then, in return I know for sure that I will gain more knowledge. As time passes by, I enjoyed everything during my employment. My Job, co-workers, the activities & so forth. I may say that UPS is worth it to invest your time & your career especially when you are a fresh graduate or even if you are looking for a long term career. But like the other company, you should also expect that it's not always easy. there are times that you need to solve a problem. The hardest part of my job was facing the irate caller or my clients but at the end of the day, it's about how you communicate with them to settle the problem."
bad,"i do not like it here. got hired as full time. my boss fires some people, never rehires anyone and chages my hours drastically."
bad,"Multiple shifts. I worked 1AM to 10AM for a year, then switched to 1PM to 10PM for another rotation. The job conflicted with personal life and overall sleep patterns! Work conditions were poor. I was required to wear a full suit in a dusty, poorly climate controlled warehouse environment, walking over 100 yards to reach my team's operation multiple times a day without a laptop. The facility is extremely cheap when it comes to computers, and a professional environment. The union also gave mgmt a hard time."
bad,"You have to be able to adapt to change, I learned so much working here in my 8yrs, co-workers are great, management is unorganized"
bad,"Very hostile work environment. Feud between management and union workers. A constant power struggle. They have unrealistic expectations as far as speed of production and will constantly harp on you about one of three things; your speed, your work ""quality"", your safe work methods. They claim to stress safety as their number one priority but will continually harass you to load faster. If they see you not following one of their work methods exactly they will try to demean you by trying to make you do push-ups or squats in front of them and count out loud. Management is always talking down to workers with condescension and it's obvious that many of them are power tripping and just get off on being able to control people, they act like it is the military and they are drill sergeants. Management is so far up their own and will force you to memorize and recite on command their cult like rhetoric. The pay is lousy you only make about $160 a week and you will be sore and fatigued from the work when you're not there. Before you get approved for seniority (after 70 working days) management will try everything they can to get you fired. They tell you to report it if you feel any sort of pain or discomfort or get even the slightest injury but if you do they talk down to you about ""not following work methods"" and threaten to fire you or will just simply lay you off like they did me (and others that I worked with) because we reported wrist pain. Hands down the worst job I have ever had."
bad,I was told my shift was being omitted but I was not offered alternate shift as promised by trainer. Upon showing up ready for work I was asked if I wanted the day off due to lack of work available.
bad,"Excellent Co. to represent"
bad,This was my very first job that I started and worked right up until I left for college.  By the time I returned to the area this store was sold to a new owner.
bad,I started entry level and was fed a lie about my pay. Management will do everything possible to get you to work but do not help at all when pay day comes around. They expect you to work without pay. I currently have an open case with the department of labor.
bad,the work environment is hostile and demoralizing where management keeps pushing your for greater numbers everyday to the point of self exhaustion
bad,"Being trained to do one thing and yet seeing the entire staff doing something else, PART TIME SUPERVISORS ARE ON SALARY, I hesitate to say that although meijer and walmart's pay are slightly lower, they treat their employees MUCH better! Oh yeah forgot to mention that recently a contract was passed at the company extending the wait to get health benefits from 90 days to 1 YEAR!!!!! I'd say the only benefit of working at the company is the workout you get, that's IT! So yes, the time has come for me to bow out."
bad,"This Good job for teenagers who don't have much to pay or support a family. Otherwise, skip over UPS."
bad,"love the family feeling "
bad,"horrible "
bad,"The UPS Data Center in Mahwah appears to be a hub for egotistical managers that are too good to speak to you without an appointment.  The people managing the departments in this facility do not have any concerns about work experience.  You MUST have a degree, and that is final."
bad,"not even worth my time to write a review of how bad UPS is. a normal day at ups means that you clock in and immediately get to work, you are expected to do and outrageous amount of physical work in a very nasty environment."
bad,"This was a very long time ago, but an intense working environment."
bad,Every day was tough. I learned how to properly pick up and move heavy boxes. The hardest part was definatly the lifting some days we had to lift boxes up to 90 pounds and in a timely manner.
bad,use high travelled lanes of traffic delivery times not compatable with departure times
bad,You get assigned to a belt and then they can throw you anywhere. They dont listen to what a doctor has to say. They get in your face and yell at you. Very unorganized and the management is not very knowledgeable.
bad,"This job was definitely a good workout, but was quite dangerous and if your body is not ready for it, there is not a lot of time to catch up."
bad,"A typical day went fine. The only complaint I have is never knowing when work will be available. I didn't always have a dependable work day, sometimes I would start late and sometimes I would get sent home early, due to lack of work available."
bad,"Everything about this job was terrible. Starts at a low wage with many unfulfilled promises from your management team. The owner and managers only care about themselves and their customers and how much they make for their own pocketbooks. The owner drives a brand new Mercedes and dodge challenger and doesn't want to even give employees any benefits. "
bad,it was an ok job.to may promese that never came true.never seen boss.the the co-workers never spoke
bad,Never work for ups. You never get hrs and it takes 10 years or longer to make any money and get full time.
bad,"Not for normal people didn't like working conditions managers are so negative supervisors crack the whip and you work on there pace which is the pace of the belt your at,hate ups."
bad,This job consisted of lifting heavy boxes and stacking them in semi-truck trailers.
bad,Working in uncomfortable environments everyday then going home to shower and having black snot come out your nose. Lost a lot of weight that I didn't need to lose working here
bad,They were very unprofessional and didn't really show concern for their employees
bad,Ups has zero job security.Lack off work all the time they didnot have any training  programe for new employes
bad,"Walk around properties to make sure no one trespassed, any weather condition"
bad,"UPS loaders work like a slave while being told to work harder. My experience was horrible. My supervisor was incompetent and lazy, I can not speak for other supervisors, however, mine was power drunk and refused to be reasonable. The trucks were extremely hot and conditions were inhumane."
bad,"This is a very shady company, don't apply here at all you will regret it."
bad,"helping customers with there packages,selling products."
bad,schlechtes Arbeitsklima Keine geregelten Arbeitszeiten kein gleichmäsiges gehalt und sehr viele Abzüge
bad,I never received a check with my total amount paid to me for what I worked. Everything there was always backed up and they underpaid me. I was told that the wages that I did not get weren't coming and it wasn't anything I could do. This is by far the worst job as far as how they handled paying or not paying me my money I went to work so hard for.
bad,"riding along delivering parcels door step to doorstep is not that bad, although when working another manual labor job on top can make it a lot more difficult. some drivers take advantage of seasonal worker help by making them deliver every package. With peak season and high volume in the work truck this is typical and drivers will do it if you let them."
bad,"The work enviornment is chaotic at best. "
bad,the mangent in this work place could be butter.hour was ok.the pay nut that well
bad,Management hired to many seasonal employees resulting in me not going to work. Management told me they were using insiders to pick up. Having me locked in to this no where job unable to look for work. Management told me are contactally obligated to the union. I told them not to blame the union for their failure with their hiring practices.
bad,Wasn't  organized at all!! I felt used when I worked for the company.
bad,sorting mail. loading the trucks. information not explain good enough.
bad,Prepared set-up for unloading of incoming trailers. Assisted drivers with loading trucks for delivery. Assisted in maintenance and continuous clean-up of warehouse
bad,"went to work came home"
bad,"-Full time workload in a part time shift for 8.50/hr for first 40 days then $9 an hour afterwards for a year"
bad,My day consist of riding in a package truck locating packages and delivering them. Very physical
bad,"Not paid enough for the hard work you have to do, they really dont care about there employees unless you get injured and its there fault."
bad,was hired for one position and got another without notice/ couldn't get anyone to train me/ had every intent on working here for a long time but instead was bullied and made fun of/ constant talking behind my back/ was like working with children/ never learned a thing
bad,You work very hard unloading the trailers for a very low pay. Never again.
bad,work alot for 8.00 an hour . alot of mail some rude people so that all over the world. would not get your whole 40 hours
bad,"UPS Operations management is probably the worse move someone can make career wise. UPS has 0 work-life balance, and you are treated as you are worthless. I would not recommend working at UPS to my worse enemy."
bad,"the UPS SCS corporation is by far the worst company I have ever ever worked for, management is incompetent and so are leads, my 1 yr experience there was shocking and trying because of the shady and confrontational employees and the fact that management will turn the cheek and will ignore all issues as long as work is taken care of, it is a very manual labor position that pays close to minimum wage and no matter how hard you work and give your'e 100% you will still get a .15 cent raise, employees that been there 15-20 yrs have gotten max of .20 cent raises with no room for growth!! I can assure you that the SCS corporation is a subsidiary company of UPS BROWN BOX service and is not ran like it, the turn over rate is crazy at 3 employees a month quitting, I don't know but to me that's a lot of unhappy employees and a lot of RED FLAGS!!! One thing that the H.R department seems to forget is that they are there for the employees and not help management hide things!!"
bad,"On any given day, I'd drag myself into work. This was a 3rd shift position and over time we began coming into work earlier and leaving later. Management was horrible. I did not know the full name of my manager or the name of my supervisor during my duration there. I was given no formal training when working, and was often ridiculed for my performance. My co-workers were just as bad. Employees often complained about their job, work conditions, and management. The hardest part of my job was dealing with all of the negativity. The most enjoyable part of my job was aiding other employees when they needed my help."
bad,I worked at the Indiana PA location and they are just plain nasty to work for. They try to intimidate you as much as they can. And when you do something wrong they scream at you like you're a worthless fool. It's no wonder they can't keep anybody. Stay away at all costs.
bad,"I applied for an online posting for a position, interviewed and was hired for this position.  After I agreed on the salary and started the job, the job duties changed and I was required to perform duties which I had not agreed to or were qualified for.  HR said they would not change the pay rate or job requirements.  After months of employment I NEVER had my New Employee Orientation.  This is a very respectable company on the outside, until you get inside - beware of the Bait and Switch!!"
bad,"the company is currently on bankruptcy,. i do not recomend it"
bad,"surpervisors are a joke if they dont like you they will try to write you up for every little thing,but yet they can sleep on the car and do what they want"
bad,"I arrive at UPS at 3:00am park my vehicle. Walk to the security office show my ID to the security guard, go thru metal detector. Clock in upstairs at 3:30am. . Go to a meeting reguarding safety and performance for all employees. After the meeting I report to my station which is unload area. Get my list of trucks for my boss and everything I need for today's off to work I go. I have all my employees meet me outside everyday, I run a meeting with all employees so I can let them know what they have to accomplish for today to meet UPS goals and how well they did the following day. Learned to deal with people in all different aspects of there life's and Supervising.. Management was very poorly run we never knew who was the person in charge, because they always was changing them. The hardest part of the job is when you know you did a good job and someone try to set you up for failure, not cool. The most enjoyable moment is supervising and rewarding my employees with a job well done."
bad,"little pay, Rude People, dangerous environment, no benefits"
bad,"I loaded packages from the conveyor belt onto ~3-4 delivery trucks. Not only were the hours undesireable (3AM-9AM), but the workload was unbearable. I can understand doing hard labor (constant, heavy lifting) but the speed they expect you to do it at is unrealistic. I'm sure if you could manage to stay here for longer than a month you could get better at it, but it's backbreaking and not worth 9.50/hr IMHO. If they paid closer to 20/hr I wouldn't complain about the hours or workload. Simply not worth it at the salary me and my co-workers were getting paid. That's why you'd always see new hires each week. They exploit cheap labor and rinse and repeat each week. Poor business ethics. Management was always breathing down your neck and talking about audits every minute of the day. Security was laughable...some old foreign guy acting like a super cop at the morning check-in. Underpaid-People-Suffering...UPS."
bad,"no hours and no boss"
bad,"Slavery, build strength and speed, work through stress, bad management, great coworkers, everything was extremely hard, I enjoyed when it was time to get off."
bad,"A typical day at work was horrid. I've learned team work among most things, along with how the factory was being operated. The management are cool understanding people that works hard for the company ,co-workers cool people too. The hardest part of the job was honestly was working at U.P.S. ,the most enjoyable thing about work was that I was able to leave there."
bad,I loved working for this company wish I could've continued but it was only for seasonal.
bad,"My typical day at UPS started at 330am and got computers running for operations. I did address corrections, sorted packages as well as respond to hazmat spills."
bad,"Its the worst job ever....real LEGAL slave work ups is. Back breaking work, non stop, getting yelled at, hot and sweaty one 10 minute break for dirt cheap pay hourly and making the same as a middle school student does weekly?....what!...its crazy garbage."
bad,Horrible hours and unorganized. I never knew when I was working. They would call at 3 AM and let me know if I needed to come to work at 4 AM.
bad,"greet the new hires, make copies of the ID'S, give them a 15-20 minute orientaton. assign the uniforms to each driver."
bad,work hard for little pay. its pretty much whatever they tell you to do you have to do
bad,Management wsvery mean
bad,i hated working at ups while being in high school it was a bad choice by me i would like too be able too work there now though
bad,"I Came to work for this joke company in Ricmond BC, they only offered me 13$/h for 345 deliveries a day."
bad,"This establishment was very unsatisfactory when it came to treating its employees. Also, very low wages."
bad,i worked there and went to school i worked 3rd shift it was so hot they didnt have fans and if you ever had anything over 230lb people would not help you for a long time which got you in trouble plus im pretty strong so i would get two trucks to load things 70lbs and under plus a truck for 70lbs and over then sometimes i would be forced to help others with their 70lb and under truck when all shift know one would help me beacuse it was heavy i didnt like helping lazy people plus most people were mexican and didnt speak english so i didnt know what they were saying
bad,They hired too many exployees.
bad,"I worked at a privately owned UPS Store, so I can not review the company as a whole but my experience was bad, the Owner and Manager were very inappropriate. I didn't fit in, I was trained on the customer is always right policy and believe in great customer service, this place was not a good fit for me :("
bad,"The UPS culture is extemely harsh and stagnate. The sales force is not treated with dignity nor respect. Sales is treated like a step child to all the other departments in the organization including marketing, finance and operations. Work here is not even recommended for an entry level candidate. Their is much internal dysfunction at UPS. The other departments do not work with the sales force and have goals that compete with and impede business development. The sales force spends more time during implementation and the work of other departments than performing sales. Nearly 75% of the organization is comprised of personnel who came straight out of high school or who earned college degrees with UPS from some excelerated forgiveness program. There are no Harvard or Yale business graduates at this organization but just a bunch of former trucker drivers, pre load supervisors, on car supervisors who have been rotated through out the company and dumped into sales management waiting to collect their pension."
bad,Work place is OK...i quit ups in Nov 2012..and still i have not received my vacation pay..when i call them no body no knows what's going on..they told me that IM still a active member in the system. But i already received the ROE. Sucks in paying off what seems to be my money..
bad,"bad overall. discrimination , bigotry, worse managers ever"
bad,Allways hiring drivers for a reson
bad,"Working here your basically wasting time, they under pay and over work you. your not even promised a 40 hour check."
bad,"I worked for ups freight in kc for a little over 1 month, Had trouble getting paycheck stubs, still have not got my last 3. Was let go because my car overheated on way to work, and was a half hour late."
bad,"I worked for UPS seasonally and a typical work night for me was sorting packages from 5 to 100 lbs. For the hard labor that was performed I only got paid around $60 a week. I had union dues taken out of my all of my checks and I got laid off without prior notice. When the holidays approached and the warehouse got busier working conditions became very unsafe. On the narrow sort isle that I worked on we had to stack packages at our feet making it very hard and dangerous to move because the sorting belts were directly behind us. At the end of every night we had to climb onto the belts to make sure there were no packages on them and the belts were very unsafe. We had to crawl under moving belts. There were many trucks inside the warehouse as well which was to be expected, but there was also many fumes in the air which made it hard to breath. Most of the workers had bad backs, limped, and did not appear to be very suitable for that kind of intense work."
bad,"Not much else to say, the environment is toxic, both figuratively and literally."
bad,fast paced cool environmwnt geared more for a single person. not enough pay to support a family off of. If you are single and white it will work for you but only if you meet that criteria!!
bad,I have been working with this company for over 2yrs and they do not want to give me a raise.I am still a temp and I will never be hired permanent.They have poor management and the company is so unorganized.
bad,"Typical work day was meeting up with the driver I was working with. The day then consisted of being told to work faster and not to think outside of the directions that were given to me, only to be criticized if I made the smallest mistake."
bad,"I went into work after school, we meet up for any changes then we get our set trailers and we go at it for 2hrs straight and as fast as we can to keep the others thats receiving the packages on the othe rend of the conveyor belt."
bad,Company difficlut to advance unless you have worked on the ramps while in high school.
bad,"the pay is not worth the amount of work they ask you to do in a day, the supervisors talk to you like you are children, the company itself is very unorganized"
bad,"help load packages in trck for delivery,also go out work driver."
bad,The pay and the labor worked for this company was ridiculous. For all the work you do there and the different roles you have the pay is just sad.
bad,A typical day would be undertaking positions above my pay and not being compensated.
bad,The company does not pay much and does not care if you have a family
bad,I hate it personally. Getting yelled at for something that is not your fault is not fun and in front of customers.
bad,not a good place to work for they will make you stay overtime and not even pay you anything i mean no overtime pay or regular pay you will spend a month or more to get your pay for any missd days that they did not intentionaly pay you.
bad,"Bottom Line, the worst company I have ever been employed with."
bad,it was cool but seasonal. i pretty much had to drive around with a driver and drop off packeges at a million doors in the cold.
bad,Here i was basically in the front with customers. Did not like the manager here they are too picky and i did all that they wanted me too.
bad,Not a good place to work long hrs. Not an equal opportunity co.
bad,a job that's suppose to be a two men job should not be a one man job to where packages weigh more than their weight nor should loads of boxes should fall on their back on a basis
bad,I had to load large bags with boxes of mail all in a timely manner
bad,"In 2001, I was hired on by UPS in Atlanta, GA as a package sorter. It was during the rush at Christmas. I really didn't know what to expect and showed up ready for work that night. The work was amazingly difficult. I was working in a facility without a/c on a truck lifting extremely heavy packages back to back nonstop. As the packages rushed out one after another I began to feel dizzy. Pretty soon I was having a difficult time breathing and I came off the truck and found a floor supervisor."
bad,is a scam they make you work ur but off and take 130 $ for union the you not even belong and you loose that money is not worth it dont do it..
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worst enemy. The culture is very abusive! There’s a lot of unwanted racial slurs and unwanted harassment  it seems that the only way to advance is to sleep your way to the top.Oh yeah also you might get fired for reporting them for not working safely.
bad,I was hired on through the staffing agency training is very poor. Workers are being sexually harassed by leads very unprofessional. And unorganized work
bad,"One Of the worst Management I found in my entire career "
bad,Health care is the only reason to consider working here.  They offer tuition assistance but with the random schedule changes it has never worked for me
bad,"This job is crazy. Scan box, place neatly and organized to build walls inside shipping truck. But you only have 2 seconds per package. If not, you will have managers screaming at you. Chute constantly jamming, so you have to run to the end of a semi, clear it, load all the boxes that fell onto the floor back on The belt, run back to the end of the truck and start scanning and stacking. Impossible."
bad,What once was a great company to work for has spiraled down. Upper district and center level management teams spend more time avoiding work than actually doing any.
bad,"Management has unrealistic expectations, no clear direction, and has the professional atmosphere of a middle school locker room. Not uncommon to hear inappropriate jokes and material from bosses and coworkers. Next major harassment suit right here."
bad,"Vetternwirtschaft ,Sexismus, unfähige Vorgesetzte, unfaire Bezahlung, dreckige Arbeitsplätze"
bad,don't even bother. They dont keep you on the schedule you were told you'd have and the pay for seasonal and i was lucky to make $230 a week along with my schedule being from Sunday night to early Saturday morning while only having Saturday off.
bad,"Bad company for work, stressful, very bad magnament, just liar at the interview long days working never appreciate your job just complain they have for you nothing else."
bad,"The pay and benefits bait you in. The application says work 3am - 9am. Then they try to get you in at 12am - 2am. If you have another job? Too bad, they don't care.. "
bad,"I highly encourage you to not apply unless you don't care how you get treated, or being slaved for minimum wage, or working at an unorganized messy workplace. Flexibility and union benefits are great that's about it. Your lucky if you stay past a month"
bad,Poor management. No room for advancement. This company is concerned with one thing and that is the delivery of their packages. They are not concerned about your health or well being.
bad,"Supervisors have no coaching experience.....they often shout and degrade the employees and threaten their employment instead of coaching them in a practical manner. Supervisors that have a tenure of over 10 years usually will scream, bark and belittle employees that require extra instruction. It's a very fast paced environment which is supposed to be ""safety first"" on a daily basis but it's not even implemented on a weekly basis."
bad,"Very Fast placed, Most of the supervises do not treat workers like human beings. And I had 3 days of on road training, 4th day i was on my own."
bad,"I was hired on as a seasonal driver I call every day and text to see if I'm going to work nobody ever gets back to you. I was told while we were all told that after 5 hours we would make 31.50 an hour since we are seasonal part-time  and they decided no we weren't going to get it, have to be after 9 hours which I did and still didn't get paid. The drivers were told to tell the helpers they would not get paid the get paid the 21.00  hour that they would get compensatedcompensated"
bad,Hard word work. Poor pay. Most supervisors don’t train well and don’t listen. Pay checks are usually wrong. The dispatch manager is awful at his job and makes everyone’s else’s job a nightmare. He takes no accountability for his mistakes.
bad,"All hands on deck approach will be needed to work for this company, great on the job experience you couldn't pay for via a college degree in Supply Chain Logistics."
bad,The compensation was horrible with no benefits. The job culture was terrible. Management was never there and when they were they were not helpful. There was no place for advancement.
bad,Great benefits. Horrible company to work for.. they don't care about their employees at all. Very high turnover rate. Management at most centers are complete jerks
bad,"Took the driver helper position to supplement my income, no one told me that job would require a 12 hour work day. Insanely stressful, long hours, the routes made no sense, we went down the same streets and around the same blocks more than 5 times, at one point we went down the same dead end street for two separate drop offs that were right next to one another. I feel like the days would've been much shorter if whoever made the routes knew what they were actually doing. it took use an hour in all of 3 neighborhoods to deliver all the packages there, it took us another 5 hours to deliver all the packages in a 5 block radius because we kept going in circles. At one point i rolled my ankle because the drop from the truck was higher than i was anticipating, when asked if i could take the rest of the day off to go to the hospital, i was told ""no, i had to work my full day or recieve no pay."" so i rode around the rest of the night in intense pain. And my drive lost my time card at one point, he just laughed it off like it was nothing. this is not a company i would ever work for again. there was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"Company has no respect for employees or their well being . "
bad,Some managers there don't like women. They lie and make you mad to try to get you to work harder. Favoritism is very much alive there. They do not encourage growth and do not support their workers. Plus so much more.
bad,"This company was absolutely horrible! I’m not sure if it was only the location I worked at, but the management was horrible one supervisor was absolutely the worst. He did nothing, he has unmotivated, and much more. I have never felt so unhappy, and treated so poorly from a employer like I was here."
bad,"Management does not know how to speak to employees. Always Rude."
bad,disappointed in UPS as a company in how certain workers are treated compared to others. Certain employees are over worked and under appreciated. too much favoritism and unfair treatment.
bad,"you wait around for sometimes days at a time to get a call to go work , any time any day and  they treat you like garbage they could care less , the union is a joke no backbone , the dispatchers have more power than the union , they use you during busy season then refuse to lay you off and tell you to find something until they call you in may if and when it picks up"
bad,"You have to go to the office for fully enter the work service to assign you to work after getting your background check cleared and complete the 2 hours session. Then you have to have your phone ready to send text messages for your assing leader to meetups and time to working as a helper with given details. For holidays- you'll don't get paid at all if you're not in the company. You have to provide your lifting gears equip it, brown/black boots for non-slippery shoes only, vest ready, a bag to not lose your cellphone, plain solid apparel clothing, car to drive faster under 10 minutes, and full of energy ready to work."
bad,"ups is not a good place to work, but its a start and it will get you off your feet if you save your check everyday now i say again save ya money people"
bad,"Management is not supportive and too much work load pressure. Work like Govt company and treat the employees like slaves . your manager will not provide any support or solutions but will ask for instant results,,,not at all customer friendly. Very worst company to work with...this company will work in a way that it will make you incompetent, you will lose your confidence..."
bad,"Mentally destructive work environment, poor management and pay that does not equal the work put in. Many came to me suggesting how great UPS was so I decided to give it a shot and regretted every minute of it. Avoid if at all possible."
bad,Work you like a donkey 200 stops a day job not made for a human union a joke they just take your money and do nothing for you management like being in prison
bad,"I'm gonna keep this pretty simple. You get 5 day work weeks. Thats Monday- Friday. Get $10 an hr. Sounds great right? Wrong. You get 3 1/2 hours of work. If you're on night shift like I was, its not guaranteed 3 1/2 hours. I was unloading trucks. 1-70lbs you pick up, but they still find a way to make you deal with things heavier than that. Bottom line, I would work hard and only make 125 a week. Stay away from ups if you wanna move anywhere in life."
bad,Supervisors have no feelings all they care about is numbers. Your health is not there concern..........................................................
bad,There is no work life balance the union is there too keep the company safe and if you dare challenge anything involving the union or the company you'll be fired within two weeks and the expect that ups comes before your health and your family not a company to work for in my opinion
bad,"Training was totally over the top. a week in the UK at driver school inc uniform inspections nuts. none of the training of any use. driving test every year."
bad,"23 years there, best thing I ever did, quit!  The money is not worth the stress and torture,.!  This company will destroy  you mentally. Dont ever work here , ever. Dont do it. !!!!!"
bad,Pretty much my job was too far. I quit n still have not gotten my final check i dont recomend this job to anyone ever. Union was shady and the whole place in general was very un organized and stressful. I would cry at night becuase my legs and back hurt so bad.
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"The management doesn’t care anout most workers. They pick their favorites and don’t do something as simple as follow a medical note. I witnessed a prenant lady working here and they refused to put her on any sort of light performance and when they finally did they would take it away from her. The place is not somewhere I would suggest anyone to work unless you want to be taken for granted, not treated fairly, and not given the respect you should. While they don’t drug test, they also don’t give you any opportunity for overtime. The managers and supervisors are never on the same page and always give different instructions leading everyone to be confused. NOT a good place for employment."
bad,"I can't work there anymore. They treat somebody so bad especially the supervisor . There is some segregation. There,  I  can't recommend someone there i had a bad experiences"
bad,"@ $14 per hour, working several trucks, only 3-4 hours per day. Extremely heavy (50+) lbs and fast paced. Trying to squeeze blood out of a rock. Also promotions based on favorites."
bad,"The temps make more than you."
bad,"Really low pay to start off,fast pace and very stressful,management doesn’t know what their doing,they don’t work you everyday and have to wait for that call every morning to see at what time your going or if you was even going to work.wouldnt recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Highly unorganized place. That place is an accident waiting to happen. 100 degrees outside and no break at all. Poorly paid for work performed. I highly recommend running far away from this place!!!
bad,Came in as a seasonal left due to the mistreatment and constant punishment from the working conditions and the job requirement. I do not recommend this is a career path.
bad,"UPS sucks.  They will promise you everything and give nothing.  Castleton, IN location was a joke.  Chaotic and too many chiefs with not enough Indians..."
bad,If you are going to work here you would be better off joining the military. They give you “discretionary days” instead of sick days and can deny them and then write you up for missing work. Won’t let you take your vacation. Work 35 hours a week as a part timer but won’t open up full time spots. Takes about 8 years to go full time without a CDL.
bad,Left the company because I got bite by a dog and well supervisor and managers where laughing at me when it happened and well situation got worse because the owner of the dog was from a gang and I explain the company policy to him he got more aggressive so my coworker told me to go to the van instead and it got worse after that
bad,Very fast paced and within the second day of work after training they had me loading 6 trucks by myself because an employee didn’t come in and to top it off I was doing preload so 2 trucks would usually leave for an hour or 2 and I would have to floor stack until they came back as well as keep the steady flow of the belt going.
bad,Management sucks. Performing back breaking work. Disrespectful. Not tattoo friendly. Will follow you on route an randomly try to catch you slacking off at work to write you up. Constantly yelled at for doing your job at a safe pase. Will tell you to hurry up even if you are ahead so you can go help others who slack off all day. Mandatory helping others. You cant just finish your work an go home. Start as early as 9am an stay out as late as 11pm
bad,"The management was very unhelpful, rude, and didn’t care about the employees feelings. The store owner used the employees as personal assistants and had them walk her dogs. Micro management without the knowledge they truly need to run a successful business."
bad,Employees and managers would fight and argue with each other all day mostly over who needs to move where and who can help who the best but the managers really didn't know how to separate and move people properly
bad,If I could give this place less than 1 star in some aspects I would. They basically treat you like you’re not human. A male dominated work environment with very little room for growth.
bad,"you walk in to your work area knowing you'll be treated poorly, yelled at to work harder, then ordered to punch out at the earliest opportunity; you are literally punished for working harder. "
bad,"i would never work here again. Horrible staff, unsettling culture , loud and chaotic environment. ask to move up to management and they move someone who just got there up before you. Try to fire you for being a minute late or calling in sick. Judgmental and expect you to work the hardest if they don't like you for no reason at all. completely a waste of time."
bad,"Everyday is torture at UPS. They have the strangest hours to work and they try to give you as little time as possible. It's very fast paced, loud, dirty, and physical. About 90% of the people are always angry for one reason or another. It's a very toxic atmosphere, literally with the car exhaust. They talk big on safety but when it effects production, safety is out the door. Management is not going to be your friend and neither is human resources. There is little chance for advancement because they go based on seniority. The only good thing I will say is the benefits but they work you to death for it so you will need it. These days you might as well work for Walmart or McDonalds, you make the same amount and it's ten times easier"
bad,Run fast from this union company. low pay to start on call managment that is disrespectful. start at 17 hr up to 28.68. work mostly the dock instead of drive. drive maybe half a shift. managment that acts like Highscoolers!! grow up were adults. b.s. safety meetings. managers and supervisors follow you throughout your work day. which is harrassment in my book. really dont know how to run an LTL company. should have never bought into freight!
bad,"Management used to be good until the new management today, they don't care about the people only production. They don't care about your safety only the numbers that can be produced and they don't care about job advancement if you don't look to their liking if you know what I mean. This place is stressful, few good people, but lots of bad that makes the majority."
bad,"8 hour days - pushed to the limit. Not an enjoyable place to work."
bad,"Depending on the hub, it is quite stressful and you can forget about your life outside of work. The hours are brutal and you'll get the slightest write up for calling in sick."
bad,"The training for loaders is a joke. They “test” you but literally give you the answers. They don’t care if you know safety protocol at all. They just want you to be as fast as possible. They don’t provide anything to help you lift. Items that say “team lift” you will always lift alone. They treat the people unloading the semis like garbage so they mess up. Then that makes the jobs of the loaders that much harder. And that makes the drivers like that much harder. If you’ve ever seen the episode with Lucy and the chocolate conveyer belt...imagine that but instead of chocolate you have boflexes, printers, totes of magazines, and mattresses coming at you. And the worst part, the harder and better you work the less you get paid! You literally have to clock out early when you’ve done a great job. The whole place is such a joke. The day I was able to quit was one of the best days of my life."
bad,"If, you are working in UPS or planning to work there so, my friend that's the worst place to work. Poor environment and Poor Management. They always hiring. Lack of staff..."
bad,"A part time job only good for students ."
bad,"I had two pairs of brand-new gloves stolen from me on separate occasions, and the person who did it was in my face laughing about it. The man had a problem with any white guys working in there. When I reported the theft the second time, management did nothing, acted as if I was the problem. Benefits are literally the only reason why most people stay employed in the warehouse area of UPS. Terrible work environment."
bad,"I worked 2 days and it was 2 days too long. I was hired to work the evening shift from 5pm to 11pm. I told them that I had school and could not do more hours at hiring. The second day, I started at 4:45pm and at 11:30pm I went to ask my supervisor if I could leave because I had to wake up at 5am for school."
bad,U have two days off work cos it ill and had to rush to hospital cos my mum was rushed there and they sack u for it. They treat u like  dirt and bully the drivers
bad,"Minorities are held back, even if you have previous work experience and college degrees. UPS does not pay well. The culture is not fair. It's like a fraternity/sorority due to indirect and discreet hazing rules."
bad,You are worked like you are a slave.  Constant yelling from the supervisors to hurry up and load a trailer by hand. The culture is the worst.Nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,"UPS was the worst place ive ever worked and i dont ever intend to work there again, i was pregnant and they wouldnt give me a break when needed and expected me to go till the end of the day and would complain about bathroom breaks"
bad,"Ups exists solely to push as many packages thru their sort facilities. It is micro managed to the nth degree. You are not looked upon as an professional journey man tech, but only a controlled grease monkey. Stay far away from any UPS job career as you can. Do not hire on with them because you then are at their total mercy and its brutal. You can be walked out the door anytime during your career or shifted laterally making your life miserable."
bad,It's was a temporary job and it was not what I was expected. You spent too much energy for a low pay at the beginning and there was no specific time to start.
bad,This job told me how to work at a steady Pace and stay focus on what's ahead of you but under paid and try to work youas of you working towards more..
bad,"Terribly managed, constantly had to stop the belt as it was too overloaded with packages, this backed us up even more, causing a never ending cycle. I would sum it up as being overworked, underpaid, & understaffed."
bad,"You are simply number here and expendable.  I worked as part time supervisor for 2 1/2 years. Business Manager says they are changing the hours I work.  I inform him that due to my other job I really can’t (They don’t pay well either, whole $.50 hour raise after a year and a half, so had to have another job) I was told either comply or turn in your resignation.  I walked, best thing I ever did.  Had another job same day making more money.  If you want to be abused and held accountable for numbers a proven flawed system or numbers they routinely manipulate then be my guest.  Personally I would rather work someplace they are not constantly threatening you with your job even when you bust your backside  for them."
bad,"This is a retail store which is productive and fun when the manager is not in.  The manager tends to take up alot of work space with her projects, she can't multi task, and always seen to feel you are intrusive on her work day if you as questions.  She has a need to control all aspects of work which hinders employees from reaching their full potential to be productive.  She is also not the shining example of a person who provides exceptional customer service for either her customers or her employees.  Too bad.  "
bad,"Management don't care about employees. They will try get rid you when finish using you, anyway they can. Because a lot of people are lining up for the job."
bad,"The description for my job was to lift packages up to 70 lbs. and load them onto a truck from 4 AM until 9 AM Monday through Friday. Most often, though, I worked from 2 AM until 10 AM. And whereas most packages were not as heavy as 70 lbs., there were twice as many packages that had to be loaded onto the trucks as the trucks were designed to carry, and I usually packed more than one truck each day. It was below freezing, thee was only one bathroom break in the day, 10 minutes in the middle of the shift for everyone working (about 50 people) to share one men's room and one women's room to take care of business. There was no provided food or water, and the pace was way too fast and for way too long. Sometimes I or another worker would have 30 or 40 packages in a row that we would get off the belt, relabel, carry into the truck and place in the correct spot in the span of a few minutes. Things became very stressful and disorganized, and there were no values or dress code or spirit of excellence or rules against profanity or anything like that. I quit because I wasn't willing to shift my life around to work in such a miserable environment. My manager did a great job balancing it all when people would often just not show up for work or leave early. But as well as he did, more major changes needed to be made. I enjoyed the first part of work when it was still slow and there was still room on my trucks, and then the end of the day when the drivers would come in and help us, so that then we had twice as much manpower and knew we were nearly done. Those middle hours though were really"
bad,they lock the water up from employees it has poor management they do really care about there works safety the management overwork us and workers are underpaid
bad,"The company is highly hypocritical, does not really believe in any of what they say.  Strictly about day to day operations and profitability.  Compensation is good but is continually eroding."
bad,"Working at ups is long hours of physical labor in all weather (heat,snow) easy job with very little quick advancement though the benefits are alright."
bad,"The UPS Store on CU campus is not a place I would want to work again. The training was a joke, it was an hour one day of our daily manager quickly listing stuff off to us. We were expected to learn more on the fly than anything. My main complaint was with the managers I had. They were only there because of nepotism (they were married and related to the owner of our franchise) and they were constantly demeaning to the student staff. They also wouldn't listen if you asked for time off (for exam study or other reason), and they would play favorites with the staff. One girl messed up packages every other day and would just get a talking too, but when another guy messed up a package and accidentally missed a shift he was fired immediately with no warning. Don't work here, its not worth it."
bad,Working for upsas a supervisor  is hands down the worst decision I ever made... do yourself a favor and stay union..little to no regard for safety horrible upper management no work life balance
bad,"The location, I worked for, Forest Park. GA.   I was not happy with the management, the requirements, the expectations nor the pay.  The Forest Park, GA location seemed to be disorganized, upper management does not care or attentive to change or progression for a more stable work environment.  The past Peak Season 2017/2018 was horrible!  And reflected each and every day!  My health and stress levels were out of control and I had to walk away.  6 months later, I am healthy once again!"
bad,"they favored other employees over me, refused to let me work more than 8 hours a week and was hard about teaching me. The manage overall wasnt the nicest."
bad,The employee's at the hub I was stationed at were rude and made it hard to come in to work and to leave. Tried to get help with issues and nothing was ever resolved.
bad,The company Hub is based on yelling and belittling workers and mostly part time sups and minute by minute change of priority. The people are from all walks of life and are good people.
bad,the office was run like a mean girls club. it is a very sad environment. no support from management and a true lack of training and a high turnover rate.
bad,"a typical day at work includes the early bird special 430am- to 930am but in case of longer days typically ended around 1230pm-1pm. I learned its best to stay a union member, manager positions are under compensated, fixed salary wages, no overtime pay, and those positions are constantly being refilled, due to firings, lay off, or some quit. management doesn't care for union workers, or its employees, most workers are under paid, over worked, and vets are left without full 401k/ retirement packages are denied or have to fight for their well earned money, this company is very clique oriented. seniority is a huge aspect of ups policies."
bad,"They will attempt to sell you on working at UPS by saying ""its like a free gym membership"". "
bad,"Typical day for a package handler is working non stop continual heavy lifting , no breaks , management is constantly pushing employees to work faster no matter how hard they are working .Employees freeze in the winter and sweat in summer in the hub . The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving at the end of the shift."
bad,The Westmont plant in Illinois was a sweat shop.It was one of the worst jobs I have had in my life because of terrible leadership. I was pretty much thrown to the wolves with my job and given no real guidance.It is not a shock the company has a big turnover.
bad,They guaranteed a certain amount of hours a week from the start and I never received those hours. I was driving 35mins to them to only work for 2 & a half hours-3.
bad,unload trailers as fast as possible while bald manager does nothing and acts stressed out!Hours suck! Pay sucks! stay away ! if you need a job go to Mcdonalds................
bad,"Average 2 to3 hours each day, they give $100 bonus each week but with the hours its barely over $200 a week! They treat us like dirt, there are no breaks, they dont want to let us use the restroom, there is no a/c or heating, and it always reaks from the fumes of the trucks. If you work fast they expect you to work faster and if you go slower they yell at you and move you to a harder place to work like unloading a trailer by yourself with huge, heavy boxes! People say the job is a work out but its more like workingout the same muscle area for a week strait with no rest and straining the muscles till they hurt. I heard that the insurance was good before i started here but you dont get it till youve been there a year. The union fights just enough to make sure that you continue to pay your weekly dues.! The union is as week as a newborn baby trying to run a marathon. What ups  wants ups gets in the end.  And for management opportunities.  They start from day one telling you how great it is to be in management. I  have never meet  a manager that liked their job. They are the scape goat for upper management. This company has a hard time keeping employees, i started out in a group of around 20 and only 3 are left including myself. This company isn't going to change. My advice is to work for a employee  frendly co."
bad,Very archaic job culture.  Management was not properly developed to enhance their skills.  There is a great deal of favoritism and the need to fit within the culture.
bad,slave drive poor management pay doesnt match with work unfair treatment harrassment try to take advantage of you over worked fully selfish try to use you
bad,Nobody cares about their job here. The only possible benefit to working at UPS is the pay during peak as you can get 70 hours of work in. After peak is over you are lucky to get 25 working 6 days a week. Management has zero training. Employees only care about pay and benefits with no care for their work. Warehouse is entirely unprofessional in conduct and speech.
bad,"As a member of management, your salary is based on a 9 hour work day with the expectation that you work 12-15 hours per day.  The company does not care about you or your family, you are just a number to them.  The pay would be good if you were only working 9 hours per day but when you work 6 days per week and 15 hours per day it does not match."
bad,Treat their employees poorly. Hostile work environment. The company insists on long hours for their management with no compensation. Pay ok but at what cost
bad,"Management is the worst you will every encounter. They only see what they want to see and promote who they want to promote. Unethical practices by management is very normal. Personnel get promoted without job postings, or without requirements met for the position. Great place for suckers!"
bad,"the process to get into the building for a tour took a about 3 weeks itself then another week to start orientation. Head of HR and I agreed on the midnight to 9am shift. First day of orientation they told me I was working the exact opposite shift (10am-10pm)? I went the first few days and the supervisors were very unprofessional and immature talking about drugs and what not, absolutely nothing related to work. Packages are NOT handled with care by any means. I met maybe 3-4 people who do the job the way it should be done. Upper management sits around and watches as handlers are chucking boxes towards the back of the trailers. I wanted to get my foot in the door somewhere that would be good in the long run and was told there is a great chance of rehire after holiday season only later to be told that they hire 3 out of ALL pt workers. Only 3. Also was promised a sign on bonus which was never given to me or anybody I asked about it. Overall, the management was not helpful at all. My supervisor taught me little to nothing during my orientation week and beyond that it was a terrible place to work. I really hope all other UPS factories are not like this one."
bad,"I have never worked for a company that treated their employees so badly. They come first. Management is very inconsiderate. Don't plan on working here and having a work-life balance, especially during Christmas time."
bad,"The store could be completely clean with no customers in it, if the owners saw you leaning against a counter or packing table you were liable to get written up. I managed the store and was required to do things that no other manager of the franchisee's other stores had to do. I would work long hours and even if I worked overtime I never got paid for it."
bad,pay is not all that. hard labor and work. can be very stressful and painful on your body. management doesn't rally care for the employees and its like being a work slave for a little of nothing.
bad,"sucked don't do it, your just a number and they don't care about you or your family, which you will never see.  Production all the way at what ever cost to get it done."
bad,"The manager paid me less than my male co-workers who were hired at the same time.  They had less experience and fewer qualifications. She was very homophobic, was angry when I couldn't stay late after my shift due to prior commitments that she was aware of, wanted to schedule me for two hour shifts after awhile, and asked for opinions during company meetings but got upset anytime people actually spoke. She also insisted that people work over their breaks, and asked about criminal backgrounds on the application, both in direct violation of state law."
bad,"Loved my position, work was interesting; management a joke; uninterested in assisting in career development of employees; nepotism is very much alive and thriving."
bad,Pass the buck mentality. No integrity or accountability. The newer people get treated poorly. Management doesn't care if you have another job...have to stay and work although the pay is low for all the work you put in.
bad,"UPS is a typical warehouse job, you have to be able to lift 75 pounds or more. Be prepared to endure injuries cause it is inevitable. Its going to happen."
bad,"arrive to the HUB walk thought security and then walk to the dock to then start examine each package to ensure to reaches it proper destination, all while keeping a pace of 20 packages per min. from the conveyer to the wall. You must sort the bigger more heavy boxes to go on the bottom of the wall and build your way up to the top of the trailer. each day working 4 hour shifts, because the stressful environment. it is a constant 95 degrees+ in the HUB."
bad,The pay scale is much harder to achieve than described. There is no set schedule and the constant change in start and end times leaves no stability for family life or raising kids
bad,Do not work here if you enjoy you're freedom or want any kind of say in anything. Management treats this like its the military. Do not care about anything else except their numbers.
bad,"If you ever wondered what working in a prison yard would be like, work here. The most hostile environment I've ever experienced. Management is against each other, dock works are out to get management. People threaten each other with bodily harm, supervisors have had their tires slashed. There is no morale, period. Poorly run operation in general. Also, they bait and switch, they post a job with specific hours, but the people they hire never actually work the job the were supposedly hired for. It's just a complete mess overall."
bad,"If you aren't management, you will be worked like a dog unloading trucks in a insane amount of time. Most hours you can get in a day is 5 but that's only if you don't get cut after 20 minutes of being there. And if you get hurt in any way, they will find a way to blame it on you and send you to an occupational doctor that will tell you that you are clear to go back to work with no restrictions, even if you tear a rotator cuff. If you're management though, the perks and hours are great."
bad,"Everyone I worked with was always nice, but it was more in a ""we tolerate each other"" way.  There were definite cliques and those who didn't fit in to one were left out by all, but were still treated nicely.  If you fit into a clique, you could go far.  If not, forget it; you'd be barely trained on your job, if at all, and even if you asked for more instruction, it would only be when someone decided to take the time.  Kind of hard to learn a new job when the person training is trying to learn their new job at the same time.  For a global company, computer system was old, slow and a complete joke."
bad,"most of the time equipment not working but expected to keep up with the work, safety violations , once injured they try to force you out , they go as as to delete hours that you have worked just meet there numbers"
bad,I don't even have enough time to describe all the terrible things about this job. Do not work at worldport. It is awful. The college benefit is not worth it.
bad,UPS is too much work and not enough money for it. The breaks are small (15 minutes or less) . The managers aren't considerate at all. The pain from the labor stays with you all day and all night.
bad,I worked at the lawnside hub for 15 years.  If you ain't management you are an enemy. I was harassed. Safety didn't mean anything unless it was an audit. No more turkeys and barbecues. No incentive. Your knowledge don't mean s***. If you slow down they are on top of you. No moving up. It took me 6 years to get full time. Management hate full timers. No changing your position. Only happy people are management.
bad,Work was horrible. They lie to you. Pretty sure not all hubs are the same but the one is commerce was horrible. Don't want to bad mouth the company but certain facilities aren't that good.
bad,Never paid correctly on weekly pay checks. Always shorted and never compensated. Management team never corrected the pay checks in a timely manner. I enjoyed the work out aspect of this job.
bad,"UPS is een wereldwijd, dus enorm groot bedrijf. Echter er is geen geld voor fatsoenlijk meubilair, vloerbedekking, laat staan een modern pand.. Zelfs de koffie is, naast niet te zuipen, niet eens gratis.. Geen leuk bedrijf. Weinig doorgroeimogelijkheden, tenzij je an de vriendjespolitiek bent.. Ook de begeleiding is 0."
bad,"Disgusting expectations for low amount of pay, it requires too much damage to to body for the reward. Unless you're a drive or Office worker, you will be benefited. Anyone in the Warehouse with surely regret the job."
bad,"I was sick with mono and had to be out for  2 weeks. I came back and ended up having a huge lump on my neck and had to be hospitalized. while i was in the hospital they let me go and then try to deny that I even worked for them."
bad,"This job all depends on the owner, since the stores are franchised from The UPS Store. With our owners and management, there is nowhere to move up, the pay is relatively low, and to management we are expendable."
bad,Jeden tag Andere Tur  Dann sich auf regen Wenn Pakete zurück Kommen Das Geht so nicht .
bad,This is not a nursing job as there is no respect given to you as a nurse. The culture of the company is not to take care of their employees but to make all their injuries and issues their fault. Their is no work life balance because the expectation is to be on cal 24/7.  The salary is extremely below demand.
bad,"Your under paid and they probably will not use as much because the drivers are selfish with their work and they are trying to get bonus!!! My advice as a insider ups employee is to not do it ..go work at khols, target, or amazon just not at the Northbrook UPS or if you are trying to get into ups permanent apply as a package handler ...you'll get more hours and payed a little bit more for loading trucks for 7 hours during peak because we need package handlers."
bad,"I went to work for UPS in order to receive the offered tuition benefits, only to find an extremely physically demanding and fast paced position, sad excuse for management, overwhelming working conditions, and workers with higher levels of seniority with the mentality that they don't have to work very hard. "
bad,"My typical day as a package car driver at UPS began with PCM (management communication to the drivers), we would be lectured on how badly we performed the previous day no matter how over & above we went."
bad,Working for a year and I had to fight just to get my 6 month bonus. Never what they promise work wise or pay wise. They say no jobs under $10 but the two beginning post are below what they promised. Also the uniform deduction never stops which is $60 a month for what u wash and you have to have them tailored. Doesn't work guard members either. If your desperate work here but do not depend on management to help or keep to their word.
bad,"It is a great place if you need money around christmas time but beyond that, it does not give you the essentials for life. You can not get health insurance until you have worked there for over a year."
bad,"They hire and fire, that's their game. They'll find something to discipline you on or they're make something to. Terrible company ethics. There was one manager who would fire people, use a hole punch on their I.D. and put it on a necklace like his ""war trophies"" and he had  a lot of I.D's on it. They promote that cause it saves the company money and they will have to pay out less in retirement. They have a window watching down on you and that's pretty much all they do watch you. Not sure how their wages are justified..."
bad,"Very unprofessional and outdated thinking, no documented processes, etc."
bad,"They cant guarentee and day of working, when they do they barely give you any notice of your work time. The work they give you doesnt compensate the work they do give you . overall the company is the worst place you can work at."
bad,"If you are not a driver of a package car, your contribution to teh company is rarely recognized.  UPS's lack of leadership above center managers is lacking or non existent.  Yelling on conference calls is common. Company lacks direction."
bad,you always have to wonder if they are going to fire you the management talks at you not to you its avery hostle work place.
bad,Very fast paced enviornment. At this job only for seasonal work.
bad,"In a nutshell, as long as you are healthy then every thing is not bad but do not get sick or have a family with a medical condition and you work in Overland Park KS in the HR call center. You and your situation is treated different from the other UPS locations. If you file for FMLA is very unlikely that you will get it. I submitted 29 pages of medical information for FMLA from 3 doctors and was denied. This has happened to many people in the call center. Also there have been so many individuals that have applied for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that have been with the company especially drivers for over 20 years and was told to apply and was told that they did not have another position for them and told them that they would do a 6 month search for another position for them (while they were not working and had no other incoming in because you cannot work on ADA which is something that they do not tell people when they inquire to their managers about it) then they terminate them. I will NEVER recommend UPS to anyone."
bad,"they had no respect for there employers. they were not very organized, not enough employers. management officials were really rude."
bad,"What a horrible experience! Owner is unprofessional and will come in after hours to set things up to wrong the next day. will watch you from surveillance camera's and email you 10 times in a row with one question per email!!?? Owner creates wasted time and unnecessary procedures that only he is aware of (often makes them up on the spot).  Once he bickered about how a z-fold is not like an envelope fold.....mental gymnastics all the time with no point! Don't waste time trying to advance or even add to your resume......."
bad,"I get to here the customers concerns/ and help solve any issues  that's the enjoyable part"
bad,If you're in san leandro looking for work. Do not apply here!! Poor management..Poor co-worker attitude. Supervisors are horrible.
bad,"was my first delivery job ever.. I was driving around with a small gulf cart around neighborhoods dropping off mail packages , also riding around with driver on the  truck"
bad,horrible work conditions with harrasment from managers day in day out!
bad,Career buster!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"none of the drivers where aware of the new driver helper scheme being put in place and not many of them wanted driver helpers with this as it slowed them down, UPS was not very good with paying me the right salary which i had earned and i am still awaiting to me paid £100"
bad,"UPS Supply Chain Solutions is by far the worse place to work. The supervisors and rude, there is no room for advancement, and the company policies aren't made for families with children."
bad,Company is not headed in the right direction. They over work you and job stability is very poor.
bad,"Dissatisfied with the entire experience as an employee for more than 5 yrs in management. The company cares not whatsoever for your personal work goals or ideals and requires that you compromise your morals and values routinely, progressively escalating to interpersonal mutiny among employees & terrible work ethics that deteriorate to apathy. Good riddance."
bad,Cant say anything good about this company.. working here is like
bad,"good for anyone who likes to work out, and work at the same time. Alot of unloading and loading, always standing, and bending and picking up."
bad,"UPS is an awful place to work. I was a mid-management person and was constantly yelled at by upper management, and not listened to by those under me. When people would consistently not show up to work and were given half a dozen and more warnings, i wanted to terminate their employment but was turned down. So if you want to work at a place where you can get away with not doing your job, go for it. The pay stinks, the hours are horrible, and the work conditions are unsafe in spite of their lip service to safety"
bad,"I did not care for the job. I was not there very long but it was a job and I did everything that was asked of me, but that doesn't mean I liked it."
bad,I have worked in many corporate environments and the training dept. at UPS in Atlanta contains one of the most unprofessional group of managers that I have ever met. I would never recommend this department for anyone to work. The current reputation among Consultants is to stay clear of this company. Their current training model is to not train their consultants but to manage through intimidation and to not provide them with the tools that they need to do the job. I was there for 90 days and when I left they had gone through 9 consultants in less than 3 months. There is truly a problem that upper management needs to address. The company has to see how much money is being wasted with the high turnover rate. My understanding is it has been going on for a long time and it has never been addressed. They are now having trouble finding Instructional Designers. I wonder WHY!
bad,"The pay isn't terrible. $15.50/hour, but you make overtime pay after 5 hours. The hours, however, are horrible if you aren't a morning person. Work starts around 3:00 am and you finish around 9:30 am. So while you have the rest of the day to do what you want, you'll be so exhausted that finding the energy is a task in itself. Overall, I wouldn't recommend working at UPS."
bad,"Managers are incompetent and do not maintain communication with each other outside of problems. Being given conflicting information from management occurs often. One will tell you to do something and another will yell at you for doing it. Pay was decent, not good or bad. Hours were low, and they always pushed to finish as soon as possible, leaving you with low hours and pay."
bad,They can’t figure out payroll. A lot of us are still trying to get paid. This facility is still new and seems like everyone working there is too. No one knows what’s going on. You get different answers from anyone you speak to. My manager had only been there a month when I started and he didn’t ever know what to do.
bad,"Worked 3rd shift part time, wasn't even worth showing up for. Worked me like a hog for little pay and the management was beyond awful. My last day there, I showed up to work and they told me I was not needed due to a lack of work. If there's not enough work, then the least you could do is give a call or an email so an employee doesn't drive 30 min to work at 2am to find out they are not needed."
bad,"Worked there as part-time but was sent home daily after the holidays. Wouldn't even get a text to not come in and so there for wasted tons of money on gas. They do have one ten minute break but it's not long enough to make it the bathrooms or break rooms. Organization needs a lot of work. Most people were nice but I feel that the newer supervisors really didn't know alot which caused alot of issues. Plus, they don't tell you a whole lot. My coworkers had to teach me most of what to do. Managment figures that you'll know everything and get kinda rude if you don't. Another problem I ran into was some employees cursing and screaming at each other and nothing being delt with that. If you do go into this job just tread carefully."
bad,"Management ignored all requests for support, basic information to do the job was unavailable, left to your own devices with no training. No incentives, bonus or thank you."
bad,"My Manager was an awesome person, not just Manager! They pay just sucked, and I would be so bored and overwhelmed with all the information. I honestly was not interested at all in the job, I took it out of desperation and I tried to give it a chance it just was not working for me. The pay at this particular store was $8.50! Great Manager, I just had to move on."
bad,"Travail physique port de charges lourdes allant jusqu'à 72kg ,des palettes de type Euro,des lots de colis lourds et le tous a mains nue sans tire palettes...camion en très mauvaise état,tenue de travail vieille et qui tiennent pas chaud du tt l hiver,des impératifs de livraison qui vous  oblige a rouler trop vite.Des ramasses de colis a faire ds la journée qqe fois tardivement et non payés par l employeu"
bad,Had to work a 3.5 hour shift in middle of the night in warehouse 4 extra months than the 30 days stated during interview. After they sent us all to driver training it still took another month to drive only to expect you to deliver like a 25 year driver on your first day driving. Get treated terribly by management with no willingness to let you actually get better at the job. Was promised a lifelong career just to get told after peak season there was no work for us anymore.
bad,People make this a really hard place to work. Way to much favoritism. It is extremely hard to get promoted with this happening. I have learned this first hand.
bad,The management is awful and totally unprofessional. They do not know how to talk to people or consider people situations if they’re sick or have family matters. Every manager and supervisor needs to go to a class on dealing with people.
bad,"If you don't like being lied to and treated like trash, apply to work here."
bad,"Bad experience, treated unfairly for the amount of work I did. Managers aren’t professional. Just stopped texting me start times. Very complicated and unfair situation. Had to be with Union to fight for Job back and you have to pay them from your check."
bad,Mean and bad owners and disrespectful there always changing rules and and threating to fire people. They lie alot and bad for bussiness. Rude to customers
bad,Bad place to work no more pension for new management  the teamsters get more and more while management loses more  leadership is all a show  on what’s politically popular  best are overlooked
bad,"Driver was disrespectful, management was not helpful or flexible, the environment was not enjoyable or good. I got sick and had to call out and it was a big problem for them."
bad,"Minimal chance for significant advancement, little to no job training, extremely toxic work culture, rampant sexism, incompetent leadership, benefit are pretty good that is about it."
bad,"Majority of the supervisors are mean and nasty, they are not of good standards or helpful. All they care about is getting those packages sent out. They also show favoritism and are strongly prejudice. They are unorganized and they miss hours on your check.. You have to take a picture of your hours before and after you clock out.. They talk to you like dogs, let the work pile up on you and don't lend a helping hand."
bad,"Gute Bezahlung auf kosten der Gesundheit. Menschlichkeit ist gleich null. Bei 30 Mio Gewinn werden die Weihnachtsmänner und die Weihnachtfeiern gestrichen und lieber die Stornogebühren gezahlt."
bad,Culture is straight to the point Work & don't get hurt...But if you do it's not on us! There are some people there that have your best interests at heart but for the most part you're thrown to the wolves when you become a supervisor.
bad,As a female I felt as though I was treated unfairly because I one to respond well to flirtatious behavior. I felt alienated and not a part of the team which resulted in my resignation
bad,"Terrible working conditions,,esp in the summer..I've seen ppl pass out from the heat. As a package handler,,98% of ur day is spent in the back of an unventilhated feeder where the temps,easily climb I,to the 140-150s.  Vdangerous..management could care less about the well being of there employees,,ZERO BREAKS,,,EXTREME HEAT,POVERTY WAGES. #REAL TALK"
bad,Honestly some warehouses I'm sure are better but I wouldn't bet on it a lot from what I've seen and heard from other centers you get treated terribly if we got paid any less we would practically be slaves it's a horrible work environment and everyone there looks like they want to kill themselves the only good thing about it is the insurance but with that being said its almost like they want you to break your back or have to get surgery of some sort
bad,They treat you like a SLAVE. THE MORE YOU DO: the MORE THEY WANT. No respect for human nature; for workers. Always try to make you feel like if you are not trying your best.
bad,"First off there is no managment . They call about safety 24/7 ,but if you complain about a safety issue like a package weighting over 100lbs hey dont help you lift it , hours vary , they have the lazy people do lazy work and have the hard workers do the hard work .  They have NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN ,one person doing 3 people jobs ,no brakes , no set time , dont care if u get injuried they make u work and then wait then they send u , like the list goes on and on , HORRIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL"
bad,Very bad experience with ups hassasment happening to the drivers and loaders I got hurt so I was on light duty but I was getting threatened with a write up for not being producive trying my hardest to pick up boxes managers do at part of their jobs that weigh more than I was supposed to lift and for that I continue hurting from my shoulder
bad,Lack of communication. Management is horrible. Cant keep people employed. UPS does not care about its employees. A lot of testing will be done upon hire.
bad,"Literally regret wasting my time by going through the hiring process here in Gainesville. Took them weeks to give me work— then once I start working I lose my mom. Still kept working, only to be told by a driver that I “no longer work there” because he wanted his friend to be his driver helper. Now the driver’s are claiming that they’ve been calling my phone after receiving my timecard, and getting no answer. Which is BLASPHEMOUS and saddening that a company and its employees would do this around this time of the year. I used to want to work for this company so bad man— but now it’s brought me nothing but frustration in one of the worse times of my life."
bad,"The management is actual trash. Theres a worn out, passively racist woman there who obsessively harasses the younger people (out of jealousy I'm guessing). A whole team took her to HR and she fired half of the team for false reasons as a result. The Director of the floor pretty much gave her free reign to harass all the employees. They give PTs fulltime hours to take advantage of them. There's no advancement even when they promise you there is."
bad,"Absolute garbage company that has no idea how to do business, keep customers or treat their employees. They only care about lining their own pockets and cutting costs whenever and where ever they can. Worst company I have ever had the displeasure of working for."
bad,"Not a clean environment, low pay, hard work during peak season, send you home when it’s slow, had issues getting paid in the beginning, long waits at the security check point."
bad,"No communication between helpers/office/drivers. Office will often tell you one thing, the driver another. This creates a very stressful environment to work in and makes for long days that are physically demanding on top of mental stress of dealing with an angry driver. Trucks are poorly maintained, safety equipment doesnt work consistently ie:lights, seatbelts, etc. Be sure you're up to the challenge of this job before you sign on."
bad,"I like working here , great place to work , but did not get my paycheck at all. Ups pays you every Friday, I didnt get my money until Wednesday next following week. When come as a new employee supposed to be shown how to clock in . No one show me how at all .kept saying I will remember your name in clock you in .  chewhenarounpaycheck.naround"
bad,They lead you to believe that you will work after peak but then let you go a week before Christmas. Horrible! They promised the warehouse a certain wage and a check will be sent to them for the difference and that never happened for them.
bad,I thought this would be a good part time job. Walked in the first day and they was like here you go. No training at all. They where under staff and didnt care. You have to pick up the slack. How is that fair for you? At $14 Dunkin donuts start off at $15. UPS should be ashame of themselves for working people like that and only paying $14.
bad,"UPS brought us in as temp-to-hire. They strung us along for nearly two years. Then, the day after Thanksgiving, they made up some fictional story, had us train our replacements, then let us go...by phone! The gutless wonders couldn't be bothered saying it to my face. That's UPS. Spineless. Guaranteed, backstabbing is the entire culture."
bad,This Company will treat you unfairly and always give you issues your Union won't handle in your favor. This Company was a waste of time and i gained nothing from working at UPS. You have to be willing to Sacrifice 3+ years of your life just tk get a good position with Company.  Not worthy of my time or energy.  Just Poor Managment and
bad,I worked for about 2 weeks. I’m still waiting to get paid hours they own me. They never gave me an option to clock in.  They work you as fast as possible so they can send you home and not have to pay u.
bad,No existe equilibrio personal/laboral. La misión visión cultura y valores reales dista mucho de un trato digno y humano.
bad,Terrible management lie about your hours and don’t pay weekly bonus for showing on time like they claim to and Once you leave you won’t get you’re last pay check for awhile
bad,"DON'T APPLY!!,  if you have a family, they claim they are very family orientated but are definitely not."
bad,"Habe 4 Monate bei UPS gearbeitet, nur Stress und Kein bisschen Wertschätzung"
bad,Management was biased and terrible . Used every thing they could against you as soon as they hire you. Micro manage your every move and use the union rules against you when it benefits them
bad,"They never have enough people working unless it’s peak season. When they have too much going on and not enough people, they send workers to different areas to help out then the other areas all get backed up because they don’t know how to hire enough people."
bad,"Renovar los mandoss. Sus encargados, capataces, jefes de equipos, jefes de secciones o departamentos; jefes regionales o naciones tienen que ser de probada ética profesional, moral y académica."
bad,"As a supervisor in the new ""S.M.A.R.T."" building, one can guarantee that somebody will shout and, probably, curse at you. Though it is warehouse work, everyone is berated and demeaned into performing at a higher level. Those who are unable to run their areas are put in positions to fail until they quit."
bad,"I was constantly lied to in this company. Favoritism is rampant! I spent 15 years at this company with the last 10 being completely miserable! I had to move, so I had to resign and I was told that I would be able to apply in my new area. NOT TRUE! I am not allowed to reapply as a former employee."
bad,"Job is very physical, manager is on you constantly to move faster, really supervisor watches over you constantly. Not a place to work if you want consistency."
bad,"I can not really speak publicly on my experience at UPS. However, it did land me in a courtroom. I tried to warn upper level management of issues inside the facility but that did not work. The culture needs to improve there."
bad,"I have never met so many lazy employees at one job, ten drivers all stand around while the new hire unloads 53 ft. Semi trailers. Knowing that I was new to Montana and had no idea where addresses were located, they assigned me to the most remote route which had no signal or reception on GPS navigation  as well as my cellphone, so how do you deliver packages without knowing where to go? Also, supervisor was a nightmare, continually harassing me about checking mirrors as I was doing ever two minutes , she was paying attention to her cell phone more than my driving and than she marked me down for things that she was wrong about. Ths workers were not friendly at all with exception of one employee who was a good man and a hard worker."
bad,If you want to work somewhere that mistreats you and pays you terribly. Then UPS is the place for you. The only way to advance in this company is kissing butt.
bad,I came in full throttle eager driven excited respectful positive attitude. I would find things to do to fix to make better for business and for customers only to get talked about by management behind my back because she was intimidated by me because she had zero interest in progress or the future of the business. Management was the most  I have ever seen. I have no idea why an owner would choose a kiss butt that is just a piece of *ss over a true genuine asse. company rules and violator
bad,"Management is a complete joke! Will not accept responsibility for their failures, but will shift the blame on the workers. Bad attitudes, cannot be trusted, tells your personal business to your co-workers. Very unprofessional. Will promote those with no experience and by-pass those with experience. Favoritism at its finest."
bad,I liked working there until we had 2 gas leaks!! They thought we being babies about some got sick and others got headaches and almost passed out. Management never apologized.In the shack they had no heat so the people in the back there froze it was to cold for people to work in it. I was told I was making 13.50 hr and got benefits not case!! Not impressed with UPS!!
bad,"This job was an absolute mess, and it should have been more obvious. Each UPS Store that I've worked in was uniquely terrible, and this was no different. The owners were fine and reasonable, but the management in store was atrocious. The ""Assistant Manager"" (quotes are necessary because she held no such position, but claimed she did) did not understand the responsibilities that came with management. She would sit in the office and work on school work, or just play on her laptop, and get frustrated whenever I would ask for help (which was often considering I only worked there for a month). She even claimed certain rules were in the employee handbook that I should have known upon being hired, only for the store owner to deny they existed. For example, she claimed that if I showed up late to a shift, company policy just says to go home. However, I didn't believe her, and she called the owner so that he could relay the message to me. Except he said that was incorrect. Then, she stormed off for about 15 minutes, leaving a new hire alone in the store."
bad,"Management does not take any complaints seriously. Everything is busted up when you get it. Drivers claim they are knocking on doors when they don’t. Also, they don’t stand behind their word like a real company should. Have a bunch of idiots that have no idea what’s going on talking to people on the phone basically telling them lies to get off the phone."
bad,UPS does not respect anyone who is not solely production minded. They do not abide by OSHA or other safety regulations. They also falsify legal documents.
bad,"Work environment is getting hostile. Workers, including myself, do not agree with how the leads/management team run things. Worried more about making numbers than safety hazards."
bad,"This place is a joke vehicles are beat to a pulp on a daily basis and most are not fit for the road. You will get wrote up for breakdowns whether it had anything to do with your work or people before. "
bad,Really really fast paced and unbearably hot in the summer. You don’t get any breaks and you can barely find time to drink water! Loading trucks the packages never stop and you have to keep stopping to go break the jam at the top of the belt! If your line gets backed up they keep calling out your line name and someone is constantly yelling to go faster! It is back breaking work and you definitely don’t get paid enough for what they request!
bad,"I've been with UPS for 2 yrs.. Know everything about the Warehouse.. The more u know, they more they will use you.. Huge Waterhouse with only 2 working floor fans... Half of the ceiling fans don't even work... The humidity is terrible... PEOPLE HAVE LEFT EARLY BECAUSE OF IT."
bad,The job is the worst job that I ever had.    They treat part timer like garbage and play favoritism.   This place don’t know the definition how to treat people.   The job is very stressful and no respect to Part timer Loader.   The union doesn’t do anything to improve the work condition
bad,"I was hired for a full time position,  however...I was lucky to drive two days a week! You are given the option to work in the hub (busting your azz) on the days you don't get called in to drive 🙄 You're pushed through 5 days of training (if you want to call it that) when it should definitely be at least 10 days long! This is just mentioning a few examples of why I left this company as fast as I got hired "
bad,"Supervisors show loads of favoritism. The $13/hr pay sounds good on paper, but when they kick you out after 3 hours of working and shave minutes off your clock in/clock out times, it's doesn't often add up to much. One 10 minute break."
bad,"You will be an alcoholic in no time, just to put up with the management teams and the work. Having a life outside of UPS is frowned upon (direct quote from district manager) and can and will get you fired if they don't like you for any reason, they will never tell you the reason. Corporate greed runs deep here. You will suffer in the winter and the summer, guaranteed. If you ever start enjoying your job here that's when you need to be worried."
bad,The company is seniority based and so working harder than others will not advance you any quicker. Lots of the time you are doing most of the work when you “lend a hand” and the pay doesn’t justify that when you are told to go home after three hours. Within my first five weeks I was told go home after 2 hours and that really left a bad taste in my mouth and I left withIn a few weeks. You are lucky to get  17 hours and it’s not because there is t volume as I was told. One day I was in the middle of lots of work and was sent home after 2 hours. The week before I left trims me to start 10 minutes later than usual time even though there was work. They try and cut costs at the expense of workers. Do not recommend it’s false advertising!!!!
bad,"This review was for my specific store, I know people who have worked at ups stores and loved it, but my personal experience was nothing short of horrible, constantly discouraging, and shady from a sales standpoint."
bad,All labor work.Kept way longer then supposed to. One time I started@2:55 my shift was not over til 12am. Would not suggest working here save yourself.
bad,"My direct so-called supervisor was very young, I learned new grammar in the screaming & yelling cuss words. A super fast paced environment & they weed you out quickly. They state 70lbs lifting-no problem but if over 70 it’s stated in their policies/procedures that it takes 2! The HR recruiter lies to get you on-board. Also, pay was docked as you may have worked 6 hours but they cut it to 4 hours with no explanation. Run, don’t walk from this place well unless you like the behavior"
bad,This job is for a person who likes to be indoor everyday all day. It requires a lot of repetitive duties everyday. This job can be great depending on the UPS Store.
bad,The supervisors was unfinished job assignments for load.The eay they talk too a worker was mess up.Never let us get over time.Only work 4 hours ouut 4 days out of the week
bad,"Management was terrible. When they interviewed me I told them, in detail, how my schedule looks saying I can only work part time. They said that it was fine and that they had hours to spend. Well they let go me after a month or so because they didn't have enough hours..."
bad,"if you like to guess about what you are doing or where the person who was working by you but is gone good luck!"
bad,"They provide good benefits because no one would stay otherwise.  They give medical, dental, pension, good time off, dont get sucked in by peak or the benefits, not worth it."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, it's not worth the stress that you go through daily, with supervisors rushing you to do a physically demanding job, so they can get a bonus on their check, while your hours get cut because how fast they want you to work"
bad,"very stressful high paced job....no benefits till 90 days. a lack of responsive management....if you need help your screwed...if you question why you are doing anything or why you are doing something you are screwed. also, they raised the hourly wage in jan...its june and I have not yet seen backpay from that."
bad,"Terrible work life balance. 75% travel without regard to personal life impact. "
bad,"UPS never gives us good training. They told us how to stack boxes and that's it, no demonstrations or nothing. Management did not understand that I had back problems and they never put me on light duty, they threw so much work at me it was way to stressful to do any of it. I ended up throwing my back out twice because of them. I had to quit because they never helped me with anything. there was honestly nothing enjoyable about this job. I simply dreaded going to work everyday, in fear my back was gonna really give out to where I couldn't move. UPS loading and sorting is not a good first job to teens unless you've been packing trucks and lifting more than 70 pounds (with no help) for your whole life. There was no communication and I felt that my managers could care less that I was hurt at the time. After I quit, they MADE me come back to the hub (mind you I lived and hour away from UPS at the time.) because they were scared that I was going to file a Workmans comp, which now that I think about it, I really should have. I will never work for this company or recommend it to anyone. it was MISERABLE."
bad,"The Human Resource Center in Overland Park is a joke. They use temp agencies to find employees. No drug testing required and no interview...I should of known better to be honest. The trainers are great and tought me a lot..they have favorites as any workplace would. They hire you on as a temp employee and expect you to miss zero days in 6 whole months...when I thought they were going to to make me a permanent employee, they laid me off instead."
bad,Working there be prepared to dig dirt out of your nostrils every work shift. Continuous movement was not a problem for me personally it's the constant yelling and screaming of management rushing you every minute of the work shift.
bad,This place sucks to work for I'm so glad I quit and left ups they are very unorganized. Yeah you get weekends off but have to have a second job only about 15 hours a week less you are a driver. But in order to get a chance at being a driver you have to quit your other job and if you failed the test you screwed yourself. And the test that I passed was the dumbest test and not worth the time. Horrible hours horrible HR and you never get a holiday off so tell your family you wont be seeing them. Again I'm so happy I left I hate ups
bad,"All the warehouse jobs are part time even the supervisors. Management sucks, these people talk to you however they want. They move you from place to place around the warehouse. Pay is minimum wage which sucks. You only work maybe 4 hours. Training isn’t provided"
bad,"Work your body until it's broken down, bruised. The work load is ridiculous then you are reprimanded if you aren't perfect. They don't care if they overload your area. They treat you like a slave. They keep adding more work for the same amount of pay"
bad,Not a bad company. However working in the warehause was an unpleasant experience due to poor management and supervision. Working 3 to 5 hours a day felt like working an 8 hour shift.
bad,Over worked + under paid. All shifts are at garbage times.  Pencil neck and short stack managers with terrible attitudes.  Horrible equipment.  Conveyors don't go low enough!  Bring back old conveyors!  Engineers who thought those new conveyors were a good idea never worked a job like this in their life.
bad,"The Secaucus Hub is beyond terrible.  I would only recommend this work environment if one possesses no skills,  just released from prison, and lives at home with parents /family and need pocket change.  The organizational culture there is dysfunctional and toxic.  The lack of true leadership is prevalent.  Preload is a wretched shift.  Eventually, one becomes apathetic and realizes you are just a body.  A body to fulfill their numbers.  I have never worked in such an abusive environment.  If your standards are high and you value yourself, this environment is not for you.  You will be thoroughly disappointed.  It’s a thinly veiled prison culture.  "
bad,"Upper management will make stupid decisions because they don’t understand what it takes to get get your job done. The people in lower management know these decisions are horrible but they are terrified of upper management so the they don’t step up and say anything. The company has a culture of bullying and fear. Also, they will preach safety to you and then make you do the same unsafe action literally an hour later. It’s a joke and I can’t wait for amazon to facilitate there demise."
bad,"Full time deliveries like natzi camp for jews and managers like Hitler.  One of the worst company's you could ever work for, a bunch of hypocrites, safety first? Not!.. It,s make service on pkg or die! Managers have sxxx for brains of course after they do an abomination on there brain and pump brown blood in! I was never offerd proper American workers act to go back to work. I  feel that I  got very short changed from union and management..and was  treated very poorly and unfairly. I have PTSD from the place,  have nightmares everynight. Ups has ruined every relationship in my life and my moral . I hope all the supervisors and management suffer for what they did to me!  It did seem that the girl employees always got preferential treatment and always hung out with management at bars where corrupt things would happen, to make there way to the top or for extra hours.  Part time even worse. And pregnant women are  harrassed and not given any mercy even with doctors note."
bad,They only hire kids out of high school or minority candidate to fill a quota and make you run through all sorts of hoops to get on full time.  THey keep laying you off and only calling you when they need you
bad,"Lack of pay. Too many hours, no sympathy for the moms with babies, supervisor total jerk."
bad,Hard working job no brakes barely any hours . People always had attitudes I got along with everybody just not a good environment . I still did my job at the end of the day
bad,"Not enough hours. Almost everyone but the really high ups are part time. They take away your bonuses after 4 months. No paid sick leave. No vacation days. Management sucks. They’re fighting a pay raise right now. You’re treated like a slave, not a human being. You don’t get paid enough for the job you do."
bad,"They will lie, cheat you out your money.  Work you like a dog and scream and yell like you were a inmate.  Bruises all over my body from being hit by packages.  Then minimum wage went up.  And they would say we were getting a raise and never did.  Then will lay you off so they wouldn't have to pay you the differece they owe you."
bad,very busy fast pace to work for decent pay but very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.very dirty place to work.no room to advice in the company
bad,Not in line with having the right people for the job management horrible they have no clue that a computer is not the solution you have to have boots to the ground type mentality
bad,"UPS is a huge, greedy company who does not compensate their employees fairly. The huge profits they make are poured into buying more technology and not at all spent on the employees. There is retaliation if you do not agree with the way they do something or if you are hurt on the job. Unless you are in upper management, it is not a pleasant work environment. Sad but true."
bad,The job was extremely repetitive as I was only unloading boxes from trucks onto a conveyor belt for hours on end. The management was the worst. They do not care at all about you.
bad,Hired in but would not put me to work. Biggest check was for 15.00 for showing up to work and sent home. Told they had no work. Waited my time for 4 weeks calling in at 6am to be told No Work. during there peek season.
bad,"Hardly anyone who works at UPS has good work ethics.  Anyone in management is told NOT to do any work. Employees are encouraged to ""grief"" them if they see supervisors help other employees with boxes.  Upper management say they are all about safety, yet expect you to sort heavy boxes at a very fast pace. In order to meet quota everyone throws packages across belts, kick boxes to unjamm belts, and mis-sort heavy boxes.. place is do dirty everything is covered dust, spiderwebs, and trash. It is very hard to breath in there. They claim they have a cleaning crew but are nowhere to be seen. WORST PLACE TO WORK FOR."
bad,"I came into this job, with a good attitude,  and though everything that was told to me and my colleagues was actually going to be true, but it was far from the truth. Management was run by kids. I literally mean kids that were in their early 20's and barely had experience as supervisor.  And the lack of team meetings, and communication is the biggest down fall. Also your can never get a hold of anyone in the hr department that is competent or knowledgeable of what is exactly going on in the warehouse."
bad,From date of hire you are told one thing just to get you in there but in all actuality its something completely different. Really a pastime job only apply if need seasonal only work.
bad,"Company mission to invest in its people is a good one.  But, employees are not treated with a high level of respect.  The HR manager's motto was to do what it takes to get it done including 20 hour work days if they saw the need. Compensation is average. No special perks provided for employees as with other fortune 500 companies."
bad,"Jeśli nie masz rodziny i chcesz spędzać 10-12h w pracy to idealne rozwiązanie dla ciebie. Koszmarna kadra, złe warunki pracy. Ogólnie nie polecam nikomu kto chce mieć normalne życie i nie być wykorzystywanym na każdym kroku."
bad,Flexible work schedule but not enough hours. I quite because they weren’t giving me enough hours of work.  They were nice people but I feel like they can approve some stuff.
bad,"The company follows the old boy and girls club. If you are a friend of a manager you get promoted. If management does not like you they will not promote you no matter how smart you are. If you disagree with management you will be labeled a trouble maker. They have no integrity but will hold you to your integrity. I watched as division managers hid people's packages in trailers and sheeted the packages as attempted on Comb's street. He was an upper manager and he still has a job. "
bad,as soon as you walk in the stress level is already high. high turn over rate. never offer full time. no benefits until you have been there a year. no breaks. management is not the best.
bad,Didn't talk to any body I worked there to get better life n have a survival they always had misleads  always changing my color of floor and never had a proper manager
bad,Dealing with customers having bad temper and attitute plus sometimes customers so mean and racist and we cant say nothing because theyalways on th right
bad,Absolutely the worst place I have ever worked. Horrible management and extremely understaffed for the amount of work needed to be done. The only good thing I took away from this job was a few computer skills and a couple life long friendships.
bad,"They won't pay overtime.  They are desperate and will hired anyone off the street. Workers don't get along with each other. Bosses will adjust your time, example if you worked 6 hrs and they feel you did not do anything they will pay you for 5 hrs"
bad,Horrible and too laid back supervisors that makes friends and put others down and degrade them. You only would receive pay raise through your Union. If you get sick and call off they will try and fire you!  They pay full time employee's good money to treat them like garbage.
bad,"I would never recommend anyone I know to work at the Harvey UPS. Management is poor, they rush employees off the clock before they can reach overtime, they don't care about employees mental, physical, or emotional state. They never taught me the proper training, they just threw me on a truck a told me fend for myself basically. I thought myself how to load and unload 3 trucks properly and how to place the packages in the numerical order and place certain packages  the way drivers ask. Example if 45 packages for the post office comes for a certain truck the driver may like those packages in the back of the truck for easier and faster access. Worse work experience in my life!"
bad,"Just don't.  I loathed my time there.  I can't really recommend it for anyone who is a software developer or engineer.  During my time there the biggest challenge was the lack of strong business analysts and software QA professionals.  Plus, they are stuck in the waterfall way of doing things."
bad,"They constantly try to fire people so they can replace them with new people at lower wages.  If it wasn't for the union, nobody would have more than 5 years in.  Most people only work there for the healthcare benefits and would quite if they could."
bad,"Management is the worst part of the job. My driver was a great guy and hard working but they stayed on his back too. Management has no respect for drivers or the driver helpers. I called in and cut my time short as a seasonal driver helper and it had nothing to do with the physical demands of the job. I am physically fit and have been lifting heavy stuff for over 15 years. My driver liked the way I work. But management will make it seem like you're the problem and they're not the problem. As a woman, you're going to face sexism and being told you have to prove yourself, or that you can't do something, as with most places. So that's nothing surprising. I don't even want to use UPS delivery services after this experience. My advice to you: FIND A BETTER JOB."
bad,This job just sucks. No home life because of the weird hours. Sleeping schedule is all messed up. No one has your back there. Very high demand job that the training didn’t help with.
bad,"The experience I had in management was terrible.  There was corruption, cut-throat politics, a culture of ""gotcha,"" no teamwork; as a matter of fact it was more a collection of individuals who would gladly throw you under the bus to save their own skins.  The time commitment was not reflected in my salary.   My experience tells me firmly that UPS looks upon its workforce as a collection of people to be exploited for company gain.  "
bad,"Harsh working conditions, mis treated by management, barely trained. Sexist company. Unofficial motto ""work harder not smarter"""
bad,This is a male driven company with its share of problems. They are all about the numbers and not the employees. Majority of people who worked with me hated their job but stayed for the pay
bad,"Good job, but terrible managment.  The evening supervisor was trash along with the driver supervisor. Favoritism was shown. Overall the job was a good one but the people in charge made it terrible."
bad,"RUN!!!!! This place is an absolute joke!!! There is no training and they change their mind every week on how to do stuff.  The printers work maybe 1 day a week.  (we are required to print a lot) There isn't enough space on servers to save work So you constantly lose your work and have to redo it.  Turn over rate is ridiculously high!  Management expects people to live there and their life to be UPS.  They are trying to update their 1988 systems but nothing works and makes our work take double the time cause they are requiring you to do it the new way. People are working from 7am to midnight 6 days a weeks.  Management is constantly THREATENING you and dragging you back in if you leave after 10 hours of work even though you have been doing other peoples work that you have never been trained on and don't have a clue what you are doing.  Work gets duplicated and triplicate cause they have no working system or way to know what has or hasn't been done so all the OT is in vain. They do NOT have proper accounting practices and are trying to be the NEXT Enron so their financials look good."
bad,"Job is mindless, but good workout. Exposed to cold and hot weather according to the season. Management seemingly doesn't care about it's part-time employees outside their production. Their hypocrites on employee & job safety."
bad,"Not a fun place to work. I was told you don't have to lift more than 70 pounds by yourself, and I was regularly lifting 120+ pound packages because we were so short on staff. "
bad,"Worked here for 3 months. Posting says 4-5 hrs but only worked for 3. The 3 hrs are supposed to be guaranteed hrs (which was alright). When you're done early, great still get the 3 hrs.... supposed to be but not with the supervisor who never fixed your hrs. You'll find your cheque to be short 30-45 minute if you decide to go home early & clock-out when the job is done. Supervisor always wait the last minute before finding someone to cover a shift when someone called in sick. Doesn't communicate what's going on on a daily basis."
bad,"Being a package handler, I was needed to work overnights to load trucks in a very fast-paced environment where management was scarce. The pay was poor and there were no backup package handlers in case of illness, which means that I was asked to cover other trucks in addition to my own."
bad,"Stressful Work Place Quick Paced"
bad,"constant threats,unreachable goals,poor management and policies.Everything good was because of union requirements. never looked back. management promoted fear."
bad,"I worked for UPS as a Seasonal driver for one season. Right off the bat I noticed that management did not communicate well if at all. I was told things by one manager and within one hour another manager completely contradicted it. My ride alongs were harsh, management imposed that I were a machine that did not make mistakes opposed to a human being. I was judged by the order in which I put on my seat belt. Time schedules were even more rigid,  I was told not to have late air deliveries but was not allowed adequate time to travel to the general location most of the time. The learning curve was a sink or swim kind of style. Management gave an extremely large amount of information and I was to memorize it perfectly. I was often pulled to sort packages (even though I was not a package sorter) and paid less because of it. I was told that grievances were filed on my behalf but never seen anything else about it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I loved being out there helping customers with their problem and being in the public. I often took the time to go out of my way to assist long time customers which was overlooked and disregarded. I had a customer call corporate to give a compliment and to request me as their regular driver (she told me) and had to fill out a report because corporate interpreted it as she was complaining the very next day, not to mention I was pulled off the route because of that."
bad,W tej firmie wgl sie nie odnalazlem i zle sie tam czulem
bad,"Stable company, little opportunity to move up. Very stagnant and ""old boys club"". Talk of diversity, but little action behind it. If you're a minority there's not as much room to move up and little help from management with mentorship. "
bad,"bad management, bad hours, bad work culture. just an overall bad place to work. upper management takes advantage of salary employees. Hardest part of the job is dealing with all the negativity that goes on in the company daily."
bad,"Very unorganized . None of my checks were on time,or correct I always had to wait to get them adjusted! The first check I received from them was a whole month late."
bad,"UPS talks a good talk, but doesn't walk the walk. Management holds ""carrots"" out (ie: promotions, new positions, raises), but doesn't deliver...timeline is always pushed back by @ 3 months. Great job if all you want to do is work really hard and go home; not a good job if you want to know what's going on and feel an integral part of the operation. A lot of yelling and disrespect...they don't deal with problem employees, they just move them. NOT RECOMENDED"
bad,I spent the entire Christmas season working with an angry and short-tempered man in a UPS truck driving around between Merrimack and Haverhill to deliver packages in the ice and snow to peoples houses and half the time they weren't even there to receive the packages that needed a signature to be delivered so most of the time we had to go back to these places again and again until we finally caught them and they signed. The number of deliveries went up in a week from 200 to 400 and then to nearly 600. I also got injured on the job by slipping on the ice in someones driveway so that sucked. I'm sure others had better experiences than me but this was mine and it was terrible.
bad,when i worked there if we didnt have something to do we would clean which is great unless the store is already spotless. the management was close to none.
bad,"so hectic, repetitive, and hot. The warehouse had no a/c, no cold water and was only part-time, only able to work 20 hours. The co-workers were great and I loved mesquite but the pay really sucked."
bad,The management in the stores did not appreciate the dedication given by employees that essentially ran the store. They would have rather hired new employees and more money and still expect more work out of the employees whom  had been there.
bad,If you want to lose weight and don't mind the very loud very annoying sound of screeching metal grinding together and minimum pay for maximum work this is the job for you
bad,"This place is operated like a slave plantation with management not caring about the workers at all. They basically treat the workers with no respect and think they can talk to you any way they want to. The supervisors with a few exceptions do not know what they are doing.  They are uncouth and unprofessional and basically do not want to take responsibility and like to blame others. They are basically covering their behinds to save their jobs. The managers constantly berate the supervisors and threaten to take their jobs.  There is constant turnover and most people do not even last six months. Due to it being a no skill position, management does not care, as they can always get a few “bodies”, as they refer to the workers, to do the job."
bad,They work you to the bone. Poor hourly wage for the work. Time clocks never work. Supervisor writes your time down. They are always shorting you on your hours.
bad,Worked us really hard and they didn’t pay us enough for the hard work we were and didn’t give us longer breaks and very unorganized never had an position it changed everyday
bad,"The pay scaling and educational assistance at ups are a honey trap. Most of the benefits arent available to employees until they have been there more than a year, and the amount that is gouged from your check by the union is insane. The negative atmosphere created by dust and poor management only makes the feeling of uselessness grow. The job opens seeming full of opportunity to grow, but in reality rewards poor work, and punishes those who push to achieve more at every turn"
bad,"Not for the worker -- even though union company management still finds ways to force seniority out"
bad,"If your not a morning person then this isn't the right job for you, unless you're despite. A typical day is 4 a.m start time to 9:30ish. In my mind The loader position is the most stressfull position in the whole wearhouse. You'll be assigned 2 delivery trucks 3 the most. Study the truck because your gonna need it. A big conveyor belt runs through the middle of the metro where packages flow. I'll guarantee you that you'll have a hand full of stressfull days where packages just keep coming to you and times were you'll have to stack. Therefore it's really fast paced having to check the belt at all times. You will sweat that i guarantee. 10 minutes break not much really. People really ship stupid stuff through UPS"
bad,"Working in a 2 to 3 trucks at a time while I'm a small 5'1 person, working in HOT conditions and no one ever helped you. Expectations were very high. Was never given a chance to move up"
bad,"Sorting and packaging mail in to trucks."
bad,"The supervisor think they own the job."
bad,"You are often left by yourself to deal with angry customers and unreasonable expectations. The store owner doesn't take the effort to staff the store adequately, thus leaving you to handle everything."
bad,There is no work life balance and no consideration for management with family. Goals and expectations change daily which creates struggles to create concrete plans.
bad,"The management team lacks professionalism and there for their subordinates also lacks it too. Profanity is used through out the entire facility from the highest management personnel to the lowest seasonal temp. Management fully focus only on quantities and nothing on qualities, efficiency and most importantly safety. Team members are encouraged to work at a hard and fast paste causing them to neglect quality treatment to customers items and package.   Team members are continuously focus on their mobile phone watching sports, listening to music and pay no attention to productivity or safety to their peers or what so ever. Over all, this is not a recommendable place to make a career out of."
bad,Human Resource Department was hostile and something did not treat the employees fair.  They need to learn to work more as a team than individuals person
bad,"UPS is a horrible working environment.  The training is minimal but you are forced too sign a document saying that you know their procedures perfectly even when no training has been provided.  The management is rude, abusive, and offers no guidance or assistance.  The absolute worst part of working for them is that they assign a delivery workload that makes the day sixteen hours to complete, but as a commercial driver is only legally allowed to drive for twelve hours, that is all you get paid for!  Work sixteen hours a day for twelve hours pay!  Not cool at all!  Management  and the Teamsters union openly mock any attempt to recoup your stolen hours.  Avoid this company like the plague!"
bad,"This company is hard to work for. You 1st work in warehouses being a package handler for 3 years, making a 150.00 a week. Then you finally get to be a driver, where they work you like a dog."
bad,"The job was very demanding, pay was decent but nothing near what we should've been getting. The higher ups way of thinking was crazy and they are very unforgiving."
bad,don't not apply for a job as a driver helper. the company doesn't have it's stuff together. they make you sit at home. all day waiting for them to call. then lie and say they called when they didn't. took 3 weeks to get a check for the orientation. kept giving me the run around. if you need to make some quick cash. this is not the job for you. as you wont get to work right away. only when they need you.
bad,The culture at UPS is demeaning to say the least.  There is no respect for the employees that work hard to make that company what it is.  It is a turn-style of dysfunction
bad,"Words that make is fill out so I can possibly apply for jobs                                                  Worst job ever ever "
bad,"The work tears our body up, and all we get for our hard work is told to move faster, no matter how short staffed we are. I wouldn't go back if I made double what they originally paid me, it's not worth it!"
bad,"The managers were mean and hypocrites. They gave us no benefits, even those working 79+hours bi weekly. They do shady things that are definitely against the law such as writing us personal checks instead of giving us our paystubs and an unpaid luch with no breaks. There is no opportunity there and it's unfair for the workers to be overworked and mistreated. No paid lunch, as a matter of fact, they make employees take it off their time sheet. The pay wage is non negotiable. They promised a negotiable pay raise if you become a notary for them, but it was a 50 cent increase no negotiations."
bad,the company has no regard for the physical/mental welfare of their employees. Everyday at work is extremely stressful. Managers are hateful and only care about money. every employee ends up with surgery due to the intense physical requirements and retires crippled.
bad,I t is unfortunate I had very poor training and management was unaprochable . Other than that I enjoyed the job it was easy to do . The people I worked with was unprofessional
bad,Unfortunately too many untrained supervisors in their position. I felt barraged by racist comments towards my Hispanic ethnicity. I wouldn't recommend working there.
bad,"Never know when you have to work, unless you call or receive a text message. Managers are rude and disrespectful and treat the employees as children and slaves. You are not allowed breaks except for a 30 minute lunch which is hard because some employees are standing in one position for 3 to 4 hours at a time. We don't receive benefits of any kind and we don't receive a work week of 24hrs or better"
bad,"Now I know why they warned me about management.  Management has very little knowledge of what they are doing so unfortunately us new supervisors don't get proper training.  You will be overworked and yelled at for not getting enough done.  Also, expect half of your shift to be spent fixing your employees scanners.  Expect to have anxiety, injuries and headaches."
bad,arrogant management. the management believe in one way communication. there is no space for two way communication. the lowest level staff is treated like machines. would not recommend anybody to work for this company.
bad,The management does not care about its seasonal employees and maybe even its full time ones. I attempted to report a coworker for racist and sexist comments directed at customers and fellow employees and management would never even attempt to get back to me. UPS is a company that cares little for its employees or how those employees act in the field/
bad,"this was a seasonal job that I did one year and to be honest if you get a good driver then you should be alright but if not, some of the drivers are really rude and they take advantage of the driver helpers"
bad,"This was a horrible UPS to work at. I was the only woman (5'3"", 140 pounds) loading trucks with the men. I asked the managers multiple times if I could get a different role with less physical demand on my body and they ignored my request so I quit. If they paid atleast $15 an hour, I probably would've stayed but at $11.00....it was not worth it."
bad,This was the worst employer I have EVER worked for. I have absolutely no idea how their 'public image' remains positive. Very abusive and completely insane operational procedures that have no regard for laws or safety. I don't normally take time to 'bash' anyone or anything...but I feel it necessary this time in hopes that I can have somebody else spared from the terrible experience.
bad,"Great company in name only, bad management. it is not work that count but who you know. Not first come, first serve. They will work you out to the bone and give you just a few. Not enough to make a living and support a family and they promise you large paycheck. Just a dream."
bad,"I never had a review, salary was low for the position. Working at londonderry manager use type of game to fire employee, for example. Plug bugs on phone to listening to their conversation, have someone to invite employee for drinks and later call police on them, also involve forklift and truck operator in accident when they find out this person use drugs to remove them from the position or fire them. The hiring process and promotion is base on ""Nepotism"" where friend and family come first Ignoring the hard work, knowledge, and education of other employer."
bad,The mangers do not care about you and your family. I you have to leave to take the day off for your children always being told work comes 1st then family. The last manger treated my less than a DOG and he did not care about animals
bad,The working conditions were horrible. If you don't want working long hours for little pay then this the job for you. The managers mistreat their employees and down talk them.
bad,My time there was fun but bitter sweet and the management team and union they say alot but never due anything and as far as the inside people we get treated like trash management treat the pre-loadeders like nobodys were people to they place all drivers on a pedal stool. The best tip I did was come in due your part and more but don't let them use your skills and youth cause they will say will make u driver and u can be waiting for a long time but some one from the streets can come in and get the slot why cause they not union and they gotta scratch 40 by 70 if they don't make it the cut them but I seen the run around far to long
bad,your pay is trash and the weird hours makes it worse. besides that its a waste of time and energy.the only good thing is that benefits are really good that's if you make it that long.
bad,I love everything about you PSA show me everything from shipping and receiving and unloading trucks it was a great place to work with others and work with my hands and to be around others who's on the same thing and that I was on I was young when I started working there for you UPS
bad,UPS lacks leadership of any kind. they are suffering from only promoting from within for the last 100+ years and will suffer in the near future. they are losing great sales people daily due to unrealistic goals and management by fear.
bad,"Terrible place to work. They Never promote anyone. Never give raises, they only offer part-time. VERY unreasonable management. Also rude management. Favouritism at it's best."
bad,"I worked there for a few shifts. In the interview was ""hired"" as management.  Did nothing but load trucks by hand for minimum wage. Terrible place to work. Nothing good to say about it."
bad,"Very tough company to go up in rankings. Very tough work load and day to day duties. Factory heavy lifting the air inside is terrible to breathe, your back will be hurting and it is not worth the 4 hour slavery shifts."
bad,"I honestly feel like you do not get paid as much as you deserve. Management is not 100% professional. Only perk is that you get free lunch, but that is only because at my store there are no lunch breaks."
bad,"Worked in Fairbanks Alaska. Terrible managers and supervisors."
bad,I went in to work and worked between 3 and 5 hours depending on the day of the week. Other employees were not friendly or accepting and the management team did nothing to make me feel comfortable while I was there.
bad,"Empresa multinacional, com grandes possibilidades de crescimento, mas que a partir de um determinado momento, começou em decadência provocada por Gestão deficiente e consequente desmotivação."
bad,"lots of work,  life balance is non existent , job security is always there but you know you  won’t have a life. make sure you don’t have children nor a life"
bad,Overall ambiance is good and the management is cooperative but the company is pretty huge and disorganized when it comes to communication and implementing the system.
bad,Too much heavy lifting so early In the morning. You have no time to relax. There's no air conditioning In the summer time and It gets too hot. I didn't like working there .
bad,"they push employees to the limits, management keeps harassing people. they harassed me until I quit, management has favourite people who tell them everything about other employees, management creates hate in employees to keep themselves low key"
bad,"UPS was the worst place I've ever worked at. The training is intensive. (no exaggeration) I loaded the packages into the trailer, while being critiqued and quizzed. I did not last for more than a week and a half there."
bad,this was the worst job I ever had. the human resourses dept lied to me about the work hours I would get. there was weeks where I didn't get any work what so ever. the management runs the day to day operations to save money so they could quarterly bonuses for them selves.
bad,"My experience working for ups was terrible. "
bad,"No safety, people get treated like slaves and management is disrepectful. Better use your union rights once you start working. Dont share anything with anybody as things will reach the management and work against you"
bad,worked and performed warehouse dutys moving packages loading a typical day was sorting or loading trucks also unloading I learned a lot about how the company runs its self and how it works it was a very difficult job with lots of labor involved and the Management was very poor
bad,"Low pay for such a physical job and having to lift very heavy boxes over and over. "
bad,"I worked for UPS Freight for almost six months. I joined their team as a Part-Time Operations Supervisor. They said the ideal candidate would be a student wanting their first crack at management. After five months I had received no training and was expected to know how to run the operational reports and everything else. They are seriously numbers driven and unwilling to train or provide coaching for employees. By far, the worst place I have ever worked. They heavily pushed numbers while being well understaffed and ultimately created a hostile union environment. They also have an open door policy, but you are not allowed to speak with anyone in upper management. To sum it up, you receive zero training in a hostile environment, no one shows you how to do anything, management will expect you to know things which you have not been trained in, and on top of it all you will be criticized for not knowing your stuff."
bad,Building is junk.  Equipment is junk. No technology on the dock still living in the past. Paper and pens!! Routing is terrible!!! No comroderie between Mgmt or employees. Selfish people. Lazy people... High turn over!!! Low pay. No positive feedback only negative bs. Suck up employees. The only good thing is the Benefits. Everybody is out for themselves here. Dock only part time dirty environment. If I were you I would run and run fast!!! There is better places out there to work for.
bad,"Nothing enjoyable about this specific job. I have asked management for more responsibilities to further my advancement. Unfortunately They seem to play favorites, When I signed on for this I was told the chances for advancement were tremendous. This is obviously not the case. Nor what I was expecting."
bad,"Unless you drive for UPS you cannot make a living, and even then its all a gmae of numbers to them, they dont care about you whasoever"
bad,"I worked at this place as a clerk in the office.  I was originally told this guy Brandon was my supervisor.  He never said anything to me.  Then I was told to report to Shelly for training so I assumed she was my supervisor, but didn't seem to know what hours I was working or what shift I worked.  Then my first meeting with Spencer I'm told he's my supervisor and I was fired.  The drivers and executives were all nice, but most of the people in the office were not.  Marva is a complete (letter starting with b that indeed won't let me write) and will yell at you for asking a question.  Several times she yelled at me and told me I was doing my job wrong, but wouldn't provide any help to learn the correct process.  Questions went unanswered or I was given wrong information.  I asked for a training manual since it was clear that the people training me had no clue, never got one.  My first interaction with Shelly was her yelling at me over something I wasn't trained on.  Remember I was only there 2 weeks.  All my work required computer access and I never did receive my ID or password.  Another girl had to give me hers so I could work.  I'm sure this is a huge violation of IT protocol.  The girls in the office are extremely rude considering they are the ones that deal with customers. I honestly couldn't believe they let some of these people talk on the phone they were so rude.  I either didn't get my questions answered or someone snapped at me when I did ask a question.  I was told to scan delivery receipts.  I flipped through them to make sure there were no staples before scanning."
bad,"At UPS it was always a hassle I would load 2 trucks a day , the management was horrible they'll just destroy me in the truck with this guy we will have about 1500 loads every night maybe even 1700 sometimes my co-workers some would get the job done some would let everything pile up till I come down to the other side that was the most hardest part of the job & my 10 min break was more like 7 min that was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"UPS can be a career worth having.  From the outside it seems that UPS is a great place top work.  In reality, it takes an average of 15 years to get an opportunity to go full time forcing most part time employees to work at least 2 jobs.  The pay starts at 10.00 per hour which is now minimum wage in NYS.  "
bad,"Worse company to work for internally. It has a bullying culture and no life or work life balance. Working for UPS is like a night-mare, the schedules are irratic and their is simply no respect of personnel."
bad,"Although I will always value the other employees I had the privilege of working with during my seasonal time with this company, Higher up management could use some varying adjustments."
bad,"A Typical day you'll be watching over your shoulder from some co-workers as they just wait for you to make a mistake, and keep pushing tasks into your table to finish. The hardest part of the job is bagging for short time off that can be made up by showing early other days or stay working late."
bad,This place is a hostile environment. They treat you like slaves. They do not respect their workers at all. All they care about is making money and production. If you are sick they will penalize you and get you in trouble for calling out even if it has to do with family issues. Supervisor life is horrible. They don't believe in days off and you can't call out or you will be penalize as well as reassign you if you do.
bad,You will definitely earn your minimum wage paycheck at this place if they decide to pay you. I worked in the Ocala location for two weeks and now they won't give me my paycheck. I called the HR dept and they told me I would have to straighten it out  at my local office.
bad,"Mediocre pay for the workload. Terrible management, horrible work environment. High school all over again. Focus on customer service is lacking (which is how you get customers, the heart of the business). Don't waste your time, this is not corporate and a position here will not allow advancement to corporate....  Good if you want a paycheck and don't mind just clocking in and clocking out but if you care about people or your job,  go apply elsewhere where they will offer you commission, the owner here does not."
bad,"Great benefits if you could get on full time. They only hire part time workers, so you never actually get the great benefits promised"
bad,worst place to work due to the unorganized ooperations. hardest part about the job are getting along with the supervisors.
bad,"united parcel service is a typical american company.obsessed with production figures and making money.they have little interest  in the welfare of there employees.they loved to talk about health and safety at work but if that got in the way of productivity then it was unimportant."
bad,"Start work 650am not paid until 8 am have to do this as people employed to load your truck/van could not do this properly. Gained"
bad,I worked here for three seasons before being hired on as a regular employee. The hours were terrible and the physicality of the job left me with little or no energy to do anything but sleep. Management was a joke and the culture of the place is you know what - backwards
bad,"I worked two separate stints at the UPS in Millbrook Southampton and it was an atrocious place to work. Having worked in different areas of the parcel industry, the work load expected of their employees is ridiculous."
bad,good job if you can get on a team truck with a fellow employee who has enough seniority to hold a bid run if you can get an assigned truck can get a gear when you need one to hook a set of doubles
bad,"Hand sort mail by zip code. "
bad,unload and load planes. preach safety but when it comes down to it they really dont care. employees treated differently and lots of favortism towards certain people and crews
bad,"Oh boy! Where to begin?! UPS treats their employees, um, very badly. Management is trained to harass you all day long and scream at you to go faster. Meanwhile, they let some people go home early on the same job because they wanted to save money. They see nothing wrong with expecting you to do the work of more than one person."
bad,"I would like to be treated has a person, and not just as a number"
bad,"UPS is a great place to work with great benefits, great pay and consists of a great group of people who are motivated to help UPS bring the best service to people"
bad,"It was go go go, there, packed are trucks up in the mornings, and i delivered until i was done, sometime this meant delivering 160 different packages to customers in a day during christmas, it was stress full, lots of time requirements, but i enjoyed doing it and was good at it, but in the end, after christmas, they let me go, and i resent them for it, i busted my but for them, and i got fired for it, i took them to the labour board, and i won, wrongful dismissal."
bad,"The job is easy. The downside to this company is management. A typical day at work is complete chaos. Workers leaving before the mail is completed makes it difficult for those who stay til the end. There is no organization within the company. The only upside to this company is your co-workers. They are completely friendly and will help with any questions you have. There are also times when fist fights break out, its a rather common thing you will see on a weekly basis."
bad,"Bad Management. High turnover rate. This was a great place to work until the managers created a hostile work environment.  when problems are brought to them they say ""Figure it out but you can't leave until it's done."" They will lie to your face and then deny they ever said that. They don't follow through on anything. They will do anything they can to hold someone back so they don't have to give them a yearly raise."
bad,"This branch of UPS (UPS Freight) was once known as Overnite Transportation. This is not UPS (Brown) - good pay, stronger union, excellent benefits.   It does not matter how many years of driving experience you have, UPS Freight will start you off with $14.55 an hour and you will spend 80% of your time on the dock unloading trailer waiting to move up.  When I started with this company, I had 12 years of CDL experience.  It will take you 3 years to max out (around $26.00).  By that time you will be bankrupt or applying for food stamps, and section 8 housing.  What I found different about this company is that many of the drivers at this location were making $75,000.00 plus.  But they were so miserable due to low morale created by bad management.  UPS needs to stop buy all the competition in the market place and forcing their expediting expectation on everyone.   This explained their high claim payout due to damage good by dockworkers (Rushing).   I was told by veteran driver that this company was great when it was run by Overnite."
bad,"nothing is ever good enough for the company. everyone is given unrealistic expectations and scolded on a daily basis when you fail. unless you are a driver (you have to be there a decade to get a full time job) this place won't be enough to pay your bills. I was a supervisor there for 7 1/2 years and I took home 20,000 a year. its ridiculous that being a supervisor at a fortune 500 company and you can still be at or below the poverty line."
bad,"never work for ups, management was terrible, the working environment was unsafe and inhumane"
bad,Worst company i ever worked for. Worked in a warehouse where everyone was extremely under paid. There was never any communication from management unless the need something done that was due next day; that they knew about for months. There was a strong lack of organization and work ethic. they would rather dump the work on a single person who is working the to hire someone to help.
bad,i put the boxes in order and the codes in order and i entered the data base in to the computer
bad,"They promise a lot benefits.,,You have to wait 1 year for your benefits and another year for your family benefits. So you work 2 year on your risk. very hard work. "
bad,"Very unethical management tactics. Dishonest. Management disciplines employees solely to set examples to other workers. Union protects workers for the most part, but plan on never turning your back or trusting anyone. Worst organization ever worked for, and current employees will claim the same."
bad,"Apalling company to work for in the uk, note all half decent reviews"
bad,"I go in at night, have to deal with lousy management and immature co-workers that do not know how to help with their share of the work"
bad,It was a franchise and the man running it had no idea what he was doing. Working 8 hours a day 6 days a week with no breaks and no lunch. I was eventually let go because I do not qualify for the ' Silver State Work Program'.
bad,If you are not a white male do not bother applying unless you do not care to ever advance past the supervisor level.
bad,"UPS baby's union workers, continuously takes benefits from management. Hires just about anybody. Management is not trained properly. Should drug test. If I could I would've given them a ZERO star rating."
bad,the people in that building are rude and they honestly don't care about your well being. They only think about the job and that's it.  Too many problems come with being in that job.
bad,"Nie polecam, praca niestabilna, donosicielstwo mile widziane, praca w ciągłym stresie, bałagan organizacyjny."
bad,"Horrible place to work consist of bullies harassment on a daily basis from managers on down not an ideal place for females have the all"
bad,"The 1 week's residential induction is extremely intense & is pass or fail, yes you have no job if you fail, you will be escorted off the premises & taxied back to you hotel! When you start it's OK, you will get 50 ish drops however once you can deliver 50 they'll give you 60, once you can deliver 60 they'll give you 70...you get the idea, there are guys who are doing 100+ drops a day. Stay away if you have or want a home life!"
bad,"I dont have enough work to keep me busy in my regular role, which leads to downtime, where I get yelled at because i am not being productive, i request more work as i see other managers struggling in their role and get told i need to worry about my own issues. Don't you dare call in sick, even if you have sick time, and call in the 6+ hours early like your contract says they will complain about you taking time off for weeks after."
bad,I would not recommend working at UPS. The management was useless. The management was poor. And you are just a number here. The only thing I like is that there are good opportunities to advance in the company.
bad,"I have never experienced the sting of reverse racism before "
bad,"I came on as a “casual” driver and was told if you work hard you can get a spot driving after peak season is over...well that’s not the case, after the holiday season you go from 63 hours down to 8 This week I have not worked a single day. They then give you the option to work in the warehouse either 2am-9am or 6pm-11pm for SIGNIFICANTLY less money, 14.00 an hour to be exact compared to 21.43 When driving and they expect you to do this for years until you build your seniority and then you can “bid” for a driver spot once it becomes open. So not even a guarantee you will be a driver. If your young this may be the job for you but for someone with a family to support and bills to pay ups is not what it used to be, they just need bodies at this point and will tell you anything just to get you to stay."
bad,I started working here in December and got 5 hours a day...but now I'm lucky if I get 4 a day...most days I get sent home after an hour or when I get there. The scanners suck...the facility needs upgraded. A lot of heavy stuff should be loaded with forklifts or dolly...not by one guy
bad,If you ready for unstable management the Oakland Airport Hub is the place. How do they expect us as employees to be a team and work together when they can't even do it. Coordinators sometimes have no idea what the job requires as far as everyday work but they still will micro-manage your work until the end of the shift. If you are one of those people who loves task completions then this job ain't for you
bad,"In the interview I was made aware that I wouldn't be lifting packages any larger than 17kg which was my limit to be honest. She said I would be in the ""Smalls Section"" which is handling small parcels. Instead I was given 4 vans to load alone, weight almost always being 25kg-35kg with no aid and a quantity of approx 750 to load. Management do not even attempt to cater or aid struggling employees. I made them aware that I was not coping and that I could not cope much longer with this position, hoping they would try me in another area - they did not. "
bad,As a seasonal hire I was promised 30 hours a week and was advised that I will be getting enough hours to quit my other job. I was sent home upon arrival almost every single day due to seniority of full time hires. Supervisors were not instructive or helpful in explaining expectations. Coworkers seemed unhappy and irritated with management and each other. Overall it was not a fulfilling experience or healthy work environment.
bad,U will never get train have to learn on your own .Supervisor get fired fast. Employees work hard during peak season.The pay is good but they stick by stupid rule HR ready to fire somebody they don’t listen to you mind already set you must call Corp office
bad,"Let me start by saying the drivers are top notch people to work with. However, HR and Management are straight up liars. What they promise in the interview won’t happen. You won’t get the hours you’re promised. They tell people anything because they’re desperate for seasonal help cause they burn bridges with people. Only highlight was working with the drivers. The drivers are treated like garbage as well. I took this seasonal job to make up what I was short on tuition and even told them that and was told I’d get more than enough hours to earn that. Didn’t happen and now it looks like I can’t return to school. They don’t even have the guts to return my calls and give me an answer and my calls have been very polite. Honesty and integrity in the workplace are not difficult. Unless you’re really hard up for money, I can’t in good consciousness recommend this place."
bad,Blaaaah they just use you an they dont even appreciate your hard work. Most of the regular workers you work with are pretty cool. Supervisors would just walk around the whole plant doing nothing but acting like they were working!!
bad,Does not add up to the types of work you do on a daily basis. Heavy liften and the supervisor was very rude with no manners. She was also a young girl fresh out from university. Didnt grasp the overall position of a manager
bad,Tensions between union employees and salary management team prevents either side from working together. Those with more time in on the site treat newcomers with disrespect and blame failings on them regardless of lack of training.
bad,"You are never a full fledged employee unless you are a driver. The managers are part time, package handlers part time. You should probably do this job as a minimal effort side job for extra money."
bad,UPS Freight doesn't treat there employees with any respect. The atmosphere at THE company is us against them attitude. The only thing I do is my job go home. There is no incentive to do anything extra.
bad,"Do NOT work here! Worked here during christmas they dont care about customer or employee only moving packages. Also NOT $17 an hour. Starts at 14. They do not care one bit about seasonal employees only their union full time ones. If you are seasonal/Part time you are treated like scum of earth. "
bad,"Hey, it’s a little consistent cash flow, only really worth the trouble around the holidays and even then, barely.  The payroll or whoever takes down hours is extremely suspicious as they shorted my checks exactly 9 times in the past year.  Not all hubs are the same, but mine, the S.M.A.R.T. Hub is pretty lackluster, called ""SMART"" but then leaves out the ""T"" (Teamwork), and is generally an energy draining environment you should only work in if you resigned yourself to be stuck in the same position and treated like less than what you deserve."
bad,I liked the job but managmet was not good at all.but overall the employes where very helpful and nice .also the hours where nice because i have a family and the benefits where ok
bad,"Many long term employees who think they are management and are favored and are - - - h - - - s"
bad,"UPS promises the world in orientation and skips over the fact that the work is literally slave labor."
bad,"It was great to get the job but was ready to leave shortly. It wasn't the work that bothered me, That was easy, it was the lack of work hours I would get. They kept saying how much they needed people but within a week it was by call-in basis. And I was only getting if lucky a day of work for the week. Not for me, I had to find a more stable place to work."
bad,Lured in with false promises from middle management of promotions and big salary but it is just a carrot on a stick situation to get the most out of you. Company is completely reactive and only does things their way. The only redeeming quality of this place is my benefits. If you ever work for UPS join the union and NEVER leave it.
bad,"They treat you bad. The managers are constantly yelling at you. Supervisors also laugh at you, They don't care for their employees. favoritism, racism"
bad,Not a good job to work at at all. All they do is overwork you and you get next to no benefits. They dont want to give you any breaks and you're working in terrible conditions. If you want next to no money and a broken back then this is the job for you.
bad,"If you are under the age of 25, habitually show up late for and call off work, enjoy being disrespectful to your co-workers and supervisors, and are a mouthy, cocky know-it-all, then the Johnstown, PA facility is the place for you!    "
bad,"I would not recommend to work here! No life and extremely poor run company! Poor Management! Go, go, go, as soon as you punch in. No drug test there, so many addicts on forklifts! Dangerous/Hazardous, how so you ask. "
bad,"The management at the Brooklyn base (times square) is horrible, favoritism at best. Underlying racism, and unrealistic goals set forward""without guidance for new comers."
bad,"Odd hours, lack of care to employees physical health during the summers in hot heating up trailers. Always being yelled at and being forced to produce higher numbers."
bad,"This can be a great job, but balancing the negative energy and negative attitudes inside the building is a challenge. There is also no flexibility with time off."
bad,Loved some of my coworkers. Hated the negativity in the building and favoritism was very strong here! Some days were very stressful and long. Always be prepared to hear something your doing wrong
bad,"Poorest management i’ve ever experienced , and i’ve worked around 20 + jobs in all different kinds of fields . Micro Management isnt even the word . They place too much emphasis on things that dont matter , but when real issues or problems arise , there isnt anyone around to step up and make any split decision and Remember , It is always the driver’s fault . The pay is good , the benefits are good . Nothing else is really that good"
bad,"Extremely racist, sexist, disrespectful and stressful work environment. Employees are hostile and disrespectful to each other. No comradery. Very stressful. This is definitely not a place I would recommend to anyone for employment."
bad,"The Prescott Valley center is dirty, poorly managed, and basically a black sheep offshoot building the company has written off. "
bad,They only give me 4 to 4 & 1/12 hrs a day when they actually let me work & it's not overstaffed. & the supervisor I would usually work with is very rude & decides to just rag on me alone because I'm new
bad,"Worst company to ever work for, it’s safety, safety, safety until you point it out to them they’re wrong, too much micromanagement. Coworkers were nice though, everyone had each other’s back which was really nice."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"a lot of osha violations its very loud, you only get a ten minute break its very hot a lot of health and safety violations. they over load you with work. very little hours"
bad,The management there are rude overbearing and will yell at you for not doing what they want you to do at all times they want you to work they can machine and if you're not capable of that you are useless to them and they kick you to the curb
bad,Stay away from this place they treat you like a slave in here and you have to carry heavy boxes it doesn’t matter if you’re strong or not this is a terrible job to work at I quit on my second day and they will terrible place to work at two do not come here I know it’s only a four hour shift but it’s terrible you’re not allowed to get a break you get a break when a manager tell you only took my break and they tell you to hurry up when they see you
bad,Fraudulent human resources. They don't stand behind anything. They told us 13 an hour at the interview then it was 10.35 at orientation awaiting a shift deal to increase to 13 and that until it was raised to that we would receive back pay. Only got 10-12 hours a week. Over holidays one week we worked 22. Big waste of time unless your stupid.
bad,The job was so easy and relaxing in the beginning until they have you doing things that’s not in your job description. I was injured on the job. Every day I would leave the job I was in so much pain and could barely walk from constantly heavy lifting. They mistreated their employees especially the African Americans. They don’t care about you. I would never work for this company or refer my friends or family to this company.
bad,"Too many chiefs and no Indians..."
bad,"Management will give you no training at all and when you don’t understand and screw up they want too write you up. And will not give you training after asking multiple times and have to get the union involved to back you cause they don’t care . Miserable environment, UPS small package is probably better and they pay a lot more that’s a fact!"
bad,"They do not train you at all. They put you to work with no instruction and leave you to figure things out on your own and then complain when you do something wrong. You are not guaranteed work daily, they send new employees home early or at beginning of shift regularly."
bad,I do not recommend anyone working there. It is brutal. This should be your last resort. They will hire anyone at anytime because people always quit after their first week there.
bad,"Management treat you like a robot."
bad,"I would never return and I’m so happy I left.  They preach about sup vs union work, but then throw the pt sups in the trailer to load and then expect them to still complete knowledge checks, salting, method evals, etc which is impossible.  And it’s hard to advance or take a step down from a managerial position to a union position. "
bad,"I worked 2 Christmas’ with UPS and both times my driver that I was helping was completely stressed out, with the amount of work and hours. 1 stressing his wife, other 1 stressing his life. So much so that it almost rubbed off on me, then I quickly realized I was a kid and my job was seasonal, so these 12hr shifts are gonna pay off. For my driver on the other hand with his “girlfriend” callin him as he smokes a pack a day on the package route, he was upset."
bad,"I worked as a Seasonal Driver. After the Holiday season was finished, the work slowed down. You will be told to come in each morning, and will have to stay for about 3 hours to be told that there isnt any work available. They send you home with no pay and tell you to report the next day. I have no idea how they get away with this."
bad,"UPS is a widely known organization that employs many people from various age groups from a lowly age of 17 to elderly age of 65. My experience with UPS is a horrendous one. To start, in order for me to get a start date, I waited almost 2 months after going to 2 interviews. I went to the 3 training days where they explained how working for UPS is an investment toward your retirement in the future if you choose to stay. Their manipulating tactic of getting people to stay is convincing new hires to realize that their going to be working extremely hard in harsh weather conditions for approx. 180-200 paycheck each week. Furthermore, you only work approx. 4.5 hours per night as a loader. I start my first night as a loader, and I'm introduced to a sweltering hot semi-truck trailer. While being terribly trained to place packages according to their system which is called a ""wall"". You're being bombarded with packages weighing from 2 pounds to 120 pounds. You have to keep up or unless you will back up the conveyor and hold the process up. Furthermore, they remind you to stay hydrated and their water filtering system is terrible, and their ice machine never has any ICE !!! So, after my second day of seeing my training supervisor not help me during my training but texting on his phone about his girlfriend issues. I DECIDED TO LEAVE !!!! Lastly, if you're not in physical shape, don't do this job. PERIOD !!"
bad,"You will work very very hard in place but no body recognised your efforts, and at the end of week. When you suppose to be happy with your check, they check still not corresponding in the amount of job you did, if you read this please save your time and effort to even think about working at ups."
bad,"My experience wasn’t good. I worked night shift loading trucks. I would load two trucks and manage the flow by myself due to my coworker not wanting to do his job and management did nothing about it. I worked extremely hard every night but it wasn’t worth the pay I received. management was okay. I never got in trouble cause i did my job really well. There were multiple incidents where employees actually fought management due to management saying rude comments to employee. There also was a time where i was sent into a truck that was backed up and boxes were everywhere and the guy regulating the flow got a jam and got mad and pushed a 25lb box off hitting me in the head because he wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings of people below him. If this is a job your looking into, just be very careful and make sure your partnered with someone with good hygiene and does there part."
bad,"Get a job in another place, UPS in Chelmsford is a living nightmare, Supervisors are disorganized, some of them abusive and HR doesn't do anything about it. Management is a joke, the environment at work is mostly boring or stressful and superiors treat regular workers like they are worthless. I haven't seen a place so unprofessional and disgusting as this one."
bad,Management sucks. Zero opportunities to move up in the company unless you work there for 20 years. New hires aren’t trained they just put them in trucks and expect them to know what to do. UPS doesn’t care about their workers your just a number to them they just want production.
bad,"Mamagment only cares for themselves, if they mess up your checks they dont care to fix it because it doesn't effect the money they are getting. They will also lie about doing correct procedures."
bad,"Unsafe working conditions, 220$ a week on top of paying union dues, I worked there for an entire year. Watched 20 people quit while working. Don’t work here unless you’re a driver. Package handlers are treated like garbage and you will notice this the first week in. Union is useless Also. I quit and was happy doing it."
bad,"Had to be available between 4 and 10 p.m. Would get a daily text from my supervisor around lunchtime each day for start time. Would often receive a text to be in 30 minutes earlier than previously asked. Would often go in and after an hour be asked told to go home because too many people were scheduled. Had to fill our grievances with union to ensure 3.5 hours of work, then have supervisor retaliate. Got hurt on the job and the supervisor would not leave the exam room as I had to undress for an xray. Not a female friendly place to work."
bad,"Management just yells at you and expects you to go above and beyond with impossible tasks. The drivers are incredibly disrespectful, and claim to be your boss. The pay is laughable for the work you do, also they lie about how much you will be paid.Benifits and paid time off take a year to kick in. Lastly they can send you home multiple days a week if they want to save labor cost."
bad,Constantly yelled at and pushed beyond human levels of expectations.  Always pushing you to move faster even though you were moving as fast as you could.
bad,"Management is a joke and the expectations are unrealistic at times.. worst labor intense job with stress ever. Treating you poorly, false promises and lie after lie.. On call u less your a buddy"
bad,"I received poor training for 3 days and was thrown out to fend for myself. When things didn't go well, I was laid off for 3 and 4 days out of the week.  Management talked to me like I was scum and just all around horrible work environment."
bad,Dealing with the Teamsters from all levels of the company is a problem and contributes to a toxic culture between management and hourly workers. Work environment is also negative.
bad,"most stressful job and high paced,get in fix what is wrong then leave,but must be in d.ec.r. and manager cant even be bothered with that,poor attitude these days for ups is cutting every corner of not needed cost like car wash,half time drivers cant even see out bug covered windows but want something for nothing"
bad,I work for 2 hours a night for 15$ a hour.  I work 3rd shift. And part time workers was supposed to get 3 to 3 in a half hours max for part time and we dont. Cant live off for $120 a week when you got union dues and Insurance
bad,"Horrible employer. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Except enemies and those I don’t like. Beat me down and caused health problems. Never ever ever work there, unless you’re a masochist."
bad,"The employment process was full of ups and downs. Depending on the line you were working on meant the level of stress you were dealing with. Throughout the time I worked there, there were some bumps in the road with errors on my part and that I feel not responsible for. When I informed them of my deployment orders, I seemed to be pressured to quit to the sudden jump in errors such as misloading packages or not loading fast enough. It was suspicious as to how much they seemed to find wrong with my cars while personal inquiries didn't match up with what was being reported. I ended up quitting a couple weeks before my mobilization date; in hindsight I believe this is what they wanted me to do."
bad,The MAIN supervisor doesn't care about his employees. He's rude and a racist. They do not do proper training. They require too much from one person. They do not give decent breaks. The whole education repayment is bologna.
bad,"been there almost 2 years if you want to become a driver do it before you get good at something inside the building."
bad,this company should be investigated for the underpay on its employees. its ridiculous that people lose blood sweat and energy at this place only to take home 200 bucks per week.
bad,"They want you to do hard work for barely any pay because ""it doesn't require a degree"". Employees face many dangers everyday working in those trucks in all types of weather conditions and should paid accordingly."
bad,Working at UPS was stressful. There is little to no management support. Could be abusive at times. Little opportunities for advancement. I would not recommend UPS as a great place to work.
bad,"Only if your absolutely desperate for a job would I consider working in a UPS hub. Work is too hard for the pay and the air quality, hours, management are horrific. Supervisors are always doing union work and the union stewards turn a blind eye to this type of behavior. Only family members or close friends of supervisors are looked well after and taken care of. Somehow the Union stewards step-daughter was able to bump off an employee with 25+ years for an easier job, remarkable!"
bad,I found myself hating this job. I unloaded packages at UPS and the management was horrible and I found myself constantly wanting to quit. I never got any sleep and it was unfair as to who did the most work.
bad,"I could go on for hours about this, but I will stay brief. It was terrible to work there. Management was incompetant and extremely bureaucratic. There is so much middle management that by the time news and initiatives travel down the ladder they make no sense, but they are enforced like laws."
bad,I'm hire for the night shift and my job is pemanent but they give me work only for 2 weeks than they always call me and said that don't come today we have a off tonight and their staff is not good they treat you like animals.
bad,"There is no hiring system that is followed by human resources.  Part-time supervisors have to do all of the work in the hiring process for the part-time operations.  Advancement in management is made impossible for most employees because of the ""outside hire"".  It is used as a back door to bring in people with little or no experience with UPS.  Center managers are able to hire anyone they like without an interview, skill or knowledge assessment, attendance check, or acceptable experience."
bad,Thier not up and up with the workers that hair seasonal work and they don't provide the badges that the workers need .from my experience the mangment all jam up . cause they text in a group message telling us no work tomorrow cause low volume .then to come to find out the only reason why I not working is because of the badges that we should have gotten wen we all got the job I personally ask for the badge all they told me is only get 2 badges .I'm still not working .
bad,"My overall work experience with Ups was conflicting. we received poor management and organization from multiple Mangers. With disorganization: no uniform was given or proper dress code was worn, time of arrival to work was given the night before or the morning of ,and the overall work place culture was not cohesive to an actual professional workplace environment."
bad,"my hours have recently been cut so I have nothing good to say "
bad,"Management is terrible, wages posted on advertisements are a lie, you start out way less than advertised. Hours are a lie too,  start times vary on a day to day basis and only full time workers are informed of when to come in on time. It sounds crazy but its true, stay away from here."
bad,"they really don't care about you. they care more about the packages getting into the trucks on time than your safety. My manager was a horrible, mean man who when you were done loading your trucks, would make you go load someone else's trucks which were a nightmare. the hours are horrible. I do not recommend."
bad,If the owner of The UPS Store is fair and nice then it will be a good place to work.  The majority of The UPS Store owners are selfish and do not like to pay a fair wage.  They expect you to do more jobs all the time but refuse to offer fair compensation.
bad,"I would get called out 2-3 hours before the time the tuck had to leave.  I was on call, as needed basis.  No steady work.  Once holidays were over , UPS called 1-2 times every week, then once a week, then once every other week."
bad,The only thing fair about this company is work life balance if you are NOT in management.  You have to know people or kiss behind to move up in the company and I have a few more years to go before I retire!  Thank the LORD!
bad,"Norwich depo, poor place to work, manager didn't know what he was doing, tried bullying to bully me but got a shock when i bit back."
bad,"The company expects you to work long hours but does not value its middle management employees."
bad,See rating...there is nothing good to say with the area that I work in.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  Do not value the feedback of older workers and push inexperienced workers into management positions without experience.
bad,"i sacrificed a lot working for this company hoping it would show and i would be able to be hired on full time. i changed my job and my hours to help my manager out and he couldn't even help me with having 2 consecutive days off. My 2 days off were Sunday and Thursday i had a toddler and a 3 year old at the time, its not easy having 2 split days off with trying to explore and take my children to experience life."
bad,"Missing leading info about compensation. Managers micromanage team. Managers speak of condescending and humiliating words. Work environment is horrible, share desks between employees and contractors."
bad,They treat their management like second rate employees.  Unachievable goals and expectations.  They are ok with management getting paid less than the hourly Union employees.
bad,"This place started add a good place,  but the pressure of the high pace and stress got to me! Very stressful on all the employees, with no time to breath."
bad,"I've not had too many jobs, but this was by far the worst. 7 managers all telling me different things, which I'd get in trouble with all of them for not doing theirs first. Hours were sporadic, managers filed them improperly for new people, and so many other things I can't be bothered to start with."
bad,"Your day to day objective was to get packages unloaded, scanned, and put on route trucks"
bad,The most enjoyable part that I liked was the job itself.  Management are horrible and HR is there to protect UPS from liabilities not for the employees.
bad,"UPS management believes that threatening supervisors is the way to motivate them.  UPS promotes a hostile work environment in their management.  The job itself is not bad, it's just the incredibly aggressive and hostile upper management that make this company unbearable to work for."
bad,"If you enjoy loading trucks in the middle of the summer when it is 100 degrees outside, 110 degrees inside of the factory, but 115 degrees inside of the truck, then this is the job for you. Other than that this job has low compensation, as well as terrible benefits and no time off because they purposefully cut your hours, even when they need you, in order to make sure you do not get any benefits. I did however lose twenty pounds while working at this job, so if you want to get paid to workout this might be the job for you."
bad,"war im Center Bremen eingestellt habe mindestens ohne Pause meine 10 Stunden am Tag gemacht man sagte mir man muss um 08:15 Uhr beginnen aber bezahlt wird erst ab 08:45 Uhr man nimmt keine Rücksicht auf das Arbeitsschutzes Gesetz denen ist alles egal Hauptsache ist die Pakete sind aus dem Center bei Fehlern wird man dumm angemacht die Bezahlung ist zwar überdurchschnittlich aber ich habe für den Monat 5 nur 1000 Euro bekommen wo ist das überdurchschnittlich rein weg ein Betrügerverein wer sich gerne ausnutzen lassen will oder wer wie ein Stück dreck behandelt werden will soll gerne zu UPS (Unterdrückt Personen Selbstverständlich) dann soll man noch Pakete bis 70 KG transportieren wie man das macht ist einem selbst überlassen. "
bad,The job  was fast paced I got yelled at for picking a box up more then once to tape it because it needed taped. I was told they would call me back to work never got a call and I called and he said they will call back. Never received that call
bad,"I'm used to the 8-5 grind, when I started at UPS I was told I'd be getting there at 3am. When I interviewed with UPS I was horribly sick. I managed to walk out to the parking lot and take care of business after the tour and introduction. Seems the employers liked that I'm willing to take care of business no matter how I'm feeling because I got the job. The next couple weeks I was asked to show up for work but then never got a call from them confirming when I was supposed to work again. I was told to talk to the shift manager, then the district manager and it seemed like I was getting the run around. I finally got a check mailed to me and I knew it was over. I'm a scrawny guy. I don't know what they were thinking when they wanted me to lift packages in excess of 90 Lbs.. This job was insanely fast paced. We had one guy load the conveyor belt so quickly, it often created jams. Some days, I'd scan packages and place stickers on them which was near impossible with the package frequency and the speed of their scanning machine."
bad,"Training sucks, supervisor is worry more for going home early rather than training you properly. Got let go the second week because I did 100 stops in 12 hours, what do they expect from me in such a short time and horrible training and extreme pressure????"
bad,"When you go to work at this warehouse there is no free water its always hot and you never work at the same station you started at. This job will stress you out just by the way the building is run, the pay rate and hours aren't consistent and there is no set end time or start time for the shift."
bad,"I worked at UPS in the call center and it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had while working. I was told that I had to have either blond, brown, black or natural red hair. I also had to wear long sleeve shirts, foundation to cover my skin and sometimes arm wraps because you are not allowed to have tattoos there. Keep in mind, this is a call center where literally ZERO customers enter. You were also required to wear Business attire and I DO NOT mean business casual. There reasoning being that the ""owners"" were old school type gentlemen. "
bad,"Pretty much zero respect is shown by management for hourly employees.The workplace environment is stressful and fast paced. I didn't mind the pace but the lack of respect is what really left a bad taste in my mouth leaving work everyday. Pay is too low, but benefits are the only thing that has kept me working here."
bad,"Hated this job in human resources working in the fmla department. Management was all ghetto fabulous females and short angry males of all colors and races. Lazy, uncooperative, terrible seating arrangements, no privacy whatsoever and you basically have to raise your hand to go to the bathroom. Coworkers were ignorant,m uneducated and basically mean. Please keep looking for another job."
bad,"Every day I came home with chest pains and sinuses full of dirt and dust. I barely made enough to cover my bills, but was too tired for a second job. During the holidays they made you sign a waiver forfeiting your right to a lunch break. If you didn't sign it they harassed you until you did, or just didn't give you the legally-required break. They are a huge employer in the city so they get away with it. After two years I was doing the exact same job I started in."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had. I would not recommend working at UPS as a manager/supervisor. The company culture is poor. There is a severe lack of respect between those on your team and a severe lack of trust between supervisors and employees. Training and expectations are laughable at best. Too many Indians, not enough chiefs. Personal and professional boundaries are grossly overstepped. "
bad,"With little to no training they expect you to already know how to do the job. some of the people there are complete idiots, there are a few good people."
bad,Don't recommend it at all. The supervisors are horrible people. Half of them dont know a thing and is very lazy. If you really want to apply for a loader position try the one in Lockport. The place is ran how a warehouse should be ran. Not to mention they have the right equipment to get the job done.
bad,"This place will corrode your humanity slowly. The hours are hectic, the way they treat you even as a manager is very crude and unrewarding. i believe they need to improve on their treatment."
bad,Management unprofessional. Union environment is a joke. Management doesn't care about associates or family. Associates not helpful and dont care. Work change daily.
bad,"As I was told by my Direct Supervisor that UPS is not a place for everyone.  Its a fast pace environment that is very stressful and pay is not very good.  You don't get Benefits until your there a year and you have to make 70 working days before Seniority since its a Teamsters Union shop.  Management is very dishonest they say at the beginning if a particular job don't work for you, you may try to do something else, which was a total lie because I had worked the pre-load shift and ended up not being able to do a good job of loading the package trucks and had asked if there was another job I could do instead that I would be better at, Instead I was told there is nothing else and so more or less they set me up to fail so that I didn't make my 70 working days and that they could find a reason to let me go."
bad,"No coordination, favoritism, and most of all disrespect. Everyone is kept in the dark on most issues, many managers aren't even aware of upcoming events."
bad,"There is a certain type of person that can handle this job and I was not one of them. It's highly physically demanding. To the point of pain for me. Most employees were very negative and didn't want to be there. There was usually a lot of yelling and insulting behind backs and to peoples' faces. Very occasionally there's violence. The pay was very low and you had to wait a year for benefits to kick in. It was only a few hours a day and you have to get up in the middle of the night. If you can't pull your weight, figuratively and literally, and you don't have very thick skin it isn't for you. If you're a big alpha male who likes physical work doesn't mind constant criticism and insults and can wait for years to become a driver then this job is for you."
bad,"Unless you're an hourly within the union (drivers, package handlers, etc.) then UPS is not a very good company to you.  They've stripped away pension now (I'm very young so I'll never get to see it), they've given up free healthcare so that they may provide it to the union, and when you get into management it is very difficult to move up in the company.  They say the company is not based on seniority but it is.  It's also one of those companies where you develop skills that are really only suited for that company so it's very difficult to use my experiences as leverage with other jobs."
bad,"When part time you only work 20 hours or less during the week, after a 3-4 hour shift you feel like you been working a 8 hour shift, the pay isn’t good at all for the amount of work people do"
bad,Glad to no longer be working there.  Management plays games and the drivers are pawns until they make the union book.  Bosses are rude and have no respect for their drivers or staff.
bad,"Alot of it depends on who your helper cord is and who your driver is...can be very chaotic and no fun with the wrong ones. Have done it three times over 10 years but never again. Also, hard on the body. "
bad,The culture at United Parcel Service from my experience was poor.  I know sometimes it's the nature of the job but there could have been a lot more done to aide the employees and make them feel welcomed and appreciated.
bad,Ups as a package handler will never get you any where in life if you work at ups they will  treat you as slave until you reach supervisor level even then they do not give you enough hours to support a lifestyle of any kind
bad,"No family time, days off are difficult to come by, you never know when you'll finish work, it could be a 9 hour day or 12 you just don't know. You can get up to 3 8 hour days per month...if you've been there long enough."
bad,Constant friction between the union and management.  Continued harassment by UPS managment towards their drivers.  No respect for the individual.  Company has had violence occur in the work place because of their policies.
bad,"extreme heat wave, unsafe environment, harsh management, low pay rate, lack of communication, putting people last for priority, union doesn't do much to help"
bad,"Management is the biggest issue with UPS Freight. Everyone seems to want to make a name for themselves by saving the company money but at the expense of the customers and the associates. In the General Office there have been so many layoffs, that most are looking for employment elsewhere as there is no type of job security. If you are able to promote out of customer service, you maybe able to find a rewarding career but getting out is the hardest thing to do!"
bad,Enjoyed it when I first started but after a few years management at ups is not true management. Managers and other employees speak to each other but yelling and cussing each other out.
bad,"If you want no work life balance, this is your job!  pay and benefits are good, but hours during peak will be extremely long.  Union environment is very challenging."
bad,"My job as an unload-er consisted of unloading numerous trailers each day. The trailers would reach temperatures of 110 degrees in the summertime, and below zero in the wintertime, as there was no heat or air in the warehouse or trailers."
bad,"I had been with company for 2 years and they never appreciated the work i did, I was very undervalued. Because I new the policies and procedures and refused to let management and other co workers walk all over me, I was degraded and terminated. I was also threatened by another employee and management let it slide and didn't nothing to ensure my safety. Management was ruthless. When I attended the union meeting and begged for my job back they had no sympathy and simply stated they didn't want me. When I attempted to get other employment, management of UPS continuously tried to sabotage my chances of getting the job."
bad,Very Unprofessional not enough work hours Bad Employee work relationship no respect for other weather its empolyee or management no full time workers at the lower leveel positions
bad,"Management was horrible and was just pushing people around."
bad,A typical day here was organized but strange. 1300-2000 boxes between four delivery trucks(one person) at very demanding fast pace. The hardest part of this job was getting 6/7 hours worth of work done in 4 hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was the 1 ten minute break.
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had in my life.  I was very good at what I did, however, the environment was very stressful and affected my health in a very negative way.  The pay was good but there was way too much favoritism."
bad,A typical day at work was moving boxes in different shapes and sizes to and from the trucks. I learned about how mail travels around the world. Management was fair because they were in the same predicament we were in. Workplace culture was very fast paced and serious. The hardest part of the job was being out in bad weather during the summer or winter. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting decent pay for the work that was done.
bad,Highly recommend that management take extended leadership classes before qualified for the job because they lack the ability to communicate well with employees.
bad,"Used to be a okay place to work at. Due to change of managers overtime, things started changing for the worse. I hate this job and can't wait to quit."
bad,It's a good company to work for the only issue I had was that my manager and owner of the store I worked at treated me poorly. Working for him with that kind of treatment made the job very hard. They also did a poor job of training people in and would get mad if you didn't know how to do something even if you were never trained to do it.
bad,Disgusting attitudes from supervisors and dreadful teamwork! No matter how u feel or what problems u have. They just don't care and expect u to do the job and do your told
bad,I came to UPS and was excited to be a part of the company and had dreams of working there till I was retired. When I first met the Manager of the facility he would not even shake my hand as a new recruit. He basically gave me the lecture that the grass isn't greener on the other side and that I would make good money at UPS. After the first month I wanted to leave...they pretty much make your life horrible by treating you like your a thief and liar. Their goal is to push you to the brink of madness and wanting to leave and it does not stop unless they want it to. I was never a union employee and didn't think much about it until they tried their best to write you up on any thing they can so that they have a paper trail on you if they decided to get rid of you. The benefits are great but you will never be able to go see the doctor or dentist...you have to literally fight every day with them on everything. The guys that deliver freight like you are great and they understand what you are going through every day because they have been through it. I got wrote up for going to the emergency room just to give you an example of what they do at the Denver/ Commerce City hub. Its a constant fight every day before you leave to get started on your deliveries. I have never been treated more like a peace of trash by anyone like I have from this company. If you go to work for the Commerce City Freight...know what your getting yourself into before you go. There have been a large amount of people who have left the company just shortly after arriving. Not much I can say that's good about UPS here
bad,"People work under horrible conditions at UPS. If anyone works outside, they will have to deal with whatever weather is going on. You have people not showing up, you have managers not doing their job, you have a jacked up system that expects you to work under their conditions or they will fire you. We didn't get any breaks at all."
bad,Very early morning work hours. The warehouse manager was sexist and very ethnically discriminatory. I would not recommend this job to anyone. The only good thing about this job was the cost of living raise that came once a year.
bad,too big to police themselves. small facilities aren't run with health and safety in mind. Allow on car supervisors much freedom and responsibility to break policies and procedures as they see fit.
bad,"A typical day at UPS, consists of training and re-training. We have to focus on on-time network and servicing packages in a timely fashion. The best part about the job is being able to interact with different people from different walks of life. I love to train and teach people. My co-workers were very supportive and promoted teamwork on a daily basis."
bad,there is good working shif here. annual increment and bonus are really great.but now there have financial problem in this company and we need to downgrade our position.
bad,No breaks are given to sorters or loaders that are handling up to 800-1000 packages per day for five hours straight sometimes.
bad,"Management bully the life out of you."
bad,as you can not keep time of your work hours upon request of the time sheet was allways edited by office ladies.was allways missing money was one of the reasons I left.
bad,"I started working at ups as a package handler, I loaded trucks. After going through the long employment process,  I started what I thought was going to be a great job. I thought they could work with me considering I'm a student and I needed them to work around my student schedule. They wouldn't do that, nor were they going to let me go home for any breaks to see my family, my breaks are only 2 weeks at most and there are no lack of employees to cover that time. Pay wasn't bad, the work you're expected to do in a short time is ridiculous, especially since over half of the employees in my hub didn't know how to do their job correctly. My first day of training I was left alone by my trainer, she forgot to come back, left me there alone for around 2 hours, slammed with work and very stressed. Maybe this would be a good job for a person who enjoys being treated like they're a robot. I pinched a nerve in my wrist and could hardly lift a box over 15 pounds. I didn't want to work to further avoid injury, and still they persisted that I work, until I just left and told them I was done. I definitely don't recommend this as a student, sure they can pay some for schooling but the amount of stress and pain that comes with it isn't work it, to me at least. Takes a certain person to do this type of job so seriously think about it before considering employment here."
bad,"Difficult work environment, toxic management style, fast pace work, growing company with room for advancement, best part about job is you get a free workout."
bad,Co workers and management alike are hard to get along with. Work has changed over the years. Worse than when I started. I do not recommend working here unless you want part of your school paid off.
bad,Managers bully you every single day about why you could not get more work done in less time. Unrealistic expectations! Hard to even find the time to stop to have lunch or even a bathroom break. BEWARE
bad,I simply don't care for UPS because they don't do re hires no matter what the circumstances. I was  a hard working loyal employee
bad,"Ups is not a good place to work,, They do not help to excel and like to look good with the public but treat employes unfairly."
bad,"I was a casual carrier. I went from station to station to deliver mail all over the city, that was fun. I enjoyed it tremendously"
bad,"good benefits, good company, management ok, had the opportunity to sharpen my skills, nice co workers, decent work environment, used to be better"
bad,"This position was very physically demanding and mentally draining because usually only one person is responsible for unloading an entire semi truck, and you have to do it as fast and as safely as possible or you are replaced."
bad,"after a year i have learned how bad the mechanics manager was, always follow your instincts. benefits are a joke, union dues are high and speaking of union don not expect them to stand behind you.  opinion is encouraged but not appreciated and used against you and your co workers.  do not sign any papers even when they tell you its ok.  it will be used against you. It is rare to get a good supervisor, they are instructed by the manager(bad)(whenever i think of him HITLER COMES TO MIND others called the management (GESTAPO- Google it), if you are a snitch you will move up (takes time though) you might wear out your lips :O by then. great place if you dont want friends and are a loner (no social life).  tools needed -hammer and chisel , tie straps supplied by the company.  again great company to get your foot in the door.  just my opinion, so i encourage you to find out for your self and please prove me wrong.  this might sound like a bitter review so i challenge you !!!!!! got more to come:)"
bad,There was no time to play games. You came in do your job no more or less. At lunch we would talk about family or what has change at the job. Put a lot of work in safety of the workers and for management. Honest day's work Honest day paid.
bad,"Part-time management treats you like livestock rather than a human being.  I once got suspended from going to the restroom.  "
bad,Customer service was very demanding. Driving was a challenge physically as well as mentally. Long work hours (overtime was mandatory). Servicing the public everyday required patience and very good communication skills. Virtually no chance for advancement to any management positions.
bad,"My work day was okay, but we only got one break and when i asked to switch to a different area they said ""no"" and let me go. The only thing i learned was how to scan the packages into the trailers. The management was terrible, they refused to work with there employees. My co-workers were okay i didn't really have any problems with anyone. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the load... the most enjoyable part of the job was when I got done loading my trailers."
bad,Job culture isn't great at all. For the amount of work yo do the compensation doesn't match.
bad,"Harassment, slander, mismanagement, payroll problems, these are just some of the daily day to day things you can expect when working with this company, ESPECIALLY if you are a low level nothing within, which you can expect to remain for quite some time if you don't know anybody on the inside. "
bad,"very boring job with no room for advancement. Management is ok, co-workers are not very friendly. Great use of problem solving skills. This job also allowed me to communicate with people from all over the world."
bad,"UPS is probably the most backwards company I have ever worked for. "
bad,This is a physical labor job. It is in a factory and that working conditions are not ideal.
bad,"Union company, employees got away with whatever they want. Management failed to do anything. Can't trust anyone. Everyone is always mad nobody likes working there. Miserable place to work."
bad,"Typical day was felt like slave work. We were seasonal so we just came to help them out, therefore they made us do everything they didn't want to do. "
bad,I currently work for this company in Coppell. Please do not apply to this location.
bad,"Part time hours, and gained experience. Very tedious work and slow paced environment."
bad,Under Paid Slaves should be the name managers walking behind to yelling telling you to hurry up. Only going to see like 200 a week starting off or less
bad,"Last resort, would not recommend this job to anyone who didn't need to make money quickly."
bad,"I loved To work, But there politics are wrong on how they treat their employees."
bad,"i typical day at UPS is a constant fight with management. Here at UPS you are mistreated by management often. This job is not hard at all, and very easy to adjust to the work culture."
bad,I learned some light computer skills & the Supervisors were decent people. I truely enjoyed the company of some of the employees I worked with & it made working at UPS enjoyable!
bad,They only give you about 5hrs and for the amount of work you do 8.50 an hour is no where near close to being worth it. They feed you all this stuff about advancing in the company but what they don't tell you is that you have to go on a waiting list for example if you want to be a driver you have to work for the company a year then you have to be added to a list and wait to be considered for the position.
bad,Working here is ok if you suck up to management  and like to be micromanaged  other then that that are out to fire you for any reason. Long hours. bs expectations and if u dont meet what they put out  see ya.  Teamsters also dont have your back what so ever so dont expect any help from them
bad,Ups sucks if no union I wouldn’t want to work there . Managers are scum of the earth they care more about the boxes.one more thing ups managers encourage other drivers to be RATS  trust no one .
bad,The work is not so bad except when management rips off there employee's by falsifying employees hours. Just so United Parcel Service can make there company numbers. The UPS warehouse in Lawnside New Jersey is the worse. Every week they take minutes and hours out of peoples paycheck. They think people are to stupid to realize that they are getting ripped off by a multi billion dollar company.
bad,Dont lie to employees. Bad management. False input. Not helpful and dont back up there employees. There not respectful to seasonal employees or stand up for them
bad,Very unsafe environment to work in a very disrespectful management and the hours very from time to time. The good thing about it is they have a union.
bad,The union and staff did not work well. PL the union would help they are poor to safe they can't pick up a box or even touch very lazy group in pre load.
bad,This company is very and organized and very unprofessional. None of the supervisors are trained properly on how to manage delegate work and complete tasks as supervisors should. There's no protocol for training any of the new hires whether they are hourly or part time supervisors. They do not care about their employees whether they are hourly or lower management.
bad,working for people that don't care bout you. if you get hurt or kill they pay your family off so it doesn't show up on the news. you have to wait a year to get your benefits
bad,"Compensation the best there is . Management, very disconnected from the employees . Production driven .You work for shareholders not the company. Since 10/19 they have cut safety in the work place . Profits over safety. I am part of the safety process . Very demanding job , very little life balance."
bad,"4 year pay progression for drivers"
bad,"14 hours a day is required. There is no balance between life and work. "
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Good pay and benefits there doesn't begin until you have union protection. They will send you home id there is a slow day unpaid. They sent me home for a week due to lack of work. and occasionally a day here and there... IMHO if they hire you they should either compensate you or let you go, otherwise they are using you....and they do, at will with no remorse"
bad,"The founder of the company is rolling over in his grave at today's UPS. I use to bleed brown, but since 2008 this company had turned mean, harsh and completely not worth working for. As far as management,  they have slowly taken away most all the benefits of being in management at UPS. Our employees make more than we do, they don't pay for insurance and we do and they also tell at us and there is not much we can do about it. So you are mistreated by upper management and employees.  Horrible job."
bad,"Management in this company is a complete joke.  Work you like a dog, don’t give two cents about you.  They do have good benefits, but they are in no way worth what you have to go through.  Besides, starting pay is not good for the intense labor performed and bad luck hours.  You make more at McDonalds"
bad,"Management treats employees like trash. Everyone is miserable, whether they are making top rate or not. The pay when you start is not worth the pressure they put on you for the first two years."
bad,Pressure all the time from start to finish they are never happy and push you all the time..management are on your back all the time.and the route learning time is so bad 3 days to learn 150 stops it's a bad place to work good place to lose weight the only good thing about it
bad,complete cluster nobody knows anything it’s day to day Not enough staff to keep up!!! Safety is not a Focus or concern upper management and supervisors do not help they just yell or disappear for long periods of time
bad,Awful here everything was bad hours pay and especially management  can trust a single one of them  they will try and fire you any chance they get very unprofessional
bad,"Ups is horrible place to work. They work you for short time, then send you home. The supervisors work after they send the employees home. Less body's to work on there time the bigger the bonuses for them. It's all about management not the people. They talk down to people in there. I don't recommend the company at all."
bad,They want robots not human workers. They do not care about people they only care about the work. They are very impersonal and non flexible at all times.
bad,"Nothing is more important than their production numbers."
bad,"I was a supervisor. I would say the vast majority of my problems came from senior management, not hourly employees. Senior management harasses supervisors with micromanagement, verbal and sometimes physical abuse. As well, senior management expects junior managers will work with serious illnesses. I did and subsequently was hospitalized with pneumonia.  Also, upper management expects junior managers will not file workers' compensation claims and will work with injuries. I did so and eventually required reconstruction of my left foot and lower leg: the result of an untreated ruptured posterior tibial tendon."
bad,"From package handler to supervisor, favoritism, empty promises, disrespectful way of speaking, dictatorship  like. Being in trouble and screamed at for things completely outta your power is wrong and plain disrespectful"
bad,Best paying job that I had  I started out part time and it took a while to go full time back then.  Not so much now a days. Younger generation just don’t want to work so there’s a lot of turnover. I worked there 42 years and I retired kind of all of a sudden. Company never did anything for my retirement and I have been retired for 2 months. Management just don’t have a clue there these days. If you suggest an ideal and present it to them they blow it off because they didn’t think of it themselves
bad,"If you are looking for a fast paced job with bizzare hours, but with great benefits, then UPS is right for you. Management really needs to be worked on, but the good part is that you are in the union after 3 months."
bad,I didnt enjoy my time at ups I'm looking for a more family oriented job it was not family oriented and did not work good with me being there for my children being a single dad
bad,This place is very dysfunctional and the supervisers are terrible. The union dues are too much and they don't help you when it comes to dealing with problems at work
bad,"I was told to yell at my employees. Every day i would come in and know the problems of the day and be powerless to stop them. When i would bring it up to my boss they would tell me not to worry about it. Then after the day when the problem happened, they would reprimand me for it on the same day i warned them about it. The culture and environment was toxic. I was also harassed and reported to my boss and HR and nothing was done."
bad,Management sucked other than that is was okay. Benefits was good. Pay was good if u had aniother job. Takes long time before.ur full time.  Morning crew gets more hour s than evening
bad,"... very particular about physical apperence you will have to unecassarily go out of your comfort zone just to get this job, alot of good natured people will miss this if the 1 week examination is not passed, all this just to deliver parcels."
bad,"The pay and compensation is worth it after a while, but the working conditions are horrible unless you are in management. Work/life balance is a joke there. Some management is alright but theyre constantly getting reamed by their management and well stuff rolls down hill."
bad,Company spends a great deal of time micro managing their CRM sales management tools and not enough time focusing on selling and bring new business on board.
bad,"My experience at UPS was awful. They barely explain how to do the job well, and management expects the impossible everyday. Extremely hot in the summer, and extremely cold in the winter. Peak season starts in October and ends in about January. It is really not worth it. Look elsewhere."
bad,I feel I was pick on by management and was not given a far work environment. Was put out of service for something I didn't do making me loose my home and my car and I feel management was very predigest towards black women.
bad,I don't have much to say besides the simple fact ups shows alot of favoritism and discipline to the wrong employees. They are very strict and they expect you to work like a robot
bad,"Unfair will not have anyone I care work for this company ever I never miss a day"
bad,Union company. Will take about 10 years to make full time. Benefits are excellent. Be prepared to work in extreme heat in the summer and extreme cold in the winter.
bad,"Boring, slow paced, totally based on the 'stay till you retire' notion and no promotion based on skill but time with UPS. Super old school, low pay even from very good school background and degree etc. Never never work here if you want to live mentally free, that is, its all about faking working and cannot do anything else without getting others saying something, aka, work politics. Worst experience of my life. Millenials, dont even think about UPS, please. They say theyre trying, but UPS is great if you want that place where you know you have a job and security, but nothing more."
bad,Constant battle between Union and UPS Supervisors to beat the clock on a daily basis.Supervisors push fast work flow but do not concern themselves with how it affects the employees or their physical and mental health. Great benefits in exchange for part time hours and terrible pay. I give it a solid 2 thumbs down.
bad,"I worked at UPS for 12 years as a part time employee for the insurance benefits as I couldn’t afford insurance in the small business I run. Every single day of operation at UPS is day one. The same mistakes are made day after day. Management is made up of bullies. Payroll is consistently wrong. Part timers pay a higher percentage of union dues than full time drivers and have far, far less protection than a driver. If you are a drug dealer or on parole, this is the job for you. I assure you you will be in like company"
bad,"Upscould be a good job if you dont like to do much work. They promote lazy workers. If you don't do your job there are no worries, for they will have someone else come do it for you. And for those who do do their own job will have to go out and do other people's work. There is no extra pay for doing more work either."
bad,GM at the time had no clue how to run the place union rep Art is a liar the union people are horrible they treat people like they’re robots heaters hardly worked and despite talking to supervisors managers union reps nothing got done about it both driving managers are foul mouthed and talk down to everyone
bad,"In retrospect, I wish I had never applied to UPS Supply Chain Solutions. There are many things you expect to be unpleasant about light-industrial warehousing. Extreme temperatures, high volume, long hours, etc... However, these things were compounded by a negative company culture with no regard to their employees needs and a deeply depressed morale in the employees. "
bad,"UPS is a great place to work if you have kids or a second job because the work hours aren’t very long and the benefits are great after your first year. However, they lack professionalism completely and in most cases, tend to treat the employees as less than human, or expendable. It’s a matter of outweighing the pros and cons."
bad,Management is pure evil. Do not care for the employees unless it's a audit involved. Only apply if you need benefits. Those are the only good thing. Anything more is not worth it.
bad,"I am a loader or bottom of the food chain to the company. Everyone is doing a job that is meant for 2 people management included. Every day the warehouse is a mad house of to many package for too many trucks coming at you at the same time. Meanwhile the supervisor is yelling at you that package's aren't getting put away fast enough, only because she/he just as stressed and scared of his/her boss as you are. Youstart very early around 3-5 am Monday through Friday and the shift ends at 9:30, nothing to complain about there I like getting off early."
bad,If you want to be treated like garbage go work for this company. The minute you suffer a injury you get bullied and treated unfairly.  Sure the insurance is great but the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again.
bad,I worked UPS for 11years and tried three times to be promoted.  I realise after working there so years is the only way to move up is to get involve with someone in management.  I did not go that route because I believe a person should be judge on there work perfomance.  The work atmosphere is horrible and management is even worst.
bad,"They didnt pay me for all the hours in which i worked, and of course had to write my Times in/out manually at first. I figured a solidified company such as UPS wouldnt make a mistake like that so i didnt take pictures for proof, but I had two checks that did not include all of the hours in which I had worked and 3rd check that came in 3 days late.This was completely unacceptable."
bad,"The only two good things i will say about this job is for one thing, the benefits are ok. And second, the co-workers you get are really cool. Other than that. This job sucks"
bad,"Fast paced, stressful, poor communication and management. Overworked and lack of flexibility. No work/life balance (unable to take vacation during summer months, period)."
bad,I worked like a slave to make pennies. I got promoted to work less physically and more mentally just to make nickles. we moved to a Smarthub and I got less hours and more pay just so it would even back out to how much I was making at the old building. they went back to working me like a slave again.
bad,The reason why I left was due to very bad. They claim they are all about safety but that doesn't exist once you are done watching the introduction video. They don't care about your safety as long as they have a high enough flow rate (unloading/loading). Management say will claiming they will fire you because the flow rate isn't high enough.
bad,Been working at ups for a solid month now first week they didn't pay me right second week didn't pay me the owed money just fixed my pay and this week I'm back down to the wrong pay and now I have to go talk to a manager that has no clue how to change it or do anything and there website sucks
bad,"Worked in office. Had terrible supervisors. One which bought their child into work around 11:00 pm EVERY NIGHT! This was endangerment. Took my 30 min. Break one night and clocked back in 1 MINUTE before actual start time. Got written up!  Their disciplinary paperwork is based on coersion. There is a line that states if you do not sign the paper you will be terminated on the"
bad,"You will be stuck on nights for 20 years and the management is a joke the worst group of knuckle heads you will ever have the displeasure of working for, I have never been told how to fix or repair anything in my life until I went to work there they only want parts changers and people to yell at and blame things on I hope you have thick skin and are good at ignoring management and their hilarious temper tantrums."
bad,terrible the management staff is horrible they don't help you with your problems they ignore you like you are not  an asset to the company i was there 12 years
bad,"The management has no idea what they’re doing. You can be a supervisor there with no experience so everyone running things hasn’t even worked there long enough to understand how everything even works. "
bad,"Lowest rating offered. Job security is the only thing offered here really if you decide to stick around. Nothing really beneficial is added, only taken away."
bad,"There is a large gap between the management team and the employees. I have witnessed so many skipped formations and botched security procedures over the years. At UPS, time is of the essence, employer/employee relations are often tense."
bad,"For a part time student, you only get paid minimum wage and on top of that, they expect to take almost have your cheque every month for union dues.  great place if you don't need the money that much.  good advancement and raises, but only if you are willing to stick around for a long time.  I do not recommend this job if you have bills to pay."
bad,"a lot of hate in the building between the union, management, and hourly employees. management often play political game against one and other at the expense of the employees. the work environment is extremely hostile. the company will do what they can to cheat you so u have to watch your pay check so that management doesn't short u hours"
bad,I worked there for 4 years and with the new contract the new hires we're going to make the exact same amount of money as me. That wouldn't be so bad except I was only getting 15-20 hours a week. If you do decide to become a driver then you are introduced to a whole new level of stress and 12+ hour days. The benefits are great if you can stick it out and be prepared to use the bull of your medical on a therapist because you're going to need it.
bad,The job is terrible and not just because of the company but because of the supervisors. It could all be so easy if they hired real supervisors that knew what to do and how to properly do it.
bad,"So many words, And not enough answers! All I got to say is you need to visit the(Portland-Hub)... The place is a clown show. Would never recommend...."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked because of the teamsters. The union polices your work habbits making sure your not too fast and managers push you to go faster. The teamsters are mafia to make things even better. I retired early to get away from the union and would never work in another union position again or want family to. It is very corrupt and UPS knowingly ships illegal drugs.
bad,"the hours were never consistent no matter how hard you worked. "
bad,I have worked here for part time. HR said you will work 5 days at 4am to 9am. But when started the manager said 1st you cannot leave at 9 am. 2nd if we dont need workers they can go home. . There is workers as slave thay packaging 4-5 truck . Facility conditions very bad
bad,Very unorganized with unbelievable turnover rate. Unstable work conditions and scheduling while staffing is underpaid and may be sent home at any time. Definitely not a place of employment if looking for.stable employment or competitive compensation
bad,"Just bench of racists managers who think they are above the law and can get away with everything."
bad,"Many of the employees and managers were way too buddy buddy with each other which often led to favoritism. New employees aren’t given the same opportunities to advance even though they’re more hard working. Extremely unorganized, packages aren’t handled the way they should be at times. Some employees in the food area are incompetent."
bad,"I absolutely hated my time at UPS Call Center.  As far as the logistics (warehouse distribution and delivery), I have no comment except to say that I believe that they would be a better area to work in than their call centers.  The call center location in Las Vegas was more like a high school out of ""Mean Girls"", inner-city style.  There were cliques and if you weren't in one of them, forget any chance of full-time employment.  My supervisor was marginally acceptable; however, the other supervisor was loud, obnoxious and she had her own ""gang"" of girls.  HR was a joke--This extremely elderly lady that UPS had to BEG to stay on past retirement and this older guy who did extremely little as possible.  UPS Global Business Service Call Center, Las Vegas is a snake pit and I would ONLY recommend it if it's them or being in the gutter.  And even THEN, it's not permanent unless you're ""one of the galz"".  Only 1 star because 0 or negative stars are not possible."
bad,"Union workers are rude and malicious! Most union members don’t want to work and complain about everything.  In addition and because of the lack of communication, management/staff/union folks are constantly at odds!"
bad,"Abusive, Rude, Devastating Debasing, Crass, Vulgar, All Around Evil....these of course are all descriptives used to describe non union management....which is as close as I have ever been to a living h-e-l-l."
bad,They are racist towards minorities good benefits and pay to workers don't care about workers well being or safety management show favoritism union doesn't care about workers there just there to get a paycheck and that's sad if you don't kiss as they'll fire you they are very political work with crooked law enforcement they'll let you go for just about anything
bad,"They use people. The work load is just too much, they make you work like robots. No wonder the shifts are not longer than 4 hours because they know that nobody can handle that amount of work load in more than 4hours. The supervisors are so mean, rude and unprofessional, they will blame everything on you just so they can be on the safe side. Promotion is based of seniority which in my opinion I feel like is unhelpful. "
bad,"Management disorganized. They say there will be many opportunities for advancement but there are slim to none. Stressful work environment, the culture is hostile - every man for himself."
bad,"they tell you they care then blame you for them overloading the belt which crushes boxes. they only want fast and full and care none for your safety egress or conditions. they will spill gas, put litter on it and shove you back into the non ventilated trailers to breath the now more noxious gas because they don't understand why cat litter  make  gasoline  evaporation much worse due to increased surface area. overall bad grippy management with no cares about you."
bad,ups is not what you think it is to much discrimination I was told they let me go because I live out in belle glade Florida and it was to far for me to come to work every day but the truth is because I call  corporate  On them do to my hours that was changed and I beat all the supervisors to work every morning the head supervisors said I don’t know why this *****here so *******early we not going to let her work and talk to you any kind of way on the job was told it will be paid interview and  orientation but it’s only for drivers helpers not pre-load on February 13th they call me and told me not to come back to work even doe I was on time and a good work I live to far but something told me to check my time card and they put no call from the 14th of February to March 20th  but to warn y’all if you have a disability problem they will mistreat you worst on the job trust me I was the target
bad,Management doesn't do job efficiently. Multiple cases of co-worker bullying. HR takes for ever to contact back. Pay is poor and not worth the time. Work maybe 12-15 hours a week.
bad,"Worked over the summer thinking it would be a good job, boy was I wrong. The actual work itself is very simple and easy it’s just the matter of how fast you do it. You can easily fall behind if you’re not fast enough scanning and loading the packages in the correct shelf. And to make matters worst, one of the supervisors there always kept pressuring me to work faster. Smh possibly the worst job I ever worked at, full of animals that don’t care about how to handle packages . Throwing them like they playing ping pong, even the ones the had a fragile label wow just wow ."
bad,"Honestly, the only good thing about UPS is their insurance which you have to wait a year to get. My paychecks aren't enough to make a living at all and they've continuously said they'd raise the salary for years and haven't done it yet. Keep pushing it back and giving employees false hope of fair pay. I'm doing less than 20 hours, about 10-14 a week because they also started cutting our hours. Let's just say, I make less than $150 a week."
bad,Never will work for them again pay is lousy over worked and very stressful not enough hours laz y co-workers any thing go no room for growth or improvement
bad,"Very poor management. If you work hard, you are rewarded with more work.  Very dirty warehouses to the point you will be coughing up dust all day.  If you work pre load shift, you will hate your life."
bad,Expect to much of their employees and they treat them like tools. All they care about is getting the trucks done. They look out for themselves and not others
bad,"Seasonal Driver Helper"
bad,"UPS has become so big that they have lost touch with what made them the company they are today. That would be their customers and their employees. Management has put their internal numbers and internal audits ahead of their customers and employees. They are so blind to the fact ""If you don't have customers you don't need employees"". UPS is headed for a big fall."
bad,"Do not work here. UPS treated me horrible, sent me home early during my already short shifts. Called me in whenever they felt like it. Poor management."
bad,"I work for 18 yrs with this company, I got lay off for not reason. I will not recommend this Company to any one. Feels liked prisoner in jail."
bad,I learned that you have to be mentally and physical tough to work for this company. There's some areas in the management department that will work with you and some don't.
bad,"The business is run by con men. In their application and orientation session they said that there was a $150 weekly bonus and a $350 final bonus if you show up every day ontime. When the last week came they reduced it to a $30 weekly bonus because “we’re paying millions to people who only worked one day.” They denied that there was ever a $350 bonus even though the man who assured me it never existed had answered questions about it at the orientation session. Lest you think this was a tragic communication error, I went and looked up the original job offer online and they’ve edited it to remove any mention of the $350 bonus or the possibility of employment after 12/24 (they claimed the job lasted into early January). I can’t believe such a big business would screw over its workers so openly like that. But I guess they know they can get away with it."
bad,"Applied for a seasonal driver position in Phoenix Az. Was hired, got my DOT card and physical, went thru the training and passed, got uniforms and told I would be called. This was a month ago."
bad,Working at UPS Freight is kind of stressful. I really didn't learned nothing besides how to load up trailer pups. Management don't care about anything
bad,"The management team as a whole really have no idea about the Industry. Cant get straight answer nor will they support you if you have family issues and need assistance. No structure in Management Poor Communication, No family time, But plenty of work work work work work  that's all they know so as you can see it not the leader in the industry and far from it. Benefits some time kick in stay out of their 401k use your money to get richer."
bad,"Expectations are unrealistic, work/life balance is terrible. Expected to work nights, weekends, provide business analysis, gather specifications, design, develop, do production support, infrastructure support (Linux, Databases, etc.)"
bad,"Highly stressful. Poor management. Uncaring supervisors.  Unprofessional management.  Dishonest supervisors.  Under-educated supervisors. l"
bad,UPS didnt pay very well i would come out with 100 bucks a week and it was rough to live off of that. I ended up getting a cut on my head which i required stitches and they handled it poorly by saying i was faking it. Not the best place to work.
bad,Total bully company.12 hour days treat u like a dog.think they own you.and u.p.s is your life.you have no family time and the mangers are bullys.you get wrong for reversing to much you have security follow you to check u vans are locked or windows shut..if not its disaplinary.if you put the wrong thing in your diad machine its disaplinary.total joke..u need to b clean shaving or u will get wrong.they watch u all day on the computer to check u working.you could give your life to this company and they treat u like dirt.
bad,You should not make the person come for the 2nd time if you are not even going to hire that person. I was expecting it since the HR really liked me. You just wasted my time UPS!  Never again!
bad,"-False promises at interview"
bad,You get paid for fewer hours than you actually work. They expect you to control everything and make faulty processes work. Everyone there is fed up with management.
bad,"Interesting crew, all very nice. I didn't learn a whole lot about managing or safety during my time there. Most often I would be running back and fourth sorting out small issues that would occur during our operation."
bad,"There's better jobs out there! The management is horrible. Ups cares more about production and money than their employees. It's also modern day slavery, constant physical work for long hours with little breaks. Very high injury risk job."
bad,It is a horrible work place the upper management is inept and they're completely ineffectual in terms of making the job easy. There out for themselves and care for no one.
bad,It was ok...But I was seasonal so I wasn't able to receive the benefits nor knowledge that comes with the company.The pay was o.k. at the time and the environment was cool.
bad,The literally give the management job to anybody. Especially when the person clearly cant handle it. And then there's being a boss and being an awful human being. Some of these people don't take their job seriously. It's literally like going back to high school
bad,"You cant move up in the job cause people dont wanna retire"
bad,"Very physically hard work. Management will berate you, curse at you, and threaten your job on a regular bases. Advancement is a popularity contest. Don't recommend."
bad,"Only work here if you have felonies and a drug habit"
bad,"UPS stores are extremely unorganized. There are so many loop wholes, it is easy to put associates and customers at risk. I do not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I really didn't have too much of a good experience at UPS. I liked my coworkers, we all had good work chemistry. They pay was to low for that type of work, too exteme."
bad,The overall working environment is extremely stressful and Supervisors and Managers are micromanaged to the hilt.  Lack of support due to the lack of wages that the company is offering now.
bad,"I was hired on as a loader, became a part-time supervisor about 8 months later. Being a loader isn't that bad, except during Peak Season. That's when everything hits the fan. As a sup, I managed anywhere between 1-10 employees. The working conditions suck. When its 80+ degrees outside, the inside of trucks will be at least 10 degrees hotter, more if they just sit under the sun for hours. It also works the other way, but not as extreme, if its 30 degrees outside, the trucks feel like 20-25 degrees. They do offer water fountains, but they had problems with them being broken multiple times, at least in my area. Without stating stuff that would get me in trouble, probably, there were some things they made us do that was highly questionable, like saying we got 2 breaks and lunches if we worked 8 hours. Once I pulled a 13 hour shift, as a part-time supervisor did union work for about 7-8 hours of that, only got one 10 minute break the entire day, still had to say I got my 2 breaks and my unpaid lunch. That is another problem I had with the company, the amount of union work we did as non-union supervisors was ridiculous."
bad,prepare airway bills with manifest and invoices book flights with airlines coordinate with shipping all out bound freight inspect all Sony incoming and separate by destination and purchase orders
bad,"job was beyond dangerous, managers were horrible and expected the impossible even if it meant damaged freight, unhappy costumers, or danger to employees"
bad,"Very fast paced, very stressful, very labor intensive. Very unhealthy environment. Very poor supervision overall. Very non-caring attitude as to safety concerns from employees."
bad,"I wouldn't let my worst enemy work here. Management treats their employees like garbage, packages get thrown, no hope for advancement you will start as part time and stay that way for the next 15 years or longer no matter what some one tells you!"
bad,"As a driver, you are treated as a piece of property. Management shows you no respect. There is no work life balance. If you like working 14 hour days and never seeing your family because you get home at 10 pm every night, then this is the place for you."
bad,Don't hire people if your not going to work them!! From November to January I worked a grand total of maybe 16 hours. I also didn't understand why I had to call in every morning to let them know I was available to work... If I applied for the job apparently I'm available everyday!
bad,Be truthful to people in HR when Employees are laidoff because saying they quit isn't fair the person was following instructions that was told to them
bad,"Extremely stressfull and negative environment. I have never worked for a company that wants to fire its employees so much.  It doesnt matter how great of an employee you are, you are 100% expendable."
bad,"Great health insurance but thats it. Its dirty, loud, they expect incredibly high production. Management is mean and they will not pay you correctly. Not worth it"
bad,"I truly enjoyed the Job portion of UPS. very fast paced, your normally on your own, and it keeps you fit and you get to meat great people along the routes. "
bad,I would never work here again. This job is truly designed for men. The environment is very uncomfortable because all the men in there acted like they never seen a women before and i was harassed nearly everyday.
bad,"i couldn't believe what i was in for upper managers let me fail at my job,i had no power to discipline for their work performance. those maintenance guys are some of the highest paid and the most lazy people i could have every supervised."
bad,I did not like how management worked together with workers. hours were horrible. unprofessional environment and mangers. i do not recommend it at all.
bad,"UPS seems to be agood place to work but the work conditions are not good if you are not part of the Union."
bad,Ups was overall a workout but I feel as though they can raise the pay especially because they don't give breaks and you also Have to keep up with a paste loading heavy boxes in trucks
bad,"Too many negative things to list, the entire company needs better management and then things may be better for all. The environment is horrible and the management needs training."
bad,"Ups management in HR, only promotes friends and families. Not a place for hard working individuals. A good stepping stone to get your college paid for and experience."
bad,"Lack of training, unorganized, integrity issues, poor management. All of this ties in with a typical day. Nothing can be planned anymore and as issues arises, we are told to deal with it."
bad,unreliable hours and if you dont find a driver that you work with daily its hard to get work. and if you miss a call even for 10 mins they find someone else so fast that you miss your chance
bad,The pay was good. The work environment and daily expectation were ridiculous. Extremely physically demanding and management always critiquing what you do.
bad,Top management had one thing in mind... how many and when can you fire Union employees.  The work environment is established using engineering techniques to dis-allow regular good employees to exist.
bad,"poor company; poor treatment of employees. Awful"
bad,Absolutely no work life balance.   UPS does not care about your personal life or obligations outside of work.  Unrealistic demands and goals are set with very few resources given.  I have been working for UPS for 17 years and have been promoted four times but with each promotion it seemed as if I had to sign more of my life away.  I would not recommend UPS to anyone.
bad,Management in this company makes their own rules despite the rules defined in the Union contract and the law. I had to fight with management for over two months to get them to finally recognize my seniority and I had a target on my back from that point forward until I was fired. They even got away with illegally taking my benefits for the last two months I worked there.
bad,Management plays to many games.  They never give credit they always are there to tell you what you're doing wrong.  I don't have anything else to say.
bad,"you will walk 8/12mls a day loaded with parcels,if customs not in you carry parcels full streets,you will delivery your quota 40 ish a day,then the drivers will give you their machines so it clocks up that they did all the work,when in reality you have delivered another 30 or so parcels,do this job if your a mug,"
bad,"Lol this place is a joke "
bad,"They treat you like animals and the pay is horrible unless you work there long enough to become a driver, and that's about a 10 year wait, and I don't even know how long it takes to go full time."
bad,"This company can be summed up in one word, EVIL.   Your job depends on you popularity and looks, so if you are not a part of the ""in click crowd"" you probably wont last long there.  The teamsters union is also in bed with UPS, do not expect fair representation through the teamsters local 41, they are the stereotypical ""mafia thug"" racketeering organization.  If you are accepted by your fellow employees in the ""click""  it would be a great job. Good luck."
bad,"Do not work here, if you are not unionized they will over work you to death and it's not worth the stress, hard work that pays off to not even 200 dollars a week, you get 17 hours a week, they basically have you do so much work in such a little amount of time, its a joke and it's all lies."
bad,"My experience was that they only hire amongst there own culture and what I mean by this is African American. Well atleast the one on foster ave in Brooklyn ny. The supervisors clearly don't care about anyone but them selfs and they are incompetent... they will try to fire you before you make book and put you on a black list so you can never return even if you do no wrong, and then on top of it not give you a reason why."
bad,"I had high hopes when I started working for this company. Although it was only part-time I hoped to stay long enough for the benefits to start. Unfortunately, you have to work a year before you are eligible for benefits and I only averaged 10 hours a week. I realize its only a part time job but 10 hours a week wasn't worth my drive to work when only being paid $10 an hour."
bad,If you have no family or intent to do anything after work then this is the job for you. Bad mgmt followed that constantly has undoabke expectations.  Just bad company to work for.
bad,Job is easy but the hours is not their to accommodate the work. There's no communication between management and employees. They don't appreciate they're employees.
bad,"Don't expect to support yourself working only here. Everyone else is making $16+ doing the exact same thing that you will be doing but you will be making 12, and because of the new contract you will be stuck there for the first three years."
bad,if you can be a driver than fine. but putting box after box in trucks from 1 am to six am every day with only a ten min break and no ac or heat...yeah it sucks.
bad,I would not recommend UPS. There is no room for advancement. Promotions are not given based on job performance. The available jobs are never posted. Management team is not fair.
bad,"The only good thing about the job is pay. Work conditions are terrible, management is sub par as well. Good holiday pay with overtime hours avaliable during holiday season."
bad,"Unorganized. The pay is not good at all. No rewards for being an excellent employee.  Everyone is treated the same. New employees get more money the long term ""valued employees""."
bad,"I worked as a team for the ups organization through man power. It was an informing experience , I got to learn the job real good , because everything was hands on"
bad,The company is not the best to work for.  If you are a female and are have problems with harassment do not expect it to be handled correctly.  You will be viewed as a problem employee if you speak up about an issue going on.
bad,"the work is hard physical labor, underpaided, part-time with very small chance of getting full-time in building without being there for at least 10 years, great benefits though"
bad,"I would not say this is a very friendly area of work. each store is owned individually by someone else so if you have a problem with an employee, you can't really go to corporate and ask for support. "
bad,"Hardly any room to advance within company unless you take management position, which you don't want to do. Everything based on seniority so unless you plan to break your back part-time for small pay for 10 years until you achieve a full-time position, I would suggest working elsewhere. No room to grow in this company unless you sit & wait your turn. The union protects people that don't deserve a job, while money is taken out of your check weekly to pay the union to do so. My experience at UPS along with everyone around me has been awful. Lexington, KY hub"
bad,it took me 2 weeks to be trained the workers made the work environment extremely dangerous and it seemed like there was  very little order in the work area
bad,"The work itself was very easy, and the hours were fine, even though you would have to work 7 days a week the store hours still allowed you to have a life.  The management lacked a sense of urgency and respect for its employees. Might have been better to work for a corporate location instead of a franchise."
bad,"Should definitely have a better system established. Employee moral is low because most are overworked as if the job was full time. The company only cares about their numbers in productivity and cram at least 6 hours worth of work in 3 (if you're lucky to work 3 hours a night). If it weren't for the benefits more employees would leave. "
bad,This is a good part-time job.  The benefits are excellent.  Most individuals cannot make a career of this job.  The opportunities are minimal for advancement within the company.
bad,"Compensation does not match workload, workers get little to no respect and advancement does not go to the deserving.  available hours have become unpredictable and so it is time to move on."
bad,The supervisors dont do their jobs.  They dont train their employees and they treat their employees poorly.  Since I started here 15 people have quit.
bad,"Stay away from this awful place. They claim to be people orientated, but they could care less about their people. Trust and partnership does not exist in this company...beware!"
bad,"Set up to fail on a daily basis"
bad,"Just an awful company with poor internal management and advancement opportunities. The management does not care about employees whatsoever, they focus solely on their own agenda to promote their own desired success."
bad,They overhired too many people so there were groups of us that didn't get any hours other then what we got in orientation. I've learned more about driving and packaging safety.
bad,"n/a.  I rather not comment; considering litigation for harassment, threats, intimidation, etc. I can go on and all, all day long, about what I thought it would be like versus what occurred while working there.  I'll say this much though:  its a lecherous culture:  the underachievers feed off of the hard workers."
bad,"Had fun with my team, but the rest of the experience was horrible. Majority of management only cared about the boxes and their job. Employees were treated as slaves; unappreciated, over worked, their opinions don't matter. Management/supervisors are always right no matter what they do. Human resources is being influenced and partial in their judgment. Zero opportunities for self improvement and advancement."
bad,"Toxic, backbreaking job. Poor environment. Bitter workers. Bad Management. Would never work here ever again. Quite a bit of vulgar, racist, misogynist outbursts from other employees."
bad,"This company will ask the world of you and then when you give it to them ,they will stab you in the back. The work is rediculous.  Carrying heavy boxes long distance, getting bit by dogs, slipping in the snow . You're expected to be at work even in conditions the authorities tell you to stay inside. I worked here as a driver for 22 years.  You can not have a life outside of UPS. It consumes your life. Makes you miserable and stressed out all the time."
bad,The management team is poor and doesnt care for employee health... The place is a constant heater that is full of dry dusty air and they have very short breaks
bad,"Here's the real truth. As a seasonal feeder driver, you are the bottom of the barrel. You get the worst and oldest trucks in the fleet to drive, Your start time will be between 6pm-12am if you're lucky to get a route for the week, if not you are on the extra board and give you the junk that's left over. Management treats you bad and if they don't like you, they would send you home after 4 or 5 hrs for the day or tell you not to come in when they are slow. I came back for my 2nd time and quit after a few weeks. the worst mistake I've ever made going back.............. Plus no holiday pay and no benefits."
bad,"If you are up to calling a company your family this is the place for you! If you want a life and respect look elsewhere."
bad,"Great company if you need tuition assistance.  The culture is not very friendly as a matter of fact in order to move up to a ""Full-Time"" position you must bleed ""Brown"".  Meaning you must eat, sleep, and commit your life to the company while dogging out the workers for at least five years.  Maybe then you are considered for a full 40 hours a week, and that's just for the supervisors."
bad,"its real good experience if your in high school "
bad,UPS freight has seem to lost track on what a LTL trucking company is. It is very sad as a lot of great people in the transportation business have left to find an LTL company that is on track.
bad,"Went to ellenwood, ga terminal for road test which took three hours total only to be told we can't hire you because we can't wait one day for you get your picture taken on license to show hazmat endorsement, since I had completed the process already and was sent a clearance letter. I wonder why they would waste my time like that. Only one day,  I explained to her. I would never recommend applying to ups because in the hiring process,  you are just one in a giant stack of applications they always have. They always turn over new hires because they call you full time but because you are on the bottom you work when ever or where ever. If you have a family to support,  stay away. If you live at home with mom and dad,  then maybe you can afford to be jerked around for a few years."
bad,"The hardest part about working in this environment it was hard to get promoted with out doing thing that was unethical, constant bullying if you were consider an over achiever. Everyone was out for self, the work environment is very hazardous forcing employees to work in environment that was consider highly unsafe. If you refuse they'll build a false paper trail cut your hour and bully you until you quit and or do things their way."
bad,"Money is great but if you can't spend it with the people you love then it's worthless."
bad,"Worked as a helper and delivered in a mall. Was hired on the basis that I would be working 5 days a week and working minimum 4 hours. Was told I could leave after 4 hours. This was a lie. I would have to call in daily and maybe work and maybe not. In non christmas season I would work 2-3 days in 6 weeks on average. Still had to pay full union dues whether I worked or not. "
bad,"Not a typical job, work life consists of 50 hours per week minimum. Multiple job roles and responsibilities. Extremely stressful, not for the faint of heart. Will test your patience level and multi-tasking abilities."
bad,"If you are a union employee its not bad, but management is horrible. Management is on salary but they work you 10 to 12 hours a day and they don't want you to take a day off."
bad,will change who you are and nit for the better makes yu look at everyone like a criminal although I had fun doing my job wouldn't do it again
bad,Non graduate superintendents bossing you around like they own the place.  Cause they making salary. And for a student going to school working long nights at the warehouse get really irritating with them yelling and rushing you. then they all team up to not promote you! I hated it!
bad,I would never recommend UPS Supply Chain Solutions as a good place to work. I have never worked for a company with such a culture. The pay is very low and work load unbelievably high. The lack of communication is a major problem and honestly I do not know how this company remains in business
bad,"I started working here fresh out of high school and needed anything. They only offer 3 hours of work a day. Hot, sweaty, dangerous atmosphere."
bad,it was the worst employment opportunity i've ever had. the pay system was obsolete and the restrooms reek of urine and kind of smelled like a downtown subway entrence
bad,"Don't get injured and don't talk back to supervisors...This is a sure fire way to get ""discharged"".  Also don't rely on the union for any sort of assistance. Union wants you to do grievances but then that paints targets on your back and they can't protect you."
bad,"UPS is one of the last American business icons.  With over 100 years of existence, it stands as a consistent presence in logistics.  That being said, it is not a good place to work anymore.  "
bad,"Most of the time it was boring. My driver and i used to finish the work pretty fast but some nights were cold and dark. The management wasn't good at all , atleast to me. My driver was cool.The hardest part was looking for addresses through a Trailer park at night. I enjoyed payday."
bad,"A typical work day can be 10-14 hours, six day a week. Learned a lot from a management prospective. Lacks the ability to schedule, great people and very challenging workplace. No day is ever the same."
bad,"Couldve done better with hiring people. They didnt even call me in for  work, and give me the hours they promised"
bad,Very antisocial and hostile environment to work in. Hours could be minimal at 17.5 hours guaranteed for part time to 40-60 hours full time.  Paid time and a half after 8 hours in a day but not if split job descriptions.  No loyalty between coworkers. The Teamster union is not very supportive once you start to promote union issues.
bad,"2008, 2009, 2010, and 2013 peaks under my belt (somehow got lost in the shuffle for 2011 and 2012)."
bad,The hardest part of the job is knowing or doing more than the people at the next levels so that the sort could function but them being slow to catch up.
bad,Your replaceable enough said. As a driver your nothing but a piece of meat. They will work you and work you. No work life balance. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I clock out and go home.
bad,words cant describe the dirty conditions you are subjected to
bad,"Life balance? Nope. Mandatory 30 sales calls a week. 4 day week because of a holiday, day off, inclement weather, company meeting? Tough. No excuses. 30 sales calls a week or write an email to your manager why. Mandatory weekly sales successes/ closes. Didn't make it? Tough. No excuses. Write an email telling your manager why. Many time I'd be doing reports or needed paperwork many hours after I got home. "
bad,"A typical day at work consist of 4 hours of hard work.  If you are not prepared to do heavy fast lifting this job may not be for you.  This job taught me what I was made of after lasting a year, which is the minimum requirement of work in order to be re-hired.  My co-workers hard workers who prided themselves on their work ethic, I enjoyed meeting different people from all kinds of enviroments. The Management team is pace driven and semi-supportive of the staff.  The hardest part of the job is the job itself.  Mentally preparing to put yourself through that job on a daily basis regardless of weather conditions is very rigorous.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people who are going through the same thing as you."
bad,The work in the IT group is very stressful and the management team lacks direction.
bad,"Any day at UPS would've been okay if it hadn't been for the sudden change of schedule. At first I was helping out a couple employees with stocking a nearby shopping mall. Then out of nowhere, management decided to hook me up with a driver who kept busting my chops up to the point where he kicked me off his truck. When I tried to explain to management I was better doing work in the mall, they didn't listen or care and ended up laying me off without making a real decision of how to work things out with me. They didn't even think about how I wasn't exactly ready to be helping out someone during driving deliveries. It would've been better if they just understood my explanation."
bad,By far the worst job environment. Needs a lot of upper managemt involvement
bad,"It was seasonal job but I couldn't get a break to eat or use bathroom and they still didn't pay me for my break. Many drivers are lazy and makes the driver's helper do most of the worker. Drivers throw packages, step on packages. I had to driver to the driver and leave my car alone wherever the driver was headed to."
bad,"Come inside and start unloading/loading freights truck two sometime one man teams. I learned haste make watse form the managers pushing their employees to load/unload faster with the result not pleasant. Co-workers all have each other back though. and the hardest parts would a all irreg trailer(packages weight over 70lbs) by yourself. I did enjoy those breakfast barritos,"
bad,"You will learn to rely on fellow part-time supervisors for your growth and development. Your employees will keep you around, and make your job enjoyable. Your superiors will not. They believe that UPS is and should be your life, and do nothing to support upward advancement- in the company or otherwise."
bad,I've never been treated as poorly at a job before in my life. Management was disrespectful and unprofessional.
bad,"typical day of work includes load and unloading boxes to go onto UPS trucks. It a very bad work enviroment and the company does not care about its employess, just protecting thier bottom line"
bad,"Dangerous job, hard, safety is poor, and management is over-worked."
bad,"I worked UPS Supply Chain/ Global Freight Forwarding. There were 3 managers in that facility and they all disliked each other. Inner quarrels and petty issues. The most disfunctional company I have ever worked for. The economy sucks, and they know it. In turn the demands are beyonds belief. Make 30 sales calls a week. No excuses. Day off, sick, holiday? Still need to do 30 sales calls. If not , like a 3rd grader you have to write a letter stating why you failed to meet the 30 calls."
bad,I am sorry UPS was very hard for a Woman. All i can say if the dont like you they will find a way to get rid of you. There managment sucked they didnt care about people. they just wanted the job done. I was there for 7 years and was told i would never become a driver there. And i didnt so i quite and went to there competitore and was hired as a driver.
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone. It is all about numbers and they could care less about their employees.
bad,been there 11 years as a part timer only stay because of the countless glimmer of hope i get every year that a full time position will soon be available
bad,"Ship, manifest, and package UPS and USPS packages for customers. Assist customers as needed with copy jobs, faxing, color copies, laminating. We also offer mailbox services, that we process for customers. We do document services and many speciality jobs."
bad,Long hours and Heavy lifting. Unorganized management. low pay.
bad,Low based pay company but the work is extremely hard and management stay riding employees backs
bad,the one thing that UPS has going for them is the job security. Even that is in question right now. The corporation leans everything on its full time supervision crew and pays them for almost nothing.
bad,No time for proper lunch.
bad,Poor pay and forced union for the demanding physical job that it is.
bad,"As great of a company this may sound like to many, I have worked there during peak season for 6 days straight Monday thru Saturday from 8:30am- sometimes 10:30pm. The management and supervisors suck and are horrible. They treat you very wrong and unprofessional and use and abuse you, your body, your time, and your overall ability for the performance of the job. They do not care to help you or support you in anyway. It’s more like they give you the keys to that big brown truck and send you on your way with the truck loaded of over 200+ boxes and expect you to know what to do and where to go. They will tell you whatever it is that they must to convince you they care for you and appreciate all your hard work. But in reality they don’t. Worst company ever to work for. The only thing good about this job is the benefits and that’s only if they decide to hire you."
bad,"Don't join management bc the second you do you won't be union. And inside the company you are constantly jumping through union redtape."
bad,"Man muss nein sagen können ansonsten Streß pur, unbedingt Pausen einhalten"
bad,Worked in many different areas for over two years..have been bullied by my supervisor for leaving to go drive for the season..came back to no hours on her schedule as a punishment.have seen workers who do everything but work get promoted..have watched the union do absolutely nothing ...
bad,You are always at your wits end. No direction no guidance from upper management. Always looking for ways to blame you for something. Nothings ever good enough.
bad,"The pay and the benefits are great, but the work environment, employee/management relations and  morale is all the worst I’ve seen anywhere..........."
bad,"when i first started i was assigned to scan each package and load it in my 3 to 4 trucks. since i was working hard and fast they started to give me a lot more work, more then anyone else and give different tasks that are not even in my job title. now i know why people there look like zombies, most of them looks sad, depressed and unhappy. if your a good worker they will drain you out and break you until you give up or join the zombie team lol. the pay is garbage, but they trick you into their great benefits. they will break your back and then pay to patch you up, wow. you can't be a good worker there, just work on your own base, cause if you work hard or fast they will expect that from you all day everyday."
bad,"It is not worth the headache at all. If you think your coming to a place of business then you are by far mistaken. The management here are some of the most immature and annoying people, not all but most are."
bad,"Management is near non-existent. Those that call themselves Supervisors seem to all be under the age of 25, reckless, mislead, immature and played favoritism among workers. Most of these ""Supervisors"" are currently in there from the Allentown hub but are worthless to say the least.  "
bad,"Journée de travail surchargée et overtime obligatoire."
bad,"I was rushed through a safety check sheet and was supposed to fill it out after 5 hours of working by myself. Didn't even go through it with me My supervisor was busy the whole time. I was expected to fill this out without being thoroughly reviewed, so I wasn't going to sign until I was actually taught everything they expected me to check off. After my first day, they brought me into the office and fired me. I've worked as a driver helper for the last three years. Super unhappy with how that went down."
bad,Not the best place to work management is no good they have no respect for the workers it's the most stressful place i ever worked people quit very often to the point where they're giving retention bonus
bad,It was a good time while it lasted the only thing I  didn’t like how we had to be out side in the cold weather to unload the trailers and bring the boxes inside
bad,They want you to move at a very fast pace non stop for 5 hours straight and have everything organized while you move in that fast pace wouldn’t recommend it unless your name is flash.
bad,"I worked at UPS so my college would be paid for, one of the best things about UPS is they pay for your college...some or most. The shoe policy is kinda ridiculous. You are required to lift HEAVY boxes... some time the boxes go by fast and it’s hard to catch more than one at a time. Never know what to wear!! The buses are crowded, and you are required to wait for a bus to get to your station."
bad,"This job is a freak show. It’s literally everyone in everyone’s drama. Everyone knows everyone’s business. Including the management. Most of the people who work here is sleeping with someone from the work place. The advancement in this company it’s bull. The only way to advance, is being being friends with the management or sleeping with people at the work place. They do not go after the people who not doing they job right. Really bunch of bullies here. It’s like a freaking high school here. Can’t focus on your work. If you not cool with the important people than at least keep your head down and stay quite. Stay away from all the drama possible."
bad,Poor management and favoritism for advancement opportunities at the Baton Rouge and for sure at the port allen location. If you file a grievance against them they make u work harder. They strive on ethics honesty and safety unless they need something done to cover management mistakes!!!!!
bad,I am owed around 600 and I was caught talking to a union member (new employee at the time) and was fired the same night and I was in the middle of getting my pay fixed. They also classified me as a non re-hire
bad,I was let go because my Dad died and I called in hours before my shift and they allowed me to come in all that morning to work. As soon as my shift was over they let me go after I was told when we bring you back we would assist with counseling if needed from the big boss. There is discrimination there toward b
bad,Fast pass and very busy there was always something to do which made the shift go by fast. Enjoyed it but my position was only seasonal and needed more hours
bad,"Extremely unprofessional. I got screamed at on a daily basis by upper management and employees. Its definitely not worth the pay. "
bad,"UPS was, without a doubt, the single worst employer I have ever worked for. The compensation and benefits were very good but that's the limit of my positive feedback for this company. Management embrace a culture of harassment and intimidation as a method of motivating the staff; They claim to be a safety conscious employer but vehicle maintenance is often overlooked for budgetary reasons and facility safety is oftentimes not maintained; I would hear frequently from coworkers of inaccurate pay due to management altering work hours, requiring union intervention; management oftentimes pressure staff to ignore designated break times to reach unreasonable productivity goals... I could go on but I feel this already paints a pretty clear picture. The decision is yours to make but I definitely would not recommend this employer under any circumstances"
bad,"They pay terribly even though they make billions. The management has zero communication skills. You work in the freezing cold and extremely hot with maybe a fan. When I come home every day and blow my nose, it's all black. Nobody actually wants to be there. Nobody puts effort into their job. They will take advantage of hard working people!"
bad,I Literally broke my back at this company and they blamed me and treated me like I was wasting their time working there. they yell at you for stupid reasons they micro manage thing that should not have to be
bad,"Great for younger people, part time work and students."
bad,"I worked for UPS for about a week and than I realized that it wasn't worth it at all. The job is super fast, minimum wage, the belt and the convoy is very old  and outdated the stuffs get jammed all the time. During winter its too cold I mean colder than outside."
bad,"I was told before I was hired here that I would be working 5 hours a night and that the most work I would get is 4 trucks to unload and each truck is 500 boxes, but every thing I was told was a lie. If your part time you will be treated like a slave, they will have you clock in and out as soon as possible, they tell you you get 3.5 hours, not 5 like original stated, a night but really you will be working 1.30 hours a night. Also they wont train you, they will have you wondering what your suppose to be doing then yell at you for not doing it. Management sits in a room with A.C all day and wont help the new hires and then every so often come out to tell you you need to work harder. I was ""let go"" on my 4th day because I did 3 trucks in 30 min and was told I am to slow. Oh ya, and on top of the 1.5 hours a day your paychecks have a $40 union dues due per week. So if you do the math 1.5 hours a night 5 nights a week at $13 an hour is a $97 pay check before tax and before the 40 union dues. less .70 x 97= 68- 40 = $28 a week. $28.00 a week pay check to be lied to, mistreated, untrained, then fired. I thought UPS was a reputable company. I was so wrong. I am willing to bet that upper management does not know how there part time employee's are being treated. I am willing to bet that human resources, and or the department that hired me, or even the union it self does not know that they sent me into an very unhealthy environment. I am willing to bet that they don't know that they are not training there new hires, not providing the hours or the schedule that was promised at time of hire."
bad,On my 4th day I got so overwhelmed by loading close to 300 packages in the trucks. Had me loading 3 trucks...very fast paced environment...not worth the pay though...I currently work here and hopefully I move up soon after probation period or I’m going to look for another job...it took forever just to get put in the system and my check didn’t come on time. So my bills were late...Seems like the managers only care about the trucks and not employees
bad,The amount of work you have to do for little pay is ridiculous! You’ll be aching and paining and bruised! Not worth the back pain! Very hard work!!!! Heavy lifting! Fast paced
bad,horrible place to work.Very stressful and fast paced and lots of heavy lifting.Co workers are disgruntled and worry bout themselves and don't help out.no communication and and new managers and supervisors constantly come in and don't communicate.Very hard working job for very lil pay.No room for advancement unless you want to wait 10years to be a driver and be put on a waiting list.
bad,"I worked with this company for 6.5 years and in the last 2 years it has been the absolute worst. There's no professionalism what so ever when it comes to the management team.  They talk to their employees like animals and want them to work like machines. The pay is very low! Nothing one can possibly live off of in California especially. They never offer area supervisors any over time, they will make supervisors do labor work and then they will be grieved by the labor workers. Its just horrible over all. It feels like walking in jail and being in jail once inside. And the work is absolutely brainless, but yet they act as though its rocket science."
bad,"This is a company where working hard will not get you anywhere but Iregs; all day, every day.  If you like doing the crappiest job in the warehouse with intermissions of filling in for others so they can have a smoke break, then you are the horse from animal farm and this job is for you!"
bad,"This review is not biased in any form."
bad,"I would not recommend UPS to anyone who is looking for a career move. You start at the bottom, and they will wring you out for all you're worth. They dangle the carrot of being a driver in front of you, but I've not met a driver who is happy with their job. I'm going back to school so that I can make less money than a UPS driver, but I'll have more time with my family. No regrets."
bad,This job was like a paid work out you would start sweating the moment you got there. The manager was very great at motivating the workers to keep going but unfortunately for me to much use of my hand caused damage to them and if I would have continued I would have needed surgery preformed on my hands.
bad,Everyone is mad and yelling at each other. No respect is given but its demand of you. The equipment is out data and need to be replace. The metal slides and fall apart. Stairs have no grip.
bad,UPS is an extremely poorly ran company that underpays all of its employees. employees are treated more like animals than human beings. Production numbers are raised beyond possibilities to keep employees fro  reaching them
bad,"At ups I’ve learned to communicate with co worker better than ever. "
bad,"Choose location wisely, please read reviews! Some locations are great, my location was poorly managed and unprofessional! Job is not hard but training is important and was not given, I was left to the online training with no actual in person learning. There are a lot of situations the online source never covers. I was left to my own devices right out the gate. Cleaning was part of my shift, but not cleaning up after fellow employees and their kids. I was let go by voicemail because they felt I ""just wasn't fitting in"" after 3 weeks. BEWARE."
bad,Benefits are great but pay is minimum I have received a raise in 2 years. They give a break when it's beneficial to them.hrs per week your lucky to get 20
bad,"Using a pre-emptive strike to freeze out the workers. Took advantage of everyone and are forcing the drivers to work extra to cover the hours they shed by casting of 20-30 year vets and people they'd worked to the bone. Took advantage of the hard workers, rode you into the dirt. Good people. Bad management. Bad bad management."
bad,ups was a very easy job all the items were light and it wasn't back breaking I just left because the pay wasn't enough for my commute and to provide a good life for me and my family
bad,Most all the entry level positions at ups are terrible and you will get underpaid if you don’t keep up with your money. Short charging people is something do a lot there. The management team only seems to care about there bonus checks at the end of the month.theres no real chance for career advancement unless your 21.
bad,"UPS is a hateful place leadership only cares about themselves and the company don't even care if you get killed on the job"
bad,This the worst seasonal job I ever had I will never tell no one to come here and work they are so unprofessional its a shame lost my checks and I went homeless because of them not paying me on time
bad,This was not a great experience like everyone says. Working there is like a typical warehouse experience. Cold in the winter.Warm on the warmer days. But the physical stress was not worth the amount of money you make.
bad,"The corporate culture at UPS is great, however, each workplace is treated like it's own company.  Management and work environment from one place to another can be extremely different.  Do your homework on the office that you work for."
bad,"The hours were trash. I was told I would get more hours. I worked from 10:00 PM to sometimes 2-3:00 AM. On average I had only 18 hrs a week bringing home less than $150 a week which is nothing. The labor is super hard and they usually expect you to lift packages that are 65 lbs or more on your own. The work is really ""until"" and they don't provide you anything except a water bottle and a ""good job"" for all of your hard work and the work is CONSTANT. This job is not what you think. It's not a walk in the park. The job description doesn't do you any justice. Also, before orientation started a male was picked over a female just because of her size. The HR woman says ""this job isn't for the faint"". Good luck with your choice."
bad,The warehouse never left us have a break and i was moving 1250 pounds an hour when i first started and than i was moving like 1350 pounds an hour after a week of working there and the bosses where rude and claimed i didn't move enough when the boss said during training that he only wanted to see 1200 or 1300 an hour moved. i was above that when her got on my case and lue (the second boss i guess) always sent me home early for no reason. and the warehouse itself was like 100+ degrees. and the trailers were like 150 degrees
bad,It's a good place to work if you are a driver and not actually working in the warehouse. Most the time they didn't have anything to hydrate you so you want to puke as I did once. Sometimes you get sent home early but rarely do they pick you.
bad,"Before I begin, I must preface with the working conditions. I was working in a sheet metal, temporary building with no air conditioning or indoor plumbing. They had 3 port-a-potties for over 40 workers. They provided water but it would usually not last half of a shift since it was during the summer. The building did not have fans until after I had put in my two weeks notice. The day started at 3pm and was supposed to end at 8pm, per the application, but we would be lucky to leave before 11pm. A typical work day would be everyone huddles at the entrance to do stretches for about 5 to 10 mins then we would be sent to our designated trailers. I was one of the few people who worked as a loader and unloader so we shall start with unloading. An unloader would go into a trailer with another worker and would set up a conveyor belt that we would then place boxes, weighing between 75 to 200lbs, onto and push down to the person who then scans the box and places it on the main belt that leads to the loading area. Unloading was the harder of the two and every single unloader would leave at the end of the day drenched in sweat to the point where they looked like they had just left a pool. We would get maybe two breaks in a shift but they would not last longer than 5 to 10 mins each. We were allowed a couple of minutes for water breaks but if they saw us doing anything outside of drinking, like sitting, we would be issued a verbal warning. Moving on to loading, it was a lot more lenient. There was only one person to a trailer and that person had to get boxes off the side belt and stack them"
bad,"it's a cutthroat atmosphere...especially with management..they are mean to their employees..bullys is a better word..I felt like I was working at a sweat shop, definitely not an equal opportunity company...they suck!!!"
bad,"It is a terrible place. It is a really terrible place. I really can't stress that enough. If they ask you to go supervisor, it is because you are new and don't know any better. Don't do it."
bad,hours were bad if you have a family you wont see your kids very much. you work from 830 and can finish your route then will have to go help someone else to finish your day
bad,Didn't like the lack of team work wasn't properly train was blind to the correct protocol was sent home 3 out of 5 work days too far to be driving to be sent home
bad,"The work isn't difficult at all but management makes everything so complicated that it is nearly unbearable. The part-time manager that runs the sort doesn't know how to play to team members strengths and stresses out very easily to the point of frantically yelling and moving people around to different stations in a way that makes operations increasingly more difficult, slow, and stressful."
bad,The supervisor did not want us to even talk to anybody on shift even if they were put into a truck with us. I would get treated differently because I would talk and work at the same time and the supervisor would target me for that.
bad,"Management is poor, all they care about is getting the most packages done in the shortest time. They say they care about the employee, they don't. They say you're the most important thing, you're not. If it wasn't for the awesome benefits I would not still be there. Friends don't let friends work at UPS."
bad,"Unless you know somebody, you won’t get anywhere quick, u got to put in years of work to get real Benifits and promotions. They promote unqualified people that way."
bad,Nothing to report but the franchise owner was treating me then satisfactory. I was not allowed to work saturdays or friday evenings due to the fact that my parents are jewish. The owner is orthodox jewish so in his religion no jewish person is supposed to work during the sabbath. I do not find that fair. He also does not provide full time work nor benefits.
bad,Like the people I work with but looking for more hours and more pay. Benefits are amazing for my daughter and myself. I’m looking for something quick paced and hands on.
bad,They don't care about you. You're just another number. There is no advancement. No matter what. I broke records and has zero acknowledgment of my work yet was 1 minute late and reprehended. Literally one minute.
bad,"90 hour workweek with no overtime compensation as you are identifieid as an owner because, if, you meet certain results you are awarded a months pay in stock to be given to you over a 5 year period."
bad,I would not recommend to work for UPS as the management doesn't give s****  and even you do report some problem to supervisors or team leader they don't care because all from local area and they don't give favor to people but they will take care of people who they go out on Saturday night to club.
bad,"I worked on the ramp during winter. My crew was horrible, my supervisor was horrible, and in order to really move up you have to be there for 20 years. Its not a hard job, but its stressful most of the time. I did get to take a lot of naps though."
bad,"UPS has become increasingly hard to work for, unrealistic time allowances and work loads. Partime wages are terrible considering how hard they push the workers."
bad,"I've worked as a Graphic Designer here for about 2 years and it is CONSTANTLY CHANGING and not for the better!"
bad,"A stressful environment with negative messages and culture being pushed by management. Impossible to balance work and home life with unknown hours on a day to day basis. Management was the direct cause of my departure from the company, The environment feels very much as though the management team is out to get you. I would not recommend this company to anyone,"
bad,"I wouldn't suggest you work at ups because of the disorganization in their facilities. Also, they seem to take any circumstance brought up to them personally"
bad,"Have you ever wanted to work for a machine? Something cold, uncaring, and gets the job done? Well, try bureaucracy. At UPS, you don't work for the machine, your just a cog in it. When you get worn down and final break, quit, or other, you're easily replaceable."
bad,I worked with the company for a while. The Hub in particular I worked for was poor in communication. The management lacked communication. Safety is priority but overall  care of well being for employees was lacking. The hardest part of the job was getting the paper done while attempting to complete other various tasks. The best part of the job was working with my team of workers. The management provided me with the most stress. I enjoyed working with the people
bad,"Very poor management, and the culture suffered because of this. Compensation and benefits were above par. Most of the employees were great but management made the position very stressful."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for ups the supervisor was terrible, always joking around and being derogatory and vulgar. Impolite and improper, they was not set out to be the leading role models they should of been. They did not use their job position and powers appropriately."
bad,"Let's get this straight.If you want a great wage and live for work and do not want any other life then Ups is the place to be,fantastic hourly rate and bags of overtime.You will earn 30-35 grand pa.Be warned though you will lose your wife and your family you will go home dejected and down every night be constantly told you are not doing enough even when you start 30 mins before you get payed and work while your on break just to try and get your over despatched drops done,management will send the drivers out on your route while your on holiday who work through their tacho breaks,go down bus lanes,break speed limits(you know who you are) so they can do more drops than you then force you to take more out when you get back and if you don't take you off your run."
bad,Worked here for over 15 years and every year it gets worse. They basically run all the older people out so they can get nothing but young kids to work. This facility has the worst safety record ever. They have even had people get seriously hurt here. There are really no background checks done so the stealing is rampant. Anything that is not nailed down is taken out the door. The supervisors are nothing more than young kids who can barely shave and use toilet paper when they go to the bathroom. Did I mention the place is totally filthy.
bad,"It all starts on the training course in Tamworth.  Ur told if u fail the course ur out of a job after just giving up a full time job. I worked out the Irlam depot , was told at interviews I'd have own run ,van etc I had nothing. I was a spare driver and everyday was put on a different route.  I was just told ur on that van today and would get on back of van faced with 100 drops in an area I'd never worked b4. That happened on a daily basis.  The depot manager should not be a manager, no management skills at all and no support.  The place was a shambles with bully boy tactics if u spoke out. They pay well but ups will become ur life as ul be working 12 hour days with no time for dinner. Don't be lured in by the money and there false promises at interview. If you work for these you will be sorry and you will end up divorced."
bad,a typical day at work consist of me sorting and loading packages at a constant  pace with only a 10 minute break. its very unprofessional and i feel most of the staff don't care about there hourly workers.
bad,"My typical day consisted of being yelled at and cursed out by angry upset customers who are calling in to inquire about their packages.  "
bad,Ups over works their employees. Play favortism and very unorganized! i was terminated because a supervisor didn't like me but they tried to say because i abandoned my job even though i had a legitimate doctors note.
bad,"UPS, while being a multi-billion dollar company, has become such, by stepping on it's part-timers. They promote from the bottom, and they're proud of this-all one has to do is write a paragraph stating they'd be a good manager, and they're promoted. However, that means we get a lot of people who only care about the money and not the job. Miscommunication is key, it seems and the only time one would see the Hub Manager is when he descended from his air conditioned office to scream that you weren't working fast enough, or that you should try working fast without injuring yourself."
bad,"Very hard work and a lot of sweat to get the job done. Management has no people skills, but there are some extremely awesome co-workers and supervisors there."
bad,"UPS is very diverse company."
bad,"o	Supervised several areas of a warehouse for routes to Orlando and Kissimmee."
bad,"Although UPS is a great company with excellent vision from our founder, it has gone a great length to veered away from that. Ever since UPS went public, they have taken a lot away from the management team. One of the vision is to take care of our people and customers first. Now it's more like bottom line and let's take care of our stock holders. Culture is very poor, a lot of politics, favoritism, and horrible work/life balance. Employees are not happy and management gets termination threats everyday. The job is very fast pace and hard at times, but 8 years ago there were many recognition programs and great benefits. in the past 3 years, all that went away and employees who does an exellent job never get rewarded or a thank you, instead, employee will be asked to do more and if they can't in one week, they will be threaten. If you have no degrees, a great drill sargent, and willing to work 14-18 hours a day as a full time management, this is the place for you!"
bad,"As a part-time Supervisor for UPS at the Dallas hub, it is a warehouse environment, meaning there are constant loud noises and banging all day. Because of this, all workers must yell at each other just to simply get there point across. I worked to Pre-load shift, which was from 1:00am-10:00am, and my boss put his personal problems out on the job and threaten to replace me nearly everyday. I worked nine hours, five days a week but only got paid salary at 5.5 hours a shift. There are some advantages as I got a 401k plan and an Earn-to-Learn plan which paid $1,500 for my college. But over all the experience was poor and degrading."
bad,Employees are not happy in all levels of management.  Very negative culture.  Fear based.
bad,"Set me up with a good life and then took it all away. Long hours, heavy workload. Good pay and benefits. Management trying to fire all top pay workers now as job satisfaction declined for all over the last 10 years. Company focus and goals quickly deteriorated job."
bad,"First off they tell you what shift you will work when your hired. Than you never work that shift! You come in early than scheduled and leave way later than scheduled! It says 3-4 hours, yeah right! You most times work 8 or 9 hours and here's the kicker... one 10 minute break! Are you kidding! The people I worked with were cool but management doesn't care."
bad,I had to unload packages onto an belt label faced up in a timing manner. The heavy items i sat to the side and wait for a man's help. that job was dirty as well also very cold. unloading from a truck in the winter was kind out of control. working getting hot and then going right into the cold. I was sick on different occasions
bad,"Management always took sides with their ""favorite"" employees."
bad,"It was hard to go to work ambitiously. Every day 4 hrs of work seemed like a luxury and not something I could count on. Simply put, nothing excited me about work at UPS."
bad,"A typical day at work involved employees working hard in their designated area, everyone exercising teamwork to get the mail to the proper destination, I learned how to work in a fast paced environment, I associated with management everyday to make sure I was always on task and meeting the jobs requirements. My co-workers were helpful individuals who worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was during peak season when there was no guaranteed time to get off work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers."
bad,"•Sort, unload and Organize Packages"
bad,UPS is a major company that does not know how to train there employees. No one will help you learn your job but the minute something goes wrong there is a Elephant from the OMS office that will give you1000lbs of attitude.
bad,I have been there for 7 years and have not been able to move up in the company. I see people who have started there as part time and be unable to proceed full-time until their 13th or 15th year. There benefits are good but you are stranded when it comes to options to move forward.
bad,Too much wasn't enough. if you worked hard they put more work on you.
bad,"UPS wasn't a very good or safe company to work for. I would load one truck after another with boxes, bags, tires, etc. I worked off of rollers that didn't work very well. The items that rolled down the rollers would fall off both sides the whole way to the back of the truck where I started and block me in. I learned the proper ways to load. The management wasn't very caring. My co-workers were very out going and it was a delight working with them. The hardest part of the job was trying to lift items by myself when they were meant for two people to team lift. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying very busy."
bad,"Running all day delivering regardless of weather, super physical."
bad,Terrible outlook as far as advancement
bad,great place to work at if you're just looking for temporary work
bad,"This was a difficult employer to deal with. Constant changes, lack of communication between employee and employer and very little flexibility made it difficult to maintain a healthy working relationship. Constant changes and significant cut in pay, along with cut in security prompted many to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"This place is terribly managed & they do not appreciate you or your work.  They constantly harass you & make you feel like your not doing enough, yell & use poor language in the process.  Not worth it!"
bad,"UPS dont care about their workers"
bad,"I would never work for this company ever again, I worked here my first year of college doing part time night shift for only like 4-5 hours. The work was easy but very laboring. Managers and workers were rude and had attitude problems."
bad,Not a bet nice place to work if the owner was there.  She will not hesitate to embarrass stimulate you in front of customers.  She does my card about nurturing the good employees and wedding out the bad.
bad,Worst job I’ve had managers were unfair work was hard and pay was bad the only good thing was that you get a pay raise each year because your part of the union
bad,"Management really does not care on helping you"
bad,"They'll take you and use you throughout peak then drop you and not give you work after peak, management definitely stinks, mostly the Stoney Creek  center"
bad,They told me I was permanent and when it was the end of the season they said bye thanks for your help and left me no work so you decide to work for them
bad,"Human resources  say anything t ok get in for the seasonal work then barely get hours,don't work most the days, and  and don't stay the whole seasons you are promised work so no I would not advise stopping life to go work for ups ,for couple months and not get the hours promised"
bad,This job would be a great job if the employees were more accepting of diversity. Seems like the permanent employees continue to remind the seasonal workers that we would be leaving soon. The supervisor actually said during a meeting that we were visitors in there home. They make you feel uncomfortable and always make rude comments.  I would still be working there if the supervisor wouldn’t have lied about calling me to return to work on Monday.
bad,"Job had good benefits but it didn't treat its employees fairly especially after crossing over to supervisor from labor worker,  i felt more like a worker then supervisor"
bad,"I've been here for 7 years, praying that the next year will get better. Most people I work with, including management cry themselves to sleep wondering how we ended up here."
bad,My time with UPS was very short. I was a part-time supervisor for one year. With my past training I was placed in operations and training. I helped open the new facility in Arizona and trained over 300 employees. As long as you don't stand up for yourself and work similar to a robot you will be fine. The management team does not want you to talk back or go against the grain. If you get an injury they will do everything they can to stop you from reporting. Overall they do not have your best interest in mind.
bad,"At the United Parcel Service, the se xual harassment policy allows anyone to harass whoever they want, as long as they only do it once."
bad,The job itself isn't bad but i never got ANY hours. U wake up at 6am call them n sit n rot for hours waiting for a call back to c if ur gonna work that day. Don't do seasonal ESPECIALLY if ur a female. They just stopped giving me any hours after waiting 4 weeks 2 b hired. mmm..mmm..mmm.
bad,"I used to love working here, its hard work but its rewarding. The management culture is so toxic here its absurd. Never trust a thing your managers tell you. They lie directly to your face. I ultimately left through what i thought was a leave of absence but in reality I was lied to by my manager and subsequently terminated. Never work here if you have any pride or dignity. Because they will actively try and stomp all over it to make you submissive to what management wants."
bad,As time has gone on ups has became a bad place to work.management constantly places unrealistic routes on drivers expecting them to get the job done.it is made to be a more stressful job then what should be
bad,Great job if you don't want to ever see or have a spouse or children. If you try to use a sick day (which you are entitled to in the contract) and management tells you that you need to come to work you will be discharged. This goes on your record even after the union helps keep your job. It shouldn't get this far however the union is in the company's back pocket these days.
bad,Don’t work at ups it’s not worth it . You don’t get all your hours they send you home early it’s loud and ghetto it’s really uncomfortable you have to wait to long to get home
bad,"You will feel like a slave in the new smart hub and nobody is promoted based on merit but by who likes who, management abuses their power often but they will hire anyone."
bad,"If you're looking for a company that doesn't care about you and just keeps demanding more and more hours then this job is for you. Forced overtime almost daily. Good luck seeing your family during the holidays. November-January expect to be home well have 9PM with over 60 hours of work a week. They work you through blizzards, and force you to take more work from other drivers when you are done with your stuff."
bad,"Waste of time, working at UPS leaves no time for social life except weekends and that depends on your position. Brown nosers get far even if they dont know anything. Company is in a decline because no one cares."
bad,The management there was extremely horrible and poor. They didn't treat the workers there fairly nor did they appreciate their efforts. They had unrealistic expectations and made working there extremely stressful and difficult. You dreaded going into work the next day cause you knew that it was going to be a mess.
bad,"Worked me till I was too sick to work, then worked me some more. They promised me advancement but never deliver even after being the highest ranked in my field."
bad,"Was a very stressful place to work and felt constantly under pressure. No work, life balance and worked a lot of long hours. Pay was good though and overtime always paid."
bad,Cut throat environment - claim to train employees which is far from true.  I did 5 years at ups and the only thing I have to show for it is an injured lower back.
bad,"The management is like the politicians, they should all be thrown out & start over fresh, from an out of state hub."
bad,"Ups è una azienda top, peccato che la coop che gestisce e organizza il lavoro dei corrieri sia in mano a chiacchieroni che fanno un sacco di promesse senza mantenerle. Una delle esperienze lavorative più negative della mia vita."
bad,"They pay you well, but you sacrifice big time for it. Family life is not important to them, neither is your mental health. Working conditions are very unsanitary. I get knots in my food when I try to eat lunch, mold growing everywhere, bugs galore, and the bathrooms are gross.  I you work with people with high seniority they treat you like you are well beneath them."
bad,"Like most jobs, they dress it up and make it look real nice when you're starting out. They talk to you about the Union, how they're all for the small people, and the great benefits. But they fail to mention that you have to be there for 30 days before you can officially join their Union. Which means you have to withstand clueless, rude, and unhelpful supervisors, and move at a constant & extremely fast pace for however long your shift is (which is typically 4/5 hours) with minimal stopping. Until you're there 30 days, you don't have any rights, your opinion won't matter, and you can't move departments unless your Supervisor approves. You're moving heavy boxes, some taller than you, within seconds, or at least that's how they'd like for you to move. If not, they will talk bad about you, and discourage you even more. My check was messed up several times because there's no time clock. Everything is recorded by handwriting. Fortunately, how ever long they take to fix your hours, is double what they pay you once you finally get your check for the correct amount of hours. Don't even bother moving from your area or going to the break room on your 10/15 minute break, unless your area is close by because if not, you'll use your whole break walking to and from the break room. Just cop a squat on the floor somewhere. Most of the facilities are huge. It takes 10 minutes just to enter the actual facility where you work because you have to go through metal detectors, two flights of steps, and down a long bridge. There were even times where my Supervisor did not want to give his group a break"
bad,"I work here for 2 years, hours suck when it’s not rush season. I mean you could be working 6-12 hours a week during slow season. As a female, I do not recommend working the malls, those men from other companies...you get the point."
bad,"This was thee hardest job I’ve ever had. It was also the least paying.. Good luck making ends meet with 17.5 - 20 hours of work a week."
bad,Management is horrible and HR doesn't help. HR employees are barely there and they won't solve your problem. Security will harass you like they have nothing better yo do. Many open positions aren't posted. If you want a career advance it's all about who you know not what you know. Most of the management there aren't qualified.
bad,"As an hourly employee its a good job. Pays great and you're in the union.  As a management employee though, its terrible. They will fire you for no reason. There is nothing you can do. This company doesnt care if you have a family or are the only way to support your family. You give them 100% they want 120% and more. You do your job, thats not good enough."
bad,I didn't enjoy working here for many reasons. The work load was not distributed evenly. Some workers were not working as hard as other and got paid the same.
bad,worst most hostile work environment imaginable on a union level. good union pay and benefits are the absolute only positive about this job. horrible working conditions worsening every month
bad,Terrible place to work for I started from being a driver helper to air driver to ground driver. You are just a number. Management is terrible they work you like a dog. The pay is great but not worth the physical and emotional toll. Very stressful everyone there is depressed
bad,Working as a package handler sucks so much. Quit after 2 days. It is not worth putting your body into that labor. And the pay is terrible for the work you do.
bad,"Working for Ups is extremely stressful.  The trucks arent updated with ac or proper heat, the managers work you past your physical limits. Harassing their employees to work faster is common in the workplace and will blame you if you get injured."
bad,This is the worst job to be at it’s hot in the environment  in the area tha managers don’t do nothing but look at u an they don’t pay enough for all that work they give
bad,This job is dirty and demanding. You breath in black dust all day. The supervisors yell at you to continually go faster. It's hot as he// in the trailers to the point you will drink gallons of water every day during the summer. Do not look for a full time position here because after 13 years myself they are still impossible to get.
bad,I went into management thinking I could change things around for the better. Upper management ignore ideas. Corporate does not understand what is going in the warehouse. Employees are disrespectful to management and do whatever they want because the Union protects them. The hub is short staffed everyday. There are shortages of trucks when volume is heavy.
bad,"Horrible management, really bad work life balance, great benefits. You will more than likely love your coworkers and the benefits are great but any job at this company sucks. They reward the lazy and punish the hardworking you will have to do other peoples work for them if they decide not to that day."
bad,The job was a waste of time period I was there for 2 years and made 13.50 a hour and had 25 to 27 hours a week and check wssnt even 250 like seriously you work like a slave you do and work your hardest to get no where it's just a waste of time period
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here I worked here for 25 years I got fired for having fmla I have anxiety and depression they used me of being out too much I can’t help that I have had this
bad,dead end job pay isn't worth the amount of work that they expect out of you. Driving would be nice if it wasn't for they buddy system getting into said position.
bad,"Toxic work environment. Job should pay more for the work that you do. You will have to move heavy packages (70+ pounds) by yourself at some point. Conditions are fair to be honest, it’s a warehouse to be fair. Managers or supervisors as they call them will tell you everyday that you are nothing but a number. You are easily replaceable in their eyes."
bad,Their pay is terrible cannot get full time until you work for three years a lot of work but not match the pay this job is only good for beginners I feel
bad,"dont work for them as driver helper, they treat you with no respect, no communication with management and it is a tough job for the minimum wage pay. You might get sick from the weather, working at peak in the rain."
bad,"They'll lie to you telling you the position isn't seasonal, then turn around and lay you off for the next month or so, then just outright terminate you after taking your union dues. AVOID THEM GO TO FEDEX"
bad,This job sucked when i fist got there nobody wanted to train me the superviser didnt do anything. And the people were negative it was not a job for me and will never go back to it
bad,"Ups has by far the worst management I've ever seen or heard of.  The job when you start out as a loader is hard mainly because the company is to cheap to hire more workers. The part time managers turnover rate is also ridiculous, and they hire people with no experience in management or even in the same field of work. So needless to say you are told to do things that make absolutely no sense and would end up being better off not listening to anything they say. So that being said if you don't mind all that and working there a few years. Then you can apply to be a driver and you will make great money with good benefits, but I highly doubt most will make it. Ps I am one of the strongest loaders in the building sometimes scanning over 1500 packages but averaging around 1100 a day."
bad,"UPS... Under Paid Slaves is what that stands for! Ridiculous work for that small pay! Run far away! The salary is no where near worth the physical pain you'll endure throwing the frieght. 10.50, and this is Dallas! Sad."
bad,"Everything is a mad rush to get the boxes through the facility, the only time it is reasonable is 4th quarter when they hire temporary workers to meet deadlines"
bad,"Too much inconsistency with the duties and how it's ran, most of the people are ego driven and have poor communication skills, isn't a good work place , smd"
bad,"Well first off UPS cut my training short because they had been low staffed and heard from a worker that i work with at RDU Airport that i was a great worker, so they wasted no time putting me on the trucks, the hardest part about the job was being lied to about when my pay raise would increase to $13.00 an hour and still work without that pay. Management was iffy and i feel most times they weren't fair they said all workers could grow and they said i was such a good worker but wasn't allowing me to grow there and move around i was always isolated in 2 trucks."
bad,I don't really like ups schedule and pay I'm not happy with working there doing work not working long enough hours being able to be sent home because of low volume
bad,Poorly run and only 3 hours a day union that doesn’t fight for u and low pay from when i started in Philadelphia in 2012 it’s stressful and   sonority  is the only way to move up
bad,"Very cut throat, Hypocritical company policies. Not what you know but who you know. people can be a loader for 10 years before promoted to a PART TIME sup. Once you are in management and not union all bets are off and its every man for them selves."
bad,They don't care about you as a person. They just want you to come in and out work everyone else even though everyone else is extremely lazy and unintelligent.
bad,"management is worst i've ever seen or even heard about , theres a good reason UPS is known as Under Paid Slaves, work extremely hard for little pay( not including drivers) yelled at all the time to speed up regardless of if waayyyy above average, just a horrible horrible job"
bad,Did not pay much very dtruesdful and fast pass.. the first month working there you get 25 token out for union what they don’t tell you. Is after that month is over they take 50 out making your checks 100 when working 3-4 hours a day
bad,"Minimal training, high expectations, turn around on untrained supervisors who were abusive to the preloaders was fast and no communication between management supervisors and workers."
bad,Had a injury during my training and was being cursed and disrespected at due to the fact that they claimed I had lied overall they sent me to their medical center in which I had dislocated my wrist and was still being disrespectful overall the environment was bad
bad,"The time spent at this job was very stressful. The work was back breaking, with little to no help from managers. The managers and supervisors were disrespectful, un-collaborative, petty, and vindictive. The hours are good, overtime is often provided, mostly during the holidays. The benefits are great. Overall the pay is not worth the effort, due to extreme amounts of stress you will be subjected to."
bad,Typical day is horrible your first put into a trailer by yourself where you're over overworked to a point where you don't think the boxes will stop.  Management is  terrible. And you only get a 10 minute break.
bad,Great pay once you start. Work place is super competitve and cut throat. Its always a fight against the clock. Management pressures you to scratch (get back before the projected hour) every signle day.
bad,"-There was zero training, tribal knowledge."
bad,"Working with other employees is great, but management is a joke. Lack of communication and no one seems to know whose in charge or what supervisor knows what. Every week pay checks are wrong. The work is over baring sometimes packages are coming so fast it's like a river of boxes coming down the conveyer belt falling everywhere, but I saw an employee get fired for throwing a box, but there falling from the belt to the floor. Quantity always troops quality. This is just a job they tell you that you can move up it's only true if your a buddy. Some days your working so hard that by the time you realize what time it is you've done 4 or 6 hours and it's time to go home, and you have missed that 10 min break your were suppose to get. The pay is ok but you work hard for every dime. The benefits would be great but most people don't make it a year to receive them.Yes you have to work 1 year for any kind of benefits. No one stays here long."
bad,The company would have been an excellent place to work for but the recruiter never gave a set schedule to work and the job ended due to weather conditions and no call back
bad,"constantly left alone to deal with overflow, extremely incompetent supervisors, extremely existing/fast paced, awful work environment, terrible pay, and an extreme lack of help when help is desperately needed."
bad,"The job will be very fast paced and you are subject to the elements. Very demanding physically. Mandatory overtime and extra days at work during ""peak season""."
bad,Was going great until I wanted to advance within the company. After asking for weeks I was left in the dark with any opportunities. Seems like the last thing they want to do is promote hard workers
bad,"This job is a good job for someone in their 20s or early 30s. The Knicks and knacks add up, and the hatred between the management and employees makes for a brutal work environment"
bad,"At first you think cool you get to drive a big brown truck around with packages but after a couple of times things get bad.  Management wants you to work fast and yet also to work safely, way to long hours, and you do not get a sense of doing a good job when your done because your so tired."
bad,"My experience with UPS was not good. Management was very abusive with words, did not follow through with payroll pay periods, and extensive amount of lies."
bad,The management is horible there. We could only take an 10 minute lunch break once a  day. We had to choose between taking a lunch break and using the restroom.
bad,5 hours of intense work. You have to work a year to get insurance and PTO. Low pay. Not worth it unless you have a FT job or you want to become a driver.
bad,"UPS part time package handling is a thankless and strenuous position. Although the hours allow for an additional job and/or more time with family and friends, prepare for chronic fatigue, soreness, and constant ""underperformance"". The wages alone are laughable but the benefits (heath insurance) are top notch. Work is extremely fast-paced and expect a military style management team with lots of yelling, perceived disappointment, and results that could always somehow be improved. Multiply all of these dreadful expectations by a factor of 3 for the peak season from thanksgiving until New Years. Bottom line, you CAN find/do better than UPS!"
bad,UPS does not pay enough for the amount of work you put in for them. There is good management and organized working and clean work spaces but the work is very exhausting.
bad,"great opportunity if you like to work,great benifits and great place to make money, this is about the only driving job you can have that pays this well without a cdl"
bad,"Poorly managed, run-down company that will ship absolutely anything for money! They hire very poor workers and treat them horribly. They are lazy and treat customers like a joke. Holding packages on purpose just because they don't like the person."
bad,Management is unorganized and unprofessional. Employees curse on the job and doesnt follow any rules. Great benefits after one year. Easy to get promoted.  Hardest part of the job is leaving because of over employee count= no pay and lifting heavy weights and sweating.
bad,high stress and very intense depending on what management level you had to deal with.  Immediate management was great to work for it was the upper management that would come in and have personal feelings and employee's were not treated professionally
bad,If your going to work for UPS I would advise NEVER go into management. Stay hourly at all cost. It is not because of your immediate sup. it is b/c of the company
bad,its an ok job...but they have trouble getting people to stay with the company. expectations are based on nothing tangiable. benefits are great but you dont get them immediatly
bad,treats employees bad especially the elder drivers. only a matter of time before a strike happens. great benefits terrible management and time consuming. bad deal with amazon causing the place to go bananas. apply if you want but I'm telling you enjoy your happy days now cause your life will become miserable once you get there.
bad,"To Quick of a paste, but i could do for 2 Years, so it is doable. The job is not for everyone, at least at the location where i worked. I head that at other locations it is easier."
bad,"Managerial staff swearing at others and on break. Male driven environment. Accusations made without proof blame team as whole. No respect for agency team and constant threatening of job. Long term agency  employees get no contract. Team leaders are  overpaid. Everyone seems to be  a first aider or fire warden with no regards for safety at all  Roles all on same start rate which isn't right. Agency management don't get involved no protection. Fixed rate pay doesn't go up in 12 weeks.  So many rules and regulations not met it is not consistent. Bullying in front of others,  managers 'softly' disciplining Staff in front of  others. Constant crudel  remarks shouted across warehouse. Unable to book time off at times even when no one else off or gets cancelled,  shifts get changed  last minute. Poor company, needs investigating."
bad,"Bad management, the pay is not worth the amount of work you have to put in. Always understaffed and the bosses don't care about your personal life. Short breaks and you only work 20 hours a week"
bad,its a okay job you just dont get no hours.When the work is done you clean up and go home. type of work we process and than we put it on the line we get one 30 min break
bad,"CEO & Top Management Give them selves raises"
bad,"I found it difficult to get anyone to help me or get my questions answered. I felt that training could have been more hands on instead of in classroom. Had I had better training, I believe this job would have been tolerable."
bad,"The job itself isnt too bad, the staff are genuinely good to work with but the management are just awful human beings, the absolute worst of the worst, managers regularly come out into the warehouse just to scream disgusting insults at emoloyees. Overtime is mandatory with threats of dismissal, the warehouse is massively understaffed and the equipment older than the company, training is a 5 miniute explanation and health and safety doesnt exist. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, dartford ups warehouse is the worst place ive ever worked."
bad,"Ups is Riddled with Constant Blatant Harassment From Management. Do Not Expect the Union You Pay Dues To, To Do Anything Helpful For The Substantial Money You Pay Them Each Week.The Building Is Vastly Under-cleaned and Outdated. Be Prepared to Inhale Dust Constantly Through the Day.Do Not Expect To Progress Up The Hiring Ladder Unless You Are Willing To Yell At People In an Unprofessional Manner."
bad,very low review. the company doesn't care about your personal life or personal and family problems. ive been cursed at by my main boss and bewittled. they over work you and when injured do not stand behind you nor care about your injury
bad,"Had bad management hourly pay was to low for the type of job you do there and it was only part time, You will only get 10 to 15 min breaks when you work up to 4 5 hours non stop."
bad,"I was the youngest part time supervisor."
bad,I worked at a very slow location. Coworkers were cold and did not take time to get to know one another. My immediate manager seemed threatened by ambition and all but refused to teach me the few skills there were to learn. Most of my time was spent looking for things to clean while hoping a customer came in.
bad,"My supervisor consistently gave me two more trucks than everyone else, and I was the new guy. They over work their employees, and should you complain about it they may consider firing you."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is going home when your done its not a fun place to work unless your higher up. ups isn't very respect to employees. they only want profits any means necessary.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in and logging into your scanner. The company has wonderful benefits and depending on location will have good employees. There are competitive wages, and opportunity for advancement."
bad,Senior management provide little support to Shift Supervisor's. If local sort misses production schedule senior management blames lower level supervisors. Culture is toxic worse than a bar no one has your back and it's everyone for themselves. Union employees are as lazy as they come and are rewarded for time on job and not productivity. Avoid at all cost if possible.
bad,"Table tennis is fun sport. it requires flexibility, strength and balance. People playing this sport have good body posture."
bad,"I have worked for this company for around 11 months, as a package car driver, and all i'll say is if your considering joining then you'll have no life what so ever!! "
bad,"applied for an admin job, but ended up doing everything around the warehouse. They force you into doing labor or anything you don't want, DON'T RECOMMEND WORKING HERE."
bad,"Very busy, stressful workplace where management and  corporate try to squeeze as much out of the hourly employees as they possibly can and expect even more from the salaried, supervisors and managers.  Disorganized and poorly micro-managed daily operations.  "
bad,"Responsible for servicing, maintaining, and inspections"
bad,Good if you plan on having no life for the next 25 years and like black gunk coming out of your nose
bad,ups has excellent benefits for their employee's.  I arrive drivers as they come in on a daily basis.  I confirm that all the daily receipts and Bill of Ladings in there.
bad,early am start time with a lot of responsibility sorting heavy and light packages to be distributed in the proper trucks.  It was very challenging and time was of the essence with this fast paced job.
bad,"busy on feet for four hours but i was on mine for eight hours i double shifted.. i learned to sort packages, I learned to adapt to eviroment management was alright sum of it... the co workers were fun to work with. da fun part was unloading..."
bad,Very strict military type management and not family oriented.Extremely cut throat corporate mentality. The other workers were fine but the corporate stuff was disgusting and inhumane.
bad,delilvely and collection of package of 60+
bad,"At UPS a typical day can be easy going if the person know their job. Learning how to operate the equipment, learning the codes, and written rules can be kind of challenging at times. Management is okay because they do not get in the way unless a job is done incorrectly. Co-workers work together at all times. The hardest part about the job is trying to keep up with the rules that are providing to load or scan the packages that are being processed during operations. Overall the environment is enjoyable and easy going."
bad,a good job for benefits but if you must kiss up to management to keep your job.
bad,"I interviewed with a group of people and was later called by the HR person. She said she would be in touch with me about moving forward with hiring me. I never heard back from her after that. I knew someone who was also there at the group meeting and was later hired. It was frustrating for me because I needed a job, I was qualified for the job, I gave of my time to go meet with them, and then they couldn't even be considerate enough to follow through."
bad,This job is good for snack money... The benefits sound great but if you dont make the hour's you don't get the benefits. So it's a waste of time. If you become a supervisor you can't go backwards so if the position is too much to handle your fired
bad,"Ich habe die meiste Zeit meines Aufenthalts zwischen 10 und 11 Stunden am Tag verbracht, sie wurden nur zwischen 8 und 9 Stunden am Tag bezahlt."
bad,I was never late nor absent here and I was always treated poorly. Overworked me even during my training period and assuming because I was able to keep up they assigned another truck to me while I was training. Mainly Hispanic workers and the managers/supervisors were very nonchalant and uncaring. Racist activity involved and poor pay
bad,"The HR department is a joke, they are forgetful, disrespectful, inconsiderate and slightly aggressive. Not only this, but my Co-Worker was assaulted on the premises, they fired the attacker and only a week later they let go the one that got assaulted."
bad,Constant drama and harassment with supervisors. Human Resources work along with managers. They abuse their authority to pick a fight with people. I managed to stay for a year while dealing with the harassment.
bad,I worked there for 2 peak seasons . It was long nights and very tiresome. The pay is awful compared to the labor . Prepare for the unexpected working there .
bad,"I liked the job. Learned forklift. Had a great co worker. "
bad,Management is not satisfied unless a understaffing crisis is underway. That is there way of maximizing productivity. Sent home at the beginning of the shift 40 % of the days so far..Sucks.
bad,"Plenty of work to do all the time. If you're athletic and love to work out this job is for you, I personally just thought I was getting paid to work out. The supervisors are complete a-holes and try to stay hydrated."
bad,Not a bad job when done correctly. OK management. Fast paced and heavy lifting. Very physically stressful. Room for improvement but over time. Would recommend.
bad,Not a bad part time job. Pay is not great unless it's peak and you work ot. Higher ups all preach safety but actually safety doesn't mean anything it's all about numbers. You will work very hard everyday and still always be behind somehow. Amazing benefits after a year if you can stick it out
bad,Ups is hard job. You have to lift heavy boxes and getting yelled about going to slow. Make sure you Dodge the package because they might hurt or kill you
bad,"On paper benifits and pay are good and can be great. Culture sucks dog eat dog job. Everyone is trying to use and exploit you. Ups motto. You work as fast as you can, so sup can get you off the clock, as soon as he can, and pay you as little as he can. You have to pace yourself to make sure your paid fairly. $13 an hour to unload a trailer is an insult but it's how you get your foot in the door to move up."
bad,This place have no progression. They want to always overwork the good workers. The managers are a joke. Most of the managers never did the job before they coach you to do something.
bad,UPS is a great company to work for they need more Improvement on their staff I had an injury at UPS and I don't think I would treated fairly during the injury at UPS
bad,Not worth the money. Stay on top of your family life. It is ALL that you really can be truly happy with in this life. Be aware of UPS's goal and in the long run for you it is not worth it.
bad,"literally the worst place to work in the world but the pay is good and so are the benefits. they also offer tuition reimbursement, but legit wanted to die every single day working there"
bad,"Lack of hours during off peak time but if stay longterm more opportunities unless wanna kill yourself loading or unloading, management said since put 2 weeks in that I should just quit now."
bad,Pre load supervisor is very stressful and not very good training on putting everything in computers not paid enough for job you are doing .Cant get everything done on the time allotted and don’t want you to have to stay over .
bad,"I worked as a loader and mostly worked on the slides."
bad,This job sucks if you dont need it i wouldnt recommend it to anybody but if you need a job then its managers and supervisors are cool but they over work you for 10 dollars an hour for 5 hours and you get one 10 minute break and they cut your hours
bad,"The benefits are really good if you can hang on and wait for them to kick in. The pay in my opinion is not worth dealing with management and the intensity of the job tasks. We were working 4 hours or so a night at an extremely fast pace. If we did not keep up that pace, we were chastised."
bad,"The management is often screaming at employees to work harder and work faster. Safety is often overlooked by management. Very high turnover rate, and lots employees calling in everyday."
bad,So I've been with the company since peak of Nov 2018. We use to get a attendance bonus (for new hires) but that ended at the end of April. So now it's hard to keep people coming. I feel that the work is a lot harder than what the pay is. The union has been working on there contract and finally passed it in late April 2019. So it took them from 2018 Aug when it was suppose to be finished. To April 2019. That says a lot about how the leader ship of UPs rolls. Plus if you're in the union you don't have to work hard. Or even do your job to the T. I see so many full time workers who make +30 dollars a hr not do much work. While the part timers at $13 are expected to work there hardest. Just saying what they expect the part timers to do and the full timers isn't a fair representation of work balance. Max hr wage is 37 for inside help and all the new people have to.wait 9 months before getting benefits. Company doesn't care for employees. It reminds me of trumps white house. Plus you get one 10 minute break. Which is garbage.
bad,"A typical day at work is solving problem after problem.  You have to learn everything on your own, no one takes the time to coach you because no one has any time to do so.  Management is not worth it. You're are a punching bag daily and never recognized for doing a good job.  The culture is toxic, low moral, and negative.  The hardest part of the job is trying to survive day to day.  The only enjoyable part about the job is some of the relationships built with employees."
bad,"I got sick and called in everyday i was sick, no insurance so i couldnt go to the doctor. they told me i voluntarily terminated my employment by being sick"
bad,"Disgusting company to work for never ever paid correctly-union are useless and are just there for training days of!! Management and team leaders all too young and have no idea.imagine the Amazon scandal this will be in the papers soon-no health and safety at all very dangerous parcels everywhere blocking fire escapes,dry ice going around belts smashed open! The press need to investigate and send someone inside"
bad,"There’s a lot of good things about ups, but it’s hard to find those things while managers rush you to go too fast. It always feels as though if you question any thing the manager or supervisor are doing then you’re a threat."
bad,If you are ok with feeling like a number and understand it's just a paycheck...then you can survive at UPS Freight. Other than that... it's a pile. Good luck
bad,The pay at ups is a issue because night in and night out people work extremely hard to receive little to no money at all on there paychecks. The benefits are good though.
bad,"Poor management, I felt like my job was being threatened everyday when I was an area supervisor. Bad working conditions. I've heard that the management has gotten somewhat better so that's good to hear. I can't say that it's convincing enough to to recommend this employer to anyone."
bad,It was good to work there at fist hardly no problem for some but came back different management didnt like me going to school. I advise no one work there. the only reason why some stay is they been there a long time and the money and benifits.
bad,You will get slaved for 3-5 hours a day. Your check will be 200-220 a week. That’s 660 a month. Billion dollar company work us like machines and pay us like we ain’t human with responsibility.
bad,"Managers don’t necessarily take their job seriously, most employees are not willing to go the extra mile for customers. Ups really cares more about making money rather than the customersz"
bad,Culture was horrible.  Management was horrible.  The work conditions were horrible.  Almost every employee with UPS is disgruntled.  Makes for a very difficult working condition.
bad,"This rating is for the WorldShip helpdesk at UPS. The WorldShip software we supported was terrible and not user friendly at all. It was very buggy and hard to support. The knowledgebase we used was not very helpful and cluttered. If you love stress, this is the job for you."
bad,"They don't repair equipment unless it's totally broken down. They hire employees who can't do a quarter of the work that the senior employees do, then force the seniors to do what the new hires can't. Management only cares about getting their bonuses. They don't keep up with safety standards, for example grip tape on ladders is worn down and not replaced, bolts holding ladders are left broken, beams that hold up tonnes of metal are bent and not replaced. The staff (management and most union employees) are lazy at best, irresponsible, and inadequate. They break state labor laws (One ten minute break no matter if you work 4 or 10 hours a day, no lunch even if you work 10 hours a day on part-time). Overall a very, very miserable and unsafe place to work."
bad,A worker died at my location and instead of them recognizing the incident and or re evaluating there procedures they did nothing reguarding the matter.
bad,"While you doing your job other rather talk to friends  and don't do nothin and its ok for them to do nothin management don't do nothing because they're buddies with management,they stand at the time clock and talk like a good 20 to  30 min.And nobody say anything to them , on the time to get your review most likely they get a better raise be more than you."
bad,There was too much confusion with payment. I didn’t receive my first check until I had already been working there for a month and we were supposed to be paid weekly
bad,The management team is terrible.  will talk behind your back and then lie to your face.  Nobody acts professional in this office.  The supervisors bounce from office to office because there is no work to do and complain about how much they have to do.
bad,"Company only cares about numbers. Company does not care about employees or customers. Management overworks employees and does not follow union contract guidelines. Pays great, but job will wear you down with stress, physical demands and lack of family time."
bad,"Working both as a bottom level employee and as middle management,  I saw both ends of a very brutal job.  You need thick skin, self pride, and a willingness to get the job done no matter the cost."
bad,if you work for UPS work for Small pack not Freight. It is a great company with great benefits but the unrealistic expectations will driver you over the edge. Freight is not up to date with UPS small pack and it needs a lot more development and advancement. The stress is not worth it.
bad,UPS is probably the most unorganized business I've ever worked for in my 21 years on this earth. Management is very unprofessional  they only look out for themselves. I started off in peak season making 14/hour. Management told us we were expected to go back down to 10/hour(yes 4 dollars) after peak season but then they told us we were keeping the 14 so they wouldn't lose any workers. Well low and behold we have been brought down to 10/hr for the past 3 weeks without notice from anyone. They keep saying the 14/hr is coming back but it's all bs so we don't quit. Only way to make decent money there is to work like a slave for 3-4 years basically.
bad,Don't work here. Run as fast as you can and look for something else. The union takes care of people who don't care. Management runs around like it's a fire drill all the time.
bad,Fast paced with tons of heavy lifting. Only recommend to the young and very able bodied. Union is nice and the potential to grow within the company is there if you have the time to put in.
bad,"Worst place to work"
bad,Need to work on work/life balance. It does not exist . Please accept this summary . I have nothing else to say . Thanks you. I have nothing else to say.
bad,"I worked as a pt supervisor at ups for just under 10 years. Upper management was encouraging me to move up to a full time management position for the last 2 1/2 years. I had consistently performed at an high level through those years and never called in.  One day I had an opinion about a issue and it turned in to an argument. They were real quick to tell me that I was out of my place and I didn't mean anything to the company. They bullies me by threatening my career made me feel like the 10 year I had put in UPS didn't not mean anything to them. I enjoyed hard work and the diverse workforce, but upper management was heartless and had very bad ethics. Its a good starter job for students. But stay away from getting promoted to Supervisor. Stay in the Union you wont get fired like I did."
bad,"waardeloos bedrijf die je bedriegt en valse beloftes doet maar je na 3 contracten de laan uitstuurd."
bad,"a typical day at work , was a fast paced form of operations. the hardest part of he job was half time at the football game when all the customers ould come all at once . the easiest part of the job was prepping food and washing dishes . i learned customer service and people skills"
bad,"A typical day at work involved loading and unloading boxes into and out of trailers. I learned how to work at a fast pace in a hectic environment. The management varied depending on the shift. My co-workers ranged from 17 year experienced employees to trainees. Mostly friendly people, easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting but it got easier with time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the consistency."
bad,"Physically damaging over time, but co-workers are wonderful.  Management was under-trained and severely stunted in growth and education.  Safety was a joke between everyone as workers 100% responsible for all safety while UPS kept no equipment up to code, repaired, ergonomically correct, etc.."
bad,"good if you like heavy lifting everyday, good for advancement"
bad,işin zor yanı 1 çalışma saat leri 2 yemek. eglence 0 hiç bi şey ögrenmedim.bu arada çalışma saatlari sabah 8 30 gece 24 00 evet sosyal hayat 0 yani.
bad,"A typical day at work includes being constantly harassed by union employees and threatened by upper management. If you like being treated like a dog, then this is the place for you. They build up this image of teamwork and integrity, but is quickly dismantled with lying and deception. Your pay is salary based so they have no problem threatening your job if your not available to work 14-16 hr days. If your not willing to relocate (to anywhere they choose, at anytime) you will not be considered for full time employment. The most enjoyable part of this job was after four years of torture, when I walked out and never looked back."
bad,"UPS is not a good place to work at if you are a package handler. There is nothing to enjoy about this and the hardest part is everything. The co-workers act normal so there's really no problem with the workers, but the managers don't really do their job. They slack off so bad. A regular day at ups is always a hard day."
bad,"It’s no way you can expect people to do all the things you want them tooo in the time limit you want . They expect you to scan, lift then put packages in a certain place and it’s never under 300 packages  truck. The packages maybe bigger than you and you rarely ever have help you may end up doing 3/4 trucks by YOURSELF"
bad,I was looking forward to ups and the work. I was promised a bunch and received nothing. I was working full time and they chose not to pay me and then lied to me about my amount. After my time there they asked me if I was interested in coming back I told them yes and they gave me a time a date to start. I go there just to find out I have to reapply and ups tells me I'm unable to reapply meanwhile I was a supervisor at the time.
bad,"The Job started out good. but unfortunately, with management that would rather risk the safety of their employees  than fix the technical issues inside of the warehouses, things go down hill rather quickly after you've been there for more than a month."
bad,"Lots Of Overtime And You Stay Busy During Peak Season 12-14 hrs a day."
bad,"You make an excellent wage with union benefits. You must first start out part time and bid on full time job openings as they become available, per seniority. Management constantly rides you about working faster and they truly don't care about you as a person. If you get hurt on the job you'll see very quickly how they turn on you. Terrible people."
bad,I worked at IPS for over 25 . It’s a great place for top notch bust your butts workers. And even than your managers will ride you hard  they’ll pit you against each other and DO NOT keep your conversation private  it’s a huge cat and mouse game and they’ll beat you down until you break! But I was able to outlast all the managers except one FEMALE! Go with God!
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had"
bad,Would never let anyone waste their time the way I wasted mines; UPS was the worst job I've experienced that fact that you spend your time working 5hr in long trailer trucks loading and only get 10 min break
bad,"This is a very mediocre job, filled with management that mostly looks after themselves with no basic regards for part time employees safety/well being. You are rewarded for being lazy, the harder you work the more responsibility and accountability will be held over you. Hectic nights will require you to work up to 7 hours, by no means a comfortable part time job."
bad,One big dump. If you value your body don't go work at UPS. You'll need new knees and shoulders after you leave. Benefits are good but that's about as good as it gets unless you become a driver
bad,Job is too stressful. You could be doing the best you could and is never good enough. Certain managers are mentally abusive and belittling. Worst place I’ve ever worked
bad,"The company allows you to choose to work indoor or outdoor, which both pays a price in terms of weather. However, they will train and convince you how good the job is good but will not actually tell you what your actually getting into. It’s Morley based on the person but I can guarantee you this can not be set as a primary job to work nor just extra money on the side. They will work you doing the whole  9 yards. You have to work 5 days a week  only working 4 hour shifts to accumulate an after tax check of  180... it does depend on the person but the work there’s want you to do is way too much to even accept a check like that . If it’s not that they may lose your check ."
bad,"Very stressful, people yelling at you about their packages, vendors being overcharged for oversized packages. Terrible schedules. A lot of favoritism. Hard place to stay working at."
bad,Ups is bad place to work you don't get to many hours I work 3 or 2 hours 5 days a week unloading tracks is hot in the tracks you got be fast to work here
bad,Management is the way to go if you want to get paid higher in the short run but long run stay union so you can be a driver and protected by the union.
bad,Stressful environment mostly due to the incompetence of supervision. If you want to work hard and still be under appreciated then its a great job and you if work part time prepared to get screwed over a lot!!!
bad,"UPS was a wonderful company, then they bought Lynx and it all went wrong. They stopped caring about the guys that actually do the work as each new manager wanted to make their mark, and the work loads went up to unachievable levels with disciplinary action following for not being able to do the work."
bad,UPS is toxic for all employees to work at. Managers hate their jobs as bad as hourly employees. UPS has a corporate culture of harassment and intimidation from the top down. 50 to 60 hours per week and at Christmas it goes to 70 hours or more. Hours are 9 to 9 or later and Monday thru Friday. Also could force you into working your days off. Union tells you that you are getting paid so why complain about more money. This job breaks your body down and also your spirit.
bad,I didn’t like this job. I felt as though we were being slaved and only being paid little to nothing. Didn’t get enough hours. Got along with the supervisors but overall I didn’t like the job
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at UPS.. The workers and supervisors are treated bad. The work you are required to do does not match with the pay.
bad,Union protects the lazy. Company claims to be the most efficient but they are the most inefficient in the business they take a simple task and make it far to complicated. They have now respect for the employees u are just a number. Getting time off is a constant fight
bad,Please reconsider before applying here . UPS stands for Under Paid Slaves. It was cool when I first got here and then they kept changing supervisors ( probably went through 5 Or 6 for my work Area) . I don’t think some management didn’t care too much about safety ( which is a big thing at the company )
bad,Ups is a good company to work for but there are managing issues.And it makes it a bad working environment..There so great guys there and you got the ones who believe in not working.
bad,Worst company to work for I ben there 12 years no catch up raise people that get hired now are making the same money as me it’s just a slap in the face out in all this time and have nothing to show
bad,I was there for yea and i found out that they lie to you alot and that you would have to be there for years to move up at all in this company . They also didnt give us our raises when they told us it was going to happen.
bad,"Management will lie out of their bare  --- and throw you under the bus to save their own  -----  Is there anybody honest there to make it right for me seeing as how they destroyed my life. It's a simple fix. I figure they owe me about $400,000.00 in back pay. My job and $400,000.00. That sounds about right. If you can find that honest person maybe they can make it right for me. I was only one of the best workers they had. I will return and work a couple more years and then retire.If you are that honest person I'm looking for you can come to 6700 Krameria St, profusely apologize to me and ask me to come back to work.What do you say,want to ease your concience and right a terrible wrong. Here's your chance.I say I earned it for giving 13 years of my life to them."
bad,Very limited diversity. Managers aren't nice at all and don't give you any breathing room between your training and when you start. Most managers expect you to be very good right away.
bad,Trash  comapny to work for barley give any hours don’t get paid enough expect you to go out the way for little pay I your best bet is fed x you get paid more and easy to promote
bad,got paid minumn for busting your butt while the drivers drive for 38$ a hr. You get picked up which is cool but they pick you up for the hardest deliveries. I work Xmas Eve and didn't get holiday pay or bonus. Never again
bad,UPS is a good company but you are just a number to supervisors and managers at UPS they don’t care about the employees. They are always only looking out for themselves.
bad,Racist and maneger acted like he knew that’s what police do in his area plus told me the ups store couldn’t get involved with there worker being harassed
bad,Dont recommend. They don't care about you they will harass and tell you if you don't like it quit.  It's because you work for the union so the don't care what you do as long as you get the packages delivered.
bad,Some management is very unprofessional and disrespectful. Even when you are working and doing what you are supposed to be doing they still send you home early
bad,"I think just only me they didn’t send my last paycheck. But then I found too much information and complains from others where they described the same problem."
bad,UPS is a fast paced work enviornment with demanding work loads that make it easy to fall behind. Hours for package handlers range from 5-6 hours 5 days a week
bad,I performed very well but the other full time supervisors dont know what they are doing and they chose the dumb sups instead of the ones that actually worked and really pushed to accomplish the numbers.
bad,Very Time consuming I’d hate to work there again an wouldn’t recommend it to anyone as a future reference but other than that have a great day may god be with you
bad,poor management making bad decisions and unqualified/unskilled  employees able to keep employment due to the union. compensation and benefits package is very fair.
bad,This company has some of the absolute worst management. Every UPS around is being told for its management to be hard in their employees. When morale is low. They say production is up. The best thing this place has going is it’s benefits and hourly pay rate.
bad,The communication and managing was extremely poor. The environment is not idea. The stress can be heavy. The benefits and opportunities are what keeps you there
bad,"High paced, but very unorganized. Wouldn't recommend to anyone (very poor cultured environment) No loyalty to the common employee, could be dishonest at times."
bad,"UPS has great benefits if you stay longer than a year. It is a very fast moving, fast adapting facility to work in. Safety is high priority at UPS. The temp supervisor's are more caring because they work with us on a daily schedule."
bad,The work was very physical and fast paced just not enough hours. The company is very big with many employees jus not willing to give more hours until Pete season which that is only holidays
bad,teaches you hard work ethics and ppushes you to finish the job you started and it also teaches you to be punctual and consistent when youre at a work place
bad,good second job to have provides insurance and benefits pays for school after you pass / kind of a chaotic place to work sometimes / its hard work / ups will push you mentally and physically
bad,"As a student it fit into my schedule. They will use you up and spit you out. You can have perfect attendance, be on time everyday, give it all you have, but if your not like them you want get hired. Unequally opportunity employer for sure. Management lacked integrity big time. Leadership was very poor, which gave a bad image to a company that serves its community. I can't speak for UPS as a whole, but the UPS I worked for represented the corporation poorly. Human resources are for the managers not matter what. Never witness so much corruption with a employer. Had to find out the hard way."
bad,"Management team known for hollering and threatening employees to move faster."
bad,"Wasnt to bad but hours were pretty bad as in the lack of hours, pay wasnt bad for the small amount of work you did. only down side is the when it gets cold you tend to freeze driving in one of those trucks"
bad,Worked for this company for 11 years.  They dont like people to stay for a long time so they will find some BS way to get rid of u.  Not loyal to their employees.  All about what benefits them.  11 years of hard work and no appreciation and no loyalty what  shame.
bad,"The work was steady but if a glitch happened in their system you were left standing around for hours. It also messed up some people, such as myself, from getting their pay check on time. After a month I still haven't recieved some of my pay. Management treats you with so much disrespect its sickening. It made my experience there degrading. I am a human being who was trying my best at a new job and to have a manager or managers treat me like they did and talk down to me like they did made a hostile work environment I refused to be a part of."
bad,"You have to be very patient, healthy and tough to work here...and you also have to be very careful you don't hurt yourself...it's a pretty dangerous place...particular the Unload. Its also a filthy place...you will come home filthy and have black snot. There is no drugs test so a lot of people on drugs get into the building. There is no belief here of slow and steady wins the race...you will not find that here. You will find Greed, Denial and Unhappiness at this company."
bad,"Managing union employees in a time sensitive environment was very stressful. The union did not recognize UPS production standards, making it very hard to hold employees accountable for their actions."
bad,"ups was a good place to work, its very fast pace but if you can manage to stay on top of the clock then you can be successful, the overall experience was worth it."
bad,the job is super far only has 2 bus that get you there barely on time. when i ask my supervisor questions about my check being messed up he was unable to to help saying he doesn't understand why my check is wrong after he is the one who does the checks. when i ask the time to come in for work nobody knows. It's just unprofessional.
bad,"its an awful job. the environment, the culture, how people treat you, its just all bad. UPS drivers usually work 12 hour shifts everyday."
bad,"ups is a great job if you are in college and need to work night shift and great insurance after a YEAR of working there, other than that it sucks and the pay sucks."
bad,started from the bottom of a company thats based off seniority.. was told to stick with and over time the opportunity of advancement was worth it.. worked 3 am- 10am M-F and driver helped 11 am -3pm.. considered on sticking with it and making a it a life long career and advance to delivery.. unfortunately I ended up  getting laid off with 15+ workers and some of those workers who were committed to job that were laid off have been working there 5+ years..
bad,"I really enjoy woking with my co-worker and every season. That UPS offer a convenient and flexible schedule, near your home."
bad,"A typical day at work would be loading/unloading trucks, Scanning freight, Operating conveyor belt, and facility maintenance. The management was poor but the co-workers were very friendly and helpful."
bad,"Owning your own business required a lot of work but eventually as the business grew, the flexibility was great.  Nothing I felt was hard owning my own business.  However, it was difficult to say that you were a business owner when major of your business was dictated by the parent company.  Owning my own business truly gave me a wonderful 10+years of how a business should operate and how to make it successful."
bad,"running, lifting, attend to consumers packages, inspection, delivery, team work."
bad,A day at ups is filled with stress. The volume was way too high for the amount of people working there. But yet instead of giving their employees more hours to insure costumer packages were safely sorted and or loaded they pounded them for four hours. Management was absolutely horrible always stayed in their a/c cooled offices only time they were seen was when they need to yell at us or tell us we needed to pick up the pace. The only hard part of that job is getting the nerve to put yourself through another day at that company. Nothing was enjoyable at that place
bad,"Typical day at work consist of balancing of counters, making phone calls to customer counters, and resolving overage/shortage errors."
bad,Go to work at 4am or earlier. three hour shift if your lucky. Typically bombarded with packages on the conveyor belt from start to finish. hurried by management
bad,"Extremely hard work, management push you to your limits every day, a high level of fitness is a must. this job is not for the faint hearted tho the wages are good"
bad,"I worked for 2mos. Unfortunately I was fired for a relatively minor accident due to being on probation,which is 90 days.  I want to think it was coincidence in timing when I was hired because 1 dispatcher was fired, another quit, the head Mgr quit, and terminal is being run by ""temporary mgmt"". Frankly, I'm being nice here, the Tukwila Terminal is an operational mess!  The hardest part for me was always searching for equipment in yard, dispatch never had control over keys/equipment which is unusual in this industry, as I've had a lot of experience with other smaller companies that did a MUCH BETTER job.  Also, for such a large company, the tractors were mostly old, and were not allowed to be washed. A contradiction to the ""package operations"" where the trucks are washed daily. I wasn't glad to be fired, but for new applicants, BE FOREWARNED, working at this terminal will be a huge challenge in patience, and you will not make the high wages until you have spent many yrs.  Also, UPS is ruthless and you might be fired, or attempted to be fired for seemingly ""minor"" violations when trying to do a good job for the company. If I was a DRIVER with experience and know what I do now, I would look elsewhere for a job.  Also, the feeling I got from some of my co workers is that they resented new employees and sort of looked at you as a threat to their jobs, especially if you did the job the way mgmt wanted you to, and didn't listen to their constant negative comments.   $15.05 PER HOUR FOR DRIVERS FOR 90 DAYS STARTING AND NO UNION PROTECTION."
bad,"I only worked at UPS for the 2009 holiday season... I did not like it; this was in Memphis, TN. They tricked me into believing I had the job permanently; the workers were miserable; and my supervisor was trying to get me fired... I guess my work-ethic threatened his position; he was mentally ill; it was just patheitic. Also, they wouldn't even give me my last paycheck..."
bad,nice job management is just very unperffessional benifits take too long to come on low hours too
bad,Good benefits for a part time job. thats about it. I have nothing else to say about this job since I worked there for such a short period.
bad,"Pros: Great benefits, great hours if you only need a part time job."
bad,Low pay absolute horrible management. Simple work but they work you as hard as they can for low pay and a few hours.
bad,"I worked for this company for over two years. The drivers get a really hard time you have to drive hard but obey laws work with bad equipment that tears up alot. they rush you hard till the end of day and if you are hired and you are at the bottom of list you might work 4 then go home and then come back, might be the highest paying job in the area but the stress and they can never get anything right. manger is usually dont listen to you. they give you a number and that is all you are to them"
bad,Enjoy all parts of my job. Co-workers are fun to work with. Management is ok.
bad,This place is like a soap opera! Very clicky and management at my location was pathetic.
bad,Very unappreciative work place  very stressful  always being talked down to  they do offer good pay and benefits if you can tolerate the stress of the job then it would be ok
bad,"It is a great starting and part job pay and benefit wise, but it is awful being there. It is a very hostile and dangerous working environment. I would never go back."
bad,"I personally hated my job as a preloader for UPS. I would have to wake up at 2 in the morning, I would be dirty and gross at the end of my shift. On an 8 hour shift— we only got one break that was 10 minutes. It was frowned upon to leave our station even to use the restroom or get water."
bad,Minimum wage is pathetic and the union is not for the workers anymore. Each contract is getting worse and it will be harder for you to find full time work. You can go to management but that's another level of stress.
bad,Terrible place to work honestly obviously I’ve had some good times but more bad times as a PT supervisor i hate it they expect way to much of us and yes we get decent pay but it’s not worth it for the amount of work we do. Being a part time sup is not fun they sell you a dream that Will never happen it’s terrible don’t do it unless you want to be stressed out all the time.
bad,"The only good thing about this company is the money and benefits."
bad,Company pays very well (except part time employees) Benefits are GREAT! But the hours and physical demand are very demanding. Management can be very unfair and set unrealistic goals. Be aware as a new employee you will be worked TO DEATH and this is only to set a paper trail trend so that if you do make it into the union you will be held to that standard. Did I mention this is a union job?
bad,Supervisor does not know anything never cared about the employees always making it seem like were slaves except the only difference is you get paid it's no wonder why they give you such great benefits when you are there for a year your back will hurt your joints will hurt your muscles will be sore do they care? NO don't try telling them anything personal going on with your life because they won't care only thing they care about are numbers they talk about egress but yet never do a single thing about it. They act like the drivers are practically gods like they are the penical of the company I didn't get paid to get yelled at by drivers the jobs is stressful as is and if your actually sick and can't come to work you basically get scolded for it the next day. The amount of work that needs to be done they are underpaid I mean for gods sake care about your employees for once in your life actual care instead of acting like they are slaves doing your dirty work. When someone calls In don't scold them for it you don't know what goes on in peoples lives stuff happens you can't expect people to not call in Give people a break and stop treating people like they aren't human they are not robots people get sick people get tired people have aches and pains. I mean seriously in this company people get handed stuff to them and it's just down right ridiculous you never get promoted maybe in 13 years or so but that's a small maybe to many problems at this hub.
bad,Every UPS store is different because the are franchises. Management is the key to the success of an employee. This franchise did not have any management and lacked leadership. Organization made false promises every pay period to keep you employed for another two weeks until they exhausted their promises.
bad,It was a good paying job and only 4 hours of work but I couldn’t work there anymore because my school time and how bad it was hurting my body but Id you can get past the school and body part it was a good job
bad,great place to work...the co-workers are amazing always willing to help..the enviroment is good...the only bad thing I can say about UPS is the pay is horrible.$14 to start and its hard and not worth it..
bad,What you do as the employee is not bad it will take you time to get accustomed to what you are assigned to do but its managements lack of care for employee which drove me away (especially if you are a student)
bad,"UPS Is a good job dont get me wrong but its just so much workers your  not treated as you should be, you get taken for granted, and at the end of the day if you want to make good money there you basically have to give your life to UPS because they dont care about your life and family."
bad,UPS do not have full-time does not pay good enough and does not teach you too nothing at all I need a job that pays 40 to 50 hours daily. Me thank you
bad,"Working at UPS was fantastic only because of the benefits offered. Maybe if i had a family during my duration working there maybe the unprofessional environment would have been worth it for the benefits alone. Unfortunately, saying you do not wish to date your supervisor can extremely effect your job and the way your treated by management."
bad,This place has great people but poor management promote anyone to a supervisor doesn't seem tovpay attemtion do theybworkers if they notice u work hard they dont rewars u they make u work even harder
bad,Usually its being run by a bunch of clowns who only got their position by sucking up to their bosses and ratting others out ....typical way to get to the top but not qualified to be a leader. The management team turn on each other when the going gets rough. Its a dog eat dog kind of workplace. Only the bullies survive.
bad,"job was fun fast and great while making friends."
bad,"unsafe work place"
bad,"Helped out in other areas when not busy in area of responsibility,Sorted damaged packages to repackaging area and noted on logs Recorded load errors on unloads,Maintain shi4 logs"
bad,This job was really difficult and there was a lot of tension between management and the employee union. The union was very frustrating and took a huge part of pay.
bad,"It was cool at first but I was only working part-time. I have three kids that I'm a single parent,so I need something full time."
bad,get to work and be micro managed by unqualified management in a unprofessional disrespectful manner . i learned hard work and time management . met many  new nice people . A very physical job very hard labor. good if you have no  other options
bad,While Working For UPS We Often Joked About The Acronym Meaning Under Paid Slaves. As That's What We Often Felt Like Once We Got Our Checks At The End Of Every Week. The Best Part Was The Benefits As They Paid Visits In Full For Normal Procedures. At The Time I Was There I Was 21 Years Of Age & I Joked About Feeling Years Shaved Off My Life. Not A Job I Would Recommend Unless You Have No Other Options.
bad,"Ups is known as one of the biggest companies in the world. Often promoted as one of the best places to work for. The benefits are incredible and the opportunities for advancement are amazing, however it is a very hostel work environment. Everyday management disrespected me verbally. "
bad,"A typical day is making sure your truck is loaded by 9:15am:"
bad,"Responsible for supervision of numerous United Parcel Service personnel in the Dulles Virginia warehouse facility. Conduct extensive training for assigned personnel, including all the assigned day-to-day business operations as well as handle logistics for employees. Maintain an extremely effective quality control and safety standards program for audit purposes. Handle high stress logistical support for management team insuring an effective, efficient and safe work environment."
bad,"Not a happy company to work for, it is a big game of politics. Upper management lacks integrity and morals. Would not suggest, this is indeed very ghetto."
bad,The benefits and pay are not what they appear to be when you are hired. They have supervisors and managers running payroll instead of a payroll department and they mess up our pay most of the time.
bad,Miserable place to be supervisors harass you work is flat out just hard and miserable to do been almost a year feel like my back been stomped out multiple times don’t appreciate anything you do everything is about numbers do not recommend unless you are overweight and want an excersise program
bad,Just the management was awful but great place to work to provide for your family got along great with supervisors and made new friends but I say again when the person running the building was not a good person to work with
bad,The only thing that was good about the job is just the benefits. They will tell you one thing and then you won’t even get what they say. Then the hours was not that good.
bad,"I did everything at UPS from loading trucks, fueling trucks, air-package delivery, and route-assigned delivery.  I did not enjoy any of it, nor the working environment at UPS."
bad,"Signed up for Christmas from the prenatal unit at the hospital."
bad,"The typical work day at UPS, would consist of coming in a few minutes earlier than your set time, you have to go through security, and once you get to your assigned department you have to stretch and the supervisors begin to explain your job for your time there for the day."
bad,"Job could be a lot better if they was organized,honest, and respectful only thing good is being a driver pays a lot more like 22 an hour other then that don’t work here"
bad,"So in mid-late 2019, I applied for a full-time center associate job at the UPS Store on Indeed, and they never respond months after submitting my application. I had to call the store directly, and was met with a very nice worker who instructed me to send my resume through the store's email. I do so, and I was to have the store's supervisor call me to discuss my resume and possibilities of employment (basically, it was a phone interview.). I was scheduled for a two-day trial basis, paid-training included, and was then told that I would hear from the UPS Store within the time frame of the weekend or the following week. I wouldn't hear from the supervisor, regarding my schedule, until two weeks."
bad,"No background checks, No drug testing. Individuals be smoking marijuana, and drinking on their breaks. Plus stealing others lunch and customers merchandise. Leads are very ignorant! They take their own breaks whenever they want. You only get one 30 min break after 8.5 hours or more. And the staff always screaming ""Let's Go"" to all individuals to speed up the work load."
bad,The job as a loader is way too much too hard too many things to load per person and the amount of pay that they are offering to give you needs  to go up at least three to four dollars in the amount of work they try to load all on you all at one time you should go down
bad,Under Payed Slaves. You Have To Do 8 Hours Of Work In 4 Hour Or Less Everyday Repeatably Lifting Boxes Takes A Toll On Your Body Started Having Serious Back Problems After Working At The Facility On Canal Place In The Bronx Once I Told Them I Could Only Sort I Couldn’t Unload They Let Me Go Talking About They Had To Do A Safety Meeting During The Meeting Once They Realized I Followed Protical They Said They Smelled Weed And Made Resign Union Didn’t Back Me Up
bad,"Bad company for work, stressful, very bad magnament, just liar at the interview long days working never appreciate your job just complain they have for you nothing else"
bad,Ups is a good company to work for just dont pay enough.'ompany is falling apart because from management to the people on the floor have no clue whats going on .
bad,They only need you part time and for peak sesson after that its over. I was working very hard everyday early at the end of it all I got fired for something that wasn't my fault i feel like because they felt I was expendable the experience was one of my worst.
bad,"Only 3 hours max & they expect a lot out of you, the pay rate is not worth the work you do in the warehouse, & they take advantage of you & how good you work for them"
bad,None nothing to speak on concerning this job there s nothing I could say about this employer accept the pay is not good the part-time work is not worth the drive
bad,"The management here is very 1970's; all women supervisors are doing office work while all male supervisors are doing manual labor. I've worked there for 3 years and have always continued to prove myself and I have very little to show for it. Give 110%? Then be expect to constantly give 150% and be harassed when you don't. Hours are okay, but they used to be a lot better. They recently gave raises to employees and supervisors, then immediately cut back the hours."
bad,"The work wasn’t hard and the pay was amazing. However, I didn’t get to work for 5 business days and when I told my manager I needed more hours I got fired. Don’t come here if you plan on standing up for yourself or expect hours."
bad,The place is really high schoolish the supervisors allow their personal issues with you too cloud they judgment. The place is really sexist.If you are a person who wants to work and go home you will soon be getting fired because you're not allowing your boss to fraternize with you on a more personal level. You would get scrutinize for not being as friendly as the other females so your check  and hour will always be shorter than others. This is just my experience So I  Never compromise my integrity for paycheck
bad,"This was the worst job ever,things were not faif at all but a seasonal job is a seasonal job.....do better ups.... nothing else to say..no comment...."
bad,I would never recommend Ups for a job. They never have enough workers to have a smooth day. They do have school benefits that i use so thats the only thing that i like.
bad,Listen.. This place will work you like a slave they dont care about any of your personal issue like they lie about during training.. Supervisor are trash you load boxes in at least 2 trucks a day the worst part is they shed hours.
bad,First of all If your considering applying for UPS you better have someone you know working there that is already upper management that can pull your application & basically get you past the interview part & in the door; if not you looking at a lot of sleep-ness nights/super early mornings considering they will not inform you prior to coming in that it is a strictly manual LABOR job. They(lower management)will literally have you showing up to the facilities hours prior to the time they are actually ready to come & get you from whatever harsh weather conditions you & the rest of the future employees are facing outside(as an consideration of future employment).
bad,"If you want to make money you need to be a driver. They get $38 an hour after 5 years. It takes years to get a driver position. You may drive once in a great while but most of the time you will be working at the most 4 hours per day at $14/ hour loading and unloading trucks. In the summer you will drink more than a gallon or two of water. You sweat so much because of the heat. You will have to move at super speed to keep up! That is if you even work at all because the regular warehouse workers get the hours first so you may not work more than 4 hours a week or none at all! You have to be on call so you can't have another job because you have to drop everything and go in when they want! "
bad,Not enough hours little pay for the work just all around worse job iv ever had never let me take time off and took 4 years to become full time bad vibes all around
bad,Terrible company to work for. First the whole Sinyard he transferred to another facility has got to go. My Father is ill. I’ve tried & tried to get transferred in my state. There’s a grievance transfer I can take up to 4 to 6 months to go through. And this company does not care about you or your family.
bad,"I was raised on the mantra of if you have nothing nice to say don't say it, so all I will say I enjoyed the company of my coworkers. Management, not so much. That's it."
bad,"Ups is basically slave labor for about $180 a week, you will work very very hard until you feel you cant work anymore and then your paycheck will be terrible"
bad,I had an horrible time at ups they messed up on my social security number so I couldn't get paid for almost a month on top of that pay sucked worked for 89.26 a week not comparing to the labor and hardworking we put into it for that type of pay it was an terrible experience
bad,The only good thing about being a package handler was the chance to advance to become a driver (if that is what you are looking for). Drivers make excellent pay w/ benefits.
bad,Je suis déterminé à atteindre les objectifs de la société
bad,"cant get promoted, lied to, told will get fulltime when they have no plans on making you fulltime,  work you to the bone with no reward, given false promises"
bad,Start time is usually at 4am but changes. You work on a belt and your assigned 3 trucks to load. Each truck will have a paper attached with details about the load for each truck. Packages range from 1 pound up to a 100 pounds to load. The task is simple if everyone is doing their jobs right then it become a nice flow and there isn't ever a build up. I left due to management and the bad culture at UPS. The hourly wage has to be way more to be able to put up with everything bad about the company. Great benefits available after probation period but that is the only good part. Some drivers don't show any respect to management or package handlers. It seems like if your with the company for years then that person has more seniority over some managers which I didn't like  because when a driver would say something directly towards an individual that I didn't think is right I felt like I couldn't go to management because of the driver seniority in the company. I even seen some drivers speak to management in a unprofessional way. That kind of behavior towards a manager would of gotten the driver terminated but that didn't happen due to seniority. Out of my ten years working I never disliked a job but this was the first job I didn't want to go back to.
bad,"Its just not worth it. its not."
bad,"I am unsure what their expectations are as it seemed most the time that the quotas they looked to meet were unrealistic. Due to the constant badgering of ""managers"" (unsure if this is the title) mistakes happened frequently. Customers packages were forced to be given little care in the aim of speed. I also watched a fellow employee fall through the loading dock because the truck was not properly parked. I was horrified but it didn't even phase the coworkers who were ""veterans."""
bad,Wahr Da als Fahrer für meine Tour in Meisenheim Tätig
bad,"Used to be a great place to work for up untill 2017. "
bad,"Avoid at all costs. The pay is not enough for the work and inconvenient hours they ask you to work. Expect us to load cross country trailers in heat warnings with no fans to help cool you down, nowhere to keep your lunch cold, nothing is handed out - water, freezies. If you want to spend your break in A/C, good chance you have to walk 5 minutes to and from the break room in your 15 minute break. UNION DOES NOT SUPPORT ITS WORKERS. The managers are so forgetful, I had to remind one 4 times about certain paperwork that I was supposed to receive. Discrimination, Racism, Favoritism, Abuse, and unsafe work habits can all be found here."
bad,"I was hired for a full time position, however...I was lucky to drive two days a week! You are given the option to work in the hub (busting your azz) on the days you don't get called in to drive. You're pushed through 5 days of training (if you want to call it that) when it should definitely be at least 10 days long! This is just mentioning a few examples of why I left this company as fast as I got hired "
bad,"It's unfortunate the people who run the company give it such a bad name. My personal experience was a nightmare. Employees would come in when they felt like, or not at all and as a supervisor, your management would tell you not to bother writing them up because the union would cover them and they'd never be reprimanded. This makes it incredibly difficult to maintain production. "
bad,"you will practically be giving them your back, for 13 dollars an hour. which doesn’t sound that bad. but the bad part was that they told me and many other employees that we would be working 12-4 and it wouldn’t change! i was there for about 7 months. i worked the full hours maybe 2-4 times. with checks that were between 120-180. a week. the pay is definitely not worth the work especially work in the summer.  the semis get hotter than all get out, yes you get a “paid lunch” you have a 10 minute paid break. which is always more around 6-8 minutes. but now my supervisor, he was one of the coolest supervisors that i have ever had! and my team was great. we all helped each-other whenever we saw someone struggling. insurance doesn’t kick in until 9 months of working with them. so the people that i had working with weren’t that bad. but overall the job it’s self isn’t something i recommend at all."
bad,"go go go and when the supervisors fail to make production its your fault. supervisors will regularly make assumptions based on no facts, common sense, or logic and then scold you for whatever imagination they come up with. i got hurt once and they asked me ""how is this your fault"" verbatim. union will make it hard to fire you but will do little else. this is all based on part time building worker of 12 years."
bad,The supervisor  are incompetent fools the place sucks it’s always hot work nights there are only 1.5 hours even though they say you can work 3-5 hours which rarely happens
bad,The benefits were decent at this job however I cannot say the same for the work experience. They could use a bit more improvement in a plethora of areas.
bad,"You have to be in shape while working at ups an healthy. Stretch before you start your work , eat a light meal , and your work success will be excellent"
bad,"Stacking boxes in truck trailers for 4-7 hours a day, with only one 10 minute break. Very hard work and will make some regret it when they are older (that’s if you work there long enough). In a single shift one might lift up to 500; 50 pound boxes from knee level. The conveyer will become backed up from the overflow of boxes and fall onto the floor inside the trailer. Blocking any walk paths inside the trailer causing you to trip over boxes. After clearing all the boxes on the floor you’ll be dripping sweat. But just be ready cause it will all happen again."
bad,"People are disrespectful. They promote from a college degree, not experience. no one cares what people do and no one is held accountable for their actions!"
bad,"The worst job I've ever had, in the winter you are better off working in Alaska! The Management is the worst ever! Don't believe the good things you hear about this company, and did l mention most of the drivers has had some kind of surgery on their knees, hips and back from lifting too much waight. Don't leave your job for this place it's horrible!"
bad,"I applied there in March to work on the ramp and very much enjoyed working out there. However, they made me work on the ballmat for most of the night every night instead of working on the ramp, which is what I applied for and was trained to do. Now I'm lucky to be out on the ramp for an hour a night. They took advantage of me and they'll probably do it to you too."
bad,"Working for UPS was a difficult job. The difficult part wasn't the work, it was the lack hours and of benefits. A typical day at work consisted of loading four trucks by address, until they were full and ready to hit the road. I enjoyed loading my trucks and listening to my music. You loaded your trucks next to others so sometimes the conversations could make your day. UPS wasn't all bad but its not anything I was interested in making a career out of."
bad,"UPS Package and Handler/ Ware house job, requires a lot of work for a little amount of pay. They make you work super hard for only $10/hr and they are not very understanding."
bad,"I was told I was the best unloader they had. One week which was my last week working in that area the manager decided not to put my hours in, so I didn't get paid. I had to go through a lot to get paid three weeks later. Others I know quit because they didn't get paid for any of the weeks they worked. UPS is slavery. I also was a truck driver and could not take breaks for the 10+hours work a day. I did training with a supervisor who got mad when I asked for a break. So I didn't get a break during training as a truck driver. The seniority drivers eat very poorly because of the set time UPS have for the deliverys and pickups to be done. One driver stated he only eats yogurt at work because he doesn't have time to eat a full meal. The drivers who do take an hour lunch break do not get to take their two 15 minute lunch breaks, especially around the holidays."
bad,Everyone Was Young and respectful. Typical day at work was fun quite and expectations was hard work  overloaded Trucks and more. I Learned How To maintain work in small Space Within a time limit. Management Was Okay They Helped Out a lot. Workplace culture is industrial. Hardest part was unloading long trucks With The Heaviest Boxes. Most enjoyable about the job is working on and being Able To Commutate With Others .
bad,"I was one of the first employees to start in Lyndhurst UPS. This job included fast paced workers which was easy for me but not for many. So this alluded in a on and off pace which made it longer for one to finish the job. If you meet a guy named Pozy inside, he was a great leader, understand that he was the only man who showed fairness and the only reason I stayed longer."
bad,I don’t Recommend no one this job. They want you to work in a very fast paced. And the break is only 10 minutes and the supervisors are sucks they don’t do they work
bad,"My driver lied and said he was changing route, I ended up unemployed while they searched for another driver. It was also a hasstle to meet with driver, they text you 1 hr before to tell you that you work on that day giving you no time to dress and take bus to meet driver."
bad,As a package handler this company is not good to work for as the job is very difficult with very low pay. They do however have a path for growth if you can handle the extreme volume of packages.
bad,"At this current time (June 2019), UPS is the worst company to work for. The supervisors do not care about you getting the hours your are guaranteed, they don't care about you not receiving help, they tell employees to stay home so the supervisors can work in their spot and they don't care about morale at all. One thing I did learn from being here is the ability to stand up for myself and for those with no voice. I was literally pushed to that point. Speaking up did make a momentary change but things slowly reverted back. Please don't do it to yourself. If anyone offered you a job there, do me a favor and slap them and then decline."
bad,Antiquated notions of leadership and management that will inevitably lead to the downfall of the company are rife. An incredibly ignorant and outdated culture that is out of touch with the current time in which they operate and function and it shows in their treatment of employees.
bad,A typical day is frustrating and stressful. I have learned how different people can be. No comment on the management. The workplace culture is peculiar. The hardest part of the job is most of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is being left alone sometimes.
bad,UPS helped give me my confidence and structure that I carry around today. They have helped in my leadership skills and has shaped me encouraging leader.
bad,Requires alot of walking and alot of moving around. No set time to get off and your time dont start until you scan your first package. Nott hard work but they dont do right with the paychecks.
bad,"The job at UPS is very stress inducing, but the money's good. If you wanna be a package handler, you need high endurance and high strength because they'll demand that you load 300 boxes every hour. you also need to be careful where you load the boxes, because if you place it incorrectly, it could break or fall on you; both of which would be considered your fault. there's no air conditioning, so bring you're own water if you don't wanna pass out. ONLY TAKE THIS JOB IF YOUR DESPERATE FOR MONEY OR VERY PHYSICALLY ADEPT."
bad,Worked here two days. Wasn’t for me. Kind of unprofessional site. Have to type in your own hours and mentally memorize everything they have you do that day. Worked 14.3 hours got paid for 6
bad,Ups is very off putting and unorganized. They don't care about their employees or what's going I in their personal life. They do not communicate well with each other and their employees and I have never worked somewhere w such a big name yet so unprofessional.
bad,UPS had to be one of the worst jobs i ever worked in. The conditions to work in sucked and the hourly pay wasn't that great either. I am glad to be out of there
bad,"More benefit of traveling learning from the locations on new techniques UPS follows and promotes. More supervisory respect given to p/t supervisors no matter age. District managers should stand behind their supervisors more instead of worry about their own jobs.More classes of advancement and education should be provided and encouraged to take no matter age."
bad,i hated ups too. it was way too stressful and you had to get a certain amount done by a certain time. the job was very difficult and physical demanding. most def. not the job for me.
bad,"Not a good place to work, focus is no longer on quality but on how little they can invest to get the job done. It's been a systematic failure to uphold the original core principles that once made ups a great company."
bad,"horrible management. no communication. everyone is not treated equally. when stepping into a supervisor role, you are not trained properly. 6 months later i am still learning  thing that should have been taught in the beginning."
bad,"Really not a great place to work, between the poor management, treating employees like trash, and over all terrible experience. If you want a workout it is good, and will keep you in good shape, but overall as a quality job it heavily is not good"
bad,"I have never been so disrespected in my life by people who work there. They talk behind your back, they constantly yell at you even if they know your a good worker and on time, they make up bullcrap excuses for many reasons, and their attitude is just downright negative.. I won't recommend this job at all to anyone who is looking for one. Because I will be saving you the trouble of dealing with such petty behavior of people who call themselves ""management"""
bad,"Worked there for a little over 3 years. AMAZING benefits after 1 year of working there. no dress code which is nice. the company itself is 'okay' but you don't get paid right for the amount of work you do. if you want to actually get paid right for the amount of work you do, you have to be there for at least 3years or more to like the job. yes you get a raise every year, and yes you have the benefits after a year, but if you are relying on this job for your only income, I suggest you look for a 2nd job. its part time job, 20-25hours a week.  its hard to get Overtime on a part time job. if your going to school or in high school or if this job is just a side job temporary, id go for it. but if you honestly like HARD work, and you love to sweat and you want to be 27-28 with a bad back, be my guest. I started when I was 19 and I tried to stick it out for 3-4 years but It was my only income so I left for another & better career field. its very hard to move up in the company. there isn't really a ""promotion"" just a pat on the back and told good job. some people don't work as hard as others and no one does anything about it. If I ever go back to work for this company again, id just do it for the extra cash. and If they don't like my hard work ethic then I wont bust my butt for them anymore."
bad,supervisors are poorly treated. Union ruins the chance of production expectations that need to be met. Supervisors are expected to adhere to union rules and still be productive in their operation... almost impossible.
bad,"Ups is a good place to work at if you need money quickly, but I don’t recommend working there. They try to get away with as much illegal stuff as they can. They don’t give regular breaks, or lunches, so working there I was really tired most of the time. The management is horrible and not organized at all."
bad,"The worse job ever I wouldn't never go bck there unless that's my final discussion, there under, unfit to supervise, half the supervisor need retraining, they will tell you that they will give u a raise but they don't. Also you basically training your self because when you get out on the bullfrog it a lot of stuff they don't tell you."
bad,Hey this might actually be a good job if anybody would call and have me come in.  During orientation they said work would be non-stop and overtime might even be a possibility.  Nope.  I can't get them to call me back.
bad,"Definitely felt I was not given a chance. I had 1 week of class, passed the tests, given uniforms, purchased new shoes and worked roughly 3 days. Did not hear from them for a week so I called and was called back several hours later and was told I was disqualified because I was to slow. I don't feel the road training was adequate nor do I feel I was given the opportunity to learn the route or the Diad. Very disappointing to say the least."
bad,"Ups in Memphis,Tn is the worst place to work. Lack of hours & pay. 10 min lunch break but only receive about 5-6 min max."
bad,"no work , slow paced , not enough pay i wouldnt recomend ayone to the company it was a horrible experience no no no never again do not apply not good job"
bad,"Sweat mill, where you are irrelevant and replaceable. They push you to continually, non-stop, work at an extremely fast pace. They hardly pay me enough for my car payment and gas, and I don't pay rent or spend any money on food."
bad,UPS doesn't seem to care about the health or safety of it's employees very much but stresses production at all costs. UPS won't invest in air conditioning for it's trucks or the inside of it's hubs and the hot seasons are extremely difficult and have even been fatal for some people.
bad,Will not recommend very stressful  show favoritetism towards certain dockworkers supervisor doesn't know what they are doing half of the time you get blamed for some one else's work that's not done right
bad,it gets really hot in the summer time. very physical $15.00 an hour is not  bad if you're full time but noooo it's a part time job and you go there for three sometimes 4 hours a day you an work doubles and get over time though.
bad,I worked there for 1 month it took them 3 weeks to pay me and its a weekly job. then hours that i worked were taking because of red flags. I worked 50 hours the second week but only received 45 once again they say it will raise red flags.
bad,My typical time at UPS consisted of standing at a conveyor belt and moving packages into position to be distributed and mailed to customers. The work involved was exhausting and the hours were not fair or reasonable.
bad,The pay is terrible. Management is terrible. An the amount of work they expect you to do for the pay is even worse. Only thing good about the job is benefits but you don’t even get that until going through a year of slavery. Don’t work here.
bad,boring as ever dont do it to yourself. They say one thing but then do the complete opposite. Summer time it feels like Africa in them truck and in the sort aisle.
bad,"Fedex freight was an alright place to work. I would recommend it to someone who needs a flexible schedule. If you are not experience, you will be trained."
bad,"Never work at Ups in Horsham PA. When the salary was supposed to increase, they forgot to change mine and never changed it so I was cheated out of money. Also, I had a work related injury which UPS refused to acknowledge. Instead, I was sent home every single day for almost two weeks straight because my new location was fully staffed, until I decided it was time to either quit or be fired!"
bad,"The pay is ridiculously low in relation to the intensive labor, cognitive thinking, poor hours, and stress one would deal with daily. Management isn't helpful and is very unorganized."
bad,I worked for ups for two months I got injured in the job then they fired me I still have not paid me my last check there staff harassed me  the made me work over the time I was supposed to get off work
bad,"this place is too work driven everybody has to work like robots."
bad,"supervisors would not help you if you did not get paid correctly."
bad,"Every day is generally the same, but ensuring the job is done most efficiently is ignored. There is a lack of organization, regard for safety, and accountability. Management falls into an old-school mentality, that encourages the acceleration of production with little regard to safety. They mostly choose to lie to themselves about the effectiveness of the Wellness program. If they perform audits to track the progress and effectiveness of their Wellness program, they are surely lying to themselves, and their superiors. The implementation of a program does not prove to be effective without appropriate feedback tools."
bad,"UPS was a good job, good pay and benefits. The work was not.  The environment was such that you got made fun of until you either quit or did your job.  They only reason I went there was to pay for school."
bad,It was constant chaos because the managers had no idea what they were doing and only got the job because they would follow orders from higher up without question. Terrible job.
bad,"UPS pulls a bait and switch on ever new hire. They mostly post jobs for Deliver driver, and Deliver driver helper because those positions pay between $24 and $32 an hour and you don't need a CDL. They tell you to put your name on a list to attend the driving class and when you pass you become a driver. "
bad,It was temporary..seasonal...I worked..never called off...never no showed...stayed when needed or asked...was let go rather than kept on..it happens..no harm no foul at THAT point...but to get message when apply ..that due to having work here previous I am NOT eligible?
bad,Loaded and unloaded truck trailers for several hours each morning and was occasionally pulled off to do package sorting.  Facilities are dirty and generally unpleasant to work in.  Was often sent home after less than an hour if the number of packages was too low.
bad,The typical day at ups would just be unloading trucks and scanning each package so the mail tracker would be up to date for customers shipping a package
bad,Everyday I would go clock in and just start shuttling boxes around. There's really not much to it. The best part is you can put on your headphones and get to it.
bad,"I enjoy working at UPS the work was something i had to get use to otherwise it was a good experience for me i would have wanted to work there  "
bad,What do during the Christmas seasons as a driver helper assisting the driver deliver Christmas packages driver made several return stops to the same home once he found packages on the truck which was very disorganized one package was delivered I'd return to the truck driver will pull off not allowing me to sit securely in the seat while the door was still open
bad,"The typical day at UPS involves: passing thru security checkpoints to ensure employee safety, followed by a brief team meeting and stretching. the remainder of the day consists of sorting packages and loading onto proper delivery trucks in a safe and efficient manor."
bad,"unloader job was ok it was freezing in Michigan in the middle of the winter, the loader job was pure torture that I would not wish on the worst of my enemies."
bad,It was a very hard and stressful job but it helped me become more patient and how to deal with rude people..............................................
bad,"not enough hours, yes pay was 10.15 but when you only work 3 hours a day that isn't anything. laziness, extreme laziness by the higher ups. One good thing though is the supervisors are understanding of school and working around that schedule but besides that nothing good"
bad,Since UPS took over Overnite Transportation it has been nothing but a disaster.  UPS does not care about it's employees and to them you are just another number.
bad,Very poor management skills. Very rude to employees. But the have great benefits if you can make if long enough to get them which they say is a year but honestly they dont kick in till a year and four weeks.
bad,"The job requirements consists of handling packages up to 150 pounds, and loading them into the vehicles.  Each pre loader has three cars that we load in a 5 hour span.  Some cars can have up to 400 packages, others as less has 150.  The job is fast pace, must have good endurance, and follow instructions."
bad,"A typical day is fast paced and  continuously changing.  I learned a great deal more regarding my craft and grew professionally nearly every day.  Working in management is not for the faint of heart at UPS; we looked to grow at every opportunity.  It was a very dynamic environment to work in, and we were rewarded accordingly."
bad,"Working at UPS is like running on a conveyor belt.(no pun intended). There is not room for growth past part time supervisor. The Glass Ceiling is very thick, pretty much bulletproof"
bad,"loading a eighteen wheeler for five hours. most of the time by myself. have to work for a year part time before you earn sick or pto for a hard job like loader i believe was unreasonable, but they tell you that up front"
bad,horrible place to work not enough hours overworking no flexibility cant  pay regular house hold bills with this job never working here might aswell work at mcdonalds
bad,The hours are short but the work can be taxing if you work at this place during peak season be prepared to bust your butt the only part that kinda sucks is not knowing when you work next some mornings I had to wake up to just maybe get called in.
bad,UPS is the place where a student can get some relief on his/her tuition but that is where the pros of working at ups start and end. 17 hours or intense physical labor for pennies. Another billion dollar company that pays its employees nothing.
bad,"Just because you get an interview and attend the oriantation, doesnt mean you have the job,well atleast the location i applied at.  At the end of the orientation"
bad,"I would come in on a daily bases, and speak to friends who I have meet and build good friendship. Me and the guys in my unit would huddle up, and the supervisor would give us our assigned trucks. Next we were grouped in pairs, and next after sent to our designated areas which varies by the day and hour. "
bad,chef et personnel pas du tout agreable je vous deconseil cet entreprise qui ma mis en fin de mission avec un menssonge a eviter
bad,Not enough people was coming to work so most of the work was put on me.The pay was ok and heavy boxes was a big problem for me too
bad,The UPS store was a great company to work for. You learned how to ship and pack items. great people!
bad,Move 10-100lbs. boxes from trucks to conveyor belts. Did not work here for long because of an unrelated work injury. the haredest part was dealing with the high temperatures in the trucks. Hardly ever spoke to co-workers because of the constant activity.
bad,"I applied for a job and thought I did great.  I was told that they would call me anyway if I got the job or not.  The website still shows that the job is open but after many calls I finally heard it was filled and I was not selected,  Still never heard anything,  Unprofessional for not getting back after an interview."
bad,"very bad mangement , long hours , bad co workers , no encouragment just constantly putting extra work on you"
bad,Not a fan of the way that they treat employees there. Not to mention 10.15 is under payment for the work load that consist of a normal day!
bad,"he day work fly by!! i loved the fast pace work, is was like working out in the gym kept me in great shape. if the company became more organized they was be an awsome place."
bad,fast paced environment where you utilize scanners to read the bar codes on packages that get read and then if they are the ones they get loaded onto the trailer trucks. very intensive work not for the weak.
bad,I worked here for years and I really did enjoy it. The staff was easy going and the position was very interesting. I was sadden by the closure of business.
bad,"After attending training for one week, staying at a motel, away from home, I have only worked a handful of hours...their practice is to over-hire, and if you are working when they finally call you in after 6-8 months of not working, look out- they are very upset if you aren't available."
bad,The health care at UPS is phenomenal and if you are a union employee the defined pension plan is good. Other than that I can't say much else for them that is positive.
bad,The atmosphere was oppressive and miserable within the distribution center. It seemed like management was miserable and it trickled down to the employees. Pay wasn't the best but at least it provided steady hours.
bad,"management was way too strict, and would look over your shoulder constantly. Management made working there horrible."
bad,"As always, at first, seems alright. Yet industry seems to be dying and no one is interested in being professional unless they have to when the managers arrive."
bad,working at UPS is fun . all co workers get along with each other and work as a team. management is good . the salary is not so good
bad,The company took care of their workers. They paid the insurance for the part time workers. They also gave vacation time and sick leave.
bad,A typical day at work was very fast beat and paced. My coworker was very dependable and we had our jobs done in a timely manner. The hardest part about the job was the pay and the lack of hours. I enjoyed management and the team work efforts.
bad,"I work there at night Shift from 11:15 to 4:00 in the morning."
bad,I did not enjoy showing up to work each day. I was surrounded by people who genuinely had nothing but negative things to say about not only this company but this specific facility and it's management as well.
bad,"A typical day at work was my first night of reporting to work.  It was my first day to work at night in my whole entire life, I felt sleepy,tied and missed very much for my bed including the children. Gradually I learned to stay awake and began to focus, performed duties well and ended up working at UPS for 9 years until most of employees were laid off including myself.  I managed and organized employee relationship meetings in order to improve occupational Health and safety problems and other related work duties. I communicated well with my co-workers and worked as team in order to achieve future goals for the organization.  The hardest part of the job was when economy was beginning to decline, less productions or percales were received and obviously we knew that soon or later, UPS will eliminate some of full time employees in order to avoid expenses and benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was that every Christmas, UPS provided huge turkeys and bonuses (money) to all employees, and every month employees who had high productions were receiving gift vouchers for gas, movies or supermarket food"
bad,general warehouse work. good pay. bad co workers. mean bosses. always trying to fire you even when you are doing your job the right way because you are never fast enough
bad,"Load and unload trucks, sort material, process irregular packages (anything over 70 pounds), I learned how to work in a fast paced environment with other workers.  Enjoyed working with the management and co-workers.   The most enjoyable part was the hours and benefits."
bad,"Ive work threw any weather [Snow, Rain, windy, freezing weather].I learned that I cant just leave these valuable packages anywhere. My co-worker was very friendly and straight forward, he is a great worker. The hardest part of the job is delivering at night where you can barely see the addresses to people house but it still was an exciting job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people knowing the environment.Also getting the job done."
bad,"I only worked at UPS for a little while before I was hired at NIC, but while I worked there it was not a good place to work. The hours were odd and the people were inexperienced."
bad,"EAdgear,com was shut down shortly after my resignation because of a lawsuit for malpractice and illegal activities."
bad,"The only saving grace working for UPS was the camaraderie of the Inside Sales group that I was training with.  The work atmosphere was strict and unyielding.  You have to be at your desk at all times.  They actually had a ""fashion police"" that would observe what you were wearing that day.  You had to take your breaks at a certain time otherwise you wouldn't get one.  The measurements by which you were being monitored set the employees up for failure.  And the actual sales job was different than what was described.  They promised no cold calls and that you would be assigned a territory.  All you did all day was make cold calls to either former UPS clients or current clients where their sales were falling.  You were trained to practically threaten the client to get their business."
bad,"disrespectful people, talk to you anyway they feel like. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody."
bad,"Questionable compensation and promotional practices as it pertains to race, not productivity and ability."
bad,"Good company to work to."
bad,i was really young one of my first jobs just so excited to get away from fast food
bad,"My typical day at work: I will pre-trip tractor and trailers at 8pm and leave the yard by 8:15pm and be in Philadelphia by 2:30am.I will leave Philadelphia between 3:30 and 4am, be back to Albany between 7:30 and 8am Monday thru Friday. The company has a good Dock Supervisor and  also a good dispatcher. Some co-workers I will see once or twice a week because they ran different routs or came in different times or back home every other day but made it to and from their destination on time. The hardest part of the job is driving in the winter on ice and snow. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyone getting along and getting back home safely. The one I learned the most is safety."
bad,"O serviço era bem legal de fazer, a unica parte chata era apenas a parte do sócio da empresa, pois o mesmo não sabia falar com voçê"
bad,"I try to quit this UPS company "
bad,"My Typical day involves setting things up ready for the start of the shift, looking at reports from previous day, setting scanners and trailers up. meetings with management to discuss previous day, any problems / issues. training of any new starters. after the shift is over I run reports send lock down report of the building."
bad,is a good place to work i do feel when i worked there i wasnt properly trained enough to do the job
bad,"Very strict place to work. No help when needed to ""pass calls"". Given 4 months worth of info in 2 weeks"
bad,"good busy company, set up work area, start key entry until cut off point, collect invoices"
bad,UPS was a great company to work for however politics often got in the way a lot of the times. For example favoritism.
bad,A typical day consist of preparing dough and pizzas. Must be able to have good time management skills so that buffet bar will consistently be filled.
bad,This work enviroment was very calm and straight to the point. Do your job and get credit for what you do. Co workers became family
bad,"Lack of hours was the worst. I never knew when I was coming or going and would sometimes be waiting for hours just to start my shift, almost never started work on time. Didn't pay me enough to deal with them"
bad,I was not properly trained and often left alone in the store to compete transactions and provide other tasks that I was not prepared for.
bad,"typical day at work consists of loading packages into trailer.Learned how to work as team to get the job done.Management is cool. Wonderful co workers,very friendly. the hardest part of my job would be when there are a lot of packages and im loading by my self things can get hectic and sometimes I am undert pressure to get the job done.the most enjoyable part of my job woud have to be my fifteen minute break it gives me time to relax and get my self together."
bad,A typical day working at ups. Is a short 3 hr day thats full of hard work lifting and moving of boxes. The hardest part of the job is moving (bulk)..Bulk material is extremely heavy packages weighing about 75 to 120 lbs. ...On the other hand co workers are nice and polite we help each other when in need of a hand....The management is ok .But sometimes bad no respect for employees....And there are no enjoyable parts to this job ..Hard work .
bad,The position I currently hold is boring and has no challenges for me.
bad,I only worked here for one month. It was a seasonal job during the holiday season. It pretty much sucked.
bad,"I was expecting to work at least three days per week, but I only worked one day on November 16, 2011, from October to December of 2011, due to being an on-call temporary job. I made sure I was up at about 7:00 a.m. every morning, but I only received one call to go into work on November 16, 2011. The HR Manager said it was a job for people who don't need a job, and for people who are looking to make extra money for the holiday season. Positions are only available around winter holiday season, once a year. One has to work about eight to ten years at UPS before they can be promoted to Driver, so job advancement isn't very fast. They had problems with the payroll department, so I got my check for my training orientation two weeks late, and it was mailed to me by UPS, and I only made $21.39 for the one day I worked, because there was a $32.00 Union Due taken out, which I wasn't expecting. I was paid $12.88 per hour."
bad,Working for ups is a very fun and fast past.  It requires a lot of heavy lifting and a keen attention to details to ensure packages are sorted properly.  It is in a non climate controlled environment which also produces an additional challenge
bad,"My manager there was really mean and horrible, she yelled at me all the time and told me to ignore certain safety procedures. They gave me really bad hours and even though I worked hard no one valued me. Some days I barely worked 3 hours even though its supost to be 3-5 and an hour driver there and back.  They also seemed to favor certain traits in a person/race/age.  They pay good and if your a student there are lots of good benefits and while i was there i got a weekly bonus for being there everyday. Other than that though I wouldn't recommend working there"
bad,Its a fair working place with zero growing opportunity. You cannot really expect to get to the next level as there is no such thing. You really have to consider and find out whether you want see yourself in the same position where you started.
bad,It’s a great job to have that can give you a lot of confidence if done right. Can teach you to become very independent. Need to know right from wrong and how to stand up for yourself. Also need to be able to take orders even if you don’t agree with them. Listen to your management closely and you can learn a lot.
bad,not fit and quick on your feet then this job is not for you. gotta get the the job very early in order to get a locker for your stuff. cant take anything pass the guard shack
bad,This job was definitely one to make you love the fact that your going to school. It was fun and we always got the job done but it was such a small facility for how many packages they had coming through the belts would constantly jam up. They also only paid $10 and it is about -15 in the winter time in the shop unloading trucks.
bad,"Supervisors push you to work at your limit. Can be fun if you like competition for unloading, not very hard work but extremly fast paced and repetitive."
bad,At UPS it is very fast paced the people that work there are great you have to be very hard working and reliable to work there over all its a good place to work but you are extremely under valued as an employee and they will do anything to cut hours or save money
bad,The job was a fast pace environment with constantly doing the same moment to move boxes.There only to shift for box handler really early in the more of the afternoo
bad,"Productive and nice place to work, relaxing atmosphere and excellent management or leadership. I love the people also. they provide a lot  of free meals which were excellent. the hardest part of the job is having to deal with uncooperative people who are the carriers they sometimes make your job harder."
bad,I was there a short time long time ago. And it was a job to get through school. Was very helpful to me with the Scheduling.  You waited on customers and sent package's out
bad,"Pick up heavy packages."
bad,"Serious Issues with labor and Management.... The job alone is a challange with weather, traffic and customers...Being ""Over Managed"" can be very stressful.."
bad,"UPS has a motivating atmosphere and one can work with some energetic coworkers and professional managment. They offer benefits for employees who go to school and work at the same time. In general I could say I am learning how to develop hard working culture, which is valuable. "
bad,"a very fast paced and demanding job, that requires you to be in good shape."
bad,"The company doesn't appreciate their seasonal workers. It is very unorganized with no way to contact anybody but HR. Even then, you shouldn't hold your breath. Other than that if you can get through it theres a lot of opportunities to better your careeer."
bad,A day at work was always hard working. hot and sweaty. I enjoyed the work environment. I got along with everybody. But I thought it was too easy for me.
bad,"This is a warehouse job the most you will expect is to work very hard there is no fans on you or ventilation this is a work opportunity that means sweat, do not see this if you do not want to work it is a position based on necessity and the company has no need for those who do not want to work this is a no advancement if you do not work the lowest positions for a time theres no driver opportunity for anyone over the age of 20 this is not for anyone under the age of 20 either this is a osha mistake if you do not work here and have no benefits for less than 7 to 8 worldly years what can happen is injury because you will lift heavy equipment and the range can vary from very small and light to very large and heavy anything heavy requires two people but unfortunately time doesn't always permit so the correct thing to do is remove cargo for another team but this means time which is not there and this is mostly a holiday service position otherwise if you don't work the hours given you have no chance of advancing to the preferred position that pays a salary of $20 an hour which is a sign that this is also not enough the world will like honesty but your position starting is 9 an hour and your hours range from 9PM to 11PM the early you get there the more likely you will work from 8PM to 11PM students get the opportunity to work 7PM to 11PM but this fluctuates based on necessity so everyone starts at 7PM and this means you will not get a call because if you expect to speak to management you will find they are busy and to work here you have to intentionally seek it and that means finding"
bad,"It's a plantation, the area is fast paced. The managers are harsh, the work is constantly fast paced. It's hot, no breaks, no phones in buildings. They have no remorse or compassion for any of the new workers in the building."
bad,En los años que trabaje en upe vien asta que cerraron en vallecas y nos echaron a la calle a todos sin mirar los años de experiencia y trabajo para ups
bad,"they work you like a dog and pay you every little starting out. management was a joke, union reps were the worst. they do everything they can you keep you from taking a day off if your hurt."
bad,"Integrity, respectful and serious. Good benefit and compensation. Good educational training benefit. Good workforce and clean environment. WEill recomend"
bad,"In a small rural area, where I currently work, there is absolutely no room for advancement. Good pay, and benefits for a part-time job, however management is terrible. Cronyism is alive and well at my particular facility."
bad,hands on everything you go to places that you didn't even know they have stores for people be so happy to receive there packages they even tip you at times making you love your job more to see how happy you make them
bad,"UPS is a great place to work, with great benefits! Management could use a little help, but overall its a great company!"
bad,Pay is great during peak season. Anything over 5 hours in a day is overtime. Lot of money you can make during peak otherwise they like to send you home at 5 hours and the pay is only 14 an hour and it’s very hard physical work. Part time supervisors (most not all) are arrogant and treat you like your beneath them.
bad,"Fast paced work,  always on the move and being redirected to multiple places throughout the facility.  And backbreaking work  but I would say you get good pay."
bad,"The work is not the hard part, I loved the work & hours. It's the environment, management, coworkers that are horrible. I would never go back to the Suffolk location. Horrible experience that wasn't worth my time."
bad,"Not a fun job most the people are pretty quiet and keep to themselves, no one seems motivated or even content about being there, and the work is to hard for the pay"
bad,Company has good benefits but management wise is bad theres to much favoritism sometimes they will ignore your needs im still owed 2 paycheck from last week of feb and first week of march
bad,As many conpany ups has its up and downs as i started at 17 as an unloader. The very fast and physical job was a tough task. I then became a international clerk.
bad,I'm a hard work never late always on time and ready to work um I lift for height boxes from the truck and I will deliver them to people house I work in queen
bad,Didn't like the one in chalk hill manager was rude poor training and what you get hired for you don't do it or you'll be working multiple other positions which you would need training in 12
bad,"While  working for UPS I able to  utilize  my  computer  skills.I  was  chosen to work many of  different  Beta  Technical Support helpdesk I enjoyed the opportunity. I also  submited a proposal of  my  ideas for training  to  upper mangement to which  they  agreeded  to.I was also  apart of the safety commitee, I enjoyed the opportunities that  UPS teleservices provided me"
bad,20 hours a week not much pay but they pay for college. Some nice people but not too many
bad,They are all nice just needs to work on communication. Also needs to work on treating everyone equal. Cause they show favoritism to the people that been there longer
bad,Ups is a good second job to have u don't make much and It is a lot of constantly working u get no break but the benefits are beautiful the worst thing I would say would be your co workers and their mixed attitudes
bad,its a hard labor type job but the benefits are really good. the longer you work there the better it gets as far as pay and hours. not a bad place to start off though.
bad,Only work here if you are looking for a work out during the busy season.  That's when its fast and you really get an amazing work out.  You well be sore for days and it well feel amazing.
bad,"I was a season driver helper for two years in a row and i loved it. I loved working with my drivers helping them to deliver to the customers who so anxiously awaited our arrival. It was very fun. My co-workers were interesting as well, learning about them and their lives and cultures. The most difficult part of the job is working in the cold weather conditions. you must bundle up but other than that, it was a very fun experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that i made someone happy by bringing them something as simple as a package."
bad,It’s a good place to work if you’re going to college and don’t mind working 4-5 hours a day/night and having your school paid for. Not that good if you’re looking for many hours
bad,Mangers are very unprofessional they gossip about people very loud and very disappointing coming from supose to be professional people I like ups as far as the benifits
bad,"This job is not for everyone, certainly not for me. You have to work in a trailer loading/unloading packages, and it gets very hot in the summer (up to 110 degrees). The intense heat along with the intense, fast-paced work will have you sweating heavily. It's very tough and you get exhausted easily."
bad,enjoyable place to work because of commitment to perfection from all employees
bad,I was very pleased working here. The staff and employees were very friendly and helpful I worked here for almost a year and never had a problem. I left this job because i wanted more hours but other than that it was great.
bad,"I worked here and I loved it the only issue was it was part time only or I would have stayed forever. I did all the processing of packages to go international so when the drivers came back he gave them to us and we made sure everything was correct like the paperwork,invoice,custom paper wtc"
bad,"As a supervisor, my responsibilities included supervising and managing employees, documenting time"
bad,I have been working there for almost 2 years and won’t get no benefits. They do not encourage you everyday. If you are injured or hurt they would not care.
bad,"If you are to work for a company that gives no respect, than this is the place for you. You pay is constantly being fiddled with and they will not reimburse you for their mistakes. You constantly have to watch your back with every detail. They do not care if you have a family, your job must be your life or they won’t want you. You work long hours and only work. If working 24/7 is for you, then this is perfect. Just be cautious. Nobody is on The pay may be consistent but the hours are not. There’s is no real management there. Overall the worst job i’ve ever had. your side."
bad,I worked there for almost a month and got fired because my manager was lousy and made a poor choice to have me do something that got him in trouble then his supervisors fired me cause he blamed it all on me to save himself
bad,I learned a lot working for UPS.  I liked the way that they were always preaching safety and conducting training courses to  make sure that you did just that.
bad,"Recommend for students in school looking for part time work. They have a student reimbursement program that helps pay up to 5k per year. Well worth it, the pay isnt bad either."
bad,"Zeker niet in adam nu Jon zegerius daar de leiding heeft. Die heeft het vak volgens mij in 1940-1945 geleerd, daar acteert hij wel naar."
bad,This job is very fast paced and very heavy lifting demanding. The chance for over time is of you pull double shifts. To get benefits you have to work alot of hours and maintain them or you dont receive them and or lose them if dont continue those hours. There is alot of favoritism there as well. The training isnt done very efficiently and the work you do is not appreciated nor enough.
bad,"Only good for seasonal work and if you have a record. Horrible work conditions, stressful work, and killer expectations. You will be ripped after working there, but your muscles are going to be too tired to flex."
bad,"The job is hard. Bad pay, horrible working conditions, bad management. 1 year required just to qualify for paid time off and health insurance. If you're in school, it's a decent job, because of the tuition assistance right off the bat, but as an hourly employee, it's not recommended for a career choice."
bad,they cut your hours and nickel and dime you to death . I had to run packages for three drivers and when I had to drive to next driver I had to sign out and drive 7 mins . this way ups does not have to pay you for a brake . same for your lunch . being a helper for 3 drivers I was just part time grunt even though they could not get bodys to fill other drivers helper
bad,the day manager c h a d walks around the building like hes hot sh** just looking for a reason to whine and if the loaders or unloaders arent working hard enough they take it out on the supervisors
bad,I only worked for the Holidays. It was easy. I worked on UPS truck delivery. It was a great experience. The people were friendly at UPS. I enjoyed it.
bad,"It lacks hr and the pay is bad i wouldnt recommend this this job to no one unless you need the benefits. "
bad,"The place is filthy, vacuuming done when people are working. Employees choke and cough all night after vacuuming.  Filters never cleaned out. "
bad,"I worked at UPS for 4 months.  My driver I worked with was great.  The company itself did not have clear rules that worked for driver and helper. For instance, lunch is whenever the driver takes lunch, and you had to pack a lunch or hope the driver takes lunch somewhere where a lunch can be purchased"
bad,This job was very stress full many of the management team did not earn there position it was givin to them either they knew someone or was kin to someone in the company so they moved faster than qualified people and it shows as there buiness has had many hiccups since 2013.
bad,United Parcel Services was a organization that was really difficult to work for because of the management and and employees that you worked with they made your job very difficult everyday you clocked in and your best was never good enough for them because they always put the pressure on the employees
bad,Worked here part time in college as a package handler and loading trailer trucks.  Work was had but the time passed quickly Management was very cut throat.
bad,They expect way too much for the amount you get paid plus the supervisors are unorganized and not very confident in their job. There's only ONE BUS that takes you to the area I work and it doesn't run on weekends.
bad,I only worked for UPS during the winter months due to black friday. It was the worst job ever. they didn't call me to work at all except for 2 to 4 days out of they entire time I was there.
bad,Not really my type of work there poorly managment and poor pay not fairly enough but less hours and not very supportive and called for help and never came
bad,"It was unorganized and some of the leads were unprofessional. During peak they made alot of people work up to 14 hours a day and 6 days a week. The bathroom was awful and they let any body work there ... so you can imagine what you could be made to deal with. Also you could not get lunch til the bug boss gave the ok, so you could work 6 hours straight before eating"
bad,working at ups was work work work no breaks your supervisor telling you to move fast they dont care about you they look at you like your not even a human
bad,"I felt that at this establishment I was treated unfairly and my voice was not heard. When given the appropriate notice, management did not adhere request."
bad,the  company changed through the years and became less a people company more of a company or interested in money.  This place worked you to lose your family and loved ones…
bad,were not treated like humans rather robots..no regards to my family life..health and well being..religious preference not respected..very stressful place and many hazards daily..
bad,The management at the location I worked at had no sense of direction. They pay was low and the quota they have you follow was ridiculous. I would not recommend.
bad,"My boss slowly began to target me out and begin to lower my hours to the point of 8.5 (if that) hours per week."
bad,"UPS is not an ideal job. They only hire incoming employees as seasonal, and once the three month period is over they throw you out like trash. I saw potential in this job, but lack of career advancement prevented me from moving forward with the company. Would I apply at UPS again? Probably. Would I be guaranteed a full time position? Probably not. As a father of two, I need something stable. UPS did not meet my expectations."
bad,"owner of this store is awful, he has no customer service skills, not professional with employees, no benefits, no lunch breaks, overall bad work place"
bad,"I wouldn't want anyone to ever have to make that into a career. I felt bad working there because some of the people were there for 18 years!! That's a long time to work somewhere as depressing as the UPS warehouse. The managers were not motivating, the employees weren't doing their best work because they were to busy trying to show up the managers. The culture was terrible."
bad,"Separating merchandise in the different areas of the warehouse , driving the forklift in the warehouse and filling the wagons. So it could be save for the long drive destination."
bad,"Come in at 12am immediately start working "
bad,The company on the inside is nothing like their exterior persona.  They are far from organzied and even father from productive.  The company facility I was employed at and the one I trained at were rife with examples of how hours were thrown at problems instead of training and processes.
bad,She wanted me to do my job and her job too.  She was hardly ever in the office and when she was she ate all the time all day. They cut my hours but hired a PT person. My check was messed up times since I had been working there. It was difficult especially when your not being paid on time.
bad,This company pays for collage but the money sucks and they take huge advantage of there workers. I hate working here but i have got use to it i need a better job that is less degrading and irritating even the bosses act like childish kids. I work 3rd shift and its draining me and taking over my life i need a day job that pays more ASAP
bad,"nver answer phones, d not now what they are doing , no one new what was going on , im certified and they had me working with people who do not now what they were doing ."
bad,"I personally would not refer anyone to this job. You work maybe 20 to 25 hours a week at a constant pace non stop and you may receive a break if you beg. The co-workers are great, management not so much. I literally had to work at least 12+ hours in different dept to make my hours and money. That's only if they give you the option to go to another dept after you finish processing. Processing only takes 2-5 hours sometimes less. When I applied for this job I was told that I had to be available Mon - Fri 6pm to 6am. Of course it did not work that way. My schedule was set for any day of the week including Sat and Sun."
bad,met with the driver at designated location and then helped deliver packages to the customers homes and or businesses throughout the shift..
bad,This company goes through employees like a truck driver goes through toilet paper at a truck stop restroom. This analogy is apt because UPS treats its employees like the c**p you leave in a toilet (disposable and with no respect). With also the mindset being that there is plenty more where that came from. They treat employees like they are a dime a dozen and therefore are not entitled to the least bit of respect. Nor would they give the employees benefits like medical health dental because they treat the employees like slave laborers. Work them till they drop and replace them. I am glad I don't work for them anymore. It is a lousy company to be employed by.
bad,Long hours little pay but if you need to survive you'll find the necessary components here to pay bills and live. learn something move on
bad,"Travail très dur mentalement, il faut arriver à gérer le stress qui va avec"
bad,all I can say is if you get hurt off the job you might as well look for another job if you take a day off cuz they will make you see your dr again and then theres and until you do so you cant work
bad,"As dockworker, the hours are limited and does not enough hours during the week to support a family."
bad,its a government job for ya they just rotate their employees out so they will not have to pay benefits went into work for a week and a half straight and i was getting sent home everyday only working 30 mins to an hour if that every day
bad,"Porém aprendemos muito com uma equipe muito pequena de quatro programadores cinco comigo porém como lider de equipe levantamentos de requisitos, analise, banco de dados, contato com usuário, para que a equipe pudesse estar livre para desenvolvimento"
bad,"Yes, I worked there for three seasons"
bad,working for ups proves to be challenging and time consuming for me..it also was like a waste of time because it take an hour to get to work and then they only let u work for about 3 hours...not good
bad,Sort out mailed boxes. I learned how to organize by postal zip codes. The hardest part was keeping track of what I was doing while my hands and eyes are in two different places doing two different things. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk with others on breaks.
bad,i worked there for around 6 months and all they wanted to do is play silly games.they care more about minority employees than they do about employees who bust but to get things done.
bad,"Underpaid overworked not appreciated and treated like a caged animal in a hkt warehouse closed up no ventilation no fans no a/C. Only 2, 10 min or less usually breaks. Cant leave property even for lunchtime."
bad,They work you like a horse. Give you the absolute minimum hours to complete your job. While all through the night you're being bombarded with packages. They donot supply you with the necessary tools to do your job efficiently.
bad,"Horrible place to work if you plan on going in to management. Unless you have a degree it won't matter how much experience you have to move up. No skills are taught to thier part time management beyond their daily job which is to basically keep you where you're at and the raises are pathetic for the billions of dollars the company makes. Unless you are hired on as a top level manager typically work out of Atlanta,  stay union. You will make a tone more money in the long run."
bad,"Hired on as a p.v.d took three weeks to work then next 2 were one day a week.total disorganization from management was promised a 500 bonus .yeah right.lost hours because there app was so full of bugs I guess I donatediwill never work for ups again"
bad,"Working for the UPS Store franchises can be a toss up pending on the area where the store is located. Area I worked at in Chicago was racist. A little advice do a little more homework on the demographics prior to working at these places. At the end of the day the owners have that ""the customers always right mentality"", even if they are COMPLETELY WRONG"
bad,"Job don't pay enough for the work performed, only part time hours, management and communication is extremely poor, no working heaters extremely cold warehouse"
bad,Upper management doesn’t care how hard you work to please everyone and they do not ever thank you. The VP doesn’t care about chain of command and lacks leadership.
bad,:Poor working environment. Staff welfare is non existence. Some of the supervisors are inexperience and clueless. Really cold at winter with little heating
bad,My experience at UPS was not the best. The management was rarely informed on what was going on in day to day tasks and I was always asked to do a lot more than my position required of me.
bad,Company very strict about the uniform and appearance of the driver that they can't provide. They will give you a used uniform bigger size to look like a doshbag and you have to deal with it. HR bunch of Hispanic that hate everyone...the don't have manners or respect to anyone. Be a slave or leave... go Amazon
bad,"bedrijf nodig aan modernisering toe. nederlandstalige verwerking ipv engels. collegialiteit is minimaal en opleiding schort iets aan. gepresseerd naar bedrijven en winkels toe om voor 12:00u er te geraken...expresse zendingen moeten geleverd worden voor 14:00u wat ook in het gedrang komt. Kunnen moeilijk hun koeriers behouden en het heeft wel zijn reden. Max. toegelaten gewicht 72kg, waar kan dit anders? Is constante wegpiraterij en plankgas geven. Word je teveel ziek, maak je kans op vlug ontslag."
bad,Management was horrible. Lack of experienced leadership. Work environment is lacking. Career advancement is hardly encouraged. Job duties are hardly clear.
bad,"I don't recommend working at ups freight, very long hours they worked me like a dog. Would go out on my daily run get back do a switch then if under 11 hours they  would force you to the dock to break a trailer which took at least 2 hours...the starting pay is the worst in the business and it takes 5 years to get to top rate. Call you in the office if your truck in idiling to long or if your on their property for the allotted time on which they give you"
bad,"Great location good interactions with people good environment for the most part. Good team for the most part. Very busy and well known location, which made it good."
bad,The work culture at this job was the most difficult for me.   Employees were aggressive and in appropriate and not held to any standards. I also feel that I was not able to appropriately do my job and was blocked by management in fixing this behavior.
bad,No solid time and there is no real training. Your just told what to do and then the rest is for you to figure out. There is different supervisor in each lane and you can never find them. My supervisor was sexually harassing me and then guys where making bets on who could get in girls pants first so I was constantly being bothered.
bad,Loading lines and unloading trucks Loading mail inside the box. Helping others to catch up from being behind. I work over when someone went home too early. Always was on time at work.
bad,Managers only look out for managers. Supervisors and employees are treated like trash and talked to anyway...While i was a supervisor there i was trying to change that.
bad,"It’s been almost 6 months since I was promised compensation for the hard work I ALREADY DID! Would not recommend this job to anyone. Your just another person in that facility,no room for advancement whatsoever."
bad,Work there if you can but don't stay trying to get to supervisor all they will try to do is over work you and tell you to hurry up and wait til they can get a supervisor spot for you I would never work for the Secaucus branch again maybe in another state but not in new jersey
bad,"Business at this store wasn't terrible, but during the middle of the day most customers would just get out of work and cause the store to be backed up for a while. What also made the job stressful is that I had to run the store alone while I wasn't qualified for the notary service there."
bad,"It was a  great place to learn and understand the product line. Top Notch Training environment. Unfortunately, It was run like a call center, hours and management were brutal."
bad,"This locations management, including the site director are not for the people. They are for their own career advancement. They pretend to get close to you just to ultimately burn you... Not worth the time or energy. Its actually very heartbreaking if you are the kind of person who gives their all wholeheartedly. **Be Careful**"
bad,"The UPS store franchise owners are greedy and don't care about their employees, no benefits, no overtime pay, they also won't pay for worked lunches even when you can't take a lunch all round shady franchise."
bad,"short breaks, only worked there briefly"
bad,"Part of why I left was on me and not on UPS, I hadn't anticipated how fast and strong I had to be to be good at the job and overexerted myself trying to catch up. But, they tell you a whole lot about Safety in training and seem not to care when you actually needed help. If you asked a supervisor for reasonable help, odds are you wouldn't get it. You couldn't tell anyone if you got hurt on the job because they'd hassle you. It was a poor work environment all around."
bad,There is no real opportunity for advancement.  USPS does not appreciate merit nor does it put a premium on tech capabilities.  Hard work is not often appreciated.
bad,I would not by any means recommend this job to anyone extremely who may need a consistent source of income because work is scarce.management doesnt care.
bad,Play games with your life by firing you for any little thing then the auniom get you your job back after 2 weeks.. then repeat over and over. Managers thinks it’s a game doing these things on purpose
bad,"slow paying, dispute settlements , the hardest part of the job"
bad,"at his job they employees are all bad people and also the management wont listen to complaints because the other employees have ""seniority"" for being there for a certain amount of time which is ridiculous."
bad,M’a permis d’approfondir mes connaissances en matière des processus d’import et export.
bad,"This facility is dangerous."
bad,"Just don’t. Really, just don’t work here. The work environment is awful, the management has major communication issues, and your boss takes his anger issues out on you, for something your supervisor did wrong. Not to mention, most of the time they short your paycheck."
bad,"I felt like the manager were very harsh even on new employees. The environment is very quiet,mangers didn’t let workers communicate. Which made it very difficult to work on a team"
bad,"Filthy work place with immature supervisory staff."
bad,"This company really didn't care about their employees. "
bad,I worked at UPS for a few years because it seemed like a decent part time job for a college student. After working there I realized the image people have of UPS is false.
bad,"lacked qualified training, left to learn on your own."
bad,There is no work life balance. They Expect 13 hours a day and will black ball you if you complain. The pensions have been capped and there is no reason to stay with a company that doesn't care.
bad,"Simple but not easy. Its a job that is purely work.  Warehouse and truck temps reach triple digits regularly so being hydrated is a constant worry.  Very little growth from within, usually several years of warehouse work before you can even see a package truck.  Seniority based.  "
bad,"The pay starts as low as the management group/executives think you will accept and does not improve greatly even with promotions, if at all.  Depending on which business group you are hired into, there is no way to move up or move out of groups to get into a role where you are utilized to full potential and able to provide meaningful work results."
bad,"No set standard of rules across the 2 NOC centers, procedures may change on a daily basis.  Employee input is not really accepted.  Management does not communicate with each other.  Not enough workstations for the employees, no roaming profiles."
bad,"The hierarchy is stifling and everyone is trying to push others down to climb on top. Limited room for advancement and then only of you have a strong network of powerful people who can push you forward, regardless of accomplishments or work ethic. In other words, brown nosers get moved up."
bad,"Began working at UPS Mail Innovation in through a temp agency. I was happy to have a job and they work you hard  but they do not offer any benefits and management is disorganized. You will get a lot of hours around peak season (mid Novemner- NewYears)  and after the holidays you lose hours to the point you are barely working,"
bad,There are things that cannot be changed without building from the ground up. But there isn't a willingness to do so. There are only patches to the leaks on a sinking ship. At least until automation arrives.
bad,"Never, never again. If I can help it. Poor management, poor example of customer service from owners. I was always working by myself which made for very long, tiring, boring work days."
bad,they shortened me hours many times. would not call me to work til very last minute. the driver was lenient and a nice person to get a long with. rada rada
bad,"This was not a job with UPS, the delivery service. The was a position working for one of the many UPS STORES.  These stores are privately owned and operated franchises who typically hire only one full-time employee to manage them and staff the rest of the store with part-time help. There are no insurance benefits and no payed time off.  I loved the fast paced, ever changing customer service aspects of my job.  Client satisf Client satisfaction is one of my passions. Doing a job with excellence is my goal."
bad,"Work load was too much for workers and not enough workers, packages got backed up and sent to the wrong places, union tax and dues was being taken from seasonal positions when not in the union"
bad,It's like a prison or a zoo . I don't think anybody should want to work there . Management treats you like  as if your nothing but a number .  Not a good job
bad,This was temporary data entry position and I worked 3rd shift.  The management was okay and I wasn't a UPS employee so I can't give a better rating for the company as a whole.
bad,Had a good work environment. A high demand of physical labour overbearing physically. Had good saftey protocal. Was a good learning experience for me.
bad,"NOT GOOD AT ALL. Management was horrible, pay was horrible. I didn't like the short hours or the fact that i lived 20 minutes away and would get to work on time or earlier only to be told to go home because it wasn't any work to do. I wouldn't get paid for that day even though i was scheduled to work. I would work only a couple hours albeit part time, but I would be lucky to bring home $140 a week. Not enough for my family"
bad,"not organized, not professional , does not apply employers with proper tools, not consistent , very fast pace. the workplace culture is great because your able to work with all nationalities ."
bad,"Did not get the bonus they said I would when I started, did not pay me correctly. Hard work for barely anything. Did not even get 25 hours a week typically. Very bad place to work."
bad,Hier bekommt man keine Antwort !!! Nur höchstens per email !!
bad,The co workers was great. The job was a over load. Too much work for not enough pay. The management team didn't treat everyone fairly. Very poor structure.
bad,Management is data driven and treat employees with disrespect.  It is all about the numbers.  They cuss and yell at staff and are degrading to the team.  They set unrealistic expectations and then penalize for not meeting.
bad,"there is no way to advance unless you are willing to move, the upper management does not care about their employees.The stock holders and goals are more important than customer."
bad,Worked overtime many weeks with no overtime pay. No benefits. Poor and incompetent hires. Poorly managed store at the time. Business sold shortly after I left.
bad,"I was hired to work certain hours, was later forced to change those hours or be terminated. They gave me extra duties without proper training."
bad,For the first couple of weeks on my belt was fun until i was put in a trailer by my self with out enough training on the rollers in staid i was trained on a belt that brought packages the rollers caused jams that became unsafe work zones for me i could not walk around packages that where pushed on the ground by the rollers. on the days that i got backed up and jammed on was not my fault but they blamed me for them and every day i got yelled at to move faster or to clean up the mess on the ground that the rollers caused not me they blamed me for the jams that where out of my control having me come out of my trailer to unjam them and to go back in the trailer when i could barely walk through it because everything was pushed to the side. never work at ups
bad,"I drove for this company for five years in the early 80's. I returned as a seasonal helper after 25 years away to find that the companies core values on a local level had changed. I knew more about the companies overall philosophy than most of the employees that had been working there for years. It's disturbing the level to which the company as a whole has declined. Advancement for serious employees may take a decade or more. Maybe a great place to get you through college, but it appears the company doesn't need dedicated ""full"" time employees anymore."
bad,"UPS is for you if you want to work 8 hours a day for 5.5 hours of pay.  You will be required to work 8 hours a day and then threatened by your superiors to record only a 5.5 hour day.  This will happen 4 out of 5 days a week.  Of course, if you are a student this will make getting to class difficult since you will miss the class.  Chances to advance in the company are not for he or she who works hardest....Thanks to the Union.  Management people are difficult to get along with and will quickly take credit for any work you do well and then quickly give blame for anything bad that happens in the operation.  Pay is alright, if you were paid hour by hour, but working 8 hour days for 5.5 hours of pay brings your hourly rate down to single digits. Do your research before joining the ranks, I do not recommend."
bad,when i first started benefits where supplied for free due to recent changes they make us pay now. not cool
bad,"le management est laissé a l abandons"
bad,I loaded packages for 20 hours a week. I learned that seniority gets to peoples' heads. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the coworkers and the supervisors.
bad,It was an cool but it wasnt for me the time i was young but my co-workers was great they help me alot
bad,this company did not care about there employes very much they did not take care of us all we go was a 10 min break for lunch
bad,Je travaillais avec un sous traitant .
bad,"durante mi estadía en Ups mis días fueron sentarme para trabajar y levantarme para irme , aprendí que el dinero y buen salario no lo es todo , también es ir creciendo y que en la empresa te permitan crecer en igualdad de condiciones con todos , entrar a trabajar todos los días a las 06:00 a, durante mas de 3 años y tener que cruzar todo santiago para lograrlo ."
bad,"UPS was a very fast paced job. The mangers at the job were extremely disrespectful, probably the reason i am no longer with this company now."
bad,"In the simple terms,it was a complete hell hole type of environment."
bad,poor management and customer service skills from owner and daughter. disgusting smelly office with a desk staked high with plates with food.
bad,any company whose figure head stands next to our president while he talks a out UPS creates jobs while shutting various sites down and outsourcing our jobs Mine went to India
bad,"I have worked for 10 months at the UPS MD location and have seen different sets of people. The supervisor whom I worked with was never in sync with the Manager (who hired me) and always wanted to prove their point. Your work will not be appreciated when it's needed and even if appreciated, you will be criticized in the background which will hit the performance factor. I am not trying to be judgemental here but it's only the team you end up working with. Unfortunately I did not encounter people who would foster new ideas and would shoulder you with the appropriate duties. My feedback is that the management should identify potential in their resources and utilize it to the best use which will bring positivity and growth."
bad,typical day at work is driving forklift and loading trailer and making sure due freight leaves on time. Co workers are easy to get along with.
bad,"This company is 100+ years old. What's done is the UPS way. Follow the preset directions and solve people problems on the fly."
bad,I went through all the process for this job bent over backwards always on time consistently giving great work 110% and been used and been getting a pay cut almost my whole pay .What ever I've been promised for this job I haven't received. My building is horrible and untrustworthy.
bad,"Poor management. Poor training program. Motto should be, ""we don't have time to train you."" Operates in crisis mode with mandatory overtime and still promotes management."
bad,"employees and customers are put last to saving money on operations."
bad,UPS unloading trucks cost me my right shoulder when a heavy box fell on it because we have to unload 2k+ packages an hour. Greedy company. Said they would take care of me and instead paid me barely anything until they just dumped me. I was young and stupid but really do not trust this company.
bad,"a typical day at UPS is pretty much you being taken advantage of, being told to move like a machine, bending your back to lift heavy boxes, supervisors or managers are liars and they really don't care about your life outside of work."
bad,You're bottom of the barrel when you start out with them and they let you know it. They will run you into the ground and don't really care because they know you're only a temp. They also do it to see if you can handle the work load. Management is a joke. They treat you like garage unless you're they're start driver. You'll be out late if you're slow so be ready.
bad,"I was given the job via a friend.The job overall became too stressful for me,partly as my social skills have become lacking.I wish for the future that I can change my mindset."
bad,Acenta adı altında aslında tam bir taşeron çok iş yükü plansız rastgele çalışma prensibi asgari ücret ve ödenen 2026 tl nin yarısını ayın ilk haftası ve diğer yarısı ay sonuna doğru veriliyor. sadece zaman kaybı ve hergün stresli çalışma ortamı.

bad,"This job is for people that have alot of spare time...if you are a young individual...this job is not for you...i wouldn't recommend anyone work there...unless they want to be lied to,,,overworked,, and underpaid"
bad,I worked a temporary position that was turned over every 6 months. They didn't want to fill the position with a permanent person because they didn't want to have to provide benefits
bad,Terrible management. Manager/Supervisors are control freak and terrible at managing people. A depressing and chaotic work place. The workers means nothing. The pay is too low for the stress and pressure that comes with the job. Stay away if you love your sanity.
bad,"Part time permanent is BS, after u are certified and peak is over so is your career until next peak season. They say 2 days a week after peak season but it doesn’t happen. There are so many part timers and you will never go full time"
bad,"My work experience was at a franchised UPS store location. Poor management, no benefits whatsoever and just enough hours not to qualify. Store owner was very cheap and did not understand work life balance, constantly criticised time off requests, just so he could have the hours HE wanted. Led the interview as if it would be a career but there was no advancement to corporate UPS."
bad,"Stressful environment..new driver get sent home 4 days a week..unless there's a call out. Not being paid for first 3 hours..poor training. No gps's allowed. Have to navigate by cell phone but if  you get caught it's a write up. Management can't do the job without the iPad navigation , but complain about you moving too slow."
bad,"Everything depends on location, not all UPS locations are corporately owned. In this you may want to look around. I have talked to diffrent level of employees an they all say the conditions make it hard to live"
bad,There was not enough working hours offered. It almost felt like a waste of time with no security within the company. Work was easy yet fast paced. A job beats a blank so work was work. It could have been more organized and a lot more of hours given.
bad,"Ups is a bunch of rats as management that claim to be your friend and want the best for you, they abuse you, work you like a dog, just so they get there numbers up and as soon a you make one mistake for them they kick you out the door, it don't matter how long you been there, how much time you wasted, they don't care as long as youre gone then can just hire the next load of suckers walking in right through the door,"
bad,Everybody that works there always talks behind people’s backs. The manager is constantly vaping in the back room but the hours were good and they are closed on Sunday
bad,"General Culture:"
bad,this place was just chaos. I did not like this job. I was moved around so many times it was impossible to learn anything. there was a lot of sorting. it was exhausting and overwhelming job to have.
bad,Over worked & under paid is the first thing I’ll say! This place sucks they work you like a robot & have barely any consideration for the workers. I highly wouldn’t recommend it unless you like being pushed past your limits....
bad,"Very high stress, fast paced environment... which would be fine if the management where more appreciative. Very unrealistic demands about loading. Don't get equipment needed, even when I ask multiple times. UPS doesn't tell the correct start time each day & often times doesn't log on until late."
bad,"**Read the whole thing if you really want to work for ups.**"
bad,Overall isn’t bad but the management was horrible. It is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. No ac or heat inside. The people there are cool and easy to get along with.
bad,"This was a fast paced, bending, on your feet all night job. There was only 1 break and a 30 min. lunch. The amount of money you get an hour is ridiculous. We do so much work for the rate an hour we got paid. It was wishy washy. When it was slow, we got lucky if we made it until lunch time. We worked 2 hours sometimes. When it was busy, it was stay until the next day. Sometimes getting off around 9 or 10 in the morning and being there since 4pm the day before. It was ridiculous."
bad,"Job at UPS was for seasonal Christmas help part time. You have to been on top of what is going on as from the time applying for position in another city for like Ceres, California you go in for interview to work there but at the end of interview the HR person paused at the end to tell everyone by the way the Job you interview for will not be actually in Ceres, California but will be in South San Francisco, California and you will have to take a bus the provide to get to work during this time.  Work hours varied from 10:30 pm to 9:00 am.  one week or a few days then told you will catch the bus the next day at 12:30 am and once arrived in the bay are will work from 3:30 am to 9:00 am. Was constantly changing from day to day and week to week. Issues that occurred is management would forget to tell all employees causing many employees  miss the bus due to the constant time changes and not being informed by all supervisors and manager at the San Bruno UPS facility.  In addition many employees on pay day had no checks or they they were shorted many times on hours worked there therefore having open grievances with Union Reps to get paid with at time some would not receive paycheck for a couple of weeks. "
bad,They dont care about there workers they cut your hours all the time and will not work you the proper hours management sucks they always make excuses and the work conditions are horrendous just everywhere in the building is poorly lit no sort of care for anything
bad,If your looking for a job where you will get home after your family has had dinner and are in bed then this is the job for you. UPS has the highest rate of divorce for both drivers and supervisors
bad,Supervisors treat you really well and are super friendly and will help when needed answer any questions but the upper management that have never worked as a loader will walk by say rude things and act like they know everything and tell you to do things that aren't protocol or how you were trained to do the job.
bad,it was great at first but then one of the main supervisors decided he didn't like me for no reason and made my life very difficult there constantly moving me around just when i get in a good routine in the area i was in and constantly writing me up for things that were uncontrollable to me and singling me out over everyone else.
bad,"It's all who you know and kissing a lot of butt.  If the boss does not like you, you do not stand a chance.  Policies are not administered fairly.  If you are a drinking buddy with the boss, you can not do any wrong."
bad,"I've worked at UPS for short time during that time my job were to stack boxes into a trailer which is taken to Phoenix, AZ. As part time employee my shift hours were 5:30 pm to 9:00 pm. Management was okay however poor decisions were made when time limited was crucial. As for the rest of the employees I've worked with during my shift hours. Employees used harsh language around other and missed treated packages by throwing them or kicking them on the floor. The hardest part working at UPS was working alone inside a trailer loading packages meanwhile more packages rolled thru causing a huge mess making my job difficult. Through out working for 3 months at UPS I've gained experience good and bad. In my opinion management needs to be more flexible and patient with new employees."
bad,Expect Unrealistic results from workers day in and day out. Seasonal helpers would spend up to 15 hours a day with UPS and they'd expect us to do these 15 hour shifts six days a week.
bad,Poor management and the pay is not good enough and you only work 4 hours a day and there is no lunch and no raises and if you get a raise they can take the raise away.
bad,The summary title explains it all.  The company underpays its employees and refuses to grant higher pay raises. The facilities are very dangerous so they make you sign a liability contract and take a safety course...although working conditions are almost never safe.
bad,"Can't wait to retire have not gotten a. Raise in more than 10 yrs. "
bad,"upper management treats everyone horrible, they don't care what they say or do to anyone as long as they make their number and quota, that's all that matters."
bad,The UPS store is just a place to work part time if you are in high school and even college. My time at the UPS store has been a rollercoaster. There are no benefits and pay is ok.
bad,Its ok for temp. No future within Gomorrah unless patient enough to wait around for 10 years be offered combo. Not realistic retiring job. Company managers try to get you fired so they can hire new hires for less money
bad,"The company talks about safety but does not practice and follow their own procedures.  "
bad,"Hourly pay is very bad its between 9-11 "
bad,I was forced to resign after finding out that I was 3 weeks away from being offered a full time position. Management completely sabotaged my attendance record to make it look like I was an insubordinate employee because I started clashing with them on what was fair. They only look out for their own kind of people and expect you to live off of what they pay you with a family and they do not care about that or school or the means to have a 2nd paying income. I wont blame the company itself but the building that I was at has very management has very nasty and careless people and they should be investigated about ethics.
bad,"Babysitting is way too much. Employees can’t think on their own. Company’s interest will always come first, no matter how great employee performs. "
bad,Very stressful place to work. Constant pounding to get more work out of you. Continuously changing the complicated pay system. Tons of blatant favoritism.
bad,It was a very stressful job paying way to low for the work that was being done .  There were times when people would be really tired and couldn’t lift anything they would make them keep working or ask them why they wanted to leave . The HR is very unorganized and I highly do not recommend anyone to apply to this job .
bad,Very poor management. Not loyal to employees.  Cut hours with little or not notice.  Very loud at times. Very cold/hot at times. Lots of heavy lifting.
bad,The graveyard shift is extremely stressful and tough.  Supervisors were extremely unorganized and made the working environment hectic and unhealthy.  Supervisors did not care about employees well being.
bad,"It was beneficial for paying for my school, but the working environment was unsafe, also got sick from lack of cleaning. Favoritism was an issue with management."
bad,"Poor manager service "
bad,"Thought this was going to be a good job, but I gave 120% all the time and injured twice from other employees, not on purpose but others not being careful.  I had to seek medical care for one of these injuries to my hand which I never had to sign any papers for.  Benefits don't start for a year and they don't count you as hired until after peek time is over and they keep you on in January.  They began a policy of having to call in sick to the call in answering machine everyday even if you know you need a week or more off.  When my Mother died and I was calling in every day and leaving my number and asking to speak with someone.  No one ever contacted me.  So I wrote a resignation letter and sent it certified mail.  I still never heard anything from anyone, but received a formal letter of dismissal stating I didn't call in for more than 2 days in a row."
bad,Good job for a highschool graduate  Salary was not competitive with the area  Needed more training with organization Good working environment with potential to move up quickly in the business
bad,"I can't believe I lasted 7 years....its a boys club. They speck down to you and let,the union reps tell at you they walk around like there the boss, so done with taking there stuff."
bad,"learned nothing, owner rarely there, did not like working there, was not told when mistakes happened, no chance for advancement,  bad working conditions"
bad,"The operations side of things is extremely poorly run. There are persistent bottlenecks that constantly hamstring the workers. The solutions are simple, but beyond the reach of management as they appear to have no education on how to properly run a process flow."
bad,"I dealt with a lot of nonsense in the niagara location, but there could be some better locations, if the management and training was better then it could have worked out."
bad,"Not A good environment to work in. No place for advancement, supervisor is poor and receive no help. Pay is low for what you do and not an open door policy"
bad,If you are just looking for a job The UPS Store is the way to go. It has good work times and some bosses may treat you better than others. The hardest part of the job is covering fr your boss when he is suppose to help you with his store. But other than that if you are retired or just need to make some money that is the place to be
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work there, Loading trucks was all they needed.This job was not fair to me and many people would steal while everyone was accused."
bad,"Had a favoritism type of venue. Very hard to receive the proper recognition. If you like being lazy perfect job for you. Can be very easy, yet receiving hours can become difficult and stressful."
bad,this job is terrible and pays bad and give terrible hours they work u like you are nobody it is terrible for real the managers are all got there heads up there a the supervisors are even worse the drivers and even worse
bad,"If you like the managers to degrade you, put you down, blame you for everything ,or have you pay checks missing hrs then this is the job for you.....i have never ever worked with a fortune 500 company that the turn radis is horroable.....also the workers there use to kick, punch,stomped on the packages so next time u get a box that looks like a foot went three it will most likely it did......WORSE COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR !"
bad,"Long hours on your feet, lifting heavy packages up to and over 50 lbs, for at least 8 of those hours up to 12. Inventory, shipping, Some managers need  to be retrained. Culture is cliques that abuse, berate , and physically injure minorities. No accountability is making it hard on the good employees. No enjoyment in any area of these positions, leads are the worse for their cliques."
bad,You know your job and can set out to do it. Communication is lacking and it's all about saving rather than quality. The drivers are opening and taking packages.
bad,Sent out on your own to learn the layout of the very large facility and find the area where you were assigned a task to complete. Full time mechanics were knowledgeable and some were willing to share knowledge some were not
bad,"I sorted mail, and we worked just enough to get the work out. We adjusted our schedules randomly and we never worked 40 hours per week until peak season. At that time we worked like slaves, taking very little breaks"
bad,"Not really much hours , rushed to finish so you don't get much hours, schedule wasn't set would randomly call you in or out, possibly send you home if too much people came in on time told to come in."
bad,"don't get sick, they will not take any doctors notes seriously, i got fired with a note for light duty. they will tell you that you are playing games and are not serious about your career."
bad,"Very unprofessional regarding the way they treat their employees. A lot of favouritism to certain individuals that don't work as hard as others, but if an employee who gives 100% , it goes unnoticed. The way team leaders and management speak to employees, is absolutely disgusting. Lack of communication between management and employees. Lack of care for their employees."
bad,i personally did not like working there at all.  i didnt feel like there was any position at the company that i would've enjoyed.  also the supervisors i had i did not like at all.
bad,I do not suggest working at The UPS Store in Fort Payne. One of the owners is very hateful to employees and also to the customers. I don't see this store lasting much longer.
bad,"the biggest problem at UPS Freight is the management. The are short- sighted, temperamental, uniformed and unappreciative. The union seems to be of  little help."
bad,Management was awful. Nobody knew anything. My first 2 paychecks were missing. Luckily during 3rd week my dd started up. Being sent home almost ever other day. Sad tho i liked the crew i was with. Maybe the place i was at was just bad.
bad,"It is worked as a franchise, so you are not getting the full benefits as you should on a more corporate level.  I was only hired to cover a vacation spot that was going to take place within two weeks and did not receive enough training as to be placed alone."
bad,"A very high stress environment, very poor management."
bad,"Poor communication poor management. "
bad,"The fact that they assist you with paying for school is great. The fact that they reward the lazy people is not so great. Each trailer should have a sorter and 2 loaders. My coworkers would take hour long smoke breaks and they would leave me to load 3-7 trailers by myself and we would all get paid the same. I did however become employee of the month, but instead of a raise/bonus/promotion, i was awarded with a cheap hat. Needless to say, i left shortly after"
bad,Das Wohl des Angestellten ist nicht an erster Stelle.
bad,"Before applying here, I was under the impression that this place was great. I was soon proven wrong once i accepted a supervisor position. The higher ups do not know how to talk to their employees and in turn, they expect you, as a supervisor, to talk to the employees you are supervising like trash. I was not impressed to say the least. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone"
bad,"By far the worst job I've ever had.  Dallas hub management is extremely abusive.  Constant promises for jobs that pay a Living Wage, but it never happens."
bad,"Never got paid in the whole month+ i been working there, always play with some peoples checks, slave work for pennies, sweating all day in sometimes 100 degree heat in trucks without a break."
bad,"Hard work, union dues subtracted heavily from paychecks. Management told me that I was being considered for months as local supervisor staff, Employees hired after me, who worked less than I did, were promoted before I was."
bad,A typical work day at ups is hard because I know I could do so much more and the pay is not getting me no where I want to start my own business and get an apartment. I've learned that your biggest motivation at ups is the ones that actually want to see you progress and be successful. management at ups is horrible the worst I've ever experienced on my life. work place culture at ups is stressful and everybody always has something negative to say. the hardest part of my job is staying motivated.  the most enjoyable part of my job is leaving at the end of the day.
bad,"the first week was ok after that the supervisors didn't care how you worked providing job was complete, poor working conditions, equipment wasn't the best to use."
bad,"I learned a great deal of management skills, I managed over 75 employees at one time. Enjoyed keeping my employees' spirits high, that way they work at their best. Hardest part was dealing with many different personalities, but it is a great learning experience."
bad,"Worked out of marion  il, the seasonal  driver helper, made $12 bucks an hour,the only  thing I hated bout this job, they did not try to place u close to home, they put u where  ever  no matter how far you are from home, and management  was very unorganized,  you would  find  out where  your  going that same morning  they call you, they hold your check hostage til u bring your clothes  in, also you  have to pay a union dues for the months you work"
bad,My years working at ups I've learned various  of skills I didn't get the opportunity to get certified because of poor management  other than I say enjoyed working for the company  i just wanted to be more involved.
bad,no respect for employee and management doesn't involve in day to day activity with the worker and all they need is a word from your close supervise which is not qualified to begin with.
bad,Every morning was a meeting about yesterdays event.  The work was the same.  We as a team needed to motivate the hourly workers.  We unloaded semi trucks to separate packages to the parcel trucks.
bad,Over worked and under paid. management was horrible! At one point i did not know my supervisor name because it changed so much. low hours. only come here for you really need a job!
bad,being a package car driver consist of sacrificing your free time and working long hours in harsh conditions. upspay a decent pay rate but you are working hard for every penny
bad,A typical day would be clocking in and receiving your daily work load which entails heavy data entry. There are no surprises at work you know what you will be doing all day every day
bad,"not enough money with horrible management and non reliable hours, fast pace environment, and fifteen minute breaks, however great motivational speeches in meetings"
bad,"If you're okay with doing all the work for the driver and making very little money this is the job for you. They pay you around 8 dollars if I remember correctly. Don't expect to be hired with them btw.  expect to deliver hundreds of packages a day. "
bad,UPS is a great job for students. Just not a good fit for me once I had my first child. The part-time hours are great. The pay is not great unless you are a driver.
bad,Unloading trucks by hand during freezing cold winter nights and having to do it in a hurry will definitely help you lose some weight or lose your job if you cant keep up.Skip one day and its an instant terimantion.
bad,"Not guaranteed 40 hours, sent home often due to no work"
bad,"I enjoyed my training in Oracle and its a new learning. The Management and benefits is average. Co workers are nice. Hardest part of Job when Budgeting season, has a lot of anlysis but its a challenging."
bad,"I worked in the Global accounting center in Coppell, TX. If you are interested in growth do not work in this building. There is no room for advancement unless you relocate to another state."
bad,"UPS is a great job for those who stay in the union (non-management). Management tries to put part time supervisors against union workers. Upper management also has no concept of accountability and responsibility. As a part time supervisor I have been harassed and physically pushed by my higher ups and everyone looked the other way. The benefits for a part time supervisor are horrible and so are the raises. They also force part time supervisors to stay for next shifts when it is not mandatory so they like to threaten your job if you do not do what they say. They punish the hardworking supervisors while those who suck up get praised. The best part or most enjoyable part about being a part time supervisor is the union workers that work under me. They would do anything for me since I show them respect and I would do the same for them! If you plan to work there stay UNION!!!! You get the best benefits, raises and have the Union who will protect you."
bad,The supervisor is absolutely not open to any opinion other than his own. and the customer is never right.  Therefore putting the franchise itself in jeopardy.
bad,"Working with the packing machine, working the production line."
bad,No one from management was concern for the well being of the employees. Only worried about the number of employees and how much work gets done.
bad,"Some people slacks off at work, and some work very hard, really heavy load most of the time around 30 to 50 kg a box, can also be dangerous if the wall(stacking) falls into you. No break for you for a 3 hours work. Environment sucks and very hot when hot on days."
bad,"Show up to factory and get to work. Learned how to operate under stress in a labor intensive workplace. Use of scanners, and how to read details quickly. Management all about the numbers no care for the workers just numbers. Co-workers quiet since it was a depressing work environment. Hardest part keeping up your pace for 5+ hours of work with only one 10 minute break. Most enjoyable were the paychecks."
bad,i worked 3rd shift in keens ups warehouse as a cherry picker operator it was a great job at first until new managers and supervisor took over then it went down hill they didn't care about the employees who carried the entire account and 3rd shift did. the others nick name our shift the clean up crew cause we had to fix 1st and 2nd shifts mess every day and still set company record regularly and the fact that they have no regard for their own safety regs. forcing one shift only to work 12-16 hour days 6 days a week. their exact words you leave at 12 hours before the work is finished don't come back 4 month of this treatment and much worse i got injured and had to quit they denied disability and unemployment. so needless to say worst job i have ever had
bad,"Every company has its pros and cons. Ranging from a good management structure, employee advancement opportunities and many others perks and benefits. However, since the last several years with UPS, I have seen a decrease proper training for the management team (operations) and poor employee relations. As a result, the work has environment has become challenging and is not conducive to the employees mental and physical well being. The employees are treated as ""less than,"" like if they were a piece of property that the company purchased. Furthermore, the employee moral is low."
bad,"This review is for The UPS Store NOT UPS (two TOTALLY different companies). I would not recommend this job to anybody over 20 years old. The pay is the worst, no benefits and no room to grow. Go to work for United Parcel Service (UPS), NOT The UPS Store! The owner has no idea how to run a profitable business."
bad,"I have been working there for nearly a year and have not been treated well.. There are lots of people who work there, who keep there heads down and do there work. You will always have someone telling you that your not working fast enough and that your never going to get promoted. I would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job for long term unless you start as a truck driver. Want to work out and get paid to do it? Here a job for you.
bad,This work environment was horrible. The management was more concerned about money than the well-being of the employees.
bad,The managers had no clue what they were doing. definitely wish i wouldve gone and worked somewhere else.
bad,"I had terrible experience there, the management is strictly focused on firing ppl unless you are bottom kisser. It is a place where corporate greed and stealing time off of time card by management is allowed by IBT. Would not advise anyone to work there."
bad,"Start at 5 am if you aren't called off"
bad,"UPS senior management has destroyed the culture of the company. The goal now is to make sure at all costs that the stock price stays high. The individual is merely a number and no longer a partner. Management who have the pension stay, those who do not typically turn over in 1-2 yrs for better pay with less hours."
bad,I didn't like working this company. The pay wasn't good for all the hard work they was putting us threw. And i wouldn't recommend anybody to apply this this company ever in life. It's only really good for college students.
bad,diger kargo fırmalarına gore berbat dıger kargo sırketleri benim yaptıgım ısın yarını bıle yapmıyolar yanı artı sofor ve kurye ayrı olmak uzere biri dagıtım bırı toplama yapıyolar
bad,Maintain a territory and open new accunts. Cold called a lot.
bad,"Working at big brown was a very interesting experience. The front line people are highly motivated and do an incredible job. The efforts of the team reflect their desire to provide superior customer service. A typical day is 10-12 hours, and it's pretty much non-stop. The physical and mental stresses are extreme,which provides a sense of accomplishment at having met customer and management expectations,and for generally surviving the day. The work volumes are ever increasing, which management says is a good thing. When one reaches the top end full time pay rate, the financial reward is satisfying with a nice benefit and pension package. (When I was in management, at a previous job, my employer told me that employees only need a union if the management is terrible, which I feel is an accurate assessment. )The shortcomings are the same as any multinational company, the larger it is, the more dysfunctional, sometimes to the point of absurdity. You really have to laugh,because there's no crying in logistics. The Teamsters try to work with the company, to provide a friendly,positive workplace environment, and they are kept quite busy. Is UPS the perfect company? No, but I like to hope that they're working on it. If you are energetic,highly motivated,and in great physical condition, and woke up one day and thought that you didn't have enough stress and aggravation in your life,well relax, there's a spot waiting for you. Working for  UPS is a lot like a marriage, both sides make a long term commitment to do their best for each other, but rest assured you will find out EVERYTHING IS"
bad,"Okay for starting designers, hours were always fluctuating depending on traffic."
bad,"Worked for Overnite."
bad,"When it came to advancing or even getting my shift changed work with my school schedule, it was poorly handled. Management was not what i would call understanding with scheduling conflicts such as school."
bad,"Poor management, and union members. Disconnection from quality due to extremely high workload. Unreal expectations."
bad,"This is an ok place to work if you are a student and only trying to save some money during school. Only work maybe 15-20 hours per week (Monday-Friday) with no weekends and you get paid $115 weekly (however, the first of the month checks will be shorter because of monthly dues) and the package handlers are on an on-call basis only."
bad,Not the place to be if you are college educated as you will make the equivalent of what a 12 year old with a paper route. Only ft/sups and managers are making real money here and you will not be considered for one of these positions unless you know somebody. Ups does not care about you or your family. Stay away!!!
bad,"deliver packages in a timely manner greeting customers, always take precaution whenever approaching homes that have dogs, keeping record of each package delivery stop by using a UPS scanning device, you as a drivers helper have to process a significant amount of packages just as well as the driver if not more, and your day usually ends around 6pm but some days it can be 8pm and thats where you see some money....overtime"
bad,load trailers and scan all items as fast as you can. The packages are sent on a conveyor system to the trucks.
bad,"As store manager, I am able to make schedules, get out of the store and market The UPS Store. I enjoy talking to people and sharing our business with everyone."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of my team not saying anything to me, but other teams coming by every day to say hello to me. Everyday someone I did not know would come to my cubicle to talk to me and how I liked it. The other people of color would constantly ask me if I was being isolated and if I were okay as well as the women. When my team would have daily stand ups my teammates would tell sexist jokes, gossip about other co-workers, talk about how incompetent everyone else was, and make fun of me as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to study on my own because no one would talk to me unless they were monitoring me. My manager would have multiple weekly meetings where he would yell at me and insult me. The head of the department just apologized for everything while he let them insult me, harass me, tell sexist jokes, and berate me."
bad,"Challenging Mentally and Physically. also, one have to be able to deal with different drivers working style and mood swings."
bad,"Don't waste your time applying for a package handler job, their website states ""$110-150"" per week take home pay, the break down sheet they give at the interview lists union dues, and other deductions. The final take home pay after the deductions is ~$70/week."
bad,Very disorganized and not well managed. No recognition unless you screwed up. Favoritism ruled the advancement process. Unskilled management in most cases.
bad,Management was disrespectful. hardest part of the job was busy days having to load fast enough before it got jammed
bad,Dirty
bad,"Worked one week and was terminated for not joining the union. Management supported Unions decision to fire me. Co-workers thought it was inappropriate, but were informed they could be fired also. The work is fast paced and considerably dangerous. I enjoyed the work."
bad,"In the chicago area it is not about your ability or what you know, it is who you know. Kiss behind enough, and you will move up."
bad,no existant increases regardless of job performance. unskilled management filling seats with warm bodies.
bad,"Where do I start, first position was as a loader, not much to it. I was promoted to part time supervisor about six months later. the job was not that difficult, but the way management treated me and my staff was deplorable. I couldn't call out sick unless I wanted to get fired."
bad,Good pay and benefits.  They don’t care about there employees all you are is a number to them and get packages delivered. They try every way to write you about and fire you
bad,Alot of favortism...really unorganized the woman that they left me with to train me just left me within 10 mins.alot of gossip basically DRAMA...Harrassment  on the daily ...work is easy but all the rest of it is bs.
bad,The place is a mess and they want to yell and blame everyone else. The employees are fun but they dont care because you arent union and they are. Supervisors take all the blame at ups
bad,"Certainly not meant for everyone. Very dirty and rough work conditions. Supervisors were alright, but management was horrible. Wouldn't recommend to a friend."
bad,"Just to sum up, not what I expected type job. Its not for everyone. And you work harder and dont get paid enough for it. You might have connection with the people, but thats really it. F the supervisors and anyone above you."
bad,"As a sales person commission is what make the role good or bad.  Although sales plans are always between 13-20 growth YOY and aggressive, this is not the problem at UPS.  The issue is customers leaving or migrating some services to other cheaper vendors.  This takes your 13-20 YOY plan to 25-45 YOY growth and is not attainable cause only 3-6 % of UPS sales reps to be paid commissions."
bad,"The goals are safety, service, and performance.  However, you will do something wrong on a daily basis and hear about it on a daily basis.  This is a militaristic company with a forceful top down leadership.  The main way of getting compliance with management employees is belittling and time.  You will stay until they feel as though you have been broken for that day and then will do the exact same thing the next day, even though some of the goals are not reasonably attainable (50% increase in employee production - year over year)."
bad,Don’t except too much UPS is a great shilling company until you work for them. If your looking for a short term job yes but if you’re looking for long term this job is not for you
bad,"Fast-paced stressful work environment. High turnover with entry-level employees, expect to train multiple newly hired employees. Compensation is okay especially if you're in school."
bad,"Employees are really goodpeopke management is not. They messed my pay up a lot. No pay before a holiday if it was beforepay day. Christa's fell on wends payday is Thursday so u get paid Thursday. Also union is useless a money hungry machine of rooms time for right to work laws. Ups equipment is junk they invest 0 infostructure. Unsafe work environmentUnsafe "
bad,"everything is based on the union, everything is about seniority, the low man get all of the jobs the others do not want to do,  you can not schedule anything at home, never know when you have to work extra overtime, UPS thinks everyone should work overtime everyday instead of hiring other people to do the work"
bad,"I came in as a seasonal worker, the day of my orientation, a supervisor came to the crowd and ask if anyone had a automobile large enough to deliver packages, well myself and 2 others were picked from the crowd, and was told we could be PVD's , that a private vehicle driver that pays $21 per hour, well she asked us to get our cars registration and driving records from MVA , which i did , and return the next day, the next day at 2pm we returned and she acted like we were losing our mines, didt remember telling us about this, and finally she said she would call us but never, did cost me $12 for the driving record, so unprofessional, so a week later UPS calls and tells me to report to Ardwick and Ardmore Rd monday at 2am, didt see that coming, well i showed up thinking im here for the PVD position, nope for preload, well after that day i went back to the managers offi c e and ask what happen to the PVD position, again she seem to be somwhere else and rushed, told me oh youre in as preload now , so she could't help me , i was irritated, took the preload position that was disastrous, im always all over the place and no professioalism at all after 2 ) weeks i just left, no organization and understanding and no one to listen to your concerns, this place was terrible."
bad,"They dont care about their employees ,there is no rotation a d managers they have no compassion. Before u get your union they fired u for whatever reason."
bad,Literally currently working here for three years and have gotten no type of advancement or major pay raise ($1.50 since I've started) constantly being kicked off the overtime lists to work and there is just no place to make any money in this job.
bad,The communication between employees and supervisors was horrible. They do not give you very many hours. And you don't get paid very much so it's not worth working there.
bad,Déconseiller si bien pour y tra ailler que pour  une commande très mauvaise traitement des colis
bad,The position required inter acting with people and shipping out packages around the holidays. The position was seasonal so it did not pay very much and the woman were all related so the diversity was off.
bad,managed by a bunch of misfits who do not communicate with each other. When they tell you one thing which you take on board and then the very next day they decide to tell you you dont fit in. Was only working there 2 weeks and they asked me  to train new members. to tr
bad,"Worked as a supervisor there, the management in the pd areas are trash especially 1-3, and the work environment is toxic. Would not advise working there for more than a year"
bad,"Lack of hours for part-time employees. Great pay and benefits, however management does not care about the livelihood of their employees and the fact that they depend on the job to survive."
bad,It was only a temporary job. They offered to send employees to school and offer tuition reimbursement but the hours they offered wasn't enough and my opinion not worth it.
bad,"The job got me in very good shape."
bad,"i had a very bad experience working for ups , they have a very poor management and they also don't care about their employees. i hope there will be some change."
bad,"Human Resources flat out lied about the hours.  I took the job specifically because it was supposed to be ""part-time"", since I have another job.  No way.  You are expected to work on the floor 8 hours a day even though I was hired for 5, so I now have problems with my other job.  Absolutely no real training program.  Worst part is the full time supervisors and the operations manager treat you like you aren't even there.  Not even bad; just indifferent."
bad,Supervisors are never on the floor there’s no management forklift drivers wreck and take no drug tests there all smoking cape and wax pens leads smell like alcohol and it’s a mess there I was on a  forklift driver in shipping for 8 months not certified and didn’t get paid as a driver driver
bad,I worked in AL/ GA and they worked us like slaves and offered no benefits. Overall a bad management team and pushes workers too hard with no compensation because all workers are part time. Don't expect to get something like 40+ hours unless its christmas time.
bad,Supervisors will cheat u out of minutes worked every week to make their operation numbers look better and good luck getting them to correct it. The company always makes it your fault if u get in an accident no matter the circumstances. It's back breaking work with no chance for advancement. They take the air conditioning out of the trucks to avoid paying for gas.
bad,"No one picks up the phones when u need to call out, they say call an hour before the start time but nobody is there to answer....  HR is no help ether they don't Know nothing about anything they can't help you so don't even bother asking about the ADP app they just direct you to a website of the company, supervisors suck completely work at your own !! "" RISK "" !! ITS A STRESSCASE"
bad,A typical workday at UPS is essentially so much more work than your getting paid for. Every day they would push you much more than what would be worth our 11$ pay.
bad,"The only good thing about working at UPS was that you get paid weekly. I am only writing more because this section requires it, but UPS is not a good place to work at all."
bad,"Very Very Very Dirty; you’ll leave with a thick layer of dirt on your skin "
bad,"I dreaded going there everyday, the ocean freight supervisor was the worst ever!! I would never recommend anybody to work in that dept. Brokerage Dept at least trains new people appropriately...."
bad,UPS Freight could easily be on the cutting edge of the shipping industry with the network and worldwide delivery chains that they have. However they chose to use outdated methods they will eventually lead to the end of its position in the industry.
bad,"limited hours, and no overtime. management subjective, high turnover,no hope for advancement.  medical benefits are the star and major reason to stay with the job."
bad,"UPS has much growing to do in the state of New Hampshire. Hazing, and bullying is not something management frowns upon, but takes part in. Not GLBTQ friendly. Extremely poor management."
bad,Everyone says working for a union is great..not at UPS! they promise you things when your hired that they never deliver..belt supervisors are amazing but the managers not so much.. I was hired at 15/hr 1st pay check i found out it was $11/hr until the contact was finalized them pay would be retroactive..never happened..contract is still in arbitration over a year later did get a raise to$12/hr when state min went up...they asked me to apply for supervisor position as soon as i showed real interest they keep putting me off..same thing happened w a coworker who applied foran opening in mechanics at ups they are short staffed for both positions.. while i was there the union and ups made a mistake and charged alot of new employees 500$ for dues they didn't owe no one ever got that money back several of us got paychecks that week from pennies to 12$ needles to say they lost alot of people that week..i stayed ..long term bennies are fab and enticing... When i left ups i contacted the union to withdraw 2months later i was sent a bill for dues after i quit..2 weeks later i recieved a letter saying i was suspended and i had attended a meeting w my supervisors earlier the week before (i had quit 2.5 months before so i obviouslydidn't attend such a meating) 2 more weeks go by and i recieved a termination letter..how can you be fired for a job you quit months before
bad,"I worked at the UPS STORE, so I didn't drive the truck, but even from what I heard about working as a driver the company still sucked at least from a management perspective."
bad,"Mauvais endroit pour travailler. Beaucoup de pression, manque de considération de la personne, managers arrogants (surtout à Sherbrooke)."
bad,"This is a job, not a career."
bad,"You could be doing a million things right, but management will always focus on one thing that you're doing wrong and beat you over the head with it. You're pretty much expected to bend to whatever they deem necessary."
bad,The center I worked in was managed poorly. It was very small so many employees got away with things they shouldn't have because most of the employees were good friends. Everyday was unnecessarily chaotic.
bad,I worked from home in a high class part of Texas and never know what time i started or how many hours i would work each day. the co. relied on giving you work based on how many packages was ordered in my area.
bad,"I didn’t like working their it’s too much of hard labor not to get paid that much."
bad,"Worked at UPS for 31 years and saw a massive shift and culture. UPS was a great place to work and loyalty was both up and down the chain of command. In recent years UPS leadership has zero loyalty to if management staff and makes decision based on the ""PC"" culture of rewarding people of color and females with increasing promotions based solely on the color of their skin rather than abilities to do the job."
bad,Your over work upon working very hard to move to the next level they have to offer  but never made it to that point. I feel a job like this is mainly for someone fresh out of high school
bad,"If you can stay in the union or get a driver position, then you are golden. Otherwise stay away from any management position. They will short change you and use you like a pack horse."
bad,Everyone was treated pretty poor. Low wages. Hours varied. Poor motivation and team building. The relationships between drivers and loaders was always a conflict
bad,Once you make it to full time ups sucks the life out of you and they pretty much own you when Thanksgiving holiday comes around you might las well pitch a tint at your center because it feels like you can not take time off from the day after Thanksgiving until around January 15th
bad,"First off, not all UPS centers are the same. This is my experience at my facility."
bad,Some locations in Chicago are great. But most are filled with people who don’t know what they are doing. And just starting in the business. Choose which location wisely.
bad,"Great if you can survive 9 months making nothing. Otherwise, run far far away. They violate their own term by denying employees hours and no one fights it because the majority use government help. As a result, UPS has a symbiotic relationship with its staff."
bad,The management at this place does not respect thier employees. The only care about hiding things so the management time does not get in trouble. They will pay well but you will earn it.
bad,UPS while I was employed is not a company I would recommend for the driver helper position. The company lacked organization which resulted in confusion and for me resulted in many days without work.
bad,"I worked here for 6 months before I quit. They overwork their employees, pay incredibly low for the amount of work necessary, and have poor management"
bad,"They promise the sun but deliver on nothing."
bad,"MOST Supervisors supervise things going wrong and do not attempt to train employees or look to improve work flow they just start yelling at everyone when the big bosses come around wondering why work isn’t completed in a timely manner and blame all employees when they see where the problem is and just hope it gets better. They try to allow the slackers to do whatever they want and make the hardworking individuals make up for their lack of leadership towards this who do not have a good work ethic. Promised a wage of $13 hr.... 5months later, still getting $10. Threaten to require 6 day work weeks when they know I have a full time job and was hired under those conditions. "
bad,"I had 22 years of service with the company. There is so much to say and not enough space. I had lots of experience dealing with employees and external customers. Job is very stressful and demanding with high levels of multitasking.  For the most part I enjoyed my staff and team over the years and this is the toughest piece to let go. Great relationships are built and that keeps people satisfied. UPS as a company needs restructuring of management jobs along with a better system in place to train management people.  There is a lack in work life balance with those at the full time and upper level of management. After all this said, I would return to the company if I was able to regain status and appropriate job placement."
bad,"Never confuse the fact that UPS doesn't care about you, just what you can do for them. "
bad,Management only cares about making their numbers on the backs of workers and looking good to their bosses I'm so glad Amazon is starting their own fleet especially in New York city where ups treats their employees like numbers and not humans especially the bronx building on brush ave ups does not care about their employees or their customers
bad,UPS' mantra is how they can get more out of their employees without any additional pay.  They expect you to work during your vacations to monitor emails.
bad,"Lack of teamwork, as well as no sense of pride in work. Do not care about their employees, and provide mediocre training for positions. The company is in a downward spiral"
bad,"Very busy during Christmas , a fast pace environment and your co workers will help teach you the business. The company is open 24/7 must be prepared to work additional hours and shifts."
bad,"The owner knows next to nothing on how the store is operated or managed, yet constantly micro-manages, and delegates his duties as a franchisee to those of us who work there. Throughout the years, he has saddled multiple employees with the task of soliciting customers via email. The store manager calls out of shifts 1-3 times a week, often at the last minute. She has disclosed that this is due to health issues related to a chronic illness, but even as she is the one solely responsible for writing schedules, she will rewrite it later to accomodate her appointments. No actual meal breaks are given for shifts exceeding 5.5 hours, no full-time positions or employee benefits are offered, and responsibilities of the employees are not fairly compensated in the wages. Corners are cut in the way of supplies, materials, equipment, and general store upkeep to save the owner money, often resulting in noncompliance with corporate policies. If such changes are made, it is usually at the last minute after gratuitous reprimanding from corporate representatives."
bad,"This is a good part time , temporarily job . This job has horrible communication skills . Very strict and unfair such as supervisors show favoritism to other employees . There is only a 10 minute break , and no cell phones period . This is a good secondary job if you already have a primary job . Biggest and only pro was that you get paid weekly .All they have to offer for food for your 10 minute break ,were vending machines. The vending machines would often be sold out of food because everyone uses it ."
bad,In any given day they would overload and expect people to keep up with the flow of packages. Even if they're falling off the belts. Management walks around as if they're better than everyone. Management loves to walk and yell at people (because people love that) as motivation.
bad,"As an employee of 7 years at UPS I can say absolutely with no equivocations that I have never worked in such an unethical and dirty, both in behavior and actual workplace environment. Top this with an overarching dismissal of intellectual property, and a general culture that doesn't value its employees."
bad,They could do a lot of things better as far as their employees that have been there and never gave up. It's a lot of work to do  and you are only as good as what you did yesterday.
bad,"Management was very unfair, people take things personal and hold back opportunities from each other, dangerous atmosphere physical and mental abuse are allowed and everybody is under paid for the work load received."
bad,I can tell you that UPS management here sucks. They give more priority to packages more than employees.Worst thing to do in a strenuous workplace like this. The pay suck and management make it even more worse also.
bad,"Its a stepping stone, don't stay. Use them to pay for school. Stressful and no one cares about anything. They just will use you up and toss you aside."
bad,Hours are always fluctuating so it’s not a job you can rely on to get the bills paid overall if you wanna make decent money you just have to put in time
bad,They are worse than politicians. If you don't kiss their behind you are basically an issue. The employees well being is always ignored and there are always safety hazards. Upper management only care about getting the job done and not about safety. Overall it is a good company to work for benefit wise but many quit because we are treated like animals.
bad,"UPS acts as if they want you to move up and excel in making a career in management, until it comes down to it.  To move up in management you have to have experience in many different areas.  Your management team will act like they want to help you transfer to get more experience until it comes down to them having to let you go.  If you're good at your job, and care about your job, they will do everything in their power to make sure you stay where you are so you cannot move up.  They will break you down in as many ways as they can, so they can build you back up into the supervisor that they want you to be.  They love playing mind games and they expect you to do the same to your employees.  If you're nice to your employees and have respect for them, upper-managemnt won't have respect for you."
bad,UPS is a corporation that will force employees to quit if they do not meet expectations. They do not care about their employees unless it will cost them to lose money. They do not air condition the warehouses and most of them have minimal airflow. Not a workplace I would recommend to anyone I know
bad,"Don't work here unless you're going to college. They give tuition reimbursement to package handlers and supervisors for up to $5,000 a year, which Is great, but that is the only perk that makes this job worthwhile. The starting pay of an hourly is only $10 an hour and they only work 4 hours a day for part-time. The work that they do is extremely physically demanding and dangerous to your health and body. The type of work that starting package handlers do does not justify the low pay rate. I could work at McDonalds and get paid $10 an hour for flipping a burger."
bad,This place starts off promising but ends up in a dead end. Company is too focused on crunching every dollar rather than giving recognition or pay rasies. In addition no full time jobs available.
bad,"I worked preload.  It was incredibly fast paced.  When I first started working I could not believe how disgruntled employees seemed to be. After a few weeks I got it - they demand too much too quickly and push more and more work.  I never felt like I got the hang of it and they demanded more.  I hurt myself because it is very hard to be in ""your power zone/ask for help/lift safely"" when it is so fast and there is no support.  I worked very hard and it seemed they just wanted to work you harder.  Not worth $11 an hour."
bad,"Terrible work environment due to abusive Management. Hard work hours, 2am to 10am. Sometimes 75 hour work weeks. No clear communication. Low moral. In nine months of employment there. Its a revolving door of staff. Lost almost a hundred employees due to many different negative reasons."
bad,I applied to and started working here because I had a demanding school schedule that I had to try and work with. The management would call me in in the early hours of the morning rather than give me a schedule that I can work with. So it wasn't really structured like I wanted it to be.
bad,Unsafe Working Conditions
bad,The union makes it hard to work there. The place is disgusting and some managers seem to have a chip on their shoulders everyday. The only plus side is you are off weekends. Moving to Management does not mean you stop being a preloader.
bad,"Management sucks, dont get paid properly for the work you do.  No one shows up work so the people who do show up always get the short end of the stick."
bad,"UPS = Under paid salve. If you want to know what it's like to have your body and self esteem destroyed get a job at UPS. If you let it, that place will destroy you. I fought my way out and made something of myself in the IT field. Truck driving test are rigged in favor of who ever is friend with the other truck drivers."
bad,this is just a job for the time being.  there is no real advancement to benefits no way to feel appreciated.  this is just a dull day job.  i cant say i enjoyed my job here. there are lots of responsibilities and very few incentives other than not being told your doing it wrong.
bad,The union does not represent you but takes your money every week. The environment is cut throat because everybody is promised a position so they will do anything to get it! On call 24/7 they could care less about DOT rules and its always a hot load! You will be called 4hr into your 10hr break! Stay away!
bad,As an engineer and supervisor logic is what we use typically when solving issues or hurdles as a person. With UPS they are set in there old ways of thinking mostly due to management who lack innovation or care for the company. As a young professional I will say do not expect to be heard unless you are already 35+ in age. The young bright minds that come in the door leave quickly because of poor compensation and lack of a voice even when you are in a management role and have solid reasoning to your opinion. Upper management does not care what you have to say because they have been there longer. When addressed with HR they plot behind your back with your manager because they are against change. This company from outside looking in seems solid. But internally it is a nightmare and it will soon unfold quickly in the coming years. The company reacts in a panic when things happen. Never do they plan ahead and get ahead of the game.
bad,"I've been working here after seeing an ad at my school. By far one of the most hardest job I've ever encountered, with poor work environment. Poor management. Poor mental health working here."
bad,"Initially I was brought on as seasonal help, but due to my hard work and quick pace was brought on for a full time position. However, after the holidays; work began to slow down. Due to seniority and the slowed pace, many of the drivers began to come in to work the line, leaving the new hires to be sent home. It became very discouraging to clock in for work, only to be sent home imitatively after for  the line being full that day."
bad,"The culture of UPS is one that breeds disrespectful interactions with employees. Upper management in particular, do not conduct themselves in a professional manner when communicating with subordinates. The use of profanity is quite frequent. And when mistakes are made an individual is brutally verbally attacked instead offering constructive criticism."
bad,I feel UPS hires people for the probation period and then lays them off so they dont get in the union and make more money and benefits.  The managers stand behind you and yell at you to hurry up.
bad,"Best to leave your personal life out of this work environment. Management is focused on work. Your personal issues may temporarily be a concern and then you have pressure to return things to normal if your situation becomes a long term issue. Work life is often routine and fast paced. Added stress occurs during peak season."
bad,Stuck in same position. Management plays favorites. Union just takes workers money. Only part time available and shift times are terrible. UPS going downhill.
bad,Always telling you to do more. Little to no achievement recognition besides an ink pen or paper pad. Continuously changing commission structure midstream.
bad,"Ups is not a job I would reconmmenend for anyone they do not pay you the day they are suppose to pay you,they do not treat their employers good and they hire very bad workers"
bad,"When I worked there the training was iffy. No one knew any answers to any questions that I had about how to do something or who to go to? You were sent to many different departments and got to experience everything on your own. There were some trainers that told you one thing and showed you another. I did very well myself, though I am a self learner and logic is my strong suite. I feel that any one that works with this company will be a package handler for along time unless they are self taught and have common sense. Something I feel is lacking most communities now."
bad,"Pretty close to one of the worse places management wise. Management does whatever it takes to get their job done no matter how stressed, overworked, or tired you are. Management doesn’t always care for how safe it is and sometimes neglects safety to get their goal finished. During Christmas time you have no social life and work long hours in non-heated or non-ac buildings. Coworkers can be okay. Can be a good workout though"
bad,I worked at ups for 6 years they gave me stressed and a lot of work. I didn’t get good pay well but good benefits for insurance and discount. Maybe one day I always go back to ups if I have a reason.
bad,I worked the graveyard shift. Very active job and fast-paced. also pretty dirty. Everyone is always mad all the time because the job is so stressful. Fun if you like to organize things. I got really good at quick thinking and Packing trucks.
bad,"Very fast paced. I learned how to cross train in a fast pace environment. Some management was acceptable , some were passive. Learned to look for the positive in any situations."
bad,Almost 300 packages in 6 hours no breaks for 10.50 an hr and they call you when they want. Would call at 11 or 12 in the afternoon asking you to be at some random location in 20 minutes
bad,Very poor management no communication at all ? Co worker training was non existing for some reason ? Was told my assignment was over but not why it was over........still plenty of work ? But was told did a very good job ?
bad,"UPS is a place to work if you have no family, are okay being talked to like a dog and are okay being lied to and lying to others It is not the type of place for anyone with true values or care for others."
bad,"As a driver helper...the pay was $10.20 hr, they want you to work Mon -Fri, they don't care about your schooling or your life. The hours were 10am-7pm but in the beginning you don't work as long since the peak seasons just starting, expect to leave at around 9 ish in the bulk of the season. If they like you then they will bring you on as a permanent part time package handler. Some head drivers work with you as a teammate, others just want you to do all the work and deliver everything while they just sit on their butt and drive. So basically a lot of work for little pay, your a piece of meat that's brought in for the holidays, if you just need some holiday cash and can tolerate working outside and working those muscles then this is for you."
bad,"Above full-time supervisor level you will find a cutthroat battle field of bewildered, overworked staff of narcissists. The constant pressure to keep any level of integrity is mind numbing."
bad,Exceptionally high turnover rate in management.  Especially in the northeast region.  Many of the management don't have enough time to look for another position.
bad,"I worked for the company when it was under another name. And since my return, this certain UPS is terrible! Seems like every other day someone was quiting!  Mangers dont respect others and that is one of the biggest problems !"
bad,Physical but sometimes challenging work but environment is sometimes unfriendly.  Night time work is tough with no offers of day time work.  People are ok to work with but just about everything you so is scrutinized by management.
bad,In my experience with UPS the conditions were brutal with elevated temperatures that were hotter than the 105 degree weather outside and lifting up to 190lbs boxes by yourself especially if you were understaffed. As well as the pay being horrible for the conditions you were put in.
bad,i do not wish to tell you any more about working at ups.  I would rather not talk about the day to day operations at UPS. It is what you expect it to be.
bad,A typical day at UPS is having to come in 15-20min before the actual start time to set up. Depending on the day the supervisors can be a little harsh. One of the hardest parts of this job is trying to keep a positive attitude when while getting hit with the flow and having to deal with supervisors harping at you. I would say the easiest part of the job honestly is clocking. It feels as if a huge weight has been lifted of your shoulders
bad,"This place is very depressing you can see the depression as it seeps off peoples faces. Stay AWAY STAY FAR FAR AWAY. The hardiest part is the broken out dated equipment, the heat, and under staffing an the management doesn't no how to run belts. The most enjoyable part of this job is going home lol and meeting cool people."
bad,I liked my work but my hours started getting cut and it started stressing me out during school. I would go back if I could I enjoyed what I did and would like to thank them for everything.
bad,Ups can be a good place to grow. U can good benefit. Working with ups. I was a seasonal. Worker.I learned. A lot working there. It can be a. Motivated job .
bad,UPS is a challenging work environment that is very demanding of a  lot of your energy.  Management has a lot of responsibility and it really teaches you to be organized and delegate as well as be assertive.  UPS teaches you how to be a successful leader.
bad,They would mess up on hours constantly. Wouldn't have enough time for lunch was to un organized very confusing and not prepared for anything you work without mentorchip
bad,limited advancement opportunities and poor work life balance. Most full-time management work 60 plus hours a week. zero employee appreciation company continues to demand more. Recently pension plans were cut and are no longer available to employees both union and non union.
bad,"Job was very stressful and the structure of the company needs to be reviewed. Employees were nickel and dimed for everything such as ways to heat food, funding for department needs like chairs, etc. Gifts/Prizes were taxed."
bad,"A typical work day was always fast pace which gave me a chance to learn self dignity, management was okay. The hardest part of the job was working hard everyday and not earning enough"
bad,I gave them low ratings because of the people I had to work with and how they went about telling you how to do your job. It was very stressful. They had good benefits and it was a good job but its just the environment.
bad,"This is a fast paced company, but the pay and the hours are impossible to survive off of. You start work at 3 am and work 3 to 4 hours. And if it is slow, you work even. And there were no benefits for part time workers.Not a lot of room for advancement."
bad,I have worked there for 20 plus years and I am paid based on a 50 hour work week but work 60 to 70 hours with no break.  They are freezing our pension in 2023.  I am ready to move on and start a new career and have heard nothing but great things about amazon and I am excited about the opportunities there.
bad,"During my years at UPS, I have learned different areas of the workplace. Summers are difficult working in trailers that hit 100 degrees daily. Also winters can hit 10-15 degrees below outdoor temps. I was able to enquire my Homeland Security Clearance ID through my time with the company and gain access to restricted areas to build my experience within the company."
bad,Ups is not a job what so ever. It really hot in the summer time and really cold in the winter time and the managere talk to you any kind of way they want to. The only good thing about Ups is that it payd every week and im off on the weekends.
bad,If I could get more hours and have set work station it would be better.An their expectations overlooks the poor equipment you must used.An if you let they will work you to death.
bad,"Ok so where to begin. The management is horrible, a lot of drama within the workspace, hours are short, the pay is less than most part time jobs, and they will drop you at a drop of a hat. The only thing that was good was some of the coworkers there.  The saying there is ""They hire 10 people, 11 leave."" That saying is very true."
bad,constantly doing things that don't make sense. starting later an figuring to get done early terrible staffing an communication. takes advantage of employees that work hard
bad,It's a difficult job and it's time to move on. Very set in their ways and not open to new ideas. Stuck in their old ways and won't ever change. They need to listen to their employees more since we are the ones on the front lines for a reason.
bad,"You are overworked, underpaid, and generally unappreciated. If you have no skill or service to sell to society, this is a great place to (eventually) make money and not make a difference. You can become a driver and make 80k after a few years of driving. "
bad,Terrible place to work at. Management is rude and disrespectful. Hardest part in the job is loading and that's what they'll start you out on and it's hard working.
bad,"This is a UPS franchise.  "
bad,"Terrible work environment,  seems like they want you to quit the 1st day you work.. All supervisors have bad attitudes and most make the job harder than it needs to be"
bad,"UPS Logistiics is a big brand but the work culture is too bad. Management is very biased, specially in Accounts Payable. They have N number of policies, like clean shave, haircut, un-planned leaves. the funniest thing about the policy was that they even ask you to plan your sick leaves."
bad,This is the worst place ive ever worked. youre constantly treated like a lesser human. and always told you can advance but being let down over and over
bad,UPS could be a great place to work if they were able to create a environment that promotes teamwork instead a divided workplace where people feel like a number and not an asset.. In my opinion teamwork is the key to success in every workplace.
bad,"If you love back stabbing, cut throat opportunities this is the job for you."
bad,"The culture of this company is not that of a friendly family orientated one. They are bottom lined driven and will meet there goals at any cost.  "
bad,"At the time I was employed, I was made to believe that UPS was a great company to grow into; however, I quickly learn that that wasnt the case. Granted this was over five years ago, perhaps it has changed since then."
bad,"There is a lot to complain about with this job. But my coworkers were great and so was part of their management team. The job wasn't easy, the trailers are like an oven in the summer and a freezer in the winter. safety protocol isn't always fol;lowed or demanded from management."
bad,"Took the job because I needed to relocate, it was the most micro managed place ever.  There was zero flexibility and not a good atmosphere."
bad,I liked working here. The hours were not good but the day went by fast. I would still be there if it wasn't seasonal work. The management was very friendly and helpful.
bad,"The pay is not very good compared to the type of strenuous work you are required to perform.  The management training level is poor, the employee training level is poor.  But with determination you may make it long it enough to find something more worthwhile than I did in 13 years."
bad,I am not to happy with this company. due to the pay is horrible. They treat their employees like garbage. they want so much from their employees an give nothing in return.
bad,"The work is hard due to its piece work."
bad,"I first applied for a full-time driver position(was a lie) only to find out it is a on-call part-time position. Must be ready every morning in case they need you.  Human resources had very few answers to questions only contact information was their email address and had to wait for answers. Hourly rate was different depending on who you talked to. If you have nothing better to do for the next 3-4 years until someone retires or gets fired and you can get their route all power to you. I was looking for a pay check weekly and have not been called on now for 3 weeks and it is considered ""peak season"""
bad,"This is only a good place to work if you are desperate for a job. They give benefits and the pay is decent but the management is TERRIBLE. "
bad,"Typically, the managers were under qualified. There also wasn't as much mobility within the workplace as initially presented. As a prospective college graduate, i remained as a package handler."
bad,management wasn't the best because there wasn't room for advancement. I would've stayed if there were raises or benefits but there wasn't anything like that offered.
bad,"Typical day of work includes being over-dispatched(overworked) for no reason other than the Company wants to make higher profit margins. Their version of an 8 hour day is really 9+ (YOUR personal life is irrelevant). Great if you love overtime, BAD if you have a Family you actually want to see. LONG way to ""top wage"". They will destroy your mind & body long before you get there."
bad,"It's a job and job only, no room for advancement.  I do not like it, there is not very much to say about a place you do not enjoy working."
bad,"I would average 400+ packages an hour and still be talked to and the min is 250."
bad,This job is not for everyone. Physical ever single day of your career. False promises from managers that have no idea what they are doing.Make sure you eat before you come in and bring a bag lunch with water. If you are not in shape do not apply.
bad,"not steady work ,specially for new drivers , not properly trained to go out, if not work sent home sometimes for several days, you have to call every day to ask for work, not a good experience"
bad,I'm in charge of all daily responsibilities in receiving. I also schedule all deliveries to our facility and coordinate with Vendors on any and all issues. The major difficulty in my facility is the lack of experience within our management team they allow my co-workers to take extended breaks on a daily basis which puts an enormous amount of pressure on me to get everything done. I somehow still manage to pick up the slack and get everything done. The most enjoyable part of this all is how good I am at my job and how pleased our client is with me and the job I perform.
bad,"There were a few things that I liked about working at the UPS store. It was a family atmosphere. For the most part the owner was a nice person. However, my overall experience and impression of the UPS store was that it wasn't an ideal situation for me to work and grow as a graphic designer and print production associate. I quickly became worried about my growth as a professional. So I started looking for more professional places of employment.The little pay was the major deal breaker. I accepted the position under the impression that I would be the print production manager. But there was an existing print production manager who was the only one that could train me on all of the specific duties associated with the job. It was an awkward and irritating experience at times."
bad,"At UPS, I have to put up being harassed on a daily basis.  I have to work for a female manager that discriminates against men and knowingly allows women to harass men and force them to do their work assignments."
bad,the job is slow and calming and not really able to work with anyone for they make you work alone. the communication could use improvement but there friendly people.
bad,Very Strick and barley had hours for employees. Enjoyable some days and not so enjoyable on other days. Typical day at Ups was difficult we never knew coming in if we would be doing our whole 10 hour shift. Management was very unprofessional and rude. My fellow co-workers were nice and easy to get along with.
bad,"excellent learning experience , pay is horrible. the company overall is a franchisee establishment if you have the right owner the experience and pay will probably not be and issue. this offers not benefits."
bad,"I had full days of work learned how to manage time better and had a great co worker, hardest part of the job was having to leave!! Loved every aspect of the job except the fact I was paid very late."
bad,"This is an extremely demanding, high paced industry. The goal of the company is to be a well oiled machine of logistics. Multiple departments of shipping and receiving that are available for advancement."
bad,the labor was fine but the management made me train new employees then promoted them above me and laid me off before the peak season because of '' over staffing ''
bad,"Everything about this location was a farce.  Pay was not what was promised, hours were horrible.  Salary employees are expected to work whatever hours without question.  Constant meetings scheduled during off hours that you were required to attend.  Leadership was non confrontational with poor employees allowing them to poison operational needs."
bad,"very face paced ,something that i could handle"
bad,"This was the worst 2 years of my life."
bad,"- A day at this ups is exhausting and horrible."
bad,"Management is not great, employees are not treated fairly."
bad,Even though the work place eviroment isnt the best. the company benifits are good.I wish that the management would orginze it self. because simple desicions that can be made in a couple of days. take way longern than they should.
bad,You on feet for four to five hours with a ten minutes breaks early in the morning around two a.m. for five a week. It all depend where you work.
bad,"working there was very fast paced, learned a lot about areas I've never been. decent work place, the other employees were my age so we got along easy."
bad,"Worked for 17 years, started as part-time and got promoted to full-time.  Working the graveyard shift was very hard and didn't get much time with my family."
bad,Management team does not communicate well with each other. Most employees that have been there over two years are not considered for advancement.  Once you become apart of the management team you are stuck as an part time supervisor no matter your effort or results. I and many other employees feel that upper management is very discriminative against minorities.
bad,The Management made it very difficult to come in everyday and work. Not a pleasant place to work. Short Breaks. Constantly being harrassed by supervisors. They absolutley do not care about the employees at all.
bad,"The lead of the Overstock.com dept was not a friendly person. They never said, ""Thanks for the great job"" or ""Thanks for working 3 hours late"". Way too hot in there!"
bad,Fast paced work environment for hard working individuals.  This an extremely goal oriented company and will do whatever it takes to get to its goals.
bad,Journée de 8h30 à 16h30. Je devais faire pleins de chose en même temps.
bad,"In de tijd dat ik er gewerkt heb, weinig geleerd ivm de minder leuke werkzaamheden"
bad,"Job was okay, management needs improvement. Need improvement on some of the tasks. Better pay needed for all the work done."
bad,"Broken promises and a business plan stuck in recession mode.  Morale amongst all in my operation was poor at best with management disliking union and union members despising everything but a lazy day.  "
bad,"Hard labor with very minimal breaks."
bad,"This is a good part time job with great benefits. Do not look to pay the bills with this check. No room for advancement, managers are always out to terminate employees."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being a non-union supervisor supervising union employees. A typical work day was very repetitive. Packages being unloaded, distributed to certain conveyors, scanned, and loaded into proper trailers for outbound. I learned patience and to write everything that gets done or is said down. The management was, what I believe, under a lot of scrutiny from above and in turn made the workplace as if you were walking on eggshells. Best part of my job was even though getting screamed and yelled at throughout the night, always being able to keep my composure, do my job successfully, and have all my employees go home injury free."
bad,"this place will work you, they will try to get the must of of you everyday for a very."
bad,"I would only be given 3-  4hrs a day. you make 14.25 an hr but they rush you to complete your job and get off the clock. Management always reminds you that you can be fired at anytime, even when you are productive. Very stressful environment."
bad,"Answer phone calls and filing documents,helping new personel."
bad,This company is not very organized all together. It is a great place to work for meeting new people and helping businesses grow but the company it difficult to work with.
bad,I really enjoyed this job mainly because of the family owned business.  The flexibility and short drive to work.
bad,It is a place that will wear you out. The pay does not help out at all. Management does not know any of the problems that are going on. Their is nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,Expect to work very hard for little gratitude. Was constantly harassed by Management to take my vacation. I was the lowest person on seniority and therefore got last choice. However after looking at the vacation schedule there wasn't any weeks available. Too many politics between the Union and Management.
bad,"horrible place, i would never work there again. there is hardly any management and what they do have are very rude, demanding, bossy and completely out of order."
bad,"My typical day would be picking, packing, or shipping orders. I learned how to work well under pressure because they often pressure to have certain amount of orders to be done each hour. Management is ok"
bad,"Management was always riding me to get things done faster, even though I was almost 15% faster than the 231 packages per hour standard that they had set. I once got lectured for over 10 minutes by 2 supervisors for not being done in time, even though I ran 45-50% higher volume than the standard. They often ran the fans when it was extremely cold, and wouldn't turn them on most of the time when it was hot. The 15 minute break we were supposed to have averaged 8 minutes."
bad,"The bosses stand behind you, as you work, and scream at you to work faster while your there unloading or loading various packages onto the trucks at a ridiculously fast pace. You have to deal with loud machinery, scream at the person next to you if you have to tell them something, and deal with annoying cuts on your fingers (even with gloves on). Also, you'll get a 10 minute break before one of the bosses screams ""TWO MINUTES!!"" over the intercom, its kind of like slavery. It's quite comical, as you realize at that very exact moment...""What the hell did I get myself into?"""
bad,"United Parcel Service is great for college students. The company has two union areas. The first union is the driver and the other is the mechanics department. The driver works 8 to 10 hours a day. Some what the same for the mechanic. The driver union also has loader and clerks and work different hours according to what the company wants. The mechanic department has mechanic and a utility workers in their union, but the working hours are the same like the drivers."
bad,Within this job I learned the logistics of the business. Although I was only a temp I did learn a lot.
bad,"The best part of the job was leaving, and the worst part was entering the building."
bad,Long hours and because of the Union managers will not help you load trailers when you need help. The people that have been there for several years get paid a ton more than you while they do very little work and at the end of the day they will just leave while you struggle to finish your job.
bad,Company doesn't care about its people any more. Unfair promotion processes. Downsizing more and more.
bad,"I worked 60 hours + for UPS noon to midnight every week. The pay was average for the hours I worked. There was little sense of accomplishment. I did learn hard work and determination because I had to. I worked there for 9 years because my elder relatives told me it was a respectable place to work. I wasted some of my most energetic and ambitious years at UPS to find out that they were mismanaged and focused on a 1970's style of business. UPS rewards people for ""steamrolling"", bullying and # manipulation worse than any company that i've ever heard of. Worse than ENRON."
bad,"Management at UPS sucks, the people in management only care for themselves and their own image, they do not care about the welfare or happiness of the employees they are in charge of, the hours are variable depending on the volume so there is little job or salary security."
bad,It's really not a lot of help but lifting a lot  your placed all over the place if they have to many people they will send you home and everyone wants to be the boss.
bad,When you sign up to drive seasonally they are VERY VERY VERY up-front and tell you that seasonal driving WILL NOT lead to a full-time driver position.  They vaguely tell you that you would have to work in the distribution centers as loader first.  But if you try to get more information on how to work as a loader they NEVER get back with you.  HR and communication there sucks.  We seasonal drivers bust our butts for you for 6 to 8 weeks.  The least you can do is have a 5-10 conversation with me about other opportunities at UPS that might lead to a driver position.
bad,"Ups is an okay job for college students who can’t pay for college on their own, but other than that I don’t see much of a point of working there especially during college if you have another way to pay."
bad,Only driving big rigs it’s beneficiary  working inside wear houses it’s a night mare  or delivering packages it’s a mess not organized at all I wish there could more hiring that way the number of packages r actually controlled
bad,Everyone At the company only ever looks out for themselves. The company will do whatever it can to keep the share holders happy like cut spending on parts to boost profit numbers. Started out good but with very limited promotion ability you will be stuck there for as long as it takes 1 person to retire
bad,They hire criminals and people with colorful backgrounds which is a plus  but don't pay much or on time.  I took them to court to get my last pay check that required 18 month wait time.
bad,You will work till exhaustion for this company and they will continually demand more. Then they will cut your hours because the job of loading and unloading is fading
bad,copulative prospective aspect with company no clear reason to leave and defately no clear reason to stay but was a quick hiring process with fair  work times.
bad,"After being with the company for so long, the benefits are the only reason I stay.  The company USED to be awesome to work for amd I USED to love my job."
bad,"The office is very small with no windows. Management doesn't care too much about their employees,  there's a lot of politics. If you're not well received by employees who have been their quite a while, they can make your job unbearable."
bad,The job just all around should be better. Management is terrible from the account I was in but the benefits are good and you’re going to have issues everywhere so I got over it
bad,"Es bueno, pero las tareas a realizar son sumamente exigentes en comparación del salario que te dan."
bad,Be prepared to work long hours and not have a lunch or break. The job is very strenuous on the body but more mentally as part ofvthe management team..
bad,"You don't have a life here and what little you do have, don't tell anyone about it or post it or it'll spread like wild fire. You can't have disagreements with management either (instructors, etc) or they will lie about you and get you fired. And if the have more seniority than you, then you're screwed and the company will go through with it just so that they don't have to deal with it. The union is a joke too. CDL dock workers were getting laid off left to right and they were unionized."
bad,"Very childish environment, similar to high school. I would say this is a good start for people fresh out of high school or those with criminal records. They offer great benefits: medical and dental, their CRCP program help those who cannot afford a college education with tuition and monthly allowances, no backgroundchecks. Outside of that, you are under paid, over worked, and under appreciated."
bad,Terrible work environment and terrible management team. No much opportunities to grow as an employee and you have to figure things out by your own as no one will help or explain.
bad,I had worked there for two years. Until management sent me to an area I had no training in. Supervisor was too careless and just let accidents happen without trying to prevent them
bad,"Poor management and planning, horrible working conditions, constantly changing schedule, work not even always guaranteed, and many other problems. It does pay decently though."
bad,The company and the boss has refused to supply inside workers with safety equipment needed to work in their warehouses how to talk with human resources before quitting and now I'm blacklisted
bad,"Job is really easy to learn. The people help a lot there is a lot of team work is nice to find that now days,  but is hard to get a over time but is perfect for college students"
bad,Managers let people mock and make jokes on people that are new to the job. Place is for people that have just got out of jail or prison. Its obvious that no one ever stays in this place.
bad,"If you want to enhance your customer service skills, this company is for you. Job is not that easy but if you are determined to have a career this company is for you."
bad,"Expected them to call me after training but it took them one month. I quit my job, stupidly, chasing after a few extra dollars an hour and then UPS didn't even call me for a month! The job's not bad but the managers all seem like they'd rather die than help you succeed. Good luck trying to get on full time after the holidays... you won't."
bad,It takes from 3-5 years working the seasonal positions before they consider hiring you and the loading manager is always in a bad mood and takes it out on the employees
bad,"Employees are treated like robots and management only care is to get rid of the volume as quick as possible, health and safety is an issue. Holidays are very difficult to get off. Lots of repetitive strain. The only good thing about this job is the hours and that there is over time when needed."
bad,"Loaded Trucks up with packages. Loaded 100’s of packages for delivery. My main job was to load steel and heavy objects. It was a good workout, the only problem was they barely paid me."
bad,I hated ups I was always by myself on trucks full of bluck bulck is anything over 70lbs the hours are reasonable hours that was the only good thing about the job I wouldn't go back unless I absolutely had to
bad,"It’s a very alpha male dominated culture. The pay and benefits are great but you’ll be treated simply like a dog at work. It’s all lip service about safety and a lot of double talk. After an injury I was reprimanded for following reporting procedure. If you put yourself on the “no overtime” list as a driver prepare to be dressed down and ridiculed by management if your day takes you over 9.5 hours even if your workday is planned out at over that time. "
bad,UPS is a company that you could advance in if you don’t have a bad experience. It could be very competitive with the employees and management. Not a job I would recommend unless you were looking to be a driver.
bad,"Highly stressful environment. Management treats you like garbage. No work/life balance. It's their way or the highway. Apply if you like long hours, headaches and getting disrespected."
bad,Management here is hot trash. You can't complain about anything or they find a way to get rid of you. You can't get any extra hours because they ask everyone with seniority first even if they are lazy and avoid working to stay in the bathroom. Hard work means nothing here because seniority over rules it and the only way to move up is to get someone fired.
bad,Racism is huge in this place ..they don’t reward good workers or those who deserve it they reward those who suck up to them ..there roles isn’t to make it better just be able to function enough to get through the days work ..management isn’t good at all .there managers/supervisors isn’t fit for the job but just fits the image that they are promoting.no room for hard workers looking to work they way up .pay isn’t great consider they scam you out of your money .
bad,"My manager out right told me to my face that he does not respect me as a ""person."" The environment is unprofessional and prevelant of favortism. This is my honest feedback, results may vary. If you can get past the people, as with any other place in the world, UPS is a great place to work with numerous benefits. I encourage people to work there."
bad,"While I enjoyed the work I did, the atmosphere was toxic and much disregard for the health and well being of the employees by management. The overall experience was unnecessarily stressful."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend anyone work here, unless you’re desperate, pay is not worth the labor, if you’re set on becoming a driver, that’s the only motivation you’ll get out of that place, you’ll work alone in a storm of packages, management does not care, they only care about the packages and if the work gets done, you’ll feel like you’re working for free."
bad,"The supervisors had no idea how to do the jobs the were supervising . Apparently there is no such thing as a paid sick day although you have sick time   The worst Hr associate I've ever met in my life . Does absolutely nothing but push you to the next person . As well as every other managerial person in the building . Overall . Written up for not being trained "
bad,Fasted pace work style. Learn on the job. Learn to make good decisions. Be on time. Persistent. Punctual. Respectful and responsible. Leading the way in our competitive work.
bad,They all play favorites. Dont matter if you put in the most work. If you dont kiss a you dont matter. If you can kiss a then youll make it to the top.
bad,"bad training, lift coworker help not encouraged."
bad,"Organize all mail. Sign off and send out mail."
bad,"I currently work at a UPS Supply Chain Solutions office. The first six months of working were the best months of my time at UPS, today i realize i was naive at that time as well. Managers at the location I worked promoted mostly individuals who they ""liked"" and felt would fit into the culture of UPS. The managerial structure needs to be re-evaluated and terminations of those in leadership should be made when necessary as a start to changing UPS across the world."
bad,"The interview process was excruciatingly long.  They take driving a truck, which I think is an enjoyable experience, into a stressful list of seemingly unending rules for just about everything short of how you should breathe.  They'll hire you and then look for any way to fire you prior to getting a Union card."
bad,It can be very unsafe and the supervisors are not very friendly The hours give me grilling the pace in which you have to work can be very tough and all around it’s just not a nice place to work and it takes almost a year for your benefits actually kick in and I don’t know how some people feel about the unions but I personally did not care for it the only good thing is it’s almost impossible to get fired
bad,Very high stress environment. Company treats you like a number and doesn't care about the health and safety of it's employees. Impossible to have a work/life balance.
bad,"The company I worked for lacked in leadership most which is what made the experience of working there so horrible. A typical day is waking up around 3 to be there and clock in at 4. You get there on time and start sorting trucks. Its important to remember no matter how hard or long you work there your efforts will never fully be appreciated.The only chance of advancement is to become a driver or supervisor which both are not as glamorous as they seem. A bit more pay for a lot more headaches, but hey if you enjoy that stuff by all means work for 500 dollars a week and a lifetime of back problems. It could always be worse."
bad,"The employees and managers at IPS are very disrespectful, childish and not work worthy. Also the managers didn’t work well with flexible schedules. They worked you to the bone, and also didn’t look out for the employees who were working in 100 degree trailers."
bad,managers were really strict and demanding the job itself was easy but the managers made it more difficult than it had to be felt other than that the co workers were friendly and helpful
bad,"Place is sexist, stressful, poorly managed. Would not recommend. High turnover for a reason. Unsafe. Inconsistent. They allow mistreatment of employees and pretend to value safety but it's not true at all."
bad,Worked twice as hard as they asked and only received pay for about 50% of hours worked. When trying to communicate issues to management calls are not answered or returned.
bad,Clearing 4 - 40ft trailers a day in a four hour shift not fun. Managers ride you hard and a package every 3 seconds better be on the belt if you move to slow you're out.
bad,The union members constantly use tactics force management to allow them to do as they please.  Union members have a utter disrespect for management and do work stalls and delays and refuse to cooperate in any way to help the company succeded.
bad,The management is lacking and they let some of the employees get away with murder out there due to the fact that they turn their they turn a blind eye to some of the young women out there who are not doing their job when they're told to and it makes it hard on other people.
bad,"I worked this job while attending school and it probably was a mistake as the hours are unpredictable and I've lost money having to withdraw from classes some semesters. Management seems to not know what's going on most of time, so communication is horrible. Senior leadership constantly threatens to fire management, so they end up implementing procedures that no one understands and just wastes more time and resources."
bad,"They pay for your tuition and give you a job so it’s worth it in my opinion if you take advantage of the opportunities that most don’t, it serves a purpose"
bad,"Needed a job, ups was hiring seasonal drivers for 2018 peak season, 18.75 an hour, I couldn't pass it up. The manager who gave me my driving test literally says that ""I'd have a 1/1 chance of being offered a full time permanent delivery driver job after completing peak season 2018 without incident."" Also meanwhile selling all the great aspects of working at ups such as how the driver's make $41/hour after 4 years of full time, free health insurance for my whole family, etc.. Took the job offer, went through a week of very dry training off site.. and was given a daily commercial route of around 60 stops per day. This was about 6 hours of work. Sometimes after finishing my only 60 stops, I'd be sent to meet another driver to take some of their stops, usually only another hours worth of work.. All said and done, I never received the full-time offer even though i about killed myself everyday to prove my worthiness. Was never given reasoning for not offering me a full time role, as i fulfilled my end of the original bargain. i was offered a part time warehouse position 6 weeks later which i took since i was still clinging to hope of that potential $41/hour which i was sold upon. But my bills were too high after 2 months of 12 hours a week at $10.60/ hour. I had to give up the biggest employment investment id ever made. And unfortunately it all turned out to be a big waste of time. I mean, i would've loved to have worked as a full time permanent driver, but i was NOT about to lose my house over it! Be smart, dont waste your time gambling at UPS. Their motives are never gonna be made"
bad,i worked there for around 2 months as a sorter it says you wont be lifting over 75 lbs... hahhaha okay i came home from work so sore i couldnt even move and ive been playing hockey for 16 years straight sooo maybe i was lifing boxes wrong but jesus
bad,"Delivery Service provider could be an amazing role. As a company they have not strong managers promoting the first person interested. The working life is demanding and while the pay is ok, the expectations never stop. If you are good they want more! No organisation and waste so much effort. I would say stay away!"
bad,"I was hired as a driver and sent to school for same.  I worked the line and then afterward delivered freight to a nearby town to 2 other trucks.  the manager was retiring after the season and it seemed she didn't care about the employees.  I would work 5-7 hours without a bathroom break during peak.  Approximately 2 weeks we were without a bathroom as the plumbing was not working.  I was hired as a driver and was under the impression it would work into a full time position, she would not commit to me.  I never called in, always on time and went above my call of duty.  People would not show up for days and come back with no repercussions from management.  I believe with proper management UPS is a wonderful place to work."
bad,"Anyone in a high up position does not care at all about you. All they care about is the numbers and makimg the building as a whole look good. We as unloaders have overachieved countless times but get nothing in return. There were points we were working 6+ hours a day 5 days in a row with the one 10 minute break. "
bad,"First time I have ever been in a union and was the worst I have ever been treated at a job. After three months of working my off, not calling out once and putting in 8-10 hr days they told me because of the season I would have to call in the morning to see if I was working. Very hard to randomly work each week. Just use you for their benefit. A USPS friend told me a good quote ""you never see an old UPS worker"" thats because they burn them out as quick as possible."
bad,Uncertainty in the future and you will do the work of 5 people for less than the average pay for 1. Tons of unqualified management and pay is not based on performance.
bad,Limited room for advancement in areas that are non-operational. there is an extreme lack of respect for those that do the toughest jobs and no regard for employees; management or non management as human beings.
bad,"This job is not for everyone.  Its difficult, stressful and hard on your body. They make terrible business decisions and hard work is not valued.  You are just a number here."
bad,totally sucks.....too few workers for too much work....ups acts as if it is going broke and has to undercut the amount of workers it uses. leaving too few employees for the amount of work done.
bad,"UPS Warehouse is like any other warehouses that handles packages. Working here at ups, they have no appreciation at all. Your hours is only 4 hours a day. Pay checks are $150 a week. You must take a break before you hit 5 hours because they don’t wanna pay overtime.  The management is really low. The  benefits is all there , but not the hours. Working two jobs is not even healthy for your body. Taking time away from family’s , because one job can’t pay enough. But there such a big company with so much money. It’s really sad to see this UPS , of Hawaii fall apart."
bad,"Very stressful poor management, not a good work environment.  Not given adequate training for jobs. Benefits are not good. Lots of turnover because of the poor management"
bad,Management only cares for themselves. I was working as a seasonal Driver Helper and was always cut of the hours I worked on my way check and also the schedule would be completely last minute and unprofessional.
bad,"Working here was very stressful, you are overworked and you are not appreciated or paid fairly for the hard work that you do. Management had issues coordinating with each other and the workers as well."
bad,"hard work place , hard management to get on with , good hours for the wage , just some managerial aspects need sorting and the way matters are dealt with overall"
bad,"Expect long hours, little to no work/life balance, political, upper management doesn't care about the ""little guy"". Advancement not based on how good you are, how hard you work just if you know people."
bad,"I worked as a preloader. They don't give you enough time to load so everyone has packages piled up around all sides, making actually doing your job pretty much impossible. Peoples packages are thrown, stepped on, and treated like garbage. In an 8 hour day you get one unpaid 15 minute break (which is illegal). "
bad,It was very early hours and management personal were very hateful and degrading.  They would yell and cuss at you. Was a very fast paced and hostile environment. My co workers were great because they were having to go through the same issues. It was a good job I enjoyed the exercise is was giving me for sure. They are a very unorganized company or at least in Amarillo.
bad,"When you first apply and go in for your interview they make promises that they will never keep.  Multi billion dollar company and they pay the least compared to the competition.  Can't keep staff, management is rude and lacks respect for the employees.  Forget advancement or trying to even be considered for other positions people that have been here 20+ years are being overlooked for positons so that they can hire part time people.  Signs of appreciaton are very far and few between.  Certain shifts are treated better than others and if you say anything when you have a problem they don't listen because they don't care and it shows.  Everything in the building is old and dirty from the warehouse to the office.  The fumes from the planes and trucks is rampant through the building not just the warehouse.  The building is in ill repair and desperately needs some updating and some proper health and safety precautions.  The time that I worked there was tolong for my liking."
bad,When you first start at ups well at least from my experience they throw you in a trailer with another employee and expect you to just start loading the trailer. The building was dirty all the time and trash cans were often over flowing. That was all in the first year of busting my butt for this company learning every position to help them out. The final straw was when my girlfriend and I lost a baby and I called off for a day to be with her. The next day I came in when my supervisor knew everything going on and the plant manager reamed me for this. Also the teamsters never did anything with the building I was in.
bad,"Minimal Chances of advancement after PT supervisor. False hope is given. The only thing great about it is tuition reimbursement."
bad,"Graveyard shift, guaranteed 27 hours a week, occasional free pizza. Those are the things this position had going for it. Besides that the job was really disappointing and not worth the time spent there. Management was extremely lack luster with communication to new hires. My pay was incorrect for the three out of 4 paychecks I received from them when working there, now matter how many times I brought it to the attention of the managers and HR the answer was the same, ""We don't know, maybe next paycheck"". Employees exhibited behavior that should never be accepted inside a professional establishment. The problems I had with working this position really all come down to management. So I would say it depends heavily on who is running the place, but from my experience it was the worst place I have ever been employed at and I would recommend you steer clear of the company."
bad,"Pay and benefits are good.  Management is old school military style borderline abusive application of micromanagement.  High level training classes are designed to represent the worst possible days you could have, in some ill-fated hope that said horrible experience will make actual work better.  Constant job threats come down to anyone and everyone regardless of standing or rank.  Motivation by intimidation with virtually zero positive reinforcement of anything."
bad,I am with ups but they dont you transfer and my family and I are moving to Houston area to be by family. As well for more fun for the kids. We will be moving this weekend
bad,"Low starting pay for the work required, training is very weak, sink or swim. You'l never work with a more unhappy group of people. Raely a thank-you or a job well done. if you don't have senority your hours get cut big time after busy seasons."
bad,Promotions are given by who you know not how well you do your job. Expected to lift over 70 lbs. from chest level. Equipment is slow and outdated and lack of enforcement of SOP's allow coworkers to place over size/weight packages on belts to load trailers.
bad,"Frequently rated one of the top companies to work for by Forbes Magazine. I don't know who they ask? Employees are continuously complaining about work load. "
bad,I could train people to do the position but would never have a permanent position with the company due to sonority. They would move the hub  supervisors up into the position and I would help train them.
bad,Long hours due to understaffing. Takes to long to implement new and better processes. Lack of documentation for job responsibilities. At times management not open to new ideas.
bad,I worked the Twilight shift which receives the most package volume and is also the hottest shift after the trailers have been baking all day. Got the job because of the tuition assistance but the 3 1/2-5 hours they advertise is more like 5-6 1/2 hours most days which leaves you exhausted with less time to focus on school. I had bruises and scratches all over my body. Management is based on seniority only so there are people there who have no place in a leadership position. Unless your goal is to become a driver or manager I would look for another job that won’t destroy your body. Pay is far too low for the requirements of the job.
bad,"If you don’t mind working for id10ts that will fire you for ANYTHING, just to break you down so you will do what they want no matter how unfair and/or stupid, then you “might” like working there. "
bad,Was a grind house where safety and well being of others is put aside for quick quotas and crazy work environments as well as inexperienced managers who could manage themselves out of a paper bag.
bad,we only worked 4 hr a day but was able to work more if they could use. it was a hot environment and we had to walk 1/4mile from the parking lot of our cars
bad,"Fast paced environment, you aren’t allowed to be a minute late or you have a chance of getting pointed. Could be a great place for a long time career it just takes a while to get to where you want to be at."
bad,"Poor management,  have to work 5 full years for 1week paid vacation,  have to work 1 full year to get benefits, not enough full time positions ......."
bad,We’re limited to what you could contribute in verbal or physical because of the union interference with productivity. There was very little positive reinforcement from upper management.
bad,"I am a supervisor but would end up physically working just to make production for the day. The daily plan is almost impossible to make with out me as a supervisor having to work. Even though while becoming  a supervisor, management said you would never have to touch a box again. I have learned how to work with different types of personalities and deal with different types of attitudes. I like the people I work with and their different opinions on life.The work I put in daily does not add up to the pay check at the end of the day."
bad,"The UPS store is a fast paced, sales based job. It is centered around sales metrics that are difficult to meet because shipping is very expensive. This job offers almost exclusively part-time, morning and mid day shifts."
bad,Over worked and under paid.  The only employees that are paid good are the drivers.  This is a very stressful company to work for.  They will not care about you at all.
bad,"The training I received was only on the computer.  There was no one on one training.  You were expected to get the training on the computer but, no time was allowed during your normal work day to complete this training."
bad,"Working with the union is very difficult to do - especially at the location I worked. "
bad,"If you absolutely need a job, go for it. The management is very old school. No aknowledgement of efforts, minimal career advancement opportunities, and no productivity tracking. "
bad,This is a horrible place to work. Management never recognized you for positive things done. They only point out the negative.  Morale sucks. They expect you to go above and beyond
bad,"For as long as i have worked there, I have seen management work people harder than they should have because the managers have made the mistakes, and the employees had to make up for it."
bad,"Management is treated poorly. Expected to work long hours/extra shifts without compensation. Has really gone down hill in past few years, used to take care of their people, now shareholders are put above all else."
bad,"I worked their as a last minute co-op position and occasionally was hired to work weekends, by occasionally i mean like twice. "
bad,"The company is quick to give you the job, onece your in they tell you what you want to hear but after a while they sugar coat everything. You have to wait a year to get all your benefits"
bad,"I was promised salary when taking this position. I worked Monday to Saturday from 9-6. I work roughly 52 hours a week and was only paid less then $450 a week."
bad,Supervisor would not train you properly. send us out on a route alone and tell us to figure it out. if we ran bad throughout the day he would make us put a longer lunch so he would look better
bad,"14 hour typical workday 5 days per week - they want 6 days and will take it if you let them. In your short time away, your phone will not stop ringing with job related nonsense."
bad,Not a place that values its employees. Not considerate of peoples time. New hires get bonuses while senior employees get nothing. Share the wealth than maybe people made stay.
bad,I did well at the job. I was hopeful to become full-time. I wanted to become a driver. Unfortunately it is difficult and many in line to get that position. The warehouse position does not offer the benefits of becoming a driver. It can be worse to become full-time in the warehouse.
bad,It was a fast pace job to unload and load truck with parcels that come down the belts. You have to make sure those package are stage in the right truck by their last three or four digit numbers.
bad,Not a friendly enviroment. Dont care about employees just numbers. They do have good hours and benefits. If you want a place that you cant be yourself this is it.
bad,This job was easy as far as learning but you must be strong and able to lift heavy at times. They rush you and you can get injured by going fast with heavy stuff. I do not recommend this type of job but if you are able to be fast and strong you might like it but you sweat a lot and get tired. The pay is low too.
bad,"UPS says they provide you with opportunity for advancement. However, I spent 13 years with the company with little to no advancement. It was very frustrating and many of the employee's where I work had very poor attitudes and were always coming in nightly cussing up and down about how poor management is. It was once a decent company to work for, but that change fast over the past few years."
bad,"Very demanding, high pressure and extreem discipline.  There is no work life balance, all work, no life."
bad,"The UPS Drivers I worked alongside were largely good people doing an honest job. Sometimes rough around the edges, but it's a job that needs some tough skin at times. If you're helpful, they greatly appreciate you. And I've had great conversations on the drive to the next delivery location."
bad,"Owner of the store was incredibly hard to work for which made the atmosphere of the store so uncomfortable.  Otherwise, I loved my job and would have stayed if it wasn't for the owner."
bad,"Tough job"
bad,"Job in it self not bad. It's cardboard boxes and envelopes. My job as a supervisor has been one of the most stresfull and soul crushing things I have done in recent times. The building tries to handle more volume than is safely cable of, the low paying starting union job attracts some low quality employees. If you enjoy being stressed and frustrated while busting your hump please apply."
bad,"overworked & underpaid. Part time supposedly but you work 40 plus hours a week. Extremely stressful & severely under compensated for the amount of work on a daily basis. No drinking water, 10min lunch break, and you are constantly micromanaged"
bad,"Not the best job I've ever had, the pay is less than minimum wage when you factor in union dues and initiation fees. If you are going to School there are programs that they have to assist in your education. Full time positions do not exist unless you put in 15 years of part time work."
bad,"This is a good job for those already at top rate. If you you're applying now this is how it will work. You start at 16/h and in 48 month you go up to 30/h. Great right? Wrong. for the first 2,5 years you'll be making $16 to do the same job as the guys making $30. You only start getting pay raises after 30months of semi-slavery. Let me tell you, the earn every penny of those $30/h. This job has to be done in an insane pace. Drivers don't take a lunch break on winter because they have to make 180-240 stops a day. Just think about making $16/h for 30 months, working on all weathers, no a/c in trucks, heavy lifting all the time, driving in snow with the same amount of stops, the repetitive movements (stop car, unbucke seat belt, bla bla bla) and being on traffic all day risking you life with stupid and irresponsible drivers for $2 above minimum wage. Actually after jan 2019 it will be only $1 more than minimum. Good luck with that. If you are ok with breaking your back, working yourself off, you should find a job as bricklayer help, at least you'll start making 25-30/h."
bad,"I fairly enjoyed working there. I learned how to properly operate a forklift. Management was decent, there were many different people telling you what to do. There were a lot of employees, so naturally there was a lot of gossip. The hardest part of the job was working during the winter months, it was very cold. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving the forklift."
bad,"paid well after full rate is acquired *currently 4 yrs., no time with family or time to pursue activities outside of work. They continue to push the envelope regarding work loads, even in the *slow season* The old timers tell me ""this job is the worst its ever been, and it's not what it use to be"""
bad,The job is very hard to advance in. It takes many years for anyone to notice you. Once you get noticed its all about who you know and who likes you. Very poor choice of higher management that only promote the people that they know and like.
bad,Clock in and urgently get to unloading trailers. Everyone at UPS work urgently no breaks for people who work one sort a day. The hardest part is not giving up even when your body is hurting from unloading boxes that weighed about 60-70 pounds. The most enjoyable part is the getting paid every Thursday.
bad,"Unload and load freight from trailers."
bad,"Worked as a driver helper. Long days, minimum wage. Unclear chain of command between all workers and dispatch.Fine for a temporary gig, but seeing as the drivers felt so much pressure to complete impossible seasonal positions, most workers are contract and thus inexperienced, and I still haven't received my bonus pay 3 weeks after my last day: I wouldn't return to this company. Not to mention that dispatch only wanted me to work four hours a day. Laughable."
bad,It was a very difficult place to work.  Many situations arose where even management did not know how to handle.  Employees were stretched to limits to cover accounts and pushed to take on even more.
bad,"UPS will tell you a lot of success stories with a promise of promotion to keep you working for a very low pay. No matter how hard you work you will be demoted or kept on the low pay scale because they need a lot of workers to do the hard jobs that they don't want to pay a decent wage for. Most employees have been in better positions only to be demoted back down to a lower paying more physically demanding job. Management will set you up to fail in order to demote you to lower pay and your hours can be manipulated by so many people they cant keep track of it. ( I.E. a 7 hour day can be changed to a 5 hour day without your knowledge and disputing it will take weeks or months, It is pathetic that a company so large can't incorporate a better pay system. If you go for an interview look beyond the hype they tell you and make an educated decision."
bad,It was an over night shift and i wanted to try something new which it was an okay job at first but is very stressful for the amount of money they were paying me.
bad,"Its no communication"
bad,UPS Is a very stressful place they want you to move at a fast past in each truck with only a 10 min break and only giving you a 9.00$ salary so it feels like you should be getting paid more for the hard work your doing.
bad,UPS had a great thing when it was privately held.  That changed when it went public.  Short sighted gains pursued at the cost of really good peoples careers being damaged.
bad,"one of the worst workplace that i've been for a couple of years. Bad management, wrong approach with the job and the people, no benefit."
bad,"Being a package handler is very hard especially loading . managers are kind of mean (not all) supervisors don't do nothing. It's not all too bad though if you're into that type of work I wouldn't mind if"
bad,Hmmm a typical night at UPS is definitely a challenge! You definitely have to be ALERT at all times! You've got tuggies and mail trucks literally flying it and cutting corners! Workers not paying attention..your manager doesn't even keep you updated with what is going on just writes on a dry erase board and lets you know when you get there that the air crafts are delayed! So basically waiting around doing nothing..the pay is not worth it either. $10.15 an hour but you get union pay taken out! My team at the time got hooked into getting hired as regular part time to them using us just for the season and then letting every one of us go! Even screwed up our paychecks! Jipped  us on our hours worked!
bad,"A typical day at work would be to clock in,go to my assigned work area and load my assigned trucks.I learned that it is a great job if you are looking to make it a career. Management was horrible needs a lot of work they got by with way too much."
bad,"The locations that I managed didn't make enough money to maintain their required inventory, pay for quality employee, or ensure customer satisfaction. They were poorly run and dysfunctional."
bad,"Mira loma ups is horrible. Management is terrible. The managers/supervisors have no clue what is going on half of the time. Always expecting there to be work and setting these unrealistic numbers that not even three shifts will do in one day. always expecting you to be working when there is literally nothing to do. Start at 5am and don't start actually doing work til about 7-730. Supposed to be busy and fast paced constantly and there isn't even enough work for the 8 hr shift. No room for advancement. I was hired  to be a forklift driver and I never seen a day on the lift. They kept saying Oh yeah were too busy for you to be on the lift, yet there was no work to be done. I could of been trained thoroughly on the forklift picking the whole nine yards. I could go on for days about this job. Just think about it before you sign the dotted line."
bad,"The work environment is very fast paced. But the management team is terrible, very bad decisions. The breaks are not very long, only 10 minutes. Communication within is lacking immensely."
bad,A good sweaty work out. That will really sore you out the next day. But overall I learned that All jobs aren't easy as I would have expected it to be.
bad,"The job is quite stressful just from an account management side of the work.  Getting new contracts approved by pricing is very difficult, unreasonable delays in securing existing and winning new business.  Customers leave UPS as they perceive this as unprofessional and that UPS cares more about counting their money than helping customers with fair rates."
bad,Union provides a very toxic environment to work in.  Management is not treated with respect and union employees take advantage of a contract that does not help a good business model.
bad,"Liked the job and the hours, but the environment wasn't the best. You had employees on the internet and their phones on non work related things. "
bad,Some supervisors would steal work to getnumbers up and take advantage of seasonal help. Wouldn't get fulltime unless you spend 10 plus years doing part time slaving in a truck. Benefits do not outweigh the stress and damage to your body.
bad,"A typical day consisted of bending over hundreds of times as fast as you possibly could in very unsafe working conditions, in order to not get so jammed up you physically can no longer work."
bad,Getting our work done through the heat  can be tiresome and the amount of boxes to unload throughout day can be dreadful even if it isn't hot throughout the evening.
bad,I sorted packages to be placed on delivery trucks. I learned how to read thier code on packages. Management didn't seem to care about seasonal workers.
bad,"UPS Tech Support is a low paying job that you need to follow a script for trouble shooting computer issues.  It works as a job out of high school, but not as a career."
bad,the job is require you to pay close attention. Can not make a mistake they will yell at you. This job can be fun if some people wouldn't ruin it for other people. I can't stress how much you have to be a strong person to work there.
bad,This place taught me the value of a dollar. this place made me so scared to spend my money as in they put you in a trailer and they constantly yell at you to get 400 stacking an hour. I never remember a time I took a break. this place is horrible and that's why I left so fast
bad,Nothing better than a drill-sergeant environment.  Hit your numbers or suffer the consequences. So called 'Part-time salary' will make you hate your life. One of worst jobs I've ever held to date. Pay is POOR
bad,"the typical workday is about 11 hours."
bad,"You don't have to be good, you just have to know the right people. Job is a joke, no one has real control of the metrics they judge on. Your sales quotas are not calculated to benefit your commission. No matter how hard you work or not, you will get the same pay."
bad,being there at 3am was brutal the pay was ok but they make you work less than 40 hours so it wasnt that good unless your a driver there its not that great and you have to work there like 5 years to even apply to be a driver
bad,No matter what you do it is Never enough for UPS Management. You earn everything you get from UPS. Nothing is given to you you earn every penny. No work Life balance. A paid day of 9 1/2 to 10 hours or more is expected and is the normal operation.
bad,"Only take this job if your desperate, as the management here can be a pain in the donkey.  When you first start out its not bad and everyone will help you.  Once you obtain Full salary that's when everything goes downhill and will stay there until you can't take it anymore and find the desire to look for new work.  If it were not for the Union you will find it hard to work here."
bad,"The management team is totally bias against minorities."
bad,UPS has high expectations and does not provide the tools to meet them. There is often hypocrisy and a lack of support from upper management. You will get in trouble for the smallest mistakes even when other personnel do the same things and do not get in trouble. Unfavorable work conditions with poor work life balance.
bad,"Hard work!!!  It is non stop and they WILL make you feel inadequate if you do something incorrectly.  Physically exhausting.  I am a female and obviously would be sweating from the heat and loading trucks.  I was told to make sure I don't wear a white t-shirt.  Not something anyone should be saying in the workplace.  I was also told by a Human Resource recruiter I needed to get in shape.  VERY RUDE!  They don't train you and really don't help you either.  Job is great as a form of exercise and something to keep busy.  Although, the stuff that goes on there....no wonder their turn over rate is so high.  They are hiring 10 people at least a week!  Would have stayed if they hired respectful management/supervisors...not kids just out of highschool young enough to be my children."
bad,It is not easy work. More so of and assembly line mixed with an extreme workout at the gym. It doesn't get easier you only get use to it. Good for staying in shape. The worst part about it is the sweat shop atmosphere and the way some of the managers talk to employers. The best part about it for package handlers is getting out of work at 9:00 am. And having the rest of your day.
bad,Ups management needs to treat their employers better. Poor management. Hours need to be longer. management always messes up on paychecks every week. lack of commutation skills
bad,Was not a great work environment. The company care more about the boxes than their own employees. The employees get paid a lot less than the work done while board members make million dollar bonuses
bad,"Worked the night shift for several months during peak. Although people say the holidays are the craziest time period, many of the things that I disagree with in terms of management and treatment of workers was a year round issue."
bad,"You never know how long you're going to have to work, because management cannot retain enough people to cover all the hours that need to be covered.  Even when there are 40-50 job openings that need to be filled, someone will call for a job freeze to save money.  The culture looks down on taking days off for sickness or mental health.  Some managers are encouraging and great, but for every good manager, there are 2 or 3 who are only there for their own advancement to pad their pension (which is based off the last few years pay).  Very political when trying to advance in the technology portfolio - the good ole boy system is in full effect.  "
bad,"UPS SCS is a far, far cry from what one would come to expect from the UPS chain. When one thinks of UPS or the drivers that operate under the company, they don't generally think of the Logistics department. Unfortunately, there is a reason for that."
bad,Extremely long hours worked every week. Newer management drastically under paid. The drivers or full time employees that work there and are not management will always make more than management personal. Raises are a joke for management people.
bad,If you enjoy a 70-80 hour salaried work week this his the job for you!!!  There is NO work life balance for management... you are married to your job.  Your day starts at 6:00 am and don't plan on leaving until 9:00 pm... and you are on call 24/7.  The work day NEVER ENDS!!!
bad,"Company takes advantage of employees"
bad,"Good ole boy network at UPS Salt Lake. Constant bullying from management and zero help from Teamster local 222 regarding these issues. If you are a KISS UP, you'll thrive. If you don't, they'll poke at you until you break."
bad,"This is not UPS it's  the UPS Store. A completely dicderent company all together. Paid under $10 for a job that requires you to do certain managerial functions. There are no raises, yearly or monthly...unless you become a manager or assistant manager which seldom happens. You do have the chance to work with awesome people, but that doesn't make up for the lack of compensation for your job duties."
bad,"This job is a complete nightmare. The management is uncaring and work you as if your a machine with a fresh tune up. The coworkers are  unreliable, untrustworthy and shady. The management also try their hardest to cut hours which makes your checks short often. The best part about this job is when you clock out on a Friday because you have weekends off."
bad,I learned how to multitask more efficiently and how to properly pack items. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with the customers.
bad,"hourly workers prone to injury, supervisors sit in air conditioning while hourly workers doing all the laborious work work in summer heat and winter cold. Rarely got breaks."
bad,"Typical work day is long and challenging.  Many tasks to accomplish daily that are difficult to get done, even with the most optimum circumstances.  Employee engagement and want to learn processes and see them succeed is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,There is not much benefit for the work you put in. So even if you make a great deal by packing and shipping that does not change your pay. There is little growth and less pay.
bad,"While working at UPS I had the misfortune of working under perhaps one of the most under qualified supervisors in my working career. The workers union couldn't do much to help me which was my only line of defense, and this experience hastened my departure from the company"
bad,UPS is a very challenging job. The pace of the job is very challenging. Work periods seem impossible due  time limitations and internal focus on production.
bad,"They're all privately owned stores. I only got paid 9 dollars an hour but obviously that depends on who you work for. Definitely not worth it pay wise. You do much more than you get paid for. Especially if you're in a situation like mine where you're the only one covering the counter. A coworker of mine that recently left worked there for 4 years and only got a 25 cent raise during the time she was there. Like I said, great if you're a college student that only needs pocket cash and gas money."
bad,I have had several issues with management that have not been and will never be resolved due to lack of compassion from UPS employees. Complaints usually don't get answered in a timely manner.
bad,The Company makes great money. The employees seem to enjoy working for the company. The opportunities to advance are there but college degree is preferred. Communication from management is not the best
bad,I worked here for a little over two weeks (not long but still) terrible job I worked 8hrs with one five minute break I had very limited of help(I am a short small female who can't lift over 30-35 pounds) I am not fast paced in my eyes slow and steady wins the race I was paid 10.15 a hour and was told I'd Get paid for training but was not paid terrible place to work
bad,"Entering this company as a ""seasonal Employee"" means waiving all rights to your own dignity. They give you very little training before holding you accountable to events beyond your control. You will work when they want you to and get sent home constantly after arriving ready to work."
bad,It was a lot of work for small pay people there werent loving there job as much as they should but it was a good place for me because i love hardwork but i did have to wake up really early which wasnt the most fun
bad,"Very harsh micromanagement on the employees who care while extremely lackadaisical on lazy employees. Extremely hard to obtain full time job (estimated time to get one is 8-10 years). You're expected to revolve your life around a part-time job, when it's hard to make ends meet with compensation. 3% annual raise is maximum permitted(less than inflation)."
bad,it was an alright place while I was in college. the hardest part for me was knowing if everyone was going to show up. another con was not knowing how long the shift was going to last
bad,Managed the daily loading and unloading of the operation.  The best part of the job was developing other supervisors. At times it was hard working with the union.
bad,"I never happy with UPS, also they laid me off for only Christmas season. Then i looked to find other the job after that, i decide to college since."
bad,"They far too often send people home, and after being hired full time, I at most got 15-20 hours in a week. I thoroughly regret having made the decision that was applying there in the first place."
bad,"If your not into hard work don't come here only the strong survive.Once your A brown driver Or Brown truck driver the pay gets extremely better especially as a full timer,but part timers get treated very badly."
bad,typical work day is usually hectic. We go to war with boxes 5 days a week and the supervision make days even longer. Working on and off the boxline really shows peoples true colors.
bad,"terrible hours poor pay, promised 200 a week but i was still on call during month 3 it is unfair and not worth it if you want to make real money"
bad,"UPS is a company i will not like to be working for again. Management is horrible, just everything about working at the hub i was at was miserable."
bad,Management is very hard to work for not worth the pay check pay is great if you don't mind working for a company who has no respect for its employess
bad,"I work on a daily basis servicing ID's for Customers and employees."
bad,Was a seasonal position. The great parts about it were you could basically come in and work just about any time you want. The drawbacks were the disorganization and still waiting to get paid months later.
bad,This was one of the most challenging jobs I ever had.  I worked the overnight shift preparing trucks for drivers.  The amount of work was often overwhelming and management was unhelpful.  It was my first real job out of high school and it was a true eye opening experience.  The healthcare benefits were the best part of the job.  Being a driver help was seasonal.  It was pretty straightforward.
bad,Business does not care about it's employee's.... Use you when they want. billion dollar company and the employees are not appreciated.
bad,"This company will run you to the bone, they do not care about the employees, whether management or not. Brakes or lunches are rare, and you really only work 3 -5 hours, management tries to cut as many hours as possible to cheap out and not pay employees."
bad,I just thought this would've been a better experience that's all working for them. They never gave us any breaks and they don't give us enough hours for what we do.
bad,Very fast pace and heavy work. Breaks was very short and back to the hard and very tiring work. Only work five hours but your body will be sore after your work shift.
bad,"The facility and work environment were the only things good about my employment there. Very few minority employees there and we were all ignored and at the same time, micromanaged. All my work went unrecognized by management but praised by the customers and other departments. The employee turnover rate is extremely high at this particular office and it is evident, at least to me, why that is. The only enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers and other departments I helped along. Navigating the different systems and learning them was also enjoyable. My fellow co-workers kept to themselves except for a few that befriended me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. No matter how much I collected, sometimes more than anyone else in the group, there was no recognition for me but others got it when they collected a large sum. I moved to PA from Florida and I can only hope that not all companies treat people like I was at UPS."
bad,"When trying to obtain information and learn how to get the job done correctly, something would be demonstrated or explained to me only once, then I would be left alone to tend to customers. After several complaints and still not being able to do my job correctly and efficiently, I decided to walk away from the company."
bad,"Not enough hours, co-workers were great people to be around, hardest past of the job was lifting boxes over 50 lbs. but it wasn't that hard"
bad,This company provides unlimited opportunity for advancement and longevity if you can survive the operations driven environment as a sales person.
bad,Dont work here. part time is 100 a week. have to deal with steroid using managers that yell at you and kick boxes. sometimes they sent you home early and you only get payed the time you work.
bad,"Loading, unloading, sorting of packages off a freight holding an estimate of 1400 boxes. Having a number to withhold for a hour."
bad,"During holiday season you work around 15-16 hours a day and a normal day starts at midnight"
bad,I get up at 07:00 to go to work and get off at 21:00 (or later). There is no teamwork and the upper management is not there for support and do not care about an individual or his/her family.
bad,hated pretty much everything about it except the insurance the culture is to bully and harass people for production there was no leadership at all.
bad,"Every day was different didn't know what time to come in the next day until you got off, didn't know what time you would even get off."
bad,A typical day at work is making sure you take care of your customers which is awesome for me because I love making people happy! UPS is an okay place to work for. You will have to wait a while in order to make the big bucks.
bad,"Very fast pace, they expect you to get everything right of the bat, and there is no job security. If they feel you aren't for the job they wont hesitate to let you go instead of working with you."
bad,"constantly forced to break safety protocol to get more production finished, employees constantly yelling and arguing with management, only a 4 hour shift"
bad,"Beware of the truckload division of this company. Most drivers associate the name UPS with everything good, that is not the case with UPS Freight Truckload. This division is the non-union side of both UPS and UPS Freight LTL, or if you will the laughing stock and even the whipping post for the rest of the UPS companies. "
bad,The UPS stores are independently owned but the one I'm currently working at isn't enjoyable and they go against labor laws. Only get one 30 minute unpaid break out of 9-10 hrs work days with no paid 10-15 minute break what so ever so I end up getting sick from not eating much. Manager is disrespectful and not enjoyable to work with.
bad,"December is UPS's busiest time of the year, and in this case, Christmas. Every year the number of parcels delivered increases, and the demand for help becomes evident, as the days start from 8-9am and reach 10-12pm. Each truck can have between 200-500 stops, with many of the drivers continuing delivering on another truck after completion of their own."
bad,"I work at a UPS hub that was built in 1985 and it has made very few improvements since. We process nearly 4 times what the hub was built to handle. Before you get hired there, they will say ""you will just work 5 hours a day from 5pm to 10 pm when in reality they make you work 4:30pm to 11:15pm and will not let you leave any earlier than that, even if it is after 10pm. Cell phones and other electronic devices are not allowed on the property, which is understandable, but what if it is an emergency, like your child got seriously injured at school? No Air Conditioning in the summer sucks, especially when the hub has a metal roof, No heating either, the only heat there is comes from all the moving conveyor belts. Managers really don't care about employees lifes or safety. I come home every day with an injury of some kind due to everything being so out dated and with all the oversized and over weight packages we have to sort. Only up side is they give tuition reimbursement."
bad,"Thankless job. Nothing is ever done correctly. The focus is always on what still needs improvement, and there was never a ""thank you"" for improving something. When a shift didn't go well, the supervisors were forced to stay hours and hours for meetings just for punishment. Not uncommon to work 14 hours per day. Upper management is very sneaky and will do anything to stab you in the back if it makes them look good."
bad,I liked working here and advanced quickly.  I had to work late and felt most of the duties were expected to be my responsibility.  I also feel that management didn't really appreciate their employees
bad,"I thought going into my position at UPS would be great...was I ever wrong! "
bad,"A typical day was spent doing a large sum of different things. I would be copying for a customer one minute, and the next I would be filling in data entry for my boss. I was constantly working on a variation of things. The hardest part of the job was that despite being capable of doing what I could, the job was clearly for more than one person, and sometimes it was just me. Plus, the compensation was sadly lower than I deserved. What I enjoyed most was the computer aspect. Which suits me completely, given that for ten years I was strictly administrative."
bad,10-12 hour days are the norm. Very hard to balance home and work life
bad,"12 hour days consistently and low work moral established by management."
bad,Temporary agency with no benefits. work most holidays with no holiday compensation.
bad,a typical day is a lot of running around and searching for the high value packages. i really didn't learn anything from this job
bad,You can pass the map test however when you get to the group interview you all of a sudden fail.
bad,"Training and testing employees throughout the hub on OSHA safety standards. Weekly new-hire orientation. Walking the hub, paying close attention to employee safety compliance or lack thereof."
bad,start at 2200 and start with a quick update of how we did day before on volume and trailers then get told what trailer to go in then start unloading trailers by putting boxes on the belt and facing the labels the right way for them to be scanned keep work area tidy and tape up any broken parcels.If get told to help out in diffrent part of building then i will go normaly it will be to clear the shoots of parcels of to help load a trailer and scan parcels and make sure they are going to right destination. The hardest part of my job is taking items off the trailer myself as we dont have pumptrucks of folklifts at ups all done by hand and wile iv been at ups im starting to learne my postcodes
bad,The pay was great. The factory scene isn't something i want to make an carer from.
bad,"Stable company for now - future will tell if the Union is still in place in 15+ years. "
bad,"Pakete einladen und los"
bad,The haredest part is loading unloading and sorting is alot easier
bad,Upper/Middle management is extremely verbally abusive towards union employees and lower management. You are required to memorize and recite a 72 step process verbatim. Management usually works 7 hour shifts with no breaks and union employees work on average 4 hours with one 10 minute break. The best part of the job is when the day is over.
bad,"The management is terrible and they treat you like scum. You can't call off or they will threaten to fire you, and they make you feel like dirt. Worst company I've worked for in my entire life. The hardest parts are keeping up with the pace of the belt and the unloaders and getting up at three in the morning every day, driving an hour to work and only getting payed enough for gas."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of financial planning, monitoring on- time transit of freight (arrivals & departures), managing loading and unloading of merchandise, coordinating routes throughout the southeast, and the ability to immediately adjust to ever changing challenges and situations, and consult customers on shipping strategies, needs, software, and proper handling."
bad,"As  21 yr employee this company has the worst management that I have ever know! The salary and benefits are second to none but you earn EVERY penny. Long hours, emotionally and mentally draining ; this company has been the demise of many marriages and families!"
bad,"The hardest part of this particular job is being able to work in a speedy time, but the most enjoyable time was interacting with my co-workers and being able to help others."
bad,"PLEASE READ BEFORE APPLYING!!!!"
bad,"loaded up truck."
bad,"This is a good job to have for school. The work is simple, and very applicable to office type environments. This is a good stepping stone to bigger and better things"
bad,"People are so disappointed here it is not a good place to work anymore. I dread going into work everyday. It used to be a good place to work, but the culture has changed and it is solely about the bottom line. No matter what is said it is still about the bottom line. "
bad,"Be prepared to learn on your own. They really don't have time to train, so you have to be a self starter and able to understand their procedures and methods through reading packets or making out what they last person did."
bad,"not enough work time, learning to handle double trailors,rough working for large corp. friendly co workers."
bad,Would be a nice to work if owners would take care of the employee's
bad,"Lots of reports and paperwork, getting promoted is difficult without good connections."
bad,"Our job was to answer calls to existing freight customers, answer questions about their accounts, schedule their freight pickups and locate and find information on lost or misrouted shipments the overall job would have been easy if the system was consistent. Systems and processes constantly changed and it was hard to please quality control. You could fail calls for anything! Even stuff you were taught in the training course was changed and expected to be immediately implemented. The employees were childish and gossipy, the managers showed clear favoritism. All that could've been tolerated if you weren't so pressured to maintain such overly high expectations that even were showed the managers couldn't attain when they were put in a situation that had to be escalated to them."
bad,"A lot of physical labor, definitely not enough money, and the union also takes away around $20 a week from your paycheck."
bad,wasnt to impressed with the work uniforms for seasonal help or the lack of hours they provided.
bad,Customer sevice and package handling and mailing. Others there are self centered and talk behind others backs making light of them. Hold any disabilities against you.
bad,My days were no more than 5hrs which I didn't like. I Prefer a job with at least 9hrs. or more. My driver was a great man that worked with the company over thirty years I believe. I believe I should of gotten paid more than 8.50 a hr. Its a lot of moving and lifting I don't know much females that would have lasted doing this positions. Management was probably the worst I have ever came across.I wouldn't consider anybody to work for the company. Only good thing I got from this job was being able to work out while working.
bad,My work day starts at 11 p.m.
bad,"I think that my experience is more reflective of my actual job than the actual company. I believe that the company is a great company. However, I feel that inside sales is extremely repetitve and boring. The co-workers make it tolerable. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with all of the changing expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is Mon-Fri, 8-5. I have learned that i do not want to be stuck in a cubicle anymore. Management is given tough goals to reach and it roles down hill to subordinates."
bad,"Its a Great place to work if your a high School Student or College Student. Other then that do not expect much room to move up or benefits. High Stress and volume job. A lot of multi tasking but for the amount of work you do, you dont get paid enough for it. It is a Franchise so its different owners, so every place has different prices, and different way of doing things."
bad,Held accountable for unreachable goals.
bad,Good company with strong presence in the US and abroad. A few locations are disconnected with too much burden on the employee to get the job done.
bad,Handle packages and ship. Dealt with customers and registers. co workers were nice. Management was bad. Hardest part of the job was the customers.
bad,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the job, the environment wasn't very conducive to promotion and management was often not accessible."
bad,While i worked here I learned everything about shipping and receiving. I really enjoyed getting to know all the customers.
bad,"taking care of mail and order and great managment, alot of work, and overnight graveyard shift"
bad,Bad management overall but if you okay with working in harsh conditions then this job is for you. The union does support you alot and basically getting fired is near impossible.
bad,"The job is quite simple, you locate your freight (boxes) moving along a continuously running conveyor belt by a numbered sticker on the side of the box which corresponds with the number of the truck you are loading (I.E- if you are in door 16, you pull off every box with the number 16 stuck onto the side) Then scan the sticker with a finger scanner which enters the info into the UPS system automatically for you, then you load it into the truck"
bad,"I would only recommend this position for high school or college students. They will not give you this position if you do not have a vehicle. I would recommend, but would depend on the person."
bad,"Lying, cheating, backstabbing, cut throat, squeeze every drop of blood out of you and then kick you to the curb. But they pay good and benefits are good and free. Everyday you report to work may be your day to get fired."
bad,"UPS used to be a great place to work, but due to the impact Amazon has had internationally on all shipping companies, UPS has now become a sweat shop where there are not enough resources (drivers, trucks, etc.) to provide great service. The job environment has now become a community of managers forcing too much work on their service providers and additionally telling those service providers that they will be held responsible for any additional work that is not completed regardless of whether or not the service provider has been given the time and resources to complete the additional work. As much as I love my job at UPS, i have never detested a group of managers so much in my entire life."
bad,Es un trabajo de mucho peso hay mucho peligro y los jefes no pagan bien
bad,i worked here at SFC for a lil over 6 months. at the 6 month mark i had suicidal tendencies that were related to the job. the bosses are all evil and dont care about anyone.
bad,"UPS is only concern about production and money, not its employees! It’s sad that this company has a whole is creating a stressful environment. You will get thrown under the bus very quickly and please don’t confront them on it. UPS has a huge turnover rate."
bad,"Just worked for Peak Season , during orientation we were offered a weekly bonus for attendance , incentive to work every day , But they turned around and decided not to pay these bonus's . Poor Company Values"
bad,They were very unorganized... I ain’t get paid my right pay & the conditions & harsh ways they had us were a bit painful. I love the experience ; just not the job cause I really had to buss my A** to get a lil pay
bad,Its a learning experience and if your a open person you can gain a lot of experience. If you want longevity take time communicate and be on time. Apply
bad,The hours were not flexible at all and during peak season they add FRIDAY on as a mandatory day. I do not recommend working here if you are looking for flexible hours.
bad,It was just not the best . They could of been a little better at it especially the mangers and supervisor they had which that something they need to work on too .
bad,I really enjoy the job at first but management is another story they don't have good communication skills with their employees. But the good thing about this job was my driver he was nice respectful and listen And good advice about the job
bad,"The work there isn't hard at all, simple physical labor moving boxes at 4am.  The issues reside with the complete and utter managerial ineptitude.  Management would play favorites and nitpick when to enforce rules like being on time and leaving early etc.  In my short time there I had seen at least 15 people be employed only to quit shortly after.  Easily over 20 people quit in just a year while I was there, the main reason being management.  It's essentially a blame game down the corporate ladder with nobody willing to take responsibility for the fact that the warehouse had been understaffed since before I was even hired.  The management only cares about what happens to them, everyone else is expendable, thank goodness for the union!  Examples of managerial incompetence include ignoring chemical spills in the building, turning a blind eye to stealing, escalating issues, ignoring issues (a fight broke out between 2 employees and nothing was done to even attempt to alleviate the stress which caused the altercation), the building had no running water for 2 weeks but they gave us 1 outhouse for 40 employees, and the manager of the entire facility comes in at the end of every shift just to yell for 10 minutes before leaving all posts and going to the golf course."
bad,This seasonal position did not offer full time work after I was told I would be offered more stable work. It was hard labor and not for the weak minded
bad,"The work was okay, the management was a joke.  Safety seemed to come last. I never saw any one cleaning anything anywhere at any time. I worked for a month and I didn't receive pay. I reached out to all forms of management and couldn't get help or answers from anyone."
bad,No one has respect for each other very unprofessional things and people are all over the place the people are messy and Loud people will laugh at you if you mess up or hurt yourself they don’t pay like they say they will they also will lose your check
bad,"If you want a stable income with job security and have no goals of starting a family or desires to visit friends or loved ones on the holidays, UPS is the place to go."
bad,"Most of these package and L T  L  carrier  company use you as a part-time help never get a full time position that for all of them work the H out of you dear you make a mistake make the comp any profit when they  can high you as full time worker no more than minty days of labor . People are looking for full time work with benefits"
bad,"This applies to package handling, particularly loading. Can't comment on the other work sections. Working during peak season will be physically intensive, especially if you're at a larger hub. Expect 7+ hour days with a single 10 minute break during your shift. Don't worry about bringing a lunch because you won't have time to eat it. Don't let them catch you sitting on load stands, even if it's during your break. "
bad,Most new hires can not grasp the physicality of the work load. Hours are very difficult to become accostumed to and management can add to a somewhat negative atmosphere.
bad,"This is a job for a certain kind of person. I’m in fairly good shape but i feel dead after loading trailers, and they expect you to work 8-10 hour days. Not worth it unless your 18-22 or you're someone that has no other option. The work environment sucks, you’ll be breathing in dirt and dust all day and all of your coworkers will generally be miserable. The only good thing about the company is the health insurance and pension, but you’ll have to suffer for a  long time to get it. And to people saying this job is “a workout”.. no not really. Yes you will burn calories but dont expect to gain any muscle. Lifting boxes non stop while under stress is not a workout at all. Your joints will be way more sore than your muscles, essentially tearing up your body."
bad,Ik moest daar meer dan 100 adressen per dag langs. De ene koerier heeft een enveloppenwijk en de andere tilt zich letterlijk een hernia. Veel tijdsdruk. Vooral in de ochtend als de expressen en de expres plus op tijd geleverd moet zijn
bad,"I worked for one day. the job title, application and at orientation they said it’s a part time, 2am-5am job, with good pay and a great work environment. All of it was lies, on my first day I had to come in at midnight, which was 2 hours before scheduled time, i worked 9 and a half hours and got some training. If you’re a physical worker and can stand a terrible work environment with screaming supervisors, a lot of complaining from the workers that they hate their job, and the hours upon hours of working hard moving thousands of packages into multiple trucks this may be for you. I had training, but it was after I had already worked 9 hours so it was very unnecessary. The pay and benefits are great and if you move up in the company it’s probably amazing, but starting out it’s terrible and I couldn’t deal with it after my first day. The lies, screaming, painful work with no breaks. Never again."
bad,If you can work hard they will just try to work you even harder. They let men disrespect women and if something happens to you good look with them caring for you anymore you are as good as dead if you get hurt. If you want a secure spot better join the boys club
bad,"Unpleasant environment. Drivers mostly despise each other. Other drivers will tell you to work slower. So many rules, your head will spin. The only thing that matters is seniority.  Management lies to you. HR people are total weasels. "
bad,"Poor management, had a coworker try to ruin my line of work, unorganized with when to work, lied about having breaks, hours, and hard to receive help."
bad,The specific job site was chaotic on some days as packages would pile onto the rollers where they came from chutes. Higher-up employees had little to no physical strain while part-time laborers worked to over-stressed.
bad,The culture of UPS only cares about the metrics  there are good people working at an awful company  they are what makes it survivable but if you want help from the company  move on
bad,I did not enjoy working here management was not the greatest facilities are run down not up to par did not feel safe or enjoy my time working at this establishment
bad,"Too political, unfair treatment. Favor base on who will listen and no opinions at all."
bad,"10min break in between hours of busting ur butt, total sweat shop.  No time to eat, I mean if u need money u can't go"
bad,The only thing is it's a International company but it's not well compensated specially if you live in the area when the high cost living and you can't even afford an apartment plus your food to live.
bad,Not fun hard work every day. Breaks are too short. Usually work alone. heavy bulk at the end of the shift drains a worker. No promotions unless there's a degree.
bad,"Would be a good place to work, but there seniority rules there work, if you don't have any seniority you don't work is a bad idea, because the company has a constant change over of people,the employees that are working for their hubs in their districts should be able to work in new Stanton being payed a few dollars more for the travel and time, instead of leaving people sit at home, the company has employees sitting at home is"
bad,Management is hostile either through passive aggressive tone or insulting and abuse of position. They act as if they're better than new employees who make 1 mistake and refuse to help when employee is overwhelmed in extreme situations. Management would rather insult employee rather than work with them. And organization of company seems to be extremely lacking. This was only my experience. Very very few others that I worked with had similar or same issues.
bad,"loved the customers, most supervision was clueless. Extremely long hours, no family time.   Perfect job if you are looking to ditch your family. Could be one of the best jobs if they knew how to dispatch the drivers so they could get 8 hours a day, not 12 hours every day"
bad,"The owners of The UPS Store on Higley and Pecos in Gilbert Arizona are extremely hard to work for. They set unrealistic expectations for their employees, and are not consistent with the company rules. They pay there sons a lot more than the rest of the employees, and will not work with your schedule. They do not reward hard working employee's."
bad,"Harsh/ hazardous conditions, nasty, smelly, dirty trucks and coworkers. Management was friendly but unhelpful, only advised me to not hurt myself. No matter how hot or cold the trucks, they were always open."
bad,UPS remains one of the best places to start a resume.  Hiring in doesn't require much more than a willingness to work and a desire to succeed. The work may get less physically demanding but it does not get easier.
bad,"This place is currently going through a transitional process.  The management is going through stressful times.  The people there are great.  But, the amount of work demanded on the person is overwhelming."
bad,"work place culture is pleasant"
bad,"If your into dropping 2 pants sizes due to sweating like a boar, then I recommend working here for the holidays. In training they will tell you the whole benefit bit but your going to be temporary and benefits dont kick in until after 9 months so figure it out, you will never see them."
bad,No instruction no help but expect for work to be done without the right tools. If you did t complete work they held that against you. Lone term employee didn’t have to do as much as temp workers. Lots of favoritism.
bad,Tried to advance with the company took a test passed n all I heard was they were working to make it happen...There was a huge lack of team effort. I expected way more from a reputable company
bad,"Management trys to take advantage of you, you'll work more hours than you do and won't get paid for it and they will frown upon you if you dont work more than what you're getting paid. If you're trying to move up you have to impress one person, it's a corrupt company and everyone just blames each other to try and look good."
bad,"finding new small business locations to become point of distribution"
bad,"This job would be nice for first year college students. A nice income to make when working part time, and going to school before or after. Nice during the summer time to work in."
bad,"Management structure not good, unfair to employees, pay is not competitive.  To"
bad,What do you want from me. Like every other job in America They do not give a .... about you. Slave labor for $10.60 an hour. Don't go there unless you're really desperate.
bad,I felt like I worked a full-time job and only getting paid $100 a week. It was awful. The only good thing about it was good benefits with insurance and them paying for your school.
bad,"The longer I stay the worse I feel. It’s fast paced and you get a lot done. Though you will not get any thanks for exceeding expectations. The only motivator to do the job is the threat of loosing the job. Management has no interest in problem solving, only delegating."
bad,Typical day at the work place involves minding your own business and going about your work. The work place culture could be better  but it is manageable to say the least. Supervisors and managers dont worry nobody unless they absolutely have to.
bad,I would not give it an overall high rating. It is only part time in most cases. The hours are horrible and if you live where it snows or bad weather it has to be a state emergency then you do not have to come to work
bad,"Work you hard, but don’t provide proper water fountains for employees. Also there was mold in the ice machine so they took them away instead of replacing them. They  tell you can’t go to the snack machine because it’s stealing time. Worst place to work."
bad,"I was very excited to start work for UPS - I don’t know, there was just something ABOUT working for UPS that intrigued me. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I was hired on as a part time Package Handler, but was also “trained” (not really) as a sorter for one of the belts. That is the WORST position that one could have, which is why no one seemed to last that long. Not only did I have to sort the belt by number/wording, I also had to load my OWN 2-4 trucks! Oh, and be sure not to stack any packages outside of the trucks - you could be reprimanded for it. Everything about this position was a total letdown. Not worth the money and hard work."
bad,"I’ve barely been working at ups for 2 years (4/18/2017) and i’m already fed up with them! They’re too much into politics! They’re so worried about it they forget about their own workers well being. I remember i was walking with my pushing cart under a few slides , there were a lot of boxes coming down but it was for them to handle not me. So as i was walking a box hit me right in my arm! I looked at the supervisor running the area and he just looks at me doesn’t even ask if i’m okay. They give us 10 minute lousy breaks. I honestly never hated a job so much but"
bad,"Extremely stressful"
bad,Didn't provide enough training for truck packing job and the business of the season at christmas didn't allow for any room to learn and ask any quesions of your boss.
bad,"it was a source of income.and it was a job. I supervised and helped when need be. i really don't know what else to say. Basically it was my source of income, partially. I went to work did the best I could and came home."
bad,Ups...what can i say.......not the best place to work....management will NOT BACK YOU UP IF YOU WORK FOR A AGENCY...bear this in mind....make a mistake and kiss goodbye.....
bad,Worked in a variety of positions during my 20+ years with the company. Most positions were in a management/supervisor role.  I tried changing departments thinking it would get better but it never did.  Constant pressure from upper management.  Expect to work during every vacation. If you want to work up the ladder expect to move around.   Benefits used to be good but are chipped away at year after year.  You are just a number with no support from upper management.
bad,"Unfortunately, the UPS Store is a franchiser. I worked as a store associate for a year and management did not help me with any overwhelming rushes and orders."
bad,I did not work for UPS. I worked for the UPS Store which is individually owned. I had no dealings with UPS. I only worked at the store and nothing more
bad,"UPS does not care about it's employees. Just numbers to present to Wall street. They cover up accidents and injuries just to not pay insurance premiums, force management people to coerce doctors to put injured employees back to work, they force full time management to ""donate"" to United Way and to UPS affiliated politicians. Definitely not with the times either. Like working in the past."
bad,I didn't get to work here very long due to an injury to my legs. Turns out heavy boxes falling on you really puts a damper on the work day. From what I can remember it wasn't a bad place to work but like I said I wasn't there long.
bad,This job is stressful and slaving. the supervisors were focused on the wrong thing. They were more interested in what I like doing on the weekend than training me and judging me based off my work performance instead of how much i talk to them about my personal life.
bad,"It would constantly busy and never got help when you needed it"
bad,If you don’t kiss their butts they will make your life miserable. Mandatory overtime. No home life balance. Been forced to work six days for almost four months with no end in sight.
bad,Work is fine until someone opens their mouth about something that has nothing to do with them. And then the manager does nothing and you are sent home and never called back to resume work.
bad,"I've been working here for 8 months and management seems to get worse as time goes on. If you're not careful and aware of your worker rights (break after 3 hours, can leave after 5 hours etc.) they'll work you into the ground. And benefits need to kick in sooner. I still haven't received mine yet."
bad,"As a third shift loader I can tell you this job is not easy and is not glamorous at all, not that you should expect a warehouse job to be that. Supervisors are rarely helpful, management is sloppy and looks out for their own numbers at the expense of their employees. Unsurprisingly it is very high turnover and you can expect to be dragged around the building a lot if they have empty spots that need filling. You will find yourself tip toeing around others just because they are beyond stressed out. As for the benefits you hear so much about you need to be with the company for around a year before any of that starts kicking in, so keep that in mind if youre a student looking for tuition assistance."
bad,Poor management poor hours no paid time off not enough hours short break periods i mean what more do you want for me to say theres nothing else i can say thats good about this job
bad,"Early mornings, short shifts, loud machines and lots of sweat and quick movements. Great job for self-discipline but terrible for injuries. If you’re loading trucks wear a belt and if you’re not loading trucks you’re golden."
bad,"11 house of work "
bad,"The people there are acceptable to be around, but when you're in a hurry to complete your job. The lack of communication between the supervisors and boss was very small and lackadaisical. The rewards you are told you will receive for exceeding tasks was never awarded. The company is more concerned about a boxes than the employees."
bad,"When they say part time that's what you are."
bad,"Excellent salary and Benefits, but management is horrible.  They hover over you like you are 5 years old.  They also follow you on your delivery route unknown to the driver to make sure they are following all procedures."
bad,"Perhaps as a driver this would be a decent job. However warehouse workers are treated poorly. Not that it's abusive, but the work you do for such low pay with no chance a raise after FOUR YEARS is so bad that i'm surprised it's legal. If the workers that have higher seniority decide to stay longer, you will most likely have a max shift of 3-4 hours. That's barely $55 with no break a day. The non flexible hours do not help either. The only people who can work here are people who want something to do as a second job, love heat because there's no AC, and have no school. "
bad,Management treats you very poor and make you feel like you’re never good enough and you always need to do more or do better. They keep you in constant fear of losing your job. You get paid well and the benefits are good but you have no life outside of the job
bad,Ups is a job that targets young adults like kids still in high school because they see $15 an hour and think it’s going to be a great job. Not knowing that they will give u horrible hours and little pay on your checks. You really have to WORK for your check and is not worth the pain and toll on your body in the long run.
bad,"It was not a very pleasant place to work.  I was a manager/owner, and I had no help from upper management, very poor collaboration, and to be honest I did not like to work there, except that I could help customers which is my passion."
bad,Very Chaotic work atmosphere. New management took over and he has a lack of experience and people skills. Upper management only cares about making themselves look good. Preload is treated poorly and is unappreciated for the work that is expected of them.
bad,Did absolutely nothing for about 6 hours until people came in at around 5 that's when we at least had something to do. The people there is nice but everything was pretty boring since we had nothing to do but to sit there and look at boxes
bad,"Based on my experience, I didn't have a pleasant time at UPS. My supervisor was not interested in teaching the ropes of the position, and I left before Co-Op ended because I felt I was not gaining enough experience to utilize elsewhere. The pay was not bad, but the environment was unhealthy, and I didn't feel comfortable working there. However, not everyone's experience is the same, and I'm sure others may enjoy working there."
bad,They straight up lie to you about having a job after the holiday season. Would of never took the job otherwise. I was supposed to work in Warehouse and as drivers assistant to make extra money but I never made it in the warehouse and just worked as an assistant with absolutely no training and bare minimum hours. I actually lost money by taking this job.
bad,"The pay was good .Good base and good commisions"
bad,They expect too much out of you while paying you very little. They abuse you and your work ethic if they find out your good at one specific job they will use you until you run out. Place is dirty and no AC or fans. Little heat in winter. Hours are terrible either 3-9am loading or 8-6 driving or 5-10pm unloading.  Good job if you want to work your life away and not see friends and family
bad,I work the morning shift and i barely get 3 and 1/2 hours. I have to work a another fulltime job to pay my bills.  The benefits are good but the quality of the work is bad.
bad,Work this job if your planning on going to college during it. It’s a fast paced environment and a great workout. You definitely don’t need to go to the gym.
bad,It was by far the worst thing  had to do so far. it was so bad it made me try my hardest in school and to never give up on my dreams because it was so bad
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you want to be underpaid and have to deal with constant gossip. The people who are supposed to supervise and help the general workers constantly talk behind everyone’s back and does the opposite face to face. Then once you get over that it’s the constant low pay high stress nature of the job. You’ll constantly have to work in a hot truck with no temperature control and no breaks. Also, your entire body will be sore and you’ll feel like you’ve done a lot of work only to be met with a drastically low paycheck or direct deposit. Do not waste your time."
bad,A regular day at work chillin moving boxes not doing a lot Just waiting on trucks to come in to unload and pre load the trucks and we don’t get a break and we come in do our hours and leave
bad,The pay and benefits are good. The management is awful. Policies change day to day depending on the bosses mood.  Coworkers are immature and thrive on drama.
bad,UPS was my first plant job i ever worked at. The job was simple but challenging as I had to lift boxes that weighed more than 60 pounds. I left because my pay was cut short even when i had 30+ hours.
bad,"Union.  Very territorial.  No training and no communication.  No one communicates with any one except to complain and criticize.  Lots of paranoia, gossip and backstabbing."
bad,Too much work for an average person to do. Just another number in a unforgiving environment. I do not recommend you waste your time in this place. bad for your body
bad,UPS is a very physical job. Poor management so many arguments it was unprofessional. During the holidays it was chaos we was literally flooded with boxes.
bad,"When you start working as an Unloader, you get sent back home a lot.  Imagine coming in on the Sunrise shift (4:45am -7am) & Supervisors telling you there is a low work volume & you're not needed. Really?! And you just know this when I've forfeited my sleep & money to come in to work?!  They try to tell you that there is no way for them to know the work load beforehand which is poppycock!"
bad,"The management here at my specific building are very unprofessional and they have no respect for the employees, they will find every single little tiny imperfection and mistake you make just to take an opportunity to yell at you and tell you that you need to do better, that what you are doing isn't good enough and it needs to be better. Recently the number of boxes we are asked to move per hour has sky-rocketed. When I started just 10 months ago, it was 1,900 pieces an hour with two people unloading. Now it has been raised to 2,400 pieces an hour and still the same two people unloading which I fell is quite unreasonable. The only good part about this job is the relationships you build with the guys and girls that you work with, other than that its not good. The pay isn't good, the hours are not good, you have a hard time getting enough sleep. If you want to advance with UPS, I suggest reconsidering unless you have very very thick skin, and can put up with unprofessional management, a small amount of pay, and working between the hours of 3-9 AM."
bad,I worked at a UPS store part time. Eventually promoted to store manager. I really had little authority but could get some day-to-day stuff done. Advancement didn't exist from here if I owned the store. Ownership was mostly good until the end. Benefits were non-existent and pay was poor.
bad,They will over work you and don’t work you. They don’t care they just want the job done no matter what. They get very rude about things. And sometimes they over worked me.
bad,This job started out decent until I found out I wasn’t going to be needed for a full time position I worked two trucks and helped down the bay if I finished before others it was always either hot or cold too
bad,"Spent 11 years here. Had it's ups and downs. Want you to work 15 hours a week(25 for ""management "") and get upset if you have a full time job that takes precident over them. They also expect you to drop the other job come October because the work picks up so drastically. Now this is not required, but they play it as ""it will help with career progression"", which is a joke in itself because 11 years of experience and mastery of everything placed in front of you does not equal 6 months experience and a college degree in their eyes. I lived and breathed UPS for the last 5 years only to be essentially put in a corner and told to wait my turn behind people who didn't know what they were doing because they hold a degree in such a high regard. So, if you have a degree and you are great at sucking up. This may be the job for you."
bad,Company makes 5 billion in profits and we are in cost cutting mode. Cannot order office supplies to do our jobs. Not enough employees to work whether driving or working in warehouse.
bad,This is probably the worst managed place I’ve ever worked at. Management is always yelling at good workers. And the bad workers do what ever they want
bad,When working for UPS as a Technical Support Analysis you had to field 30-40 calls from around the world from different centers and hubs. As a customer service rep you would have to field calls from external customers who are trying to track packages. The most enjoyable part of working at UPS was the opportunity to work from home.
bad,This job was seasonal only. If they had to many people show up for work they would send you home every time. Would have injuries on the job and boxs over flowing on the belts to where you where traped in the trailers
bad,"UPS is a solid job, especially for drivers who join the union.  However, I never had the chance to go driving because I was a part time supervisor.  I became a part time supervisor so that UPS would give me tuition reimbursement.  However, in doing so it became a dead end job.  "
bad,seasonal type of job. assisted the delivery driver in delivering packages to the homes of the consumers of ordered goods. but no room for job advancement.
bad,I didn't really work for ups that long because i had a temporary job with them i was a seasonal driver helper and they barely called because i was a female .
bad,"Greet customers, process packages to ship out domestically or internationally. Help customers with any issue concerning claims which include their package."
bad,Working in an environment where so many people are located causes a lot of disruption. A lot of negative vibes and not a lot of support from supervisors and others.
bad,"Have to make sure u keep track of your hour "
bad,I was told over the phone that I would get 14.50 an hour.  Then when I showed up to sign the papers to work and already turned down another job they said.  I don't know who told you that but its 10.50 an hour.
bad,"As a truck loader, I was someone who loaded boxes onto semis. Management was always changing, and they would allow you to stay focused on a single truck, constantly having you switch around just as you were getting into a rhythm. And you would never know what your hours for the next day would be until you finished that days work."
bad,Pay was very good but the push by management to get things done during the day was really bad. Many times they had no idea what to do to correct things that happened in the field.
bad,I worked at the Ups Store not UPS. Please do not work at the one in Cameron Park. Every employee there has been treated wrongfully. You dont clock in or out
bad,Its was not too bad for high school graduate and started at UPS for long term driver. The brown ups truck driver paid well but not an great job for some one who just try to make living.
bad,Not a job to get if you are a freshman in college or attend early morning classes. management is not flexible with your school scheduling and they only care about their numbers
bad,"UPS overall is a great place to work but not at this location.  The management team is horrible with no integrity and doesn't care for their employees.  Tgey will lie in your face and work you outside of your pay grade while making every excuse in the book to keep from paying you.  They even go to great lengths to keep you from advancing within the company.  I have seen them have management no approve employees request when applying for other jobs within UPS because upper management doesn't like that employee.  I have also seen upper management limit open positions to only specific employees, which is illegal."
bad,"The hardest part was dealing with there being no heat on the trucks it gets very cold , a typical day at work is basically me and the driver delivering packages threw out our whole route"
bad,"Au niveau du salaire très bas "
bad,"Too much work and being underpaid. If you arent going to be FT management they will overwork you. Some times I have to take my work at home and I am not even getting paid for it, thats where I draw the line."
bad,"Leuke werk collega’s , fysiek zwaar werk , houden geen rekening met jou als persoon zelf."
bad,"Depending on the shift you pick it depends, there's only two shifts day and night. Those who pick the day shift work 8hrs. Those who pick the night shift works 4hrs or 5hrs sometimes even 3hrs. I worked the night shift but I have tried out the day shift every once in a while for extra money, to me it wasn't really worth it."
bad,Poor start due to ineffective employee training. Reassigning of designated driver caused change of schedule and location. Miscommunication between employer and employee.
bad,"The company is ran vary poorly , with people looked at like expendable items to be worked to death . The only reason i still with there is because of the relationship i have gained with my employees . The benefits are not that good either ."
bad,"UPS is not for everyone, its a great company if you get the chance to move up in the company, but if youre stuck at entry level, its kind of a waste of time."
bad,"Fun place to work if you didn’t have a drunk manager, better training. Owner is one sided and likes to place blame before hearing facts or both sides."
bad,"You load and unload trucks. Anything over 50 pounds requires 2 people. You have to meet quota! Its a very fast passed job."
bad,"its a very unorganized company they cheat you out of your hours you only get one 10 min break they tell you one start time and the computer will say another ex manager tells you 3:00 am  and when you clock in it will say 4:00 am,Management doesn't know how to treat their  employees."
bad,"Definitely the coordinator has NO idea do your job, I sign up for full time job and they gimme 2, 4, 6 hours a day for $11. Zero motivation for people show up everyday, cold, rain, they don't shows any importance, if you do your job really well as Driver Helper. Like disposal."
bad,Fast paced and productive. There is a chance to become permanent for the company but there are no guarantees  so you just have to show up and be teams
bad,Very fast pace great pay but no one knows what you are supposed to technically be doing so it's a lot of Chaos then when something gets messed up everyone is quick to blame someone else
bad,"Originally, I thought had high hopes for the job, but after working for a few days, I now know better."
bad,ups is a high pace job that consist of alot of lifting heavy packages and organizing. it can be a good job if they give you proper breaks and good pay for the work you do. as a man i like the challenge but its just dark in the trucks.
bad,It's a good job for someone maybe in high school or for someone is trying to earn a few bucks. The working conditions just don't match the compensation.
bad,I worked with a driver during the Christmas season as a drivers assistant. Its definitely not for people who dont like the cold which is me   and the drivers dont really respect the dont throw the box policy.
bad,Warehouse work. Picking/packing inventory for order fulfillment. Making/folding boxes on a assembly line. Affixed labels/stickers to boxes for shipment.
bad,"I didnt mind the labor part of it. However, if you're a nursing mother you are screwed.  The 10 minute break the only one they give, doesn't cover how long you would need to pump. I am pretty certain they're breaking the Ohio working nursing mother law, however it may be different with a union job. The drivers think they're better than you and that is ridiculous. Delivering packages for a living doesnt require a degree! By law after 5 hours there should be a half hour break but I am not sure about the union labor laws. This just wasn't for me and I only worked there a very short period. Also 6 day work weeks are not something they inform you of in the interview."
bad,"Poor communication, Lack of hours, Not enough work, no benefits, short notice to come to work, "
bad,You are known only by your last name and they do not care about family life. I had blew out my knee and while on leave waiting for them to find me a new position they terminated me.
bad,"The team was great, a few supervisors were also great."
bad,days were very short but the hard work made it seem longer. I really didnt make that much money cause we only woukld work about 25 hours a week maybe. The work makes your body sore and i remeber eevryday at least one person would quit
bad,"A typical day at UPS would be loading at least 2 or more trucks while hundreds of boxes came rolling down the assembly line. Cold, hot, raining, snow, it doesn't matter you were still outside loading trucks."
bad,The hardest part about the job was lifting the boxes that were too heavy and the easiest part was scanning and putting the right racks on the ups trunk
bad,"Being the only other employee aside from the manager, I had to do pretty much everything. Getting yelled at by customers was a common occurance and having no form of backup when you had nights of people lined to the door was very stressful. Would not recommend for a part time worker."
bad,"The Job I had it was hard working there it was dirty. The management team was rude also, same as the staff. But overall I can to work the work was easy but I just fault uncomfortable at the work place"
bad,This company pays good.  I was a 15 year employee of the company.  This company does not have good work life balance.  You will usually work 12-15 hour days regularly this becomes much worse during peak season.  Also the development opportunities are very difficult to understand and almost none existent.
bad,"Scheduling isn't efficient. Dealing with rude customers everyday. Processing packages, doing fax, scans and copies for customers. Printing business cards, banners, and posters."
bad,"Working as pre-loader for UPS is terrible, pure and simple. Your body will be tired all the time, and management will treat you as nothing more than a beast of burden. "
bad,"Unlonding trucks in summer is rough. "
bad,I was only called in Sedalia n Saturdays for 8-10 he's a day and was only able to work the hours no one else wanted was treated unfairly bc I was female
bad,Working at UPS was a job for the time. I tried to improve the work place but supervision did not allow it. Overall a stressful place to be and unless your friendly with your stewards you are disposable
bad,Ups is a great job if you are able to get in and past your probation period. If you are a hard worker you will get more work put on you but still get paid the same as someone else doing the same job not nearly as well.
bad,UPS upper management is bad but the work force is dedicated and family oriented. The workers and low level managers desire better. The disfunction of the uppper management teams corrupts the lower level supervisors and managers due to excess stress placed upon the work force with no clear direction or incentives to keep people employed. High turnover rate
bad,"only worked for two months job was under staffed and didn't pay great , workers were lazy and talked way to much rather then work job was simple and easy just load and unload the trucks that came back"
bad,UPS was a nice place to work but it was rough. The pay was good for part-time work. But the management didn't support you. There was always a quota to meet which was truly unrealistic.
bad,"Great pay and benefits.  Disorganized chaos, very stressful work environment, tasks are not clear and expectations are outrageous. Toxic work environment, stay away!"
bad,Year over year our message and goals changed mid year so there was no consistency in my division Global Freight Forwarding. I was offered a buyout as the company has headed in a new direction. My years at UPS were often confusing and frustrating as the UPS philosophy with management personnel is to rotate them every 3 years . This leads to inexperienced senior managers running a complex Freight Forwarding operation with no experience. This in turn made the employees feel as if the company did not care about the Freight Forwarding business unit.
bad,The amount of work needed to meet daily expectations did not really match up to the hourly wage as full-time employees were paid three to four times as much while doing less work.  While mostly a safe working area there were always several instances per day where an employee would need to exceed the safe lifting amounts because there were no other employees available to help.
bad,"A typical day at UPS is just fast paced always moving type of job. I've learned that the faster you move the less cold you'll be. Management is sweet if they like you or you've done a good job they will gift you with free ups gear an you can put your food on there tab."
bad,"running is not ideal AT ALL for those seeking advancement.  if recall correctly, running for delivery drivers is exactly that, wherein the main task at hand is to assist the driver.  pay is not exactly great, but for a SEASONAL position it should suffice for younger employees."
bad,Horrible. I do not recommend unless you really need school paid for or plan for ups to be your permanentjob for life. May wor over 12 hpurs a day during peek season.
bad,Meet up with your driver at an agreed location.  Find out how many packages are to be delivered for the day & head out to deliver them as a team at various locations
bad,"Never a Dull moment, however due to expecting and a few other things that have happened to me personally I would not tell anyone I know personally to apply. This place is more of a part time place to just get by for high school or someone who just needs a little extra cash, a great place to get in shape as well if you want to lose weight. a typical day includes logging into the system so you can get a paycheck a little over a hundred dollars if you show up everyday on time. Then you go to prep yourself for the position you where trained for in the class room. While doing your position you must multitask by bouncing around and maintaining a certain number, lower the number the harder others must work to make up for your loss. I have learned that no matter if your sick or not you have to push yourself due to lack of employment, the few who do decide to come in and work not only don't make it, but they end up quitting within two weeks maximum of being there and working. Management is amazing the only thing worth going in for everyday is seeing the managers and supervivors who actually care about the people they are over and working with. Workplace culture I have no idea about I don't hear anyone speak of or dress according to a certain religion in anyway shape or form. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the people, you have the normal ones who never want to work and just act like they work and then you have the handful of people who come in and bust it out every night just to make up for the slack of the ones who don't want to work. then you have the tiny handful"
bad,This place is ran like a mean girls school. People are unprofessional and the management turns a blind eye. Training is horrible and then they threaten your job when mistakes take place which is unrealistic.
bad,"employees would be treated bad by supervisor. Hours would be missing for employers. some employees harassed by employees. "
bad,"I didn't work for the typical UPS warehouse/ delivery. I was at a UPS Store, which happens to be a franchise that offers no raises or benefits. The job was the easiest I had ever done and it was convenient for me because it was down the street from my University and they didn't stay open during late hours of the night. Although I got every federal holiday off, eventually not being able to progress wasn't cutting it. Its a really easy and decent job."
bad,"Stressful and fast paced work.  High turnover and many frustrated employees.  The pay and benefits are great. However, there is a lack of advancement opportunities.  Great for a part time stepping stone now, whereas it used to be good for a long term career even for part time."
bad,"Great job for part-time students"
bad,"UPS only offers part time package handler positions so it does not make the job too appealing, overall it is a decent place to work but i would not recommenced it to a friend."
bad,"Not a pleasant place to work.  Employee morale is horrible, office staffing cuts are expected to begin in late 2018.  Inflexible work schedules, top-down old school management style, and employees have to constantly justify their jobs."
bad,"They over work you and make you work positions that require aditional trainging, higher pay.... poor communication from supervisors.... Hours were never steady..."
bad,"After completing driver school, being paid just above minimum wage, you are moved to the warehouse for as long as it takes till they need you to be a driver, still being paid just above minimum wage. The warehouse is a very physical job that you cannot do for more than four to five hours before being completely exhausted till the next day and the hours are very early morning. When you do get to drive, if it is during the holidays you get paid $27 per hour but once that is over it drops to $19 per hour and the normal annual raises come. If you are very young, like right out of high school, maybe but to start this job when you are you are 40 to 50 years old is very hard to do. Also, the drivers that started young, have a high percentage of them needing hip and/or knee replacements at an early age. Have no idea who the CEO is so I put yes on his approval due to the company's success."
bad,"this job was a temp job. the first time I worked there, the lead didn't do anything. She sat at her desk with her feet up, unless we were short staffed. Since I was a temp, when I got into my car accident they filled my spot and i was relocated to a different department.That department was an absolute joke. you weren't allowed to talk, and people loved to throw you under the bus. I ended up finding a better job and quitting."
bad,"The climate is very chauvinistic. Women are treated poorly."
bad,"a typical day of work would consist of our manager leaving the store leaving the other employees to work like my self. we would sort the mail, clean the store, learned how to work a program named oracle, pack fragile items, open and close the registers, manage people's private mailbox's. management was not good the manager jimmy would consistently fall asleep to let the other employees do the work as well as leave the store for hours at a time leaving the employees alone whether they knew wha they were doing or not. the workplace culture was very laid back and diverse we would dress casually and were all very adaptive. the hardest part of the job was when the manager would leave and the store would get packed to the brim. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the new people and customers from around the world that needed top ship things."
bad,"This is very high driven workplace. Management vs union employees is very disruptive. Upper management is very demanding, and everyday was a challange."
bad,"Extreme labor. No room for advancement unless you know the right people. You can have all of your education and 10+ years of experience and will still be passed up. The stress and expectations are unrealistic. This used to be THE company to work for, not any more. Turn over rate for management alone has increased by 60%"
bad,"If you like young irresponsible managers who know nothing and care nothing about a company's culture, but still are in a position to implement company strategies - then UPS is the perfect place for you."
bad,"Does not care about employees gives very short breaks, constantly rushed and given more work than anybody is prossible of handling, constantly mistreating employees"
bad,"Halen van aantallen aangiften is dagelijks de oorzaak van een hoge werkdruk en vaak is er tekort aan tijd om extra aandacht te besteden aan je werk. Huidige manager en leidinggevende hebben voldoende tijd om zelf onderling overleg te plegen maar communicatie naar de andere medewerkers  toe is er nauwelijks. Interesse is er weinig, ideeen of opmerkingen worden met regelmaat afgekapt. Jammer dat ze afgegeven signalen negeren en het zichzelf niet aantrekken."
bad,The location in Queen Anne was very steady with repeat customers and personal mailbox customers. This location is also dog friendly for those with pets.
bad,"Don't work here unless you're going to college. They give tuition reimbursement to package handlers and supervisors for up to $5,000 a year, which Is great, but that is the only perk that makes this job worthwhile. The starting pay of an hourly is only $10 an hour and they only work 4 hours a day for part-time. The work that they do is extremely physically demanding and dangerous to your health and body. The type of work that starting package handlers do does not justify the low pay rate. I could work at McDonalds and get paid $10 an hour for flipping a burger."
bad,"it was a Temp position, seems to be in the state I lived in. it was ok I guess. just didn't pay temp as much. I think it was 13.13 an hour most of the people was nice."
bad,"loading of air containers"
bad,"I feel that UPS does not follow their statements regarding employee culture.  Management is not knowledgeable in operations and procedures, nor do they work to improve this."
bad,if you don't want any help during work then this is the job for you. i don't care about saying anymore. the job is not that good and the people there have attitude problems
bad,"typically you would go in before 5AM work until 9AM, very fast paced.  unbalanced work, some people would be loading 5 trucks, while others would only be loading 2.  favoritism plays a large role in what work you are assigned."
bad,"I worked here for a couple of month. Extremely fast paced and hard on your back and knees. If you like working hard, this is a good job for you. Pay could be better."
bad,"Unloaded trucks for 2 years.  Body was sore and feet hurt from standing on the concrete. No lights in trucks most of the time, often worked in the dark."
bad,As of right now I’m still working at United parcel service and I’m looking for another job that I  can work with customers and help me get closer to business
bad,I had issues receiving my last paycheck. they tried to withhold it from me and had two previous shortages in my paychecks before that. I did lose weight with the active workspace though.
bad,Very stressful and unorganized. No benefits and never had a full time work week schedule. Supervision only cared about how fast and how much was being done
bad,This was a job i had to help pay for college. The best experience i got on this job was teamwork. It is a good part time job for a college student. The hardest part of this job is the heat and cold there was no air units in the building.
bad,Very hard on management. The culture has changed from a partnership. Management does not have the ability to make local decisions. Micromanaging is taken over the process that managers have no room to actually manage their own locations.
bad,"Very unfair pay, brother makes more working at McDonald's. Too much work for given time. Very unhealthy environment co-workers are fairly unpleasant..."
bad,Can be fast paced with little regard for any issues that may be occurring because the only thing that matters is that the trucks be filled more than ASAP
bad,"This applies to the UPS Store, not UPS in general. It is very slow paced with little professionalism. Recommended ONLY for temporary part time. Very small space, untrustworthy co workers, low pay for the amount of stress and annoyance done alone by the people who work there, just everything wrong"
bad,"none, I do not recommend, please stop asking me.  I would not recommend as a career, only as a means to live ,.  Save your money because your pay is guaranteed"
bad,Excellent benefits. Great place to work for longevity. Can advance after 30 days on the job. Do not honor all holidays as other agencies do. After 12 years I have 4 weeks of vacation a year.
bad,Fast paced environment not very many employees not the best management of time from the uper level management high turnover rate ok part time job just not managed very well at all
bad,"I would go into work at 10:00 pm go on the line and start my trucks, which I had to load before the drivers would come in, in the morning after that if u.p.s would need driver helpers I would volunteer to go and help"
bad,A start of he day at ups is very fast pace and time manageable  beacuase the manager is walking around telling everyone hey are doing good but they need to work a little faster. the hardest part of the job is lifting those heavy boxes.
bad,"Back breaking labor is a guaranteed regardless if you're a union worker or management. The work is monotonous and unfulfilling, and the only thing keeping me or anyone else there are the health benefits."
bad,UPS is far too strict and has not grown with the times. Holds on to outdated policies and when you go full-time it takes away from your having a chance at enjoying the life you worked for.
bad,"If you like being told you are never good enough and be lied to, then this is definitely the place you need to work. The pay and benefits are good, but you constantly ask yourself is it worth it."
bad,"Even though we were considered part time supervisors, we were forced to work 8 hours a day.  And during peak season, you were forced to work 10-12 hours a day plus weekends.  Some bosses can be cool but they are under a lot of pressure from the higher ups and yell at everyone."
bad,All you are is a body in a truck. They care very little about their employees unless you work there long enough to become a senior member. This place is basically a meat grinder.
bad,The amount of managers that work there that are harassing and self serving is beyond frustrating. There are a ton of great managers and people that work there but the bad highly out weigh the good.
bad,Try to stay away from this company they don’t treat you with respect. They don’t give you enough hours and the pay is bad.They only give you ten min. breaks.
bad,"A supervisor felt the need to constantly degrade and belittle all his employees and make an a** of himself. The packages were mistreated and damaged because no one cares about integrity, they just want to meet their numbers for the day."
bad,Need better management period period period period period period period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They need to actually care about the employees and not make one person like myself unload 3 53 foot trailers with 150lbs + packages called erigs full and I’d have to un load them on my own and with in 5 hours have to load 3 trailers full of the same packages.  When it’s supposed to be done by 3 people.
bad,"just fast paced stressful constant upcoming things you have to deal with on a daily basis i would not recommend anyone get this job "
bad,I worked nights so I wasn't as busy but it was a stressful job. I off loaded and reloaded truck's at night so it was cold. I also have not received my final paychecks
bad,"I worked at Worldport here in Louisville, on the ramp, for 2DA (day side). If you can find anything else, or if you have no intention of ever advancing past being a paid drone, do yourself a favor and do it. No benefits for a year, and ""part time"" just means they can cut you out after three hours. Good luck feeding a family on the union mandated $10.20 per hour. And don't bother getting a second job; UPS expects you to be available whenever they want to pull you in."
bad,Working here is almost like getting paid to workout but the work is extremely fast paced and the supervisors will be frustrating but overall ok job if in college or high school.  But not as your primary source of income
bad,was as good seasonal job to work at open flexible hours that will work with your shift good starting pay if no experience and willing to train and provides supports to you.
bad,There is always something to do when you are a preloader. Stressful job..Not enough breaks to be able to have energy to do these proading jobs.  All though you can do a lot of hours if you wanted to just by asking the managers if you can work and the managers can and will work around it to make it happen.
bad,I only worked as a seasonal helper it seems like theyre going to hire you after the holiday season they tell you to apply and no matter how long you've helped them they rarely give you a call back
bad,"Didn't work here for long enough to see the full work culture, but it looked decent for a delivery company. Not quite the most interesting, despite claims otherwise."
bad,"it was a very fast and stressful pace. no room for advancement, no communication. we were underpaid and the hours were not good. no place to eat and wit only a 10 min break which was usually cut jjst to slave again."
bad,You could cut the stress with a knife. Everyone was so rampant and rundown at the same time. Everyone operated  differently and had their own interpretation of the rules. Management was no help. A lot of the employees were kind of offensive and the pay did not fit the workload.
bad,UPS routinely tries to trap its workers in situations that can be used against them. Mangegment has a very us vs them attitude towards its workers. I would not suggest this career for someone looking for a balance between work and family.
bad,This job was very quick paced it was a little hard so many boxes come at you at one time they don't pay enough money for me to be there at 3 am in the morning slaving for $10 a hour
bad,"Great benefits, low pay and hours.  Hard work, very physical - extremely hot and humid in the summer heat and VERY cold in the winter with no heat - constant battle with the body to endure the elements your expected to work in"
bad,"If you are a college graduate, if you are looking for a job to make some money for the holidays, then you need to find somewhere else to apply to because working as a package handler at UPS for part-time is only meant for those who are more interested in working as a driver."
bad,Very bad company to work for. Bad CEO here; I would not want to go back to this company. MELLENY ANDREWS was a horrible drug addicted manager-who chased good employees and others away.
bad,"Responsible for efficiently delivering packages to customers while exhibiting a professional appearance and demeanor. Directly responsible for loading packages, ensuring prompt and correct delivery by often capturing signatures, money orders, and specified locations by customers. Maintained a proper GPS, while also being responsible for reading maps."
bad,"Insurance paid for 100% by ups"
bad,"Not a very upbeat environment, met some awesome drivers and a select few coworkers. They make you put that you take a break but you never actually do."
bad,Great place to work to pay for yourself to get thur college.people working there also are amazing.fun environment steady schedule for school and work.
bad,"Not the type of job the encourages progression, minimum wage. Great benefits but not enough pay or hours, the hardest part of the job is hours (lack of)."
bad,Was a good place to work initially however changed drastically over the years. Had young individuals right out of high school in management positions telling seasoned employees how to do their job and they were still wet behind the ears. The list goes on!
bad,"If you like to do the same thing over and over day after day, then this is the place for you.  Felt like a caged animal working for these guys.  Management always barking work faster....this gig not for most people...but again i was just loading trucks,,,not on the road delivering."
bad,UPS still has not paid me for my labor it's been over 2 months of going back and forth to try getting someone to help me still no response from any management very bad company to put your time and effort into
bad,It was a fast paced job but the place was confusing and nobody wanted to help and if they could they couldn't because they were too busy. It was a paycheck!
bad,Not for people who are used to working 40+hours. Part Time management has no power over employees. More like a high school than job. Lack of teamwork. Poor training department.
bad,supervisors are undertrained. management was poor. Even when its -5 degrees they would force you to stay outside and work or they would write you up..
bad,"Work started with cleaning the store and helping the morning customers. Packaging, shipping, photoshopping, fingerprinting, mailbox service, passport photos, and I believe there was a business card service too. Management leaned responsibility heavily on each individual, and everyone was expected to be perfect. Helped out around the shop, worked as hard as I could, plus was my first job. I remember my managers and co-workers fondly, and the last few months were bad on me. was middle hired and fired before seasonal workers. As first jobs go, it wasn't miserable. For best results, just do your job right the first time every time for all of time and you may keep your job."
bad,"I accepted a position at UPS after moving to a new city.  I heard they paid their employees well.  Starting off, I was only paid a measly $10/hour for working 3rd shift.  My checks were barely $200 after working those long, seemingly never ending shifts.  I quit."
bad,"The intensity of the work is back-breaking. There is a lack of tools/safety equipment required to avoid injury. It is easy to become injured before your first year, but there is no insurance before you get your year in."
bad,The job was easy in my opinion but it was very unorganized and management was very poor and because of this employees suffered consequences they were not responsible for. Because management did not wish to take responsibility for there mistakes and wrong doings.
bad,"Niskie zarobki,duże wymagania..Brak możliwości rozwoju,praca ciężka fizycznie nie doceniana przez pracodawcę.."
bad,management was very poor at UPS.They never listened they would always bark orders at you. They would always yell and scream at you instead of talking. They were very hipicrtitcal. They made very poor decisions. They provided no training. They would shift all the blame to the FT supervisors even if it wasn't our fault. We were expected to use the employee relations model when it came to working with our employees but when it came to them talking to us we got hammered into the ground like a railroad spike.
bad,"Poor communication. Different supervisors answer same questions with different answers and nobody is on the same page when asking about promotions. "
bad,Not for me I'm 40 and need something more stable in my life at the moment. I just don't like this job and would never do it again ever or recommend others to the company.
bad,"poor communication, non standard procedures. Favoritism. Overtime was expected and rarely given advanced notice. Management did not seem to care that you had a life at home and needed advanced time to reschedule."
bad,If you are looking into the opportunity to be a driver helper despite what is advertised you will make 10.20 a hour which for working 2-4 hours a day is basically a waste of your time. You might as well not get out of bed for $20-$40 a day before tax. $100 a week bonus is also a sham it doesn’t happen.
bad,"very hard work. job was fast paced and non-stop. met some really cool people while I worked there. keep your head down and get in and getup and you'll be just fine, don't get caught up in the high school drama."
bad,"They can improve the working organization specially for sales, unforseen meetings, with no goals, and up to late hours. "
bad,"Don't let it eat you alive. No work life balance and upper management cares nothing about the employees, operations supervisors, or customers packages."
bad,"it sucks, learned nothing, management is unresponsive, pay is unbalanced. workplace culture is terrible. the hardest part is learning daily functions without training, most enjoyable part is weekends off and early start/early end."
bad,"working at ups at times was like working with high school kids .The staff was very immature, You have to  know someone in order to advance. Most of the staff were related."
bad,"I did not care for this job. Very ghetto, people did not wnt to work. Lots of lazy people that do not care. Even management does not care. They abuse packages."
bad,"work day-stressful"
bad,"Well working for the UPS store was not good. I did like working with my coworks but the Management was not nice to their workers  or customers.."
bad,you were required to create your structure. I was unhappy in the same position for 8 years.  I needed career advancement and it was too late when I began my search.
bad,"Supervisors are to work a minimum of 10 hour days, many being 12-14 hours. the failures of the team are blamed on the one that has to take the many daily conference calls. moral is low."
bad,working hours weren't great for the pay you are receiving.  They should have had better hours and more professional management. if you are not really physically fit maybe its not the job for you.
bad,"What can I say. Unless you are going directly for school or benefits, just don't do it... and if you are working there to get school paid for then be sure you are stilling living with your parents because you simply don't enough to live on your own... or even with a roommate in a cheap apartment. Just being honest! The system doesn't work, And the hours, time of shift, lack of management care, lack of care from the union, etc etc etc... it's all just terrible."
bad,I wouldnt recommend anyone to work at UPS. UPS was stressful and it wasnt a match for me. I had to go in midnight and then go to my class. I would always be late to class. Your in a cold environment and that sucks.
bad,Working at UPS  sucks because you have to work with the elements which basically means if its hot you're going to be boiling and if its cold you're going to freeze mostly because they're to  cheap to put in an air conditioner and heater as if that wasn't enough they got you running all over the  place picking up heavy  packages weighing up to 200  pounds without help I'd also like to mention and the god awful supervisors who do absolutely nothing they just  watch while eating a snack like popcorn it's not a  movie  we (package handlers) are literally hurting ourselves to do this job which we don't get paid enough for. The starting salary for package handlers $10.20 an hour which is basically about $200 a week minus taxes which in Tennessee takes out about $30 dollars so you're getting paid $170 dollars a week to break your spine. My advice don't work here unless you have absolutely no other option.
bad,I was very straight forward delivering packages to designated locations that were labeled on each package. The hardest thing was working in the snow and cold season in NYC.
bad,Working here was so stressful for me I had to load the big trailers by myself and packages were backing up on the belt. Pay wasn't good and the hours weren't either.
bad,"if you have a family part time is not the answer but it do have some decent benefits, but if you have any type of er problem at home just be prepared not to have a job!"
bad,"Pay was not worth the hours(11pm-4am)."
bad,"very little support, lots of overtime- expected to work long hours-not very much training, never see anyone until you make a mistake that's all I have to say"
bad,The office was either too cold to bear or too hot to work.  If you don't have a relative that helped you get the job your chances of promotion is rare.  (it's who you know).  Minority are rarely promoted but instead oppressed and kept on the lowest of the toldem pole.
bad,Not applicable  I enjoy my work relationship with UPS and continue with them at this time.  My time ahs been brief but I am learning many new and expanding work related issues which directly affect the customer service that is important to this company.
bad,"paid doesn't equate the stress load, management cant relate to employees, management knows less than casual employees, employees are always under duress"
bad,I was let go here after telling MY boss that I was taking three weeks off. He told me it was fine and proud of me. I go on my vacation to Europe and whilst traveling through Germany get a random phone call. I call it back and hear a man yell my name and ask where the F I am. I told him I am in Europe. He screams that I never told him nor does he care. Tells me I got eight hours to get home. I tell him I never heard of him before. He promptly hangs up and I continue the tour.
bad,"Busy, there is work available"
bad,The jobs just wasn't for me to many problems and didn't like the people. Too many unfair rules. Also the hours were not that promising. Nothing really much to say.
bad,"Responsible for picking up, transporting, and dropping off various packages and handling shipments within a specific region."
bad,"This is was a very stressful job. The only reason that i was here is because i was selected for their school to work program when i was in high school. So i really intended on being there till i got out of school, but things happen. It isn't a bad job if you are in school and just looking for a little pocket money. Because an average paycheck there wasn't much, one paycheck made my car payment at that was it, i was broke till friday."
bad,read and load parcel into a trailer. repeat these actions over and over until the trailer is completely full and start another one. Packages must be kept upright for easy loading or unloading
bad,Very stressful for a supervisor no order lack of workers lack of communication the site i worked at barely met there monthly quotas lack of overall balance
bad,Empresa muy cuadrada el gerente de entrenamiento es obsoleto
bad,"Everyone seems underpaid. A lot of part time supervisors let power go to their heads because they are as young as 19. Some full time staff play favorites, are incompetent, or are straight up rude. People shift blame to anyone else. Work is boring and at times miserable. They don't really seem to care about their employees for the most part in my building."
bad,Good work experience. A lot of exercise involved. Good hours. Good union. Good benefits. Workers are usually good people. Management isn't bad. Good job.
bad,Requires too many hours before you can go home. No work/life balance. Too many new supervisors that are not properly trained before putting them into the operation.
bad,"Everyone's out for themselves. No comradery, and very long work days. Seasonal employees are just thrown around with very little training. Managers definitely show favoritism to certain drivers..."
bad,"Working at ups was very tiresome having to pick up and delivery packages to customers. I learned that you can easily get injured working for the company, The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages.  I enjoyed working outside except when the weather is bad"
bad,"The attempts to stay competitive in the industry and appease shareholders seems to trickle down into absurdly stupid management decisions on a daily basis. I have worked there for three years and have found the environment to be truly soul crushing. I fall into a depression thinking about going into work and I am filled with dread when the time arrives to go into work. It's a shame because the benefits are truly great, but being met with unreasonable demands and having blame hoisted on you from every direction on a daily basis makes it impossible to grin and bear it for too long."
bad,My job was supervising eight people loading packages onto trucks. I was to make sure the people put the correct package on the correct truck. I was also to make sure everyone worked in  a safe manner to not harm themselves or others.
bad,"I was hired as a part time employee, It ended up being more that, fulltime hours, very late nights. I was just misled when I signed up for the job. The coworkers I worked with were great, but they seemed very overworked."
bad,"As a driver helper, you are not guaranteed any hours of work, and it is hard to get in touch and stay in touch with managers that are suppose to assign work. Fairly easy application process."
bad,I was still in highschool and working here part time. Benefits were ok. Pay was low for the amount of physical work and responsibility pertaining to the job.
bad,it was fun to meet new people and unload trucks but there was no air conditioning and the fans barley worked. along with the fact that there was no true set time for you to start working.
bad,Typical day was busy at all times.I learned how to move at a face pace and precise the most enjoyable time was at break everyone had an upbeat attitude.
bad,"terrible manaagement,steal from checks extra hard work not enough pay terrible working conditions.the supervisors overwork you and underpay you and some of them steal form your checks do they can get bonuses."
bad,Management is only concerned with their bonuses.  They reward dishonesty as they EXPECT employees to skip lunches and breaks; whatever it takes to get the work done -- kill yourself for little or no appreciation.  Drivers are paid to be treated badly.
bad,A great place to work if you are in the union. Management need to be completely overhauled. Being in management the promotions are based on if a manager like you or not. You don't get promoted from working hard but if your manager likes your character. Promotions are based on favoritism.
bad,Working at ups is a very different experience. The people I deal with everyday witch are the same employees that come in everyday don't really care for there job not motivated at all to work.
bad,At first it was a okay place to work.  Then management changed and the people in HR changed then it all went to pot.  Tried to work with management and it went no where.
bad,"sorting mail is good but the stress you have to deal with is tiresome. The job gave me the opportunity to be able to process mail, sort and learn every location mail was to be received and outgoing."
bad,Daily i would conduct the loading of 5 areas each having 10 outbound doors with various destinations. We would load all types of parcels from smalls to irregulars and over 70's. I would ensure that all employees are working safely while following the methods and servicing the customer in a productive manner. I learned how to train and develop my employees to work for me and be successful while doing so. I always tried to create a positive atmoshphere and make the job fun and engaging. I learned that great employee relations go a long way and create a great team. Upper management has a lack of respect for all who work there. They curse and yell non stop at all employees and lower management. The hardest part of the job was working 11-15 hours a day with zero breaks and no lunch break. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees who work for me and my direct counter parts.
bad,the ups i worked at was very dusty and dirty. The managers took out the fans we used in the warehouse. It was very unbearable. They did have really good benefits.
bad,"The shifts are bad timing, you can hardly ever change it. The risk of injury is high. The Taxes that are taken out of the pay along with union dues will leave you with close to nothing. The management are inconsiderate and disrespectful."
bad,"Well where do i start. The money seems like a cool amount till you get there and for 4-5 hours straight you are pushed mentally and physically to the edge. You leave tired, sleep the day and get right back up to do it again. If you dont mind the stress and enjoy lifting and loading trucks PERFECTLY, its the job for you. I got the hang of it but with the distance i traveled to the job, and having to wait a full year for benefits, i had to part. I'd work there again, but just seasonal at best."
bad,I've been working with them for 3 years. You must be able to lift heavy packages and multitask (especially for loaders). Only pro is good benefits....
bad,"I do not feel too favorable with the supervision because there were good workers; but, not treated fairly..... Promotions were not truthfully submitted as stated."
bad,The top items one learns here is the power of spin sales.  It gives one the chance to work with a client and have them come up with the answer that you are thinking without you having to say the answer.
bad,"I hate it here! This job is one of the worst I've ever had. Luckily it's only part time and I'm not solely dependent on it. I'm looking elsewhere. The benefits aren't worth it to me. This is a job for someone who has has nothing else going for them career wise. Management is rude and hateful to the package handlers, not sure why... I've seen people there lose it over the stress of the job and the way management treats everybody."
bad,"physically demanding, and very hot working conditions. very fast paced. all jobs start off as part time. promotions based on seniority. long hours on weekends and holidays."
bad,* Package handling * unload an load trucks an cans.*  Scanning packages . * Take packages off conveyer belt if broke an put in claims. * set up station an assist other employees
bad,"A hot work environment that requires constant hard work with little down time and a short 10 minute break; reward for hard work was more hard work with very little pay until full time, which you had to wait at least 14-16 years for. Only good thing about the job was the benefits. What I learned was what I do and don't want out of a job. I'm a very hard worker with a firm work ethic, but I need to be treated with a little respect. The pay was not at all near the amount of work I put in, and often times I produced more work than necessary to keep production numbers good. I learned what it means to work hard for little reward, and I enjoyed the hard work."
bad,this is a very fast paced job that is hard on your sleep and body. have to be very serious about job and  is willing to work in all weather conditions
bad,The professionalism in that place of business is just unacceptable. I had many family emergencies that took place and never had anyone care enough to work with me.
bad,"I was unaware that such work conditions were possible in America. Many people warned me about working for them, and sure enough, it was as bad as they described. Unreal."
bad,"At UPS you find out what route you will be on then check the truck load.  Delivery the package to the home and most it is dark before we get done. Sometime you had leave it at the gate which is a problem if you someone to sign for it. One can easy get hurt running at night. The managers was great,the place were always busy."
bad,"worke to hard for less pay, was a part time job, loaded trucks to be shipped out, there was to many management in one area, the hardest part of the job was getting up ealry in the am to work as hard as u can imagine"
bad,"i would never apply there again, they do not treat people with respect, they do not support college students, the company hires people who discriminates against students."
bad,this place also sucks its very sexist and the work is exhausting. you see the laziness from those who have been there for a few years they kinda just stand around while you do the work.
bad,"good place to work when t was under the old management, very nice and polite.  the customer where friendly and very nice to me and  my coworkers.   good environment overall"
bad,"Didnt spend much time at this company, but from what I understand you could move up quickly and it can be very busy around the holidays. I hear really good things about this company."
bad,not much to say but                                                                                                                                          .
bad,"working is very hard, good compensation,medical good,very hardest part of the job,local 804 is very support to employ,a typical day at work.good medical"
bad,You have to worry if they will be taking you in the office for something stupid like have to stop and use the bathroom. They would love to fire you so they can replace you with someone making less.
bad,"I would clock-in, checking customer service about their packages. I learned about shipping. I enjoyed meeting different people.The hardest part of the job is learning the system but I learned it in a week."
bad,Good work atmosphere. They give everyone a equal opportunity to work depending where you live the make it easy for you to get picked up to get to work and the driver will drop you off close to your house at the end of your shift
bad,"Just not what I am wanting to do with the rest of my life. This job is a thankless one, their is no motivation. The benefits have drastically gone downhill since I started at UPS in 1998."
bad,"you never know what your going to due, everyday it changes, it can change while your running your route, trucks breakdown"
bad,"this job is pretty easy once you get the hang, doesnt take much to learn. can sometimes get very unorganized & nerve recking. physical job that requires alot of endurance."
bad,A typical day. There was unprofessional . The coworkers was okay but some was rude. The management was so bad . The supervisors was better than the management
bad,"A very fast paced environment , not a desk job you have to be hands on no full time position available, the hours are bad the pay is not that great at all"
bad,The workload can be crazy at times. Most of the time you are handling 2 or more trucks and you will be overwhelmed with the amount of boxes coming your way. Good job if you need it but nothing to make a career out of loading boxes.
bad,Worked in the kitchener center as Administrative Assistant the supervisors are not friendly they are all unhappy and drivers are miserable they do not get along as a team they talk about one another behind each other's backs just horrible they have Spanish people cleaning their bathrooms and their warehouse like slaves even willing for them to dig through garbage to look for something that was misplaced horrible set of people they do not know how to talk to their stuff they do not put customers first either everything every day was always a problem worked there for 4 months I'd say the first two months I dedicated myself to that job but when I realize what kind of people I was working for I just distant myself didn't do the job to the fullest until they let me go because I do not like to quit on people I had another job lined up right away stay far away from this Kitchener Centre run with your life
bad,loaded and unloaded trailers daily and lifted over 50 lbs. daily I also kept my work space in a clean organized manner daily/weekly.
bad,"system failures which lead to manual work and backlogs"
bad,"The job itself is fine, but the workload is immense, occasionally more than what can be expected to be completed by one person. Management was often unreceptive to the concerns of drivers and assistants about the volume of packages, and would rarely do much to help their employees. Also, opportunities for advancement were not a readily available as employees are made to believe at the time of their hire."
bad,Great place horrible management and its super fun as long there not doing anything illegal. People were quite enjoyable to work with it just they didn't now to run anything without getting behind
bad,They slave you as a part time worker and then send you home early so you don't get your full amount of hours. Plus they move you to a different outbound as they please that you know nothing of because of seniority.
bad,"this is a great place to start working... if you're looking for promotions, this is the place of 50-50."
bad,"I worked at UPS for 2 and a half years and let me tell you, its quite a place to work. They whip you like slaves and treat employees like garbage. If you're a second slow at moving a package they'll yell at you. Management is atrocious and have no respect for their workers they just want to get the most they can out of you. But once holiday season (peak) rolls around, they need all your help. Stick it to them and don't come in unless you really need the money. Promised college benefits that I never saw even though I asked for 3 times. Raises were ok but not enough for the work you do. Review of the company is in order."
bad,I had chance to experience delivery package to the customer. You get to meet other worker that work in the same field as you. Overall it's a wonderful place to work for.
bad,AS a temp i was going through some rough patch i hit this job and rolled with it no stranger to labor yet there was a lot of dislikes in this the temp seem to be used like man power and under privilege so i did like it much but i could do this job is i were with ups not the agency.
bad,"Unless you're a driver or at the upper management level its not worth working for this company. They will overwork you, threaten your job, expect the world from you, pay regular employees make around $30-$40 a day, entry management a set salary of $65 a day, after taxes. ""they offer benefits"", no you will EARN those benefits through lots and lots of sweat."
bad,"Needs better leardship team. Wouldn't go back to work there, more like student summer job not to make it a carrier or long term job. Safety should be taken more seriously."
bad,Working with handling packages and properly delivering to businesses and houses. Including scanning correct package and signing customers authorizing security purposes.
bad,Is a great job if you can tolerate favorites. Constantly changing conditions. while repetitively lifting objects ranging in various size and weight.
bad,"I've worked as an unloader for 6 months (which is NOT when you get the benefits, it's when you get a bonus of around $200 to $250, that's it). Some supervisors are good and some not. The good ones give us acknowledgments, honesty, and cooperation. The bad ones do the opposite and give less care about what the package handlers are going through, they just want to get things done since they are so miserable just like I was. There is dust all over the place. We all came home with black mucus and severe allergies from the dust. I sent a lot of feedback the the hub, telling them that they had to make a lot of improvements in that nasty facility. I have suffered countless bruises on my legs and arms. I left eye was bleeding during the last day at work due to an accident involving doing a wrongful thing with another employee (tossing long and heavy packages). This job is very physical, short hours, noisy enough to damage your ears, dusty, very rough, uncomfortable, unsafe, and plain miserable. UPS needs to put money into making their facilities better and safer."
bad,"I was working as a seasonal position warehouse package handler, unloading trailers. The manager was okay because their job was to make sure we work safe and not get hurt. The hardest part I have to keep up with the pace and during the summer if it 90 degree outside then it' s about 100 to 115 degree inside the trailers. Of course I bring iced water to keep me from being dehydrated. The job was not enjoyable...it was hard work."
bad,"Unfortunately, these stores are franchised, so it all depends on the owner. The guy who owned the last store I worked at was.....I'll just he wasn't the most pleasant person to be around. We didn't get any type of benefits, no insurance, sick leave, paid vacation, nothing. The only reason I stayed at this job was because of its proximity to my home and I got as many hours as I wanted."
bad,"Required to unload and load trailers everyday, parcels can weigh up to 70kg, sometimes you are alone, sometimes there's a helping hand. The job is very very physically demanding and i would NOT recommend working full time but rather part time to avoid back pain, muscle ache and stiff joints, Uniform is not provided, I would highly recommend wearing elbow pads, knee pads, wrist straps, steel toe caps and a waist belt as many people injure themselves working without them. This role will leave you heavily sweaty and tired. I witnessed several drop outs due to people giving up on the job as it was very difficult at times and you would be told ""Well do it, you have no choice or go home"". There is not much flexibility with the management as they want the trailers Loaded/Unloaded so they can get home ASAP. Sadly a lot of favoritism exists within the management, Some people will be treated with royalty, others will be treated like dirt. Management honestly does not care if you injure yourselves as you will be replaced easily. CONCLUSION: I would not recommend this job. Health is BETTER than wealth, do not be a fool and take the risk for £10ph to split your spine in two, honestly it is really not worth it. There are people who quit due to slipped disks in their spine, disastrous hernias, bruises, severe cuts and broken bones."
bad,"Company politics, no compassion for employees. Unable to grow within company, it is all about who you are friends with."
bad,"Typical day: over dispatched long hours an countless on call pick ups"
bad,"A typical day at work revolves setting up your area for operation, managing your hourly employees, and wrapping up at the end of the sort.  Advancement normally takes around 2 years if you have a degree."
bad,"I did not really fit in with the people I worked with, which was the hardest part of the job. A typical day consisted of cleaning the school."
bad,"long and hard sometimes dreadful , i learned how to operate different sorts of machines learned a bit about a warehouse , my co-workers were all pretty good people they were enjoyable to be around the hardest part of the job would be doing the actual job of loading the trailers the most enjoyable part was break time ."
bad,"Low pay. Few hours. Union wasn't helpful to me as a part timer. Benefits were good for the hours worked, but you cant make a living wage. "
bad,Good places to works. Always have a simile. I really don't have anything to say about this job.CO-workers was great. Hard part was understand how the season football game with.
bad,"Very long hours with very heavy work load.  Little support from management.  Training consists of on-line videos, between slow work periods."
bad,a very fast paced and demanding job. compensation and benefits are solid however work/life balance is very poor. good opportunity to gain management experience and school money is provided.
bad,"I was a loader, working multiple trucks.  Supervisors would throw packages that were not supposed to be there behind my fully build wall then blame me for it.  And yes, they admitted to it."
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work. I've been here for almost 2 years and the entire time has been nothing but harassment and stress. "
bad,"Typical work day consisted of being in a dimly lit trailer for 5-7 hrs and up to 12 hrs during ""peak season"". You have to load atleast 270-300 packages an hour or else you will be talked to by management. I  didn't learn anything particularly useful while working at UPS but it did help me memorize the ""sort"" ( This state goes to door 25 etc.). Most of the upper management were unqualified and only tried to mitigate the damage that major issues were causing rather than actually trying to solve them. Most superviors were kids in their 20s and early 30s who spend more time on their phones than actually getting things done with the exception of 3 out of 20+ supervisors. Never had a problem with co-workers as we were always helping each other get through the day, Each ""belt"" had a nice sense of comradery where we could joke with each other without fear of anyone would be hurt. However it was sad because in order to keep up with the high demands of UPS some people had to resort to taking drugs to keep up and not break down. The hardest part of the job was dealing with how negative the management was towards the workers. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
bad,"Being a part-time Up-loader was very difficult to get hours after peak season. Basically worked 10 hours a week. Hub supervisors are helpful but upper management needs help. Co-Workers are good people if you're respectful. Basically its non-stop box lifting. Boxes can range from 1 pound to 160 pounds. Sometimes it gets extremely busy and very fast paced. Someone with Claustrophobia would not enjoy this job, actually I would never recommend this job to someone who cant handle any sort of tight spaces. Part- time benefits are a plus regardless, which they offer health and dental after a year."
bad,"Good company to work for long term but overworked, "
bad,Poor communication and union employees result in a distrusting work environment. They claim to have an open door policy but won't listen to complaints or turn them around on you if you do point out problems. HR reps are in with management so when you complain they will work together to do what is in the best interest of the company and not the employees who was wronged.
bad,I hate this job immensly. Management and the people who work there are the only good things about it. Just another cog in the machine kind of job.
bad,"Management and employeess treated unfair requiring employees to be over worked. Management pay scale is based off a 50 hour work week yet they work 60+ with no added compensation due to being salary. Also, randomly have Saturday management meetings after working 60 hours. The salary seems very good until you take into consideration where you will be working. Living in the Bay Area is extremely expensive but so is commuting with the cost of fuel and tolls. Management does not even have time for lunch! "
bad,"Great benefits but the work is tedious and the people are very rude."
bad,Decent pay for a college student and educational reimbursement but slavish hours.  You can never get said degree because you will be too tired.  Most people in the college reimbursement program drop out of school and/or quit UPS long before they get a degree
bad,"During my tenure as a part time employee I was excited to be a part of this company that was until I realized that you work hard and it is never enough. Some of the long time employees are lazy, some supervisors are just unprofessional in the way they address employees. You are viewed as a name and number. You work hard for little pay unless you become a driver. Sometimes there are fights on the job. You have to be tough if not people look at ways to take advantage of you on the job. A lot of ghetto people, not saying that's wrong just the behavior is. "
bad,You had to work your hardest to load packages as fast as you can. You don't get in benefits in till you worked there for a full year.
bad,A typical day consist of loading trucks. Management was ok depending on the work load. My coworkers were a bit immature at times because of the ages of employees. The hardest part of the day would have to be the uncomfortable work temperature.
bad,Management and co workers were a bit loud and have no organization. They use profanity and do not help when needed. Your likely to get hurt or injured and the staff wouldnt even know. The hardest part was the supervision . No one to look up too there . The most enjoyable part about that job was probably the hours werent very long sometimes after being outside for so long.
bad,It is a company that provides benefits for its employees and their families and they are great when you need to use them. It has good hours for those working a second job.
bad,great first job if you are fresh out of high school or in college. part time work allows you the availabilty to finish homework.
bad,"I started working at UPS and was very excited to be a part of the company. I was placed with a mentor that helped to mold me into the leader that I am today. I went through some good and bad experiences as a supervisor which helped me to learn not only how to deal with different people, but also how to have a voice in the company. A typical day at work consisted of long hours, production reports, timecards, working very closely with the customer/client, and running multiple areas at one time with multiple employees reporting to me for daily job tasks and assignments. I learned great time management skills and the ability to prioritize. The employees that reported to me, as well as employees in other areas were great to work with. I never had an issue with employees taking direction. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my fellow management members. I feel that the company was very manipulative and told you what you wanted to hear while different decisions were being made in the background. My management team was very quick to throw others under the bus to better themselves rather than working as a team which UPS promotes from the beginning of the hiring process. UPS also promotes an Open Door policy which in my opinion, they do not follow through with. The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with the employees I worked directly with and those that reported to me."
bad,"Working at UPS depending on your position can be the best and worst thing you could ever do to yourself. While the company preaches safety it is one of the most unsafe companies to work for. They would rather you stand there and watch as an employee struggles to keep up with sorting boxes to the right location because the person that is unloading them is working entirely too fast for that employee. Senior Management (Full Time Supervisors) will belittle you at every turn in front of your employees despite the situation. You have to work in extreme weather conditions  including heat and cold, rain, snow etc. Always be prepared for any and everything while working at UPS."
bad,"My Logging time in UPS starts 8:30, which is usually a fresh start of the day."
bad,"great place to get a good workout, there is not a lot to learn but lifting and lowering package and safety of the work place."
bad,"Worked as a supervisor in the Ontario air hub. UPS is a great place to work however, the management in Ontario is in a constant battle with the Union. Imagine a huge multinational corporation setting very challenging metrics for the supervisor to achieve using only union associates who according to the union contract can work at their own pace no matter how slow that pace is as long as they are working in a safe manner.  After about 8 years I realized that if i did succeed then UPS would put me in a more challenging position and this cycle repeated perpetually  without pay increases until i had decided I'd had enough and resigned. It can be a great place to start a career however, it is not for everybody."
bad,"The hardest part of working at UPS is that the cirteria for advancement is not clear. The only people that the company promotes are those how are in the ""in"" crowd, not those who excel at what they contribute to the company's success."
bad,Same thing day after day. No chance to show my true ability as a Package Handler. Poor working conditions and very disorganized.
bad,This was a contract position in a fast paced call center environment where inbound calls came in from shippers regarding shipments. This was an okay job for a contract position but not a job I would want to work on a permanent basis.
bad,"meet driver, visit different places meet new people. you are out with your driver al day helping deliver and pick up packages."
bad,Its a terrible place to work. They don't provide enough hours for the amount of labor you preform and applying for other jobs within the company takes months and the supervisors are a real pain
bad,it was very dirty and the management was not nice. the benefits was the only good thing about this place. the most enjoyable part was leaving for the night.
bad,I didnt not like this job. They do not care about their wokers. They also take advantage of them as well.There is nothing else to really say about this company.
bad,"Not a good work life balance, enough said.  This is not a good place to work if you have a family or outside interest.  You never have a set schedule."
bad,"From my fifteen years at UPS, I learned that I can work with any personality type.  I was a supervisor for over ten years and had hard employees and mangers in that time.  I can relate to people regardless of their disposition and attitudes.  I found it to be my challenge to motivate union employees on a daily basis, but my efforts did achieve success in my work area.  After being at UPS and in supervision, I am confident I can achieve and do anything because of the demanding environment it was.  UPS was a steady job, but there was little opportunity for advancement in management."
bad,"""We have a really high turnover rate"", uttered by my second interviewer, should have been the alarm I needed to consider going elsewhere, but I stuck it out because of pre-conceived notions that this company was decent to work for. "
bad,calling hours long days over time yes most supervisors goods if you're a single person great job supporting the family not so goodbenefits are good expectation of pay is low
bad,"Typical day consisted of heavy lifting and moving a lot."
bad,"terrible culture and moral in facility, people hide instead of trying to work putting more pressure on other workers to fill in….would never work there again or recommend the place……terrible"
bad,"Benefits were ok, management needs more people skills, it's all about who you know"
bad,Hostile and verbally abusive work environment.  Made to feel inferior to upper management. Never good enough.  Treatment of employees. I disagree with their management  practices.
bad,"Horrible work environment, they would always want too much out of you, but didn't want to pay you more."
bad,"Ups Italia è un'azienda che ti garantisce buone possibilità per sviluppare un lavoro professionalizzante. Tuttavia l'ambiente lavorativo è molto stressante, perchè si lavora con i minuti contati e i turni di lavoro sono molto logoranti per via dell'orario."
bad,"While the healthcare and vacation time are good, the company lacks the ability to follow its own policies and the Union Contract in place. Seniority is honored at their convenience."
bad,"slavery, make you over exert yourself with no reward. short breaks and the supervisors are not very helpful."
bad,itf was a very faced place position which u learned alot which was educated
bad,Co workers are awesome and fun and you have to learn things fast in order to work at the UPS store
bad,"UPS sadly has the resources to be one of the most innovative companies in the world. Sadly, the management are slow to change and have an ""old guard"" mentality. Numbers drive the company instead of efficiency and some of the best and brightest are filtered out of UPS to work for other companies. UPS success is mostly in part to the lack of players involved in the shipping industry."
bad,"I would handle packages sort th4em to the right zip code, taking them to the right truck"
bad,My experience with UPS was  not very great. All im going to say is that some employees were very unprofessional.
bad,The Job was hard it included a lot of lifting and early hours for not enough pay and your hours weren't guaranteed.
bad,"I was a very active worker in UPS United Parcel Service warehouse and things seem to be quite hazardous to me when lifting heavy object off the rotating belts.  Another thing I could have easily become hurt or even killed in the warehouse while working.  Lots of things where compacted with machinery in motion, any packages could fall on my head.  There were no benefits to be obtain until after one year of work with UPS was fully completed.  Management here was truly poor.  The manager would bully the workers to scare them in keeping up with their duties."
bad,"Okay environment. Great supervisors, but not somewhere I will like to work again."
bad,"A typical day started at 10:20 am and finished around 7:30 pm. I started as a driver for the company, doing high volumes of deliveries. I was then promoted to the office. My duties included front reception ; Greeting customers and directing them to the appropriate sales team member or freight forwarding team member. Walk in exports; price quoting and organizing payment and export.Walk in customer package collections."
bad,"If you need a good work out plan and want to have a check every week,UPS is where you need to be. "
bad,"very nice coworkers and management"
bad,"I am not going to bash on UPS. The employees work hard and the full time drivers are paid well. However, the core of operations rest with the part time people who make it all run in the warehouses. I believe more emphasis needs to be placed upon those who are doing the heavy lifting."
bad,"Niemand spreekt engels of nederlands,waardoor samenwerking vrij moeizaam gaat. En je moet soms dozen tillen die je volgens de arbowet niet eens mag tillen"
bad,I started out loading 18 wheel trucks. Later I learned the zip codes and how to sort small packages into bins according to zip codes.
bad,"Sorting, scanning and shipping thousands of packages in a sort time span. Alot of lifting and very dusty environment."
bad,I got to be outdoors learning the job and helping the driver deliver packages. The guy i worked with was very nice bought me lunch every day and was a nice guy overall would definitely reccommend this job.
bad,"not much to say, hard work and not enough pay was the only turn off about working at UPS. The hours were insane and the requirement was very demanding as far as work load."
bad,"Not much to say beyond the title:  What can I say, they are very micro-managing and there is no team work atmosphere."
bad,"Typical day includes hard work. There's lifting, bending, standing walking, climbing, and stacking until the job is finished...only six hours!  I learned how much work goes into to shipping a person's belongings/purchases and the importance of getting the packages on the correct trailer.  Management is functional, but under high pressure to get optimum performance from ALL employees in a unionized environment, so character flaws and insensitivity usually incites some drama.  Hardest part of the job is the temperature conducive atmosphere, high turn-over rate and lackadaisical characters that are employed there; no cohesion!  Most enjoyable part of the job is payday (weekly) and the 6 hour work days (5 days a week).  Plus the benefits....gotta mention those (excellent)!!!"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of providing a packing and shipping service to customers, as well as to translate for our Spanish speaking customers which I enjoyed very much, But Management was very bad, for example i kept getting blamed for money missing from the company and it was not me that was taking money from the store"
bad,Short hours with high demands and expectations everyday. Unloaded and loaded trucks with packages everyday. Management strives for maximum productivity while also being confused at times on how to reach their goals. 
bad,Working there for Lincoln tech deff helped for the tuition reimbursment but other then that i worked there for a whole year and not one raise was given to me. went in at 8.50 and stayed at 8.50
bad,A typical day at work would be unloading trucks and i learned how to manuever objects that were three times my weight.  Management encouraged us to be safe and try not to get hurt or request help.  My co-workers were very hardworking and helpful.  The hardest part was not coming home in pain.  The most enjoyable part is we had fun while working.
bad,This is not the company for young motivated professionals. The environment is very rigid. If you like to take risks and be creative this is not the organization for you.
bad,"great work environment,co-workers great as well however this was only a part-time job"
bad,"For a 1st job , great place but other than that.... Definitely manual labor."
bad,Check inbound mail shipments.
bad,Has great benefits but the work is tiring.If you plan on going to school this would be a good part time that pays for your school.
bad,"This job is more for younger guys. If your a teenager just out of high school i recommend it, but not for someone whom has a family to feed.The pay is ok but does not uphold the work."
bad,its really not much to say about ups my typical day at work was the same every day so i had nothing special to look forward to at work my management i never really communicated with them co workers i really didnt know them it was me and the same person working together every day. the hardest part of the job would be unloading 1500 boxes and 3 hours
bad,Loaded and unloaded merchandise off planes at O'hare. Scanned merchandise before loading on planes and trucks.
bad,"Other Employee's weren't good workers. The management was good in certain area's, some of them didn't know how to do their job. Co-workers was lazy, supervisor's were lazy."
bad,They barely worked me when i was there. Wasnt really worth my time because I really needed work at that time.
bad,"I’m currently employed with Health Care UPS Supply Chain Inc. as a Quality Assurance Specialist. QPIC and RPIC. I am actively involved in maintaining quality compliance within the facility, as well as with external clients. At UPS SCS, I am grateful to not only have gained valuable hands on experience & knowledge in health care regulation, quality and distribution, but also have sharpened essential skills for personal growth. My dedication, reliability and hardworking character have brought positive contribution to past and current employers and appreciation from the colleagues and seniors whom I worked with."
bad,Fast paced environment working with a good team. Very poor compensation with few raises. Advancement opportunities were rare.
bad,Meet up with the driver daily. Helped deliver parcels to there right address.
bad,A Union company based on more than 50% part-time employees. Most all full-time hourly Union positions are filled from the part-time positions per the bargaining unit contract. Part-time employees start at $8.50 per hour with no health or welfare benefits for ONE YEAR. Part-time employees in our area often wait 10-14 years to become full-time.
bad,The employees I worked with are a bunch of shady lairs. This was towards the end of my employement there though.
bad,Take inbound calls and assist customer with tracking their packages
bad,"Fast paced ,hott conditions and not enough hours."
bad,"Distributing mail throughout the facility by way of a process called “scanning”, sorted mail by County, City, State and Zip code and also sacking small mail parcels."
bad,it was fast work and had to stay on schedule everyday. hardest thing was working in crazy weather. but still had fun while doing it.
bad,"I did unloading of the semis in the morning and, first off, the hours are horrible... like 4:30am-6:30am... Second, it's slave driven... lol what that means is there's SERIOUSLY people going back and forth from semi to semi yelling at people ""Come on! Lets Go! We only have 8 more semis!"" lol It's a joke, especially when your literally lifting 40-70lb. packages again and again and again! (think every 3 seconds touching a new package for a few hours on end...)"
bad,Unload trucks. I shouldn't have stayed there as long as i did.
bad,"It starts off as a good place becasue they offer you education reimbursement but thats it. The hours are horrible, pay is horrible, they(supervision) don't care about the lives of the employees by any means. You can work as hard as you want to and you will never move up no matter what. UPS is all about the time that you have worked there. Benefits are great because its free thats the only thing that is good. They are a union company and the union is weak because it doesn't take care of the employees when the supervisors have done things wrong. Only thing the union is good for is the benefits, pay, and keeping the sorry employees that don't work hard and get away with everything. Don't take a job at UPS it will take years to become a full time employee. When I say year I mean 6-8 years."
bad,"As a PT Operations (preload) supervisor, my days are never easy or can I help them get either. Little to no support from managers, also."
bad,4 hours a night as a loader. Self starter loading a truck. Hard work and working as a team.
bad,This was just a bridge job from one to the next.. Good place to work if you have low ambition.
bad,it was cool i just hate the pay and the hours they gave me had me working in the brinx thats to far for me
bad,"Worked here for the night shift before switching to twilight shift. The night shift gets the most hours of the 3 main shifts, about 3.5 -5.5 hours, but is run by an awful manager who constantly berates the minimum wage employees for not working hard enough. The HR manager who hired me told me that this hub offers tuition reimbursement, but it is only available to supervisors and is the main selling point for UPS being a reputable company. They also only give out breaks after 3.5 hours, which is technically illegal and their breaks are only 8 minutes long.maiselling"
bad,they work you to death in inhuman conditions. a typical day would start and with no heat in the winter time it was freezing in the warehouse. the management was horrible. the only part I enjoyed was the people I worked with other employees. the hardest part is keeping your cool when your thoughts and concerns are not heard.
bad,"Unless you like getting up before dawn, it's not the best. Management is poor, they only care if you unload something fast. They only make ""friends"" with select people. Workplace is dusty and dirty. Only a few months out of the year is it busy, it slows down a lot. Pay is ok, but if you only work a few hours a week, the pay per hour isn't worth it."
bad,"Three times,they made me cut my hair in 3 consecutive days when I started.There uniforms are probably the worst in the delivery business.im not trashing I'm sure some policies have changed."
bad,I have never heard an employees here say they actually like working here. Plenty will say they like what they do but cant stand the company. You will always be under the microscope regardless of how hard you try or how good you are or how long you have been here trying your best. Management is tolerable at best but wont be friendly.
bad,you will be worked here they have good benefits management doesn't care about you they want you to do the impossible work starts earlier at times peak season you'll be living at work
bad,Please be mindful when applying to position starting to turn into more of a call center atmosphere which is not what I came there to do. there is no set pay scale so you never know what your commission is actually based off
bad,"A typical day at work would be busy but half way through the shift it would be slow and we were told to go home early. Management is not very good, communication skills are terrible and when you do ask questions they give you attitude. I was a seasonal worker, I knew it was not a temporary job but they literary told us the day of that it was our last day. Before that occurred we had kept bugging about a last week noticed and still got no answer."
bad,"The company it's a good company but not management . You can work over 100,000 a year , as a driver but first you got to get into the union which that is hard to do and become a senior driver but most of the time they don't allow you especially today . when I was a driver you work 30 days and you're in the union . now they give your hard time to get into the union so good luck , Work balance not at this company good luck on that one . You go to work early in the morning and you don't come home until all the packages off the truck that can be 9 o'clock at night 10 o'clock at night and so on . Nowadays at UPS They like to hire Spanish people and the reason for that is because they can work them without them knowing the union rules Spanish people don't follow the bargaining agreement rules From the union . So they like to hire young Spanish people they work them without lunch ."
bad,"-I do not work at a warehouse or as a driver, I am an employee at a UPS Store."
bad,"During the time of my employment with UPS, I did not enjoy the work environment. I feel as though none of the employees really wanted to come for the job or experience as much as it was for the check. Also, the management wasn’t the best, they always overlooked employee requests. The warehouse was hot and dirty as well as the break area. I just did not enjoy my time at UPS."
bad,"easily the worst place I have worked. Middle management is rude and very disrespectful. I cannot count the times I have said ""we can go talk to HR"" when speaking with middle management. Upper management has no idea what is going on. They care more about the packages than the employees. they will tell you to play off an injury so that it won't mess up their bonus (gain share). This is all on the night shift, so I do not know how it is for other shifts. other than that the job is extremely easy, but the people make it suck. Do not work night shift or if you do go into the operation side not the training side."
bad,"You are your production number, not a person. Work life balance is horrible. Union employees have some protection, while non union are worked to death."
bad,"Timings for work change everyday, no respect for human values, supervisor will text anytime after 12 to 2.30 pm around 2 to 3 hours before to let you know about work timings"
bad,Can not provide one it is confidential I signed off on itvery bad work environment so many saftey hazards only 10 minute break in 5 hour shift damaged packages I was on time to work every day I say I was doing such a great job I was according to detail too I worked hard for my 2 weeks hoping ups hired me on but no ups still let me go
bad,I was to work there for the holiday season. The management and trainers were down to earth and not unreasonable but they didn't hide that it was dangerous to work at the Commerce City or Aurora locations. It was labor intensive and stressful when things got busy.
bad,Contacting anyone is impossible because no one doesn't give their phone numbers to anyone. Hours are bad because when you finish early that's it you're done.
bad,"Like most large corporations that need large numbers of employees doing menial tasks, you are completely and utterly expendable. The one saving grace is the teamster's union, which makes firing warehouse employees nearly impossible unless you really do something egregiously stupid. That being said good work is never rewarded (often the opposite, you will be saddled with more responsibilities) and other employees skate by doing essentially nothing all day. On top of that the Union engages with some companies with predatory sales practices, and will routinely flood your inbox with advertisements for companies that will screw you over. "
bad,"The warehouses are an open bay warehouses with no air-conditioning, the managers only cared about the numbers. They would also transfer you to a different area within a week if you couldn't meet the necessary production rate."
bad,"Very fast paced and no time to relax. You will lose weight at this job which is the only good part about it. They will tell you that you will most likely be hired on full time after the seasonal period is over, but that's a lie. Job culture is a joke and just silly. You have to shave clean or you can keep a mustache but, it has to be nearly trimmed with no hairs going past your lip. If you have or want to keep your beard, don't work here."
bad,Working at UPS isn't too hard if you don't mind lifting boxes and stacking them into walls. The pay is rather decent and the benefits aren't anything to complain about. But that is as far as I can go in describing my experience working there. I had a really hard time working as a part timer employee since the hours a various and the start times are random. One of the main issues I had while working there was how poor management was. Management is also the reason why staffing was an issue as employees were quitting on a weekly basis which resulted and harder workloads for the little employees that worked the shift. You have to be a very patient individual to keep a peace of mind under how management treats their employees.  The second main reason why I found it to be a very difficult place to work is the poor scheduling that determines how long you have to work there. Some days  the train comes late and we'd have to take a lunch ( which you don't get paid for) and having to stay extra longer than you would like. However they do work with you if you have any personal issues or have schooling obligations if you are enrolled in a high school.Work  there at your own risk.
bad,"I have been with the company for 5+ years now and now more than ever, I am ready to leave. You have the union, you have health insurance and paid time off. But upper level management is the worst. The promotion process of the company is very bad. Few good managers, majority unless and no people skills. Absolutely done with UPS!"
bad,"Mis guidance and leading of any leadership roles for any employees there.Work here to learn your package/packages get tossed by the equal hiring opportunity they speak of.Not to mention if you don’t join the union don’t expect any missed hours to appear on your check.."
bad,"The work throughout the peak season was getting done at the good rate of time, there was no need for (so called) Supervisors getting in a person's face and degrading them every few minutes complaining that they are not moving fast enough. Also, the times that they expect you be at work continuously change so having another job prior to going to this one can be difficult at times."
bad,"If you work on the preload you start early, its fast paced and heavy work at times. If your local sort its relaxed and easy going. Males benefit more."
bad,When you work part time your treated like an outsider full time staff are looked after a lot better and some drivers won’t even speak to you .Not provided with uniform .
bad,"The company is very conservative and the culture is not for everyone.  The older generation has worked for UPS for 25+ years and the younger generation comes into the company to learn skills, only to be lured away by competitors.  There is high attrition and you are always expected to cover your job and the work of others due to constant staffing issues. Work/Life balance is non-existent, especially during peak periods. Old-school UPS Managers expect you to place your job first, above all else. It is ""brown to the bone"" for a reason. Outdated and antiquated company policies do not attract or retain younger workers (example:  facial hair policy). Benefits and pay are excellent if you are willing to put in the time, but once you have been there for several years, your pay increase is less than that of a peer who has less length of service. You may have the same performance rating, but they will receive a higher increase because they are lower in the pay-band.  Very unfair!  Long-time management level employees are not rewarded - instead they receive less of a merit increase for being too high in the pay-band or near the max for their pay-band. Advancement is limited unless you are willing to relocate."
bad,"Not too long ago I still loved working for UPS, but I have found this year that there is no real reward for hard work, just sucking up. As supervisors we are salaried at 50 hours per week, but that is the least amount of time I work often. If you're not getting 6 hours of sleep or less you're often considered, 'not doing your part'. They have no sense of how to treat people well and nicely, and only do so once it becomes clear they plan to quit."
bad,"a typical work night can consist of not having equipment to work with and you are trying to look ""busy""...Management tries to do their best to accomodate but sometimes fall short. Morale can be low sometimes because of lack of communication in dispatch and management."
bad,Complete lack of communication management is a serious joke failed to communicate at all after he lost his property and blamed it on me. We had the seasonal diad things mine either went haywire or was simply junk. Fired day before Christmas due to a sick child.  Never got that exit interview.  They promised many things only to lie.
bad,"Okay, don't get me wrong for it being my first job at 17 it gave me some money but, the stress while being in school wasn't worth it. And since the college I was attending wasn't eligible for the tuition benefits I Had To Leave. Wouldn't Recommend at All"
bad,Will terminated you if you do not meet their standards. After being lied to about job security! DTS school is not in the requirements for this job. After hired it's a completely surprise!!
bad,it was and ok job to say it was seasonal...i only didnt think it was fair for us to clock it upon arrival and clock out when leaving if the supervisors are going to revise your time anyway.... u have to check and make sure your time is correct or if they even put it in.... supervisors feel they are better than u... can be disrespectful if you let them... the checks are not worth it
bad,Ups pay is horrible. Can’t really live off of there pay under paid. It’s a job for high schoolers. Or college students. Not for someone looking to live off of
bad,"I was hired and trained as a fulltime driver, but after going through weeks of training and passing the class and road test with a 90%+ grade in both. A group of us who passed the class would show up early every morning for work only to stand around like we were at a day labor pool hoping to get a route that would only be for 2.5hrs. After  2 full weeks on this and only going on 3 routes, they "
bad,"It was only a 6 week gig.  8 mile walking with a pushcart (really, in 2018 and 2019) with no bathrooms. Tons of heavy lifting.  No country for old ladies (like me). But it had its fun elements and knowng it would end soon always helped, you have to bend the rules to stay safe and take care of yourself, I might do it again if I can use my car and be compensated for gas, etc. Its a quick but not easy way to earn some holiday cash."
bad,They do not train you well at UPS. You literally get thrust into it and it is sink or swim. I had to call in for a personal reason and I asked what start time was on Monday and the lady either misinformed me or lied.
bad,"Ups is pure hard labor. If your not up for physical strain then uls isnt the job for you. Once you get past the physical endurance and want to level up to managment, your going to have to deal with alot of prejudice ppl with the desire to break you"
bad,"I was an air operations supervisor, I worked harder than the employees I was in charge of managing. They were lazy, could talk to me any type of way, I had NO support from upper management. They needed warm bodies every night, I would get an employee taken from my hub and moved to another and we would be short staffed and have to work twice as hard. I worked in a blame everyone else but yourself type of environment."
bad,"Shift start times usually only move by about 15 minutes or so per day (every week, this changes by about 2 hours over the course of the year) but the ending time of the shift ranges well over an hour. If special events are occurring (such as prime day, beginning of peak season, etc.) management will post pieces of paper around the building sometimes just a few days before the extra shift and say that the shift is mandatory, but not go around telling people. If you are a full time student, expect to not have time to do anything but study, and expect time after the shift to go to waste. They also make a lot of decisions that don't make any sense, such as sending out trucks at the end of the night that aren't full, don't have to leave immediately, and have a bunch of packages waiting to be loaded into them and also not telling the belt supervisors when their belt is about to get hit with a ton of packages so the belt supervisor can prepare. Also, work hard but don't kill yourself or they will expect that daily. If you're a really fast loader/unloader, expect to have to compensate for slower coworkers."
bad,"Great benefits. Part time for many years but you get full benefits. (Medical, dental, vision) You need to work at least 8+ years to get full time. Very labor intensive.  Sometimes you unload a trailer on your own and you will go home sore/achy."
bad,UPS environment is very physical and I guaranteed to you that you will break a sweat. Many people are there for years and it is so hard to get the good positions there.
bad,"With timely manner asks to perform the job with limited staffing to keep the company at its expenses.  The cutting cost affected the overtime available but yet expect productivity to still continue its course.  With results never good enough, the constant pressure and stress on a daily basis makes the environment suffocating.  Knowingly on a daily basis of no recognition for the job you do just drains the any energy left.   Defiantly safety is a priority regardless and they provide great benefits to those who are union employees, unfortunately not for management.  Management at UPS means nothing because you are treated badly under suppressible conditions."
bad,"It was ok at first but once you see how crazy things get with the boxes you'll think twice plus the pay never added up even when they'd lure you in with the whole making 14.50 an hour thing , they would send you home whenever they felt like it as well just not worth getting injured or working too hard over especially if your check wont be more than 300 a week  , plus it's temporary so don't get too comfortable unless you really plan on working there for a long time."
bad,I personally would not recommend anyone try working for this company during in the Holiday season. They work you entirely too hard not a lot of room for mistakes. Being a loader was tough physical labor. Too many products not enough workers on the docks. This company also likes to work their employees through their entire shift before termination.
bad,"So I recently just quit today and my overall take on this job is its a very fast paced job, you gotta be very fast unloading and loading packages and it’s very physical and demanding, I would sweat and get my shirt soaked because of how hard and fast I have to go and it’s not worth 14 bucks a hour and the atmosphere was just depressing, the only good part of it was the people were nice and that’s it."
bad,"Working there is stressful and working at night every day is pretty taxing on health. If you want advancement then it is possible but doesn't come easy and might not be worth the trouble. Lost a lot of weight, good exercise."
bad,Its an awful place to seek personal growth in spite of having great people amongst one-self. You will encounter  people in your current situation that will appeal to you and thats about the only good thing about this company.
bad,Employees are constantly asked to do more than their fair share. Stay working without pay. Very physical job but there's mental also. Management is always cut throat and condescending.
bad,I found hight competition in Italian department among colleagues. Pay attention. I suggest of speak less of your future.  Enviroment is not how you can see it.
bad,"Occupa circa 10/11 ore al giorno,lavoro piacevole ma in determinati periodi veramente stressante..."
bad,"I worked temporarily for UPS during the holiday season as a Driver Helper Coordinator. It was hard, crazy, and stressful. There were a lot of responsibilities. The person who trained me QUIT due to the stress! The job consisted of matching temporary employees to drivers to assist the drivers with holiday deliveries. First of all-you would get the schedule of drivers who needed helpers only an HOUR before you had to match them up with a temporary person. You had to coordinate where the people lived with the pick up points because most of the temporary helpers didn't have cars! Also, many of the temporary employees were unreliable. Additionally, the drivers balked CONSTANTLY about getting a helper! I would have to fight the drivers to take the helpers! So it was a constant struggle. Additionally, I had to call people the morning OF the workday to try to get them to show up when others called out. There were also many applications and phones I was responsible for monitoring as well. It was just too much. Also, the 'lunchroom' consisted a few tables and hard plastic benches and NO SINK or REFRIGERATOR. There was no lounge or anywhere to take a break from the madness. It appeared to me that they didn't encourage any type of relaxing. However, the bright side was that the employees were knowledgeable and dedicated. The manager was wonderful as well. I really liked them and enjoyed working with them. But the job-terrible. I would never work there again."
bad,Management never has your back treat you like an animal so they can get their bonuses... Expected to do for them but when worker asks for something that needs to be done it gets set aside...
bad,"Nothing to say I believe I covered it all previously, when answering your questions, it seems to be self explanatory by the questions that I answered for this"
bad,Demanding and fast paced environment as a package handler. It can be stressful mentally and physically whenever your supervisors are constantly on you about pace especially if you’re young or new to the hub. I was one of the favorites in the hub because I bust my butt so I didn’t have to hear anyone’s mouth.
bad,"- Ancient technology in contrast to other logistics companies."
bad,"The only thing good about working at UPS is the benefits, but that's if you're gonna work here for over a year. Highly recommend going to school if you work here, it's not worth working warehouse as a career.  If you want to be a driver, then good luck on the wait list. the time you wait to be offered a driver position is the same amount of time to finish school."
bad,"Management was the worst part about working at UPS, when a problem came up it was never taken care of and they withheld money from me and when they did pay me they only paid me half of what they owed me."
bad,"what can one say about a call center job, you listen to people B itch and think they are the only ones getting packages. people think since they paid the lowest price for delivery they should get a guaranteed time and red carpet service. Supervisors they bring in knew nothing, ask a question and usually goes un answered"
bad,"UPS says they will promote from within but does not act on it. They like to hire for higher positions with candidates that have no experience logistics, shipping, receiving. Poor training habits."
bad,"They will promise you a promotion for ""good work"" but give it to everyone else around you first. They will tell you you're a great worker, until they find someone better. They treated work place injuries as a liability instead of trying to help."
bad,"The money is good for drivers positions but not good for facility positions. Management does not care too much about seasonal help. Micro Managing is a common practice and threats to employees are normal behavior. No excuses for accidents, misdeliveries, or being late with a package are accepted, under no circumstances. The pay makes it worth putting up with, knowing it is only temporary. They will tell you that you have a chance of being kept on full time, but it is very rare if that happens, and if you are kept, you lose the drivers position and are put on the loading dock as a loader or package sorter and your pay drops drastically. It can take years before you are selected for a full-time drivers position."
bad,The work there was always more strenuous then it needed to be. The warehouse was always filthy and had things strewn about that would cut you as you moved by them.
bad,I Only Got A 10 Min Break & I Had To Leave All Of My Belongings In The Car. People Had Bad Hygiene Or They Were Just Rude. Nobody Greeted You When You Come To Work Nor When You Leave. Very Bad Professionalism.
bad,"Work Conditions:"
bad,"Only 3-4 hour work days if you're new until you gain seniority."
bad,"The typical day is very fast paced. Depending on how your driver is, then the day could go more enjoyable or not. It is very fast paced and you burn a lot of calories. You usually run around from door to door. You have to be reliable."
bad,"Typical day included managing materials activities in an aviation based position which included: "
bad,"I was really looking forward to being a driver helper during the peak season (Thanksgiving through Christmas/New Years) for UPS. As soon as I got the job, I was told I would be making $13 an hour. My first paycheck was at the rate of $10.35 an hour. Every week management and supervisors said they were working to fix it. However, it was never fixed, and I never made my promised pay. They even said they would re compensate the driver helpers at the end of the peak season but that never happened either. It ended up being very annoying to deal with. "
bad,"They'll move you all around so you dont have a permanent job that you can learn. Managers arent the best at training, and if they think you aren't learning the job they'll just fire you; even though you've been doing 10 different jobs"
bad,Fast paced no set hours.Learned how to load trailers. Poor management. Stressful... Hardest part you don't know your hours and loading. It would make a great part time job and work your self up to full time
bad,This is good job to work and good Benefits but it’s not for me that The hours are short I need more hours the Brakes are you get are short And it’s too far
bad,I learned that everybody is different and ups shows that by disrespecting there employees and management I'm happy that I left because they was already trying to get me to leave cause i didn't like the way they was treating me
bad,They are very mean to their employees. They treat you just like a number and not a person. They make you work extended hours even if you ask for a 8 hour day.
bad,The job was fast paced with little to no help from others unless they decide to help you. Management is poor to say the least as they don’t care what you do and they purposely try to catch u messing up to give them a reason to fire you.
bad,"Needs a new manager. The one in charge now is very rude  and seems to bully the other managers, supervisors, and just workers in general. Does not listen to anyone else, acts like an alpha-male and is very arrogant. The other workers for the most part are very friendly and easy to work with."
bad,"Hired as a driver for one rate, then to work you had to agree to part-time hours 3-4 per day at 1/3rd of the rate agreed to.  Management on site was good, but had hands tied to change anything to make the operation more productive."
bad,UPS is a place that utilizes proprietary metrics to hold you and your subordinates accountable to.  These metrics do not mean anything since they are just numbers written on a piece of paper.  None of these metrics make any difference to the stock price or dividend.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get the packages loaded and delivered so that the company morale is not diminished.  The best part of your day is when you walk out of the door.
bad,"Their focus on operations and the bottom line resulted in neglect of their employees. The union is no good, they're in the company's pocket. The high turnover leads to overextension of workers and the union stewards are a joke at fixing problems."
bad,"This job is a last resort for those who need a job. Ok pay but not enough for some of the work you have to do. You get very little help, a lot of times you work by yourself."
bad,The benefits were great but the environment wasn't. If you can put up with the environment and harassment from managers I would go for it. Ita a good part-time job for school and during the holiday season you can make pretty good money.
bad,Be prepared for a fast paced environment and a lot of lifting and twisting. Have to be able to keep up with production line and keep work area as clear as possible
bad,"Overtime all the time, don't make plans, expect plans, desire to run errands or tend to ANYTHING but getting their shipments out! They do not care if fatigue sets in. You are required to work 50, 60 & 70 hour weeks. When your employed by UPS you are expected to do nothing but the work required for your position. Any outside life or family is of no concern to them."
bad,Managers need employee relations skills. too many politics involve with work and way too many managers micro managing. No team work amongst managers. Cut throat! Blunt Racism people need to stop!   What does this CEO rating has to do with work environment??  Never met him/her...
bad,"Ups wants you to pack boxes a certain way like for example making ""perfect t's"" and make your shelf level centered and always build to the top. But they expect you to not get backed up with boxes especially for your first job"
bad,"Good money for what you do, but the work/life balance is absolutely terrible. If you're a person that loves overtime so you can trade any family or home time for extra cash, you'd love it here. If you hate spending time with your family during the holidays give them a call; I'm sure they'd love to have you. "
bad,No room for promotions and work to many hours fast paste job always on the go and little recognition for all the hard work that you do as a hard worker
bad,UPS is still trying to figure out quite a few things. Corporate changes procedures too often and it leaves management changing their own which makes it a lot harder for managers to do their jobs because they're constantly training and stressed out. This energy rolls down and you then have a frustrated company. Very toxic work environment.
bad,"UPS is a great place to work if you are ok with being hot, overworked, under paid, and often asked to do things by  yourself that require multiple people."
bad,"Compensation is great (pay, benefits, pension, ect)."
bad,Not sure if it was the location i worked at but higher management (FT supervisors) was horrible and didn't follow guidelines and regulations from the company. PT supervisors were the only part of management that I was able to get along with. Horrible work environment and pay didn't really seem great with all the responsibilities and other conditions given.
bad,Pay is the only reason to work at UPS. I have worked 2 positions there and both sides of management were horrible. Communication sucks and they constantly remind you if you get fired that you can never work for UPS again (in any state) .
bad,The poor workplace started with the management team. They treated you like garbage and made your daily tasks nearly impossible due to their incompetence. The building was in poor shape and things broke down regularly. They did offer free health care after a year and tuition reimbursement however.
bad,"I had a good experience at ups a good parttime job it help complete some things i need to"
bad,"This is a active job, if your slow and show you don't want to work there they will get rid of you. Graveyard shift is the worst as long as you are at work before start time(on start time is late) your good. Some supervisor's have no communication which is bad but you must work as directed. This job has a pension at minimum 5 years which is good. You will sweat and freeze at this job,this job is not for everyone expecially lazy people! One last thing this job will mess up your sleep habits!"
bad,It's a good job if u need benefits other than tht it's not a job tht can support one living without getting a second job so I wouldn't recommend a kid out of high school this job unless he just wants the benefits.
bad,"stay an employee. Joining management was a mistake i overlooked. work life balance is horrid, but the pay is there. Hectic environment but you will have hours if you work, full time is hard to come by however."
bad,"A typical day at work, stressful. you learn most of the time on your own, despite the training provide online, monthly. the management is mainly impolite. the multiculture aspect is at 100%, employee from all over the place. the hardest part of the job is to be push to the limit and work in a team missing members, and being treated as a #"
bad,"UPS is a hard working business! But very unorganized! As far as scheduling, and paychecks!. After the first two pay checks my money began to decrease (missing money from paycheck) due to company difficulties."
bad,"One gets to play life-sized tetris for hours with packages with weights ranging from one ounce to 150 pounds. Warehouse environment with docking doors opening and closing constantly, so be prepared to feel the weather."
bad,Excellent job security. Management and people skills training. Demanding hours. Like the warehousing job. Upper management is green in for the industry
bad,"UPS is a very stressful place to work, and the pay does not compensate you for the work you put in. The supervisors are overworked and underpaid, and always hollering at you to work faster."
bad,"Working for UPS Freight is very stressful, there are many deadlines and goals that need to be met.  On many occasions, I did not have the tools to meet or exceed my goals."
bad,"While UPS used to pride itself on promotions from within and providing reasons for staying with the company, they are currently culling long serving, dedicated employees and replacing them with kids just out of school or sending jobs offshore. The culture they used to brag about no longer exists"
bad,"If you are any good at your job you will be taken advantage of. Fact. Management do not care about your life outside of their gates. If given too much work to do, you are expected/sometimes forced to stop out til completed"
bad,Extremely stressful pace. Far to top heavy in useless management positions. Treated like garbage if you are a seasonal hire. Don't even think of getting hurt on job. It is always your fault. Even when it is not!
bad,You have a lot of people walking out from the job on a first date it's pretty much the person's responsibility that is there to cover any of the items that come down on that line so basically we're doing someone else's job at the same rate that you're getting paid for doing one position I will recommend this job I would not recommend
bad,this job is a god way to advance throughout the company. workplace culture is good good pay benefits the job was great if you love outdoors and the rain.
bad,"It's hot and humid in the summer and cold during the winter. The harder you work the more work is given to you, with the same amount of time to do it."
bad,not a fun place to work. underappriciated you can never get done fast enough. good insurance and decent money managment is very difficult to work for.
bad,"There just was not enough hours available, that went to those who been there longer."
bad,If you want to go to school then ups is the place to go. they will pay for your college tuition if you pass your classes. you get Bonuses every semester if you do good.
bad,"I wasnt happy working in an old stagnant environment where nobody wants to learn or change. Bureaucratic environment demoralize you on every step."
bad,"The work is far too difficult for the measly, barely-above-minimum wage that they give. You must work Monday to Friday but are only guaranteed 15 hours a week, however you are expected to have full time availabilities (you could be working anywhere between noon and 7pm). They demand nearly impossible goals that are basically never met by anyone, such as 950 packages sorted per hour in small sort (when most average 600-700) or 250 packages when loading trucks (which I don't believe I've ever seen reached - closest was just over 200). Goals like this that require so much effort are insulting when they refuse to pay anything above a poverty wage to the package handlers. Instead of a decent wage, they'll often buy pizza or enter you in a raffle to win an iPad or things like this, but these things do not pay the bills."
bad,"If you get offered a position here, run the other way, they work you 50-70 hrs, pay is minimal, management was horrendous more worried about numbers than actual accounting work."
bad,You will be taken advantage of here. There is no room for improvement and have a good time taking medical leave. You will also not get any benefits or paid very well at that.
bad,"A very good part time jobs not something if seeking full time employment. If you can apply as a driver first. Way better pay and more hours, less physical."
bad,"The facility is dirty and no one is able to give definitive answers to simple questions. Management is lacking and no one seems to care about their jobs. Pay is low and depending on how long you work there, you may be paid less than other employees. With the amount of pay that you do get, it is not enough to pay for living expenses and working extra hours can be daunting. Recommended for someone looking for temporary employment, unless you really want to work in this company."
bad,"i didnt like my hours, they were short we barley got 5 hours a day because everyone their is a part-time worker unless your are a supervisor of any kind"
bad,"The job will give you great benefits for the hours you work and what you do, but the work is hard, stressful, and varies day by day. Some days we need to let a lot of employees go as soon as they walk in the door because of the lack of work. if you have a family and need medical coverage and benefits like that, do it, but otherwise stay away. It is VERY labor intensive work."
bad,"The place was filthy and the equipment broke fairly often. The late nights and fast, unforgiving pace of the work itself can and will wear you down. The rate with which new hires quit was alarming because the initial gauntlet they put you through can be unbearable most days, since those with seniority are given many perks, but actually getting to that point is tedious and unforgiving. "
bad,"Expect physical labor. Everyone starts as a loader or unloader and your manager tends not to care about you or your problems, only your production. You'll often work overtime and you do get paid for those overtime hours, but they only offer the minimum 10 minutes break time every four hours. You'll be in a small confined space for hours on end and lifting, turning, bending over, reaching, and placing objects in a very fast paced environment. In most cases, you cannot leave the facility until all the packages are processed. My shift was 4-12 but often didn't leave until 2 or 3 in the morning."
bad,"Worked here for almost 2 months and it's not horrible but it's not great. It's a good place to work at if you're in school and need a part time job, it does pay decently with the weekly bonus of $116, but if you miss a day or come late and don't get the weekly bonus, it's not worth showing up at all for the rest of the week. It does not pay enough for the things you're expected to do, or positions you're put in."
bad,"We were told lies throughout the time working here, though there was no chance of the job becoming full time. People should be upfront about the employment relationship. Most employees were downsized, but other were retained in secret. This makes for a distrustful environment."
bad,Grab packages from a color coded cage assigned to my set of trucks sort them in the cage and then load them to the corresponding truck while the cage is moving.
bad,It was ok working with this company. learned from it. Breaks needs improvement. security was friendly. staff was ok. overall experience ok. there is things need to improve
bad,"When I started at UPS, it was a very family oriented business.  After 11 years, management obviously targeted drivers at the top of the pay scale and looked for any reason to terminate their positions."
bad,"Management likes to pretend nothing wrong is going on, and doesn't see a problem (or chooses not to see it) until the problem is completely out of hand."
bad,It is a very fast paced environment and the training doesn’t always correspond with the tasks asked to do it wouldn’t be so bad if the pay was more reasonable and hours were better
bad,From the operation stand point stay hourly. Tons of routes to get good career money. The world wants everything right now keep that in mind if you choose to work at UPS
bad,"as a package handler at ups it was exciting at first, but the short hours and the work load became stressful. only working 3 hours a night, wasn't what i was really looking for as a career."
bad,Not an easy place to work because of the hours. Typical working times are between 3AM and 9AM. Almost impossible to balance school/work with this job as well.
bad,"I was a part time supervisor for 7 years and Management was very poor, they made bad decisions constantly, and right when you are stating to make progress and settle in, they smack you with another heavy load. They really make you earn every dollar they pay you and some!"
bad,"If you are desperate for a job it might help feed you. If not look for a full time job and skip this place.I was down on luck, no income coming in before I accepted a temporary job. I live in the lower east side of of Manhattan and to get to work I go to time square, transfer to a NJ Transit Bus. Same procedure going home."
bad,The benefits are great but the people are miserable and the management is terrible. I reported an incident to HR and they pretty much shrugged and sent me back to work. I worked in dispatch on the graveyard shift. I never will again.
bad,This seasonal job did not pan out as initially presented. Seasonal with the option of part time hire after the end of season. Scheduling and communications were irregular.
bad,"During my time at UPS I found myself at ends with management. When hired, HR gave us phone numbers for management and HR. The phone number for my direct supervisor was incorrect. "
bad,"para empezar trabajaba 11 horas diarias, se supone que tenía una hora de comida pero cuando había mucho trabajo no respetaban mi comida, podría decirse que era casi diario, la encargada era super pesima, me trataba mal enfrente de los clientes, si acomodaba las cosas como a mi me pareciera mejor para la empresa, lo tiraba todo y me decía que lo hiciera de nuevo. En general es una mala empresa para trabajar."
bad,"United Parcel Service, Sharonville, OH — Package Handler"
bad,The typical day to day was pretty routine. Didn't learned much and the little that i did was about out dated technologies. Management wasn't great at all. They understood very little code and focused more on documentation then coding .
bad,"managment wants write its employees up at the slightest wrongdoing. the  manegment doesnt know anything about trucks or trucking, they hire people with no clue how to make a delivery . or be on time.  UPS FREIGHT in salt lake city  is the worst company ive ever worked for. because of the manegement."
bad,"To work at the DIA terminal, you must clear a back ground check to get your employee badge. They had told me if I didn't clear the back ground check for the DIA terminal, they would send me to the Commerce City terminal to work. After several tries to get my employee badge they fired me without the option of going out to Commerce City, Co. I have had back ground checks before, I never understood why UPS lied to me about having to work at Commerce City terminal if they had no intension of sondind me out their."
bad,"This may be because I worked at the Flint, MI location.  No respect, drivers do not let you close the door and/or put my seatbelt on before taking off.  The drivers pawn their work off on the helpers.  They are unionized and make $40 an hour after driving for 4 years."
bad,"i never come back again to that job cause is stressful,poor managment,breaking night all the way down no break.poor pay,i cant stand that job anymore."
bad,"Honestly the supervisors were the biggest reason for me quitting. they are extremely unfair and treat the workers like slaves. I enjoyed the benefits such as tuition reimbursement and medical benefits which was nice but over time, management makes it unbearable to work there along with a lot of coworkers that feel they don't have to do as much as the new people. overall the working environment as a whole is unfair and its not the best place to work."
bad,"fast paced, constant heavy lifting, bare minimum compensation, poor management, poor communication between management and employees, workplace ran based on fear. Human resources will tell you anything in order for you to come aboard."
bad,The job was to clean up after the sort.  Management was uncaring for the most part as this job is considered bottom of the barrel.  Cleaning the sorting system is the hardest part which takes place every three months.
bad,"Pay is ok, they can't find people who can pass the Automation Maintenance exam, so a lot of contractors work there, never see managers, building and equipment is just falling apart, my health insurance was not started (despite waiting 4 months), some people work, most just sit around, uniforms took 6 weeks to get, constant problems with uniforms, often dangerous work, wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,I learned to communicate with others and understand my role. I enjoyed interviewing people. I enjoy helping others. I live up to the company standard.
bad,"This job is brutal.  Expect to get worked to death.  There are high expectations for worker output and the job comes before anything else.  Work is your priority, over your family, over everything.  Work, work, work."
bad,Typical day at Ups requires so much energy. Fast [aced environment with high expectations. Not enough breaks physically demanding management was decent but never on your side
bad,provide info and tracking details on packages.it helped me become efficient with typing. long hours behind a computer can put a toll on some people.have to be able to stay on average or above quality expectations
bad,"A typical day included putting books in boxes for eight to ten hours a day, only to stop when we needed to make more boxes to put boxes in or load books on a conveyor belt to put in boxes."
bad,Nonstop moving of packages needing to be sorted to go the correct locations. Warehouse was hot and humid one day and cold the next. Some nights had too many people and not enough work to filter out to them.
bad,Terribly low morale for drivers and dock workers.  Most drivers stay only because of seniority.  Discipline to praise ratio heavily skewed in favor of discipline
bad,My job was to stand in front of a convertible belt once packages start to come down I was to put them in the trucks were they were to load them up and sometimes I would load up trucks to but overall it was good job wasn't bad at all
bad,"It's modern day slavery for the new guys. You gotta put up with the BS for 5-8 years before it gets decently better. Even at that, it never truly gets better. You'll start your day around 0830 and while they say you should be done around 1900, there have been too many nights going until 2100. The overtime is nice but, you won't have much of a life working here."
bad,No comment suppose to have a maximum amount off work very often you get given more than your maximum being told your get help later sometimes help doesn't come and your left to struggle
bad,This company is good for first time emplacement opportunity. The set part time schedule provided allows for plenty of opportunity to further education or pick up another job. Union position.
bad,Everyone is so unhappy at UPS. Drivers hate Managers. Managers are not interested in any input from drivers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with everyone attitude.
bad,Being a handler at UPS was not worth the pay. Your loading boxes into containers that are shorter than you at a very fast pace for 3-4 hrs a day. It's very intense labor.
bad,This is a great job for those who are in college and need experience. The climate of the store is from very slow to fast paced. You are able to hone in on Microsoft Office and organization skills.
bad,"5 hours of heavy lifting and cardio. Load packages until an entire freight trailer (10' heigh and 10' wide, 55' long) is full, then load another. "
bad,"They throw 7 different project at you, not enough staffing communication or training. Want you to succeed but may not lead you in the correct path. Feel no purpose"
bad,"Upper management is doing a good job on making sure the new employees are being trained properly.Its the supervisors that seem to  have the intent in seeing new and employees let go. They dont want to do their job in training me the proper way, they just having me pick up their slack."
bad,"there is a lot of room to grow. fast paced, and one has to be able to adjust to the changing weather conditions. very diverse, management in the area i worked has no structure and things can change quiet often. not a cohesive unit (management wise)."
bad,hard work but it has rewards. its not for everyone but if you can do it it can be a long term job. the company feels like its behind in the indistry in terms of equipment and mentality.
bad,"Dear Reader,"
bad,good for people who want to work and still go to school but staff needs work on working with the employees when feeling overwhelmed with packages in a short time notice.
bad,"just a number. employee benefits are great but management does not care about the individual person. Managers are rude, no interest in helping others succeed"
bad,"Its a great union job if you enjoy the work. If you don't you'll be absolutely miserable. Pays good, great benefits, but it's tough. If you work hard the only thing it gets you is more work off the lazy people."
bad,"Be prepared -- the local management will make or break this company for you. They are very hands off even when numerous issues occur between staff. "
bad,"UPS isn't a bad company to work for they have plenty of opportunities to advance. However there's plenty of better career choices that won't break your back or have you coming home furious with your 10 bosses. The management their can be very shady and take alot of shortcuts for ""logistics"", their poster's should show workers throwing boxes and smashing them around then the driver throwing them at door steps. Not to mention the lawsuit when the union found out management was shaving hours off their employees checks. So yeah what can brown do for you?"
bad,"If you like drama, getting yelled out and talked about behind your back.  Then this is the job for you.  The job is customer service of the worse kind."
bad,"UPS Corporate is a boys' club run by men.  Women are left out of key decision-making meetings because the men in charge like to hide their locker room banter.  Over the two years I was there, I experienced many instances of unprofessional, suggestive comments from seven different male managers and was paid significantly less than male coworkers who had the same or less experience."
bad,"Management wants young people. Since I made management aware of my service connected disabilities and started utilizing FMLA for them I have been a target for harassment and retaliation. Benefits and pay is great if you are in the union, management hours are very long 12+ per day plus weekends, their 401K match is below industry standard and there is no monthly pension anymore just a 401K for management."
bad,"I've never been in a place that presses you to work and work at a fast pace as UPS,   This has as much stress as being in boot camp in the Marine Corps.  I mean the supervisors are constantly reminding you that they are going to write you up if you don't complete your task in a over crazed moment, Everything you do you're being observed by your supervisor and it has to be done quickly and when it's done you are sent home."
bad,fast paced heavy work load time consuming stressful fun learn about company's role independent interesting stability is all on the employee to move up
bad,For being such a being and known company they do not treat their employees with the respect they should. found the job just end up frustrating and annoy pretty much every employee i came across. UPS(under paid slaves)
bad,Een bedrijf met een zeer star regiem. Afschuifsysteem op de werkvloer. Typisch Amerikaans bedrijf.
bad,"It was a good job but they don't give enough hours "
bad,"Great benefits and pay. UPS doesn't care about people...only profits. After 30 years in the Durham, NC location, employees are still working 55 hours a week because it's cheaper to pay overtime than hire a new person. These employees sacrifice time with family for this company then turn around and get fired for not putting their flashers on one time."
bad,"The company does not care for the workers. In training safety is considered No. 1, yet when actually working all they care about is performance no matter the cost. Sub-par wages and terrible hours combine to make an unhappy work experience."
bad,ups is not a good  company   they pay so low and the employees have to work so much. but sometime they are activity is fun  what i dont like ups because they will judge the people with their rf gun thats unfair
bad,"My job was fine for me, but the environment of the company is very hostile. Management will always try and throw the next person under the bus if it comes to making them look good."
bad,"My son went to work with them as an evening job while he was studying fire science in college.  When tUPS says one has to be able to lift 50lb, they mean lift televisions by yourself over your head onto the pile in the semi heading out of town.  He hurt so badly that he couldn't go to school.  I told him to give it up, as he was only going to hurt himself.  Lifting 50lbs is one thing, but lifting it over your head alone is a totally different thing."
bad,I got promoted to management very fast but I didn't realize that leaving the union behind actually puts you in a lot harder place
bad,"Working at UPS was a great experience "
bad,Little room to move up in the company unless you've been there 100years. Supervisor Picking favorites like back at highschool while others work like dogs.. no breaks.. very unorganized and unprofessional
bad,"Bad management "
bad,"I  worked at UPS as a Sr. Administrative Assistant in the Revenue Management Department.  The department is to assure UPS stays profitable.  The Revenue Managers whom I supported are responsible for producing incentives for UPSs  large shippers (no one pays published rates).  "
bad,Not well managed and with too much union intervention. The culture pitted departments against each other. So instead of working together it was like working against the other side.  anecdotally i saw two employees get into a fist fight and neither got fired thanks to union intervention.
bad,"You work hard for your compensation of benefits and good wage. The cost is they do not care about your health/safety until you actually get injured, reactive not proactive, and caring about seeing your family is a joke. "
bad,"For the most part the other employees are a joy to work with but the management is more set on numbers over safety.The pay is good for the hours worked, the casters in the wings are not maintained as well as they should be."
bad,I did not enjoy much of my time while with this company. They do not treat their employees very well. Moral is always low. I would not recommend this job.
bad,"They hire you at start of a busy season, then they cut your hours down to 3 days a week, then to nothing and they expect you to survive on no money.  You really don't get to the 90 days probation period. Your job is not guaranteed, it all about favoritism with the supervisor or the boss.  They expect the new hires to be good as the ones be there for over 10 years.  Think twice before taking sny stand with UPS."
bad,"Not the best to work at. There is two tier waging and you often work harder than your peers for much less money. "
bad,"The company is currently causing drivers to quit they cut pay in half so dont believe the hipe when they say $1.00 a mile because you will only get 500 miles a week or your loud will be cancelled at least twice a month.  But you will get great home time and all kinds of discounts on products and purchase, but again you will not have any money to bye any thing let alone have a house or car. UPS Frieght is all about the stock holders not family freindly. I personally lost my house only a year after I started working for them. and it just got worst They laid off 23 drivers in Fontana and have laid off at least 200 more that I know off In the United States simply they put it on the TRAIN and send it across and still charge the same as if company drivers are taken it."
bad,"This facility only gives one break a day. One break out of a 10-12 hour shift. There's a lot of yelling and the on-site manager gets mad very easily. Even though the job is very easy and you just sort through mail all day, the pay is still not work it."
bad,"The trainers were the best."
bad,"A typical work day as a UPS Front Line Supervisor was full of paperwork and nonclinical empty threats to both supervisors and hourly employees. "
bad,"The owners of this franchise were not prepared or equipt with the skills to run a business.  They also brought their marital/personal life into the store, which greatly affected the daily opperations of the business."
bad,"vous êtes serez traité comme un moin que rien dans cette boite "
bad,I went to work and felt like the management team was always looking to find a reason to complain. I wanted to work and go home because of the atmosphere and the management
bad,Very fast paced environment that I don't really enjoy. Upper management are all about the numbers and hitting their profit goals without enough recognition to the employees at the ground level making it go.
bad,Daily duties rarely varied not allowing any growth in other areas. Overwhelming and stressful environment a normal days work.Best about this job were the insurance benefits offered after a year of employment.
bad,"some days start very early and we don't leave until the work is done, so we have a starting time, leaving time depends on how much work we have. I have not done 40 hours in quite a long time. There are no chances for promotion."
bad,UPS is a high energy work environment that does not pay well for the work that is done.  Management does not care about its workers.
bad,"Part time employees work between 18 and 30 hours a week.  Inside work is hard and no ac or heat.  Full time inside jobs not likely unless you have 15 years part time.  Best bet get out of the hub as soon as you can go driving and make some money.  Benefits still good, union is weaker then it used to be.  Supervisors are tough, like to discipline employees, but most of them are promoted to part time supervisor quickly and know less about the job then you do."
bad,"poor training from the start,  very small tight clique ,  not open to welcome or properly train new people.  a couple slect competitive bullies work here."
bad,"Maybe it was just the time that I started to work there but, the supervision of that place was bad.  The workers really didn't want to be there.  Overall was not a very friendly environment to work in."
bad,"Very fast pace and hot during summer day, wet and cold during winter. Management is bias and favor only who they like but the workers there are friendly. That terminal will never hire you on but only keep you as a temp. In the end its good as a part time job but not good if you looking to move up in your career."
bad,It's UPS it has all the advantages and disadvantages of a big company. i.e. problems have to be elevated through several layers of management before connecting to some one who can actually do something.
bad,As a package handler as hard as you have to work compensation does not match. As a new driver you have to call in every day to find out if you work or not. Which makes it hard for you to get another job because of it possibly clashing on a day you might have to work.
bad,Operations supervisor responsible for more than 175 hourly employees and management. Work schedule consists of 12-14 hour days doing pre-sort and post-sort reports. Co-workers are great and understanding. Union employees and the labor department can be extremely difficult to deal with and very troubling when you need to terminate someone for production or service related items.
bad,"Very little in terms of upward promotion. Job is really about who you know rather than what you know. I learned a lot being in the company and the most important lesson that I learned is to be careful what you do. The benefits are good, but the pay has not changed in the past 15 years. You accumulate lots of vacation time; reaching a maximum of 6 weeks after 25 years."
bad,Worked at UPS in the evening for 5 hours at night.  The work was steady unloading and sorting packages.  Some of the boxes were quite heavy.  Got injured one night when packages fell on me.  Continued to work nightly trying to work through the pain.
bad,"Unload freight from conveyor belt, Load freight onto truck, Watching out for hazardous materials. Mostly independent work. The hardest part about working here was lifting objects that were too heavy or when a lot of  freight would come at once."
bad,"UPS is a place that is very strict in everything they do. Employees must clock out for breaks, work until they are told to go home, not guaranteed 40 hours a week, and get new managers every 3 months. The work it self is not difficult. Hours in a week range from 30 to 70."
bad,"The best part about the job is the people you meet and get to work along side of. Being able to have great conversation about family, life, or religious beliefs."
bad,"- My review of this company is that they spend far too much time on conference calls talking about what went wrong the day before and not enough time discussing progressive strategy and process improvements."
bad,"Long hours once in management position. Once you get close to retirement you are not treated very well, feels like the company wants you to quit so they do have to pay your retirement. There is not a very good relationship between hourly employees and management. The hardest part of the job was feeling like you were being taken advantage of and the so called open door policy did not exist."
bad,Answered incoming calls. Processed different types of billing. Office manger sat in her office all day and yelled at co-workers and demanded different things she wanted or needed. She watched everybody like a hawk. The freight drivers were miserable all they did was complain about various things. The office manager and terminal manager did not get along so there was always tension between them. The best part of the day was punching out and going home.
bad,"If you aren't the favorite here you're not going to enjoy your day.  Other people in your group will be doing the same thing (i.e. talking) and you're singled out of the whole group.  Company hasn't caught up with the recent grads or those of the ""millennial"" age group."
bad,"•	Proactively contacting existing and potential UPS customers, building rapport and partnerships, learning their businesses, identifying needs and challenges, make value propositions to increase revenue through effective use of well-developed sales and negotiation skills, manage implementation and follow up for optimum revenue gain"
bad,"I did not enjoy any part of my experience working for this company.  There was no room for advancement and not much was done to develop, coach, teach, or train their employee's."
bad,"Unload and Load the trucks."
bad,Managing people to make sure that all items that need to be picked get picked.  Co-workers are all good people.  The hardest part of the day is trying to keep people on track and hit our goals and finish within the 10 hour time frame we have.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing good people and helping them improve themselves.
bad,Poorly managed location. None of the full time managers are appreciative of their workers. You are treated without respect.
bad,"I took this entry level position to get my foot into the door of what I thought was one of the best companies to work for globally. No relocation assistance is provided. Although I loved the job, I was sold a dream about the advancement opportunities.  They opportunities are available if you are willing to play office politics with management.  Advancement is not based on your performance.  The management team runs the business as dictators and they have absolutely no integrity or ethics; although they will make you read and recite their commitment to ethics and integrity in training class daily from their ethics and integrity handbook. If you want to work at this office the best example to prepare you for this is to watch the movie Office Space.  Good Luck!"
bad,"It is very busy and lots to do most of the day. In the beginning things start off well but then takes a change. "
bad,"*Established model practices, highlighting the most efficient and safest way to complete tasks"
bad,"If you are a UPS driver and have the protection of the union then yes you will get paid very well to put up with a demanding and stressful environment. If you are management however I wouldn't recommend it. I was only a part time supervisor and so it wasn't too bad, but most of the time you are in-between a rock and a hard place with the union and upper-management."
bad,You only get one break they all ways on your back you have to ask to go to the bathroom like a kids
bad,"UPS is a respected company, but its terrible to work for them.  Great pay and super great insurance, but everything else is terrible.  Management doesn't care about anyone.  You are just a number.  They don't appreciate or praise you for being a good worker and doing a good job.  They just want to criticize.  Full time workers are protected more than pt workers.  Part time workers have no permitted days off and are at their power hungry manager's mercy. There is tons and tons of turnover because of their unfair and unreasonable management."
bad,It was a great place to start. Learned the basics of warehouse operation.
bad,"Not only was the training awfully prepared you for the task at hand, the work itself was overbearing and late long hours. Management was unhelpful, co-workers were friendly at times but also berating on newer members. The pay was low and the conditions were unpleasant."
bad,Primarily oversaw operations team focused on US Military shipping in/ out of the Middle East.  Traveled to Afghanistan and other Middle East countries regularly
bad,UPS doesn't care about its employees or their families. They force you out on roads and weather conditions that no one should ever be on or in. The company spends more time and effort following its union employees looking for reasons to fire them. I seen 3 different times where they followed drivers that were a month or less from retiring. They tried firing all 3 of them because they couldn't get the routes done fast enough. Had the union not stepped in the company would've got their way and screwed these men who gave them 30 plus years of loyal work out of their insurance and pension money. As far as lower level mangers and on car sups I've seen them fire them for little to no reason. If they don't fire mangers they will demote them and force them to relocate to other states. This company tries saying its a great place to work and cares about your family. Truth is they hate union workers. They over work the drivers with 10 to 11 hour days all the time. Forget about thanksgiving and Christmas New Years you won't see your family at all. The 9 years I drove for them was the worst 9 years. This job will impact your marriage as well. The divorce rate for a UPS driver is way higher than normal. Lots of drivers have bad knees shoulders and backs from the job and un safe work environment. That's another thing they try to get drivers on. You are to get help with packages over 70 lbs. well when you drive you're all alone you get to a house with no one home you have no help. So you have to unload it yourself and sometimes your handcart is of no use. I've seen a handful of drivers hurt
bad,"I'm working nights there and I do not like working nights, so over all a fairly miserable job."
bad,Very long days with little since of accomplishments. The minimum work day is 11 hours with sometimes no break. There is no work life balance and too little concern for change. Co workers are very involved but also very stressed. There are a great since of team work to make production needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Being able to train and motivate employees to be the best workers and encourage wellness.
bad,"There were no enjoyable moments except the ten minute break. You are treated like a mule, co-workers don't really talk or create a great atmosphere."
bad,UPS is a great place if you don't want to move up quickly. The hours for employees outside of the offfice can change and you can work long days. I really loved my position as a contractor and a later employee and if you need a job they hire quickly.
bad,"If you enjoy 12-15 hour days, then UPS is for you.The demand for production is constant and unreasonable. Training is neglected and there is very much a sink or swim attitude."
bad,"They need to bring back the private sector of ups, and buy back this public influence into how and when we do business."
bad,It would be a good job if they worked you more than 3 hours a day.....
bad,"management does not care about the union employees, they harass, and intimidate. advancement takes years unless you go into management. park time work forever! the work load is ridiculous!"
bad,one of the worst places ever. especially the Edison/keasby location. everything is outdated. This was one of the first and earliest UPS facilities and it shows. ive worked at Fedex after which is located directly across the street and that was one of the more modern facilities. The edison UPS should be shut down and deemed illegal/unsafe. its insane. they have so many ppl working there to handle the high volume because all of the chutes and rollers are outdated and cant handle the capacity get jammed up WAY MORE then it ever should. nothing is computerized still have humans doing all the sorting and they mess up so much. always had people coming in to take picture of huge jams and they would tell us they were from Ohio and sent to investigate this location and would just shake their head how crazy it was. and because of all these xtra workers they need to break jams the problem they have is parking. the parking lot is WAY TOO SMALL for everyone who works there to find a spot. fedex across street has a Huge parking lot and they stagger the shifts so u can leave and have a break for an hour and come back for more or go home its up to u.. UPS every shares a 10 minute break at the same exact time which is nuts cuz then u have to wait online to use bathroom or use vending machine and if u didnt run to be first on line then u wont even have time to use bathroom or eat. They expect part time college kids to work every day Monday-friday. what kinda part time job makes u work everyday? why cant u just work 3-4 days if u want. id work sat or sunday if they were open but they are not.
bad,"unload trucks and planes,with cargo fastpace,not enough help and time to complete assignment"
bad,"great for the benefits, but they do not care about your family life, there is no compensation for working the 3rd shift as well as working weekends."
bad,"Assist customer with making copies, sending faxes, answering the phones, and handling cash transactions"
bad,good place to start no a lot of money but if you can make it here u will go far
bad,"(THIS IS FOR THE UPS STORE IN LAKE ZURICH IL) They are not really connected to UPS therefore no benefits. The owners are brand new, and don't know how to train very well. They fire people often for little reason. Don't see this store going very far. Although the store manager was a great employee to work with, and the work itself was kind of fun (when there was any) the other employees sort of leave you with all the work. One girl just puts away mail, or hides in the back. She is very unprofessional, even the way she dresses. They fired me after a month and a half, because I made 2 or 3 minor mistakes (A couple print jobs gone wrong) ""They just couldn't afford to lose out on any money."" Of course your going to be the only one making mistakes when your the only one doing any work! They are more concerned with making money then good customer service. I wouldn't waste your time applying."
bad,"very busy here, people interesting, enjoyed the use of computers and data entry."
bad,A typical day consisted of helping the driver with anything. I learned better ways to lift heavy packages. The co-workers were the drivers which changed every couple days. The hardest part was knowing there wasn't any advancement or permanent position. The best part was driving around the town and city.  
bad,Work place is a little off balance but the job get's done. Management need a lot more training in the field.
bad,Unload trucks per invoice . Load containers with right product .Using clamp trucks and temp workers .
bad,"I am so thankful i have started my career with this company as this is a multinational company. It helped me alot learn new things like dealing with different types of customers, learning how to deal with them and how to satisfy the customers needs. I am blessed with my colleagues as most of them are helpful and friendly. However, one of the hardestpart working on this company is getting no support with the manager of my department and how the management runs the company."
bad,"One person determines the future of your career at UPS. This person might be your supervisor, manager or Division manager. If they do not like you, they can alter your course/future with UPS."
bad,"Great hourly pay but everyone works at the same time, so you are only given tops 3 and a half hours a day. On top of that you must work everyday. You get paid every week but when you add how much your check is on top of the fact you work Monday through Friday, it isn't worth it unless you have nothing else to do during a day. The most hours you could possibly get a week is around 18. Its also a workout to work there, you are constantly loading/unloading hundreds of packages and it does take a toll of on you."
bad,"Loading about 1200 boxes day after day, while on a time limit. Walls collapsing and boxes 30 pound boxes crashing down all on you. I worked the part-time position but the 5 hours were never garaunteed. I didn't really have a relationship with the co-workers there because I was in and out. The management was cool , I wouldnt mind working with them again. I loved clocking out of work, that was the best part for me."
bad,"making sure the packages reach their destination. Its normal checking the correct postcode(destination eg Bristol BS00 0ER), scan and then loading."
bad,"I got lucky the driver I worked with was helpful and good to work with. Not a very difficult job to do if you could handle the weather. The majority of the day is spent outside, which meant dealing with the elements, heavy rain, snow, and cold temperatures."
bad,"It'd be a fairly nice place to work if they paid you to deal with the nonprofessional behavior displayed by supervisors and newly graduated high school kids. They will over staff on occasion and send you home. You barely get enough hours to make a reasonable check as is. They're also starving out the double shifters to cut costs. I've also recently discovered that advancement is only for the select few who have connections prior to getting hired or have the ability to suck up in vast amounts. It takes years to get a position driving if already in the company, and supervisor? Forget about it."
bad,teamwork; making the best of it with the co-workers no matter how bad the management is...
bad,"A typical day is I come in scan packages, make address corrections, speak with customers regarding issues with packages,unload semi trucks. the hardest part of the job is the fact that management plays faoritism, and some people that are not management want to run the place. the salary and benefits are good for a part time job."
bad,"I truly enjoyed my work day, it was physically demanding at times, but it kept me in good shape."
bad,Wish I could do more and work more hours.this company is great but I want a more stable position
bad,"Very disorganized, lots of unneeded drama. Lots of down time, poor communcation skills. 30 minutes of working off the clock everyday. Way too many people who will stab you in the back in a second. My manager is good, above him they are horrible!!!!!!"
bad,"the company was ok for a part time job full time? buy for full time, not really sure what to say since l've not spent that much time there."
bad,it is a very fast paced job. theres not time to do anything besides move packages. and there arnt any breaks.
bad,"Too stuffy, too old not progressive. Management styles were flippant. The pay was not in line with other companies."
bad,"UPS used to be a great place to work. Very colaborative and customer focused, was a great place to learn supply chain management as well as sales techniques. Changes to senior management has caused the environment to turn toxic which has lead to the departure of many excellent management team members. UPS goes through cycles as they promote from within, so the toxic enviroment they are currently in should subside once the management team has been posted to new areas."
bad,Just know they will work you like a slave for four hours. Benefits are great union is good. Supervisors and managers talk to you anyway and yes they do get away with it. Yes there’s growth but everything comes with Seniority and who you know.
bad,"From my experience. No communication, sudden changes, disorganization, favoritism. The works. The benefits are great, but the management and above aren't. You can make a career from here, just gotta have a strong drive and a heart for BS"
bad,The work that is expected from us we should be getting paid a lot more holidays pay shouldn't be giving a year after being with the company and health benefits shouldn't take 9 months to get they should be giving after the probation period I got hurt a couple of time at this job
bad,"Not too good of a place to work if you are into fitness and running. Also, you do not get much help at all. Besides that too much heavy lifting and not too good for your back."
bad,"After working at UPS for multiple months, I've learned that package handlers are compensated well because the work is hard and organization of information and management isn't great. Many things aren't communicated to employees and a lot of information (for example, daily package volume) is faulty. I'm not sure that this company values employee contentment at work, because it seems that many people who work their aren't very happy with the way things operate."
bad,Organization is focused on daily exceptions in follow up on deficiencies from previous day.  Very strong focus on standard operating plans and limiting errors through managing processes.
bad,Management is nonunion and the workers are union. Hard to meet goals upper management establish because they don’t hold their workforce accountable to come to work.
bad,Many daily and weekly tasks to perform with limited resources. Management is demanding on task completion. The job doesn't give me much personal and or family time.
bad,"They don't care at all about your life outside of the job. I tried to call a day of 3 months in advance and they wouldn't let me, for no reason whatsoever."
bad,My shift would start at 11pm. They would put me in a trailer either by myself or one other person and had us stack boxes to form walls inside the trailer.
bad,"Able to advance within the company however, this branch of the company was a very difficult place to work. Fast-paced and very immersive. Not much of a team environment as it should be."
bad,They hire you as part time but once there it is only seasonal. The times to work were never stable; daily they changed the schedule. Management was rude and disrespectful. I was told by my dept. supervisor that they were going to have me sign on but once the season was over they never put me on the schedule. I felt used by UPS and would have never wasted my time only working seasonal. I was lied too.
bad,"You really just have to blend in and not let anyone notice you or else you will be put on the spot for your mistakes. The environment is very clique-y not unlike a high school cafeteria. The management could not care less about what you do, as long as you're achieving their goals."
bad,"Fast-paced, underpaid, back-breaking labor being upsold as ""we work harder than anyone else"" kool-aid while dangling package driver and career growth carrots in front of your head. Expected to move a parcel every 3-4 seconds in unloading the filled-up 53 ft trailers, and every 5-12 seconds when loading up the trailers depending on the item's weight. Can't bring in cellphones without good reason because of fear of theft, so you're stuck working in silence unless you're the type that can maintain multi-hour long conversations with anyone."
bad,"The positives include home daily, pay and benefits including a pension (as of now). Of course it takes 4 years for top rate and the starting pay is lower than other LTLs. "
bad,"Even in the union, it's very easy to loose your job over stupid stuff. Supervisors also do not communicate with each other and most of the time you never have the same sup, they are always moving to different areas."
bad,"I feel like i work way to many hours at UPS. not typically what i would like with work life balance. "
bad,"First off if you are a slow learner or dont pick upfast do not apply, they do not help and slow doqn when training and small mistakes drive them crazy and will start yelling and cussing, the managers treat most employees like garbage and scream and cuss but the money is ok bennifits are free, thats about it"
bad,"This job has a very demanding physical work fast pace. Management does not want your opinion, you are hired for labor. Get it done fast and safe or leave. If you need a job with benefits and you are UNeducated, then this is for you."
bad,Las personas que tienen antigüedad en la compañía no interactúan con el personal nuevo. Si eres latinos no sientes una aproximación de parte de los americanos. Son muy aislados cada quien en su área y con su grupo. El entrenamiento lo debes hacer por tu cuenta no está bien alineado. Los contratados no son tratados como personal de la empresa.
bad,"pLEASE DON'T WORK AT THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT TO BE PAID FAIRLY, OR  BE IN A WORKING ENVIROMENTTHAT IS NOT FROM 50'S . I have a four year degree and getting a masters in very relevant field and all they want to pay me is $16.45 per hour"
bad,"I was hired as seasonal help with the potential of being hired on afterwards. It's a con to get temporary help. It took over a month to start after I was hired. In the meantime I quit another job. I was calling in several days a week with no hours available. The few times I did go in, I was sent home after a few hours. It's great pay it you can actually get hours & a permanent position. I wasn't given a chance."
bad,"Management sucks, pay sucks, work sucks, waste of time, I wish I never worked here I've wasted 3 years of my life, find yourself a better job, union is the only good thing"
bad,"There are so mant supervisors that none of them are on the same page about most things. They tell you not to cut corners or to rush, while simultaneously expecting you to do that because they over load the drivers and want them to still get done at a reasonable time."
bad,"More supervisor based then employee based. Good benefits after a certain amount of time, along with weekly pay. Shifts do differ on hours. My work day included unloading trailers doing bulk and whatever else they ask you to do. Just stick to yourself, do your job and go home. (HIGHLY recommended)"
bad,Management doesn’t care about you at all. All managers want from you is to work work work. My on road supervisor didn’t let me take my hour long lunch until the end of the day when he did a ride along with me. Very disrespectful dispatch person during the morning hours. If you are a new cover driver expect to be put on new routes everyday without having knowledge of the area at all.
bad,"Management really sucks here at UPS. They will let new hires take your position and not even care. When you ask them when you will be able to work your position, they will tell you ""I can't do anything about it"". Management does not care one bit about you. Everything is about them and they don't really care about your hours. Benefits are good but management sucks really bad. They are all about themselves."
bad,Very stressful work environment and very hard for a women they made me carry heavy things and the pay was not worth it i dont suggest it i would not come back
bad,"Use you up. Get sick once, you’re gone. Walking out in single digits dripping with sweat this happens a lot. They go through people like socks. I got a fever of 102, called in. I knew that was it but i called back anyway, my number was blocked. That’s how they deal with people there. I was also the ONLY person with three trucks by myself to load. To heck with them!"
bad,push push push too much ground to cover and never fast enough for the managers. managers don't want to here that I need time to fix problem if you can bandage the issue lets do it and go. VERY UNSAFE
bad,All ways been my childhood dream to work for ups the manager I was put under really stole my dream and set me back as a man from a background of low income as from my childhood that is was no longer Hope it was never going to be a dream or a goal to be part of a company that have management like her
bad,I enjoyed working there. I worked during the holiday season for a couple of years and it was good. You and your team basically control the tone for how the job go
bad,"""It's a tough job"", that was the first thing everyone told about UPS, and they were right. Despite being my first job, It was very much par for the course in terms of the work. I wasn't mislead of what I was expected to do, but the quality of work varied from tolerable to very exhausting since you never knew what sort of packages you would be working with. The people working there varied from friendly to completely uncooperative, don't expect people to stay for too long, the worst ones usually end up quitting within the first couple weeks. I wouldn't have mind the tough work environment had it not been for poor constantly switching full time supervisors that varied in quality. My previous supervisor was the main reason why I quit since they were extremely uncooperative and unprofessional. I had almost 3 weeks worth of vacations days poorly managed and was never paid properly on time or was misinformed due to the incompetence of my supervisors and it was a very tedious task to try and fix it, this happened within a 2 year span. My previous supervisor also would discourage taking sick days and would press co-workers into using their vacation time as opposed to their sick days so that our vacation times couldn't be properly used anymore. Many of my co-workers were furious with how misleading our supervisor was that many of them had quit after years of working here. Despite the hot summers, despite the harsh winters, despite the extremely demanding work load and unpredictable tasks, I would have tolerated the job for another year had it not been for the terrible full-time supervisors."
bad,"UPS pays well...because you will never not be at work.  The corporate culture is ""get the job done no matter the cost"" and the corporation does not care about your life outside of the company.  If going into operations management, be prepared to work 14-16 hour days, 6 days a week."
bad,Pay the employees a better wage so they can at least afford an apartment in Atlanta and not have to live check to check. It makes no sense how much money the company makes every year an upper level management makes but yet you won't pay your specialist and admin employees a livable wage.  All while requiring them to come in and work hard and remain happy while not being paid fairly.
bad,"nasty hot.  Terrible  communication between staff and management  and even more so in just management!!     "
bad,They are not honest about what you are doing. It's basically a call center and they will reel you in by telling you it's not and you can manage your time and calendar to make your calls during the morning and work on other things in the afternoon. The sales floor show people mainly making calls throughout the day to current customers who don't want to be bothered. The training is also inadequate. They give you a day to learn a segment of material and then thrust a test upon you expecting you to pass at a high percentage rate. The instructors are glorified sales people themselves.
bad,"The management was militant, aggressive,and had a ""no excuses"" unsaid policy. They have one purpose only, and that is to make sure you get out as many packages as you can, within 8-10 hrs. Don't look for thank you's or good job's-they expect you to do whatever it takes."
bad,Very fast paced. No hours and training is horrible for new hires. Management is not the best. It needs organization. The benefits are very good. People typically work at ups for the benefits.
bad,"A few years ago it was a great job, now its like amazon. In phx hub the trucks are 105+ degrees they expect you to work till you are sick. Been dehydraded so many times and get written up for having to call in due to heat exhaustion."
bad,UPS Is A Cool Job To Those Who Are In It For The Years Of Hard Work To Even Earn Any Real Benefits If You Plan On Making A Living In The US Ups Will Not Help You At A Package Handle Or A driver Assistant Position
bad,"Some departments at UPS are good. Unfortunately, it is very inconsistent. There is a lot of cronyism, despite the company making efforts to address it. There are also promises of promotion being constantly implied but delivered infrequently. The talent dev strategy is all over the place, which makes promotion/advancement seem even more mysterious."
bad,"I worked at UPS for 2 years. It was a time of lots of learning, not educational per se but more learning how to overcome a dark, cold, metallic environment in which you have to bring your own happiness with you. There is not any to be found there apart from the occasional sunny person you run accrossed. "
bad,"If you're looking for a over the top stressed part time job where other employee's act like 10 ply then this is for you, I would highly recommend getting a trade job and getting an ACTUAL career"
bad,"There was a huge divide between union employees and management, which in my opinion took a huge hit on customer satisfaction. Union employees were never satisfied. Corporate had unreal expectations and the Holiday season is a joke."
bad,"Processing in bound and outbound orders, answering customer inquiries, working with customers/clients to validate order information. working internally with other departments to ensure you're able to process inbound and outbound."
bad,Management is awful. Constant equipment failure but you are blamed for certain things like not weighing freight even if all the scales are broken. Prepare to repeatedly do things over and over again since management constantly messes up with the few jobs they actually do. Long hours fixing others mistakes while others skate by doing the bare minimum with no repercussions from timid management. If you want an easy job with decent pay this place is decent but don't do anything more than the bare minimum because then you sign your death warrant to being overworked and abused by management who sit on your shoulders and call themselves tall.
bad,"While the pay is great, most of the times it doesn't seem worth it due to the sheer amounts of stress. That coupled with about half of the Full-Time management not being able to solve our issues. Advancement is possible but you have to put many years to advance."
bad,"I enjoyed the job. I like working hard and a fast past environment, I loved the hours. My big issue is the way I was let go. I worked there for a little over a month and everything seeemed to be going well. My management had even told me that I was doing great. I asked frequently if I was up to speed and got a yes everytime. Until one day, they had me work a full shift and with no explanation told me they were letting me go. I think they just didn't need another employee because work was slowing down a bit. However I wasn't hired as a temporary worker and I was let go as if I was. It felt like I had been tricked into helping them when they needed me and then they dumped me the moment they didn't. Honesty is all I would've asked for."
bad,Even though this was a temporary job this job sucked and despite working harder than the most of the employees I was given less breathing room than they were since the supervisors were too scared of its employees to give me any leniency.
bad,"I was promoted from Driver to Night Manager.  My Boss ( Center Manager)"
bad,ok work environment with good benefits.    poor management in the workplace  decent paid vacations.  The management can b more concerned about the safety and comfort of their employees. and much more professional
bad,"The job itself was nice. People were generally understand and good to work with. But, management can be a little tough. The job, is fast paced, gets you in shape, and they give you breaks. One mandatory and others if you need it or if you have caught up in your truck bed. Injury is a big concern. There is many chances for boxes to fall on you and easy to be buried. You also have a quota to place up an amount of boxes per minute and hour to fill up as many trailers as possible."
bad,"The job is a fast pace stressful job, Its made more difficult than it should be do to understaffing and the constant change of starting times based on projected volumes of packages for the day that tends to be off 4 to 5 thousand a day.  If you like a good workout its a good job for you and the benefits are great. Drivers get overloaded  always and the long hours don't give them as much of a  family to work ratio. the Preload is always shorthanded and some of the managers are short tempered. the job is made more difficult than it should be. I like it for the workout and the pay. Turnover is high for people quitting or getting fired but overall I say its agood place to work with good pay and benefits"
bad,"There is lack of communication between managers and employees. Management doesn’t help if you need help with something. "
bad,"UPS Outerloop 1860 is the worst account of all, no respect or any consideration for their employees, some weeks long hours including weekends, others you can't even get 40. You'll see mean supervisors who are watching you every minute, they put you a lot of pressure on when you're new and the work to do is overwhelming."
bad,Ups is a part-time work place for most of its employees. I feel like as much work we do we don’t get paid enough or even get enough hours. I honestly feel like it’s a waste of time & energy.
bad,If you want a lot of time off then this is the place for you. If you want to go home they can send you home. Management does not care for you. If you work hard your supervisor will take advantage of you because they can't fire anyone. They will work you as a slave and be fine with it. You get a raise every year but you'd have to work in the warehouse for 15+ years to be making good money unless your a driver.
bad,low hours no full time got sent home early they don’t give any break takes a very long time to be a full time person at ups very physical hands on type of job
bad,"its a good job I just don't like how you have to work part-time for so long just to become full-time they give you every benefit you can thick of  . after a year being at the company . "
bad,Ask for help when you need it and ask for your breaks cuz they not looking for you to take your breaks. always wear comfortable clothes that you don't mind getting dirty
bad,"It was a seasonal job I had when I was 19.  Pay was fair, but the hours were long, and the volume of packages was nearly unmanageable.  As it was a job for the winter holiday season that is to be expected, though I doubt I would ever consider doing it again."
bad,"I worked at one of the multiple stores they have, and the one I worked at was very strict and not a lot of room to have time outside of work, and I was bossed around more than I should've been by my manager, but it was fun."
bad,"Yeah UPS is a big welll known name, but they dog the T^%& out of employees.  The amount of work expected from subordinates and managers is not worth what they pay.  Advancements are possible, but wait yiour turn in line.  Most managers that are part time, are just do-boys, and do-girls.  More like little supervisors with no real management purpose."
bad,They dont typically like giving to many hours.supervisors are rude to everyone below and make harder worker do majority of work while lazy workers aren't make to make any effort
bad,It’s a really hard place to work and if it’s the only thing you are doing at the time then it will be really hard to stay motivated to work but at the same time they offer help with plenty of future endeavors.
bad,Ups is a poorly managed place as well as dangerous to work at. They are constantly having broken packages and it seems as if there isn't much if any communication between management and supervisors.
bad,"constant standing and walking, warehouse workers do not receive benefits until after one year of work.warehouse workers only work 3 to 4 hours per day. Drivers get paid very well with great benefits"
bad,"Poor management in relationship to the atmosphere of the workplace.  Allowed abusive, belittling, berating, and abusive language.  Hours were very difficult 2am - 8:30am."
bad,"Depending on who you work under (supervisor) will determine how you like it. They need to work on getting their employees to work from home. "
bad,"In order to be ""promoted from within"" , education and professionalism aren't required.  It's about who you know and whether or not you're considered a ""yes man"".  Women are treated as second class citizens and are rarely promoted into full time management."
bad,"It's a decent but difficult job that doesn't pay much, but you get pretty great work/life balance. It's pretty relaxed when it comes to calling in sick or for personal reasons. Unfortunately the workplace culture was not great to be around. Harassment and bullying was common, and when reported, the management just ignores it."
bad,"You will give everything you have to UPS and then some, yet it will never be enough. Once you've giving all of yourself to this company, they will throw you away like a dirty diaper. Union and management work together instead of the union working for it's members, but if you don't join UPS will find away to rid themselves of you."
bad,"There is no typical day as an Account Executive with UPS, which depending on the type of person you are can be a good or bad thing. Usual day starts off with checking emails/ voicemails and prepping for the day's customer visits which can very from service visits to contract negotiations."
bad,The only reason many people work at UPS is because of the benefits. Supervisors and managers hate their job. Everyone else does too. All we ever did was complain and yell at each other. They make you work in almost freezing weather to the point your hands turn purple with no heat source. They treat you like your expendable. Someone died Christmas 2017. No one said anything. I found out a week later someone died on my shift being crushed to death by a truck. Real nice guys.
bad,"Typically, you arrive at work and await role call. Next packages are delivers on belt to be sorted into the correct semi trailer using scanners and labels. There would be a designated breaktime to eat your lunch. I learned the proper way to lift packages. Management mislead me by telling me that a seasonal position would remain for me the next year. The position was closed the next year, and I was told to take a different position."
bad,The hours are unsteady and they always try and cut you before you get a lunch so they don't have to pay you for the extra time. Most of the supervisor don't know what there doing and are extremely unprofessional.
bad,"Stay away from management at ups just stay with the union. They try to catch you with the pay boost and faster benefits but the benefits for pt supervisors are much worse. Management can be good but at my hub they were nothing but abusive to the supervisors while restricting them to less hours than pt union employees during peak because ""cost"". Job used to be amazing the management can make or break it"
bad,Positive Culture - astonishingly poor operational acumen for a global logistics company!  Seasonal workers did not receive paychecks and this did not seem to be an issue to management.
bad,Loved the hours but not the back breaking work for low pay not enough to take care of a family and all management  does is walk around yelling at people
bad,"I liked the actual job, but not anything else. The job was really short lasting & they made it sound like it would be longer than it was!! I wanted to work full time & they wouldn't give me the hours. I was lucky to work 5 hours a day. It was almost not even worth my time!!"
bad,"The job is made out to seem more professional and rewarding than it is. It is high pressure and the salesforce is held accountable for company failures. "
bad,"For this job, I was promised to receive calls from 8-10 am daily to ask if I was available to work. If I said yes, a driver was supposed to call me within a short time period and tell me where to meet him so we could begin our deliveries. I was also given the impression that I would be able to work 30-40 hours a week."
bad,A lot of work for little pay and hours. You don't have benefits until a year later. Management is easy to get alone with they work with you. Everyone work as a team player. The hardest part is the end of the night Bulk items.
bad,"This company can be great or a nightmare depending on your approach and your needs. First off, the starting pay is lousy for supporting yourself unless you have a second job. On the flip side, the benefits are absolutely the best you can get anywhere. Healthcare is practically free without cost from your pay, and they offer retirement options and advancement for those who seek it. The downside to the advancement is unless you are more senior than your coworkers you will be in for quite a wait, but it will come eventually. Raises are determined by union contract and can vary but are pretty much annual. You'll get some sort of increase each year. Management runs the place like a correctional facility. They view employees not only as expandable but as a burden chewing up their regulated hours worked. This is the only company I have seen that rewards hard work with even more hard work and no fair rest or compensation while rewarding the laziest of employees with an easy do-nothing job for the same pay. Regardless of your work ethic they will try to get rid of you after time because you're being paid too much. This is where the union is a blessing because unless you are blatantly doing something wrong, they will back you."
bad,Poor management and very low morale. Proper training is hard to come by. Employees feel unfairly treated. Management seems to be hands-off when it comes to employees concerns.
bad,"I have worked there for 12 years and can't work more than 2 days a week as a road driver. They are more than happy to give my work away to contractors, while I seat at home starving. I haven't worked a signal day this month of November, and I have vacation and sick time the company won't allow me to us, because it's a ""blackout"" week."
bad,UPS was an okay starting job. The starting pay is not that good compared to the labor. All management cares about is meeting numbers. The result of that includes cutting corners.
bad,"The expectations for training are a little unrealistic as the seasoned drivers don't ever really meet the requirements.  You also need to watch out for yourself, because there is really zero help.  Example... There is a calculated amount of time for each stop, each package, and different pickups on each route which gives the work load of the day.  My time was not accounted for to pull a trailer everyday (which I found out later I was supposed to be paid more hourly for) and wouldn't count for time to pick up and drop while trying to make my time for training.  Benefits and pay were good."
bad,"management and labor were very divided, many layers of management.  and they moved them around often.  so you always were getting new managers that wanted to change the way everything was done"
bad,this company was a terrible place for me to work. you are working long hours and everyone is spread extremely thin. goals set are often unrealistic with the tools at your disposal.
bad,Working at UPS as a manager can be difficult in a union environment. Employees are protected by their union which makes it hard to enforce rules. Many union protected employees abuse the very thing that is supposed to be a safeguard for them.
bad,"This company is as corporate as you can get. A lot of politics and hierarchical maneuvering needed. You are very much encouraged, but also solely responsible for building your own network. There's a lot of old school mentality that is very rigid and tied to it's old corporate environment. I have seen good ideas that are brought down because the company structure lacks flexibility and quickness that can be experienced even starting in their technology. They will sacrifice quick go to market technology improvements for absolute perfection. It's truly challenging, but there is a small glimmer of hope with their new MBA management programs and intern programs."
bad,Working for UPS as a package handler was not an easy job and was not worth the pay. This job is best for people who just want a side job to get an extra check.
bad,"it very fast past "
bad,clock in go to trailer and start loading and unloading packages in trailer within first 10 mins i am drenched in sweat.i learned how to work on my own.my supervisor was a joke. workplace culture is very  laid back no problems with my coworkrs mainly with my supervisor who jumped down my throat my second day there assiging me to two of the hardest trailers.hardest part of the job is the lack and inability to train employees i watched a video on OCEA then was thrown into the fire basically and assigned to two of the hardest trailers.the most enjoyable part of this job was the water break.
bad,The pay is very good but they treat their employees like garbage.  Benefits are good but you have a shelf life that is not very long they will fire you.
bad,"It is an easy job to do but work is unbearable because they do not have enough staff and lack the infrastructure to process a lot of their packages in a timely manner."
bad,Watched to many UPser's who gave everything for their operation be ran off by those trying to validate their own jobs. Never took a lunch and actual breaks no matter how long the workday was scrutinized
bad,I was part time seasonal help and was working there only until a full time job became available to me. If a full time job was available would have stayed working at UPS.
bad,"Insufficient hours, not hard work if used to manual labor. Quick paced while moving trailer to trailer. Need to be able to lift seventy pounds or more"
bad,"I was told when I was hired that I would only have to lift 70 lb packages by myself, but repeatedly was required to unload 150 lb packages with no help."
bad,"This job is ideal if you are looking for something temporary, or a college student. There are a lot process to understand or memorize, no opportunity for career advancement, micromanagement, and pay is not worth the work."
bad,UP Sis a great job for someone straight out of High school but unless you plan to put in the 5 years to become a driver then it is mostly likely just barely going to get you by.
bad,"The environment was very busy and productive , fast pace. kept you busy. At times maybe difficult due to heavy loads . It was a fast and busy environment to be in and times will get busy due to heavy loads and lack of employs showing up."
bad,"UPS does provide stability,and great benefits.  However, it is extremely stressful, and management is under such stress they are very hard on the union employees.  The company only cares about numbers."
bad,Won’t do it again! They say they are all about customers but it’s definitely not the truth. All the calls are based on times and the shorter your on the phone the better of an employee you are; even if you haven’t helped them UPS still don’t want them on the phone. I suggest before getting a job at a call center for UPS you call their technical support for ups.com or for campus ship or try and ask about importing addresses... Only 10% or less of level 1 agents can actually help you and that’s their sole purpose. If they don’t know it they have a very angry person Messaging their computer and listening to their calls. Have fun!
bad,"You were expected to load over 1000 packages into 3-5 trucks off of cages on a conveyor belt in less than 5 hours. Sometimes 2-3 of your cages would go by with no packages so you're standing around doing nothing for a couple minutes then your next cage comes by with like 20 boxes and you're expected to get 5-7 boxes out at a time, write the package number WHICH IS ALREADY ON THE BOX on it again, put it in it's proper zone in said truck, and hope to make it back to the next cage 30-45 seconds later. I worked this job less than 2 months, lost 50-60 pounds, and was let go right at the end of my trial run."
bad,"I was told when hired that obtaining a 4-year degree would put me into a promotable position. I have been told since I received my degree that I would not be allowed to be promoted. The management teams are very cliquish. All the managers know each other, and do not want to allow outsiders ""into the club."""
bad,"Work days are typically face paced and heavy. If you are not accustomed to hard labor and harsh work environment temperatures you probably won't last long. Supervisors are ok to work with, however the managers are very aggressive in regards to getting work done fast and are not afraid to speak their mind. There are opportunities to work overtime and during the holiday season you will be getting paid pretty well, if you can survive the increased work load."
bad,"Personally, I would not recommend being a package handler at UPS. The hours are not steady and the facility I worked in (Ontario), did not have good management. Some of the supervisors were attentive to teaching you proper techniques on package handling while others completely did not care about the job or the facility at all. The biggest con about the job was the fact that your told you'll work part-time at around 20-25 hours a week. Realistically, starting out you'll work 10-17 hours a week, and the union dues are subtracted out of your paycheck. Many of the new hires I started with were typically sent home early from work, 1-2 hours into the shift, with no warning in advance, simply due to the fact that the load was supposedly light for the day and there were more than enough workers. Overall, if you plan on using this as a short term way to get money, look elsewhere. Now If your in it for the long run, looking to become a driver for the brown trucks or a feeder (semis), and your willing to suffer for a few years to become one, this might be an interesting option for you. UPS doesn't care too much about the package handlers, but they take care of their drivers."
bad,The job at UPS was a strenuous work day where the employees who were hired to load and unload packages were moving for a constant 5+ hour period. Break times were 10 minutes long and there were little to no accommodations for varying temperatures within the warehouse.
bad,Was injured on job. Took me two weeks to get evaluated by the head manager of the building. once i reached him he denied me going to the doctor so  I had to go myself and got fired for it.
bad,"Als Mitarbeiter wird man dort oftmals ausgebremst, wenn man sich weiterentwickeln will."
bad,"When i worked here i was treated unfairly and was forced to risk my own safety multiple times. I was made to walk through the bay doors, and i was also made to jump out of a moving vehicle by one of the drivers. when I brought it up no one did a thing. just say that because i lived a fair amount away they wouldn't have hired me in the first place."
bad,"A typical Day at work starts off with stress. Employees never come to work and get away with it. They disrespect you. Gossip spreads faster than it did in high school. Every knows everything. Management is usually the root cause of these rumors. You are set up for failure without necessary equipment or bodies. You are given unrealistic numbers to reach, and when you fail you are scolded in an unprofessional manner. Managers cuss at you, and bend the rules as they please. The hardest part of my job is showing respect to my employees when all i get are negative comments from my superiors. The most enjoyable part of my job is my time off."
bad,I would have to load multiple truck full of 20lbs + boxes within a time period and there are bells ringing and its very noisy hardest part is keeping the packages from jamming.
bad,"union is corrupt and unproductive. corporate leadership is too demanding and out of touch with daily operations. inadequate time/paid hours allotted to training new employees. Pay for employees too low, granted this is constricted by the union which encourages laziness, equal pay for unequal employees, and an unnecessary distrust of management and their intentions."
bad,It's was not enough paid they work u hard an pay you little money.its like they didn't not care bout the people that was working there if u got sick still had come to work or you get fire
bad,I put my two weeks in once king super said I can work everyday. They single people off to work alone while most have help. I'm not A fan of that. I worked it until I gave up
bad,"This is a company that is typical corporate America. They are controlled by the union employees. Management is taken advantage of and treated like dirt by their own management and by union employees. The benefits and pay can be great, but expect to get treated terribly, be taken advantage of, and never be thanked for a job well done. With UPS you will never be good enough and you are always replaceable."
bad,"Not a bad job. Just lots of problem solving for minimum wage (at least where I was working). Also, customers have a tendency to not be happy with you because UPS lost of damaged their package."
bad,"had 150-180 stops to make a day,was in assistant to the full time delivery person,during peak season (end of November-end of Dec)"
bad,"This job requires a hard-working attitude with a sharp head. You must be able to process information quickly and make fast decisions to succeed. The culture has been fairly poor because upper management makes inefficient decisions that affect everyone else down the chain. This makes things harder in the workplace. Also, the pay scale between management and drivers has developed a large gap. For these reasons, I wouldn't recommend this job unless you were planning on becoming a driver."
bad,"Hostile staff, poor working conditions, unreasonable management.  The first time the manager called me to his office he acted as if I was a bad person and not on his side.  I worked very hard and a simple discussion could have sufficed.  Was not informed I could request a union representative to join meeting until afterwards. People have been attacked by staff prior to when I joined."
bad,Supervisors have no idea what there doing I’ve personally heard one say “i could slap you right now” . barely any hours to get takes a long time to move up hardley any breaks no time for any bathroom breaks really all in all not a great place to work
bad,Ideal for anyone who is single and doesn't care to see their family. (As a driver). Management doesn't care about you or your concerns. Just look good on paper.
bad,"The job was a difficult job to begin with.  "
bad,I would have liked to get pay increases that reflected my level of effort and not a blanket increase. That system does not reward hard work and leads to frustration from employees.
bad,"This is not a job that most would want. They say it's not for everyone. I say that is not for most due to it's inefficiencies. The Package Handling job, I hope is nothing less than a stepping stone to other career options in the company because it is far too stressful as a long term job."
bad,"I worked for them over Christmas, the management is awful letting you know if they need you or not, most of the time they wont tell you intill the last second unless you need the money its not worth the frustration of the management"
bad,ups do not understand the work load increases daily but they did not want to pay the hours and my supervisor for the embassy center was very rude and a bit disrespectful
bad,"I was a seasonal driver for peak season. Everything was very disorganized. Every single day you are not sure if you will actually work or not, but it was mandatory to come in. depending on who loaded your truck, the packages were a mess to find."
bad,"It's close to impossible to meet the 1200 package per hour (PPH) quota as an unloader. It can also get very stressful as a package sorter, especially if you have two assigned unloaders that are fast."
bad,"Would leave UPS in a heartbeat if something comparable, job wise would open up. There is no work/life balance what-so-ever with this company. The stress is too great."
bad,"early starts"
bad,"The pay is fine with contractual raises twice a year. You gain a majority of your benefits after a year in the union, union dues are taken out every check until you reach seniority then it goes to just once a month. If you're an unloader the job is tolerable because you're there the shortest amount of time, but if you're a loader be prepared to be the last ones out while doing the most work. The work is tough on the body. Just hope you can move to a different job after you get some seniority."
bad,"Military, is the closest one word answer that I would describe UPS as"
bad,"I would only take this job as your last option. you are paid minimum wage. Other warehouses are paying more. If you're looking for good benefits then you this is good but again you will not be paid fairly. Everyone thinks for what we do we are being paid too little. We were told that we would get yearly raises and this year we did not because of minimum wage being raised. I've been here for two years and anyone that comes in right now or came in within the year and a half is being paid the same as someone who has worked here longer doing the same thing. It takes a year from your starting date to get your benefits. "
bad,"The typical day is to come in and assess new job tasks. The trucks roll daily and because of the age of the fleet, need constant attention to the smaller aging systems on the trucks. Examples: lights, seat belts, tires, body mechanisms, electrical gremlins. Staying on top of maintenance is key, but there is constant friction to pull just one car out of service for needed attention.                                                  The current management team does a good job of shielding automotive functions from the rigors of operations but not from the negative attitudes and cut throat accusations. The fact that you keep 30yr old cars running with minimal breakdowns is less noticed than the rumor mill generated by disgruntled unknowledgeable  personel. "
bad,It was a very good experience but the job did not last. I thought it would become full time after a while but did not get any hours after the busy season was over.
bad,they ask for effiecieny and safety but that place is madness. I am a college student and tried getting benefits for my finicial problems but not once did they bring it up after my month was up. the floor leaks on your boxes which ive complained about n nothing got done.
bad,"PRO's"
bad,I think UPS is a great place to work if you are looking for an hourly job and a non-corporate-like atmosphere.  The atmosphere is laid back.  Benefits are great.
bad,"Was hired as a seasonal driver, but was assigned as a helper. They scheduled me only three hours a day to push as fast and hard as you could work during peak hours then sent me home. Several days worked over 8 hours. Overheard some drivers ($35.00) laughing about how they drove and the helper ($15.00) ran to make the deliveries. One helper was attacked by a dog and almost died."
bad,This job has a very high turnover rate due to the work environment and changes with management or employees. Its great as a part time employee you get benefits but not much else is beneficial with being part time. You have to wait a very long time in order to become a full time employee. Very physical job but its a warehouse so you know what to expect when you get there.Main problem is they cant keep enough people there to work during the week so we are always doing alot more work than expected.
bad,Has great benefits but the work is worth a lot more than you're paid for. Minimal chance to advance from part time to full time and may be stuck in the same position for years.
bad,"The hours was okay, the training was poor. The benefits was great. I don't think for a call center they should test people. It's a call center. The score you had to get was unreasonable."
bad,Average mail production warehouse. Shipping and receiving product big warehouse alot of work most nights. A long time standing on your feet but work can be worth it.
bad,UPS offers great benefits but pay for part-time employees is sub par. The work is very physically challenging and the work environment is harsh. Summers are brutally hot and winters are very cold.
bad,I would not recommend working here. Hours are horrible and the pay is nowhere near what it should be for as much as they expect you to do here. This is not an ideal job if you are looking to advance quickly and make into a career.
bad,Stressful   fast   paced   work   environment   with unrealistic   number   to   meet   on a   daily  basis. The battle between management and the union continues to worsen
bad,The job was easy for those who learn fast and don't like to challenge themselves. The management prefers robotic lower to mid management. Implementing change is not readily accepted. The management style is very militaristic and very political. Outside ventures are not encouraged and will slow your career progress. Though the benefits are comparable with most corporations the wage was much on the low end.
bad,"If you are single and need a job to pay 1 bill then it is a good job because they will only give you part time at the beginning anyway."
bad,"They can hire better supervisors. They hire people off the streets. The supervisors feel they do not get paid enough so they drag their feet making it hard for the employees to have a successful day at work. If they hired better supervisors who want to be there and actually want to work, the whole work environment would be better. The union does a good job at protecting its employees. The Managers there talk down to their supervisors over the radio that they use to communicate at work."
bad,"Go for your self and see because it didn't work for me, don't mean it wont work for you. Its a good job if  you don't have a job during the day. Things just didn't work for me."
bad,a typical day at work is good.i learned how to work as a team.management is ok.the hardest part of he job was holidays.the most enjoyable part was you get paid every thursday
bad,A lot of work place problems that  stem from the size of the building.  Focus was not on employee goals but the focus was to only help UPS achieve max profits through this building.
bad,"If you're thinking about working for UPS, be prepared to rethink your career unless you want to spend a year or more waiting on a Truck Driver position. The work conditions are terrible, there were little to no breaks (5 min max), and the pay is not worth the work effect put in. Terrible job, I highly recommend you find some work elsewhere."
bad,"Long hours and decent pay.  I learned how to manage people.  I very much enjoyed seeing people get promoted that worked for me.  The workplace culture use to be ""take care of our people and they will take care of the company"".  It changed to an increase of people and areas to manage.  The CEO started managing by the numbers.  It was hard work but enjoyable."
bad,"the job is enjoyable but unfortunately the pay is minimal and there is no room for advancement at this facility, all in all i would say this was one of my worse experiences working for a employer."
bad,"Overall, the organization has its ups and downs. Benefits are great along with sufficient pay. Operations (in general) is horrible. Management is a strain. Everyone is out for themselves and teamwork is but a myth. Did I also mention that there is no union to protect you? Drivers run the company, for the good and the bad. The stress and workload is not worth the pay or environment."
bad,Management does not care about their employees and they do not listen to their employees and do not help them with situations. They also seem that there employees are easily replaceable.
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at ups i felt we were under payed disrespected and neglected. I regret every hour of overtime i donated to that company.
bad,"UPS is a okay place if you need the money, and it does have very good benefits. The people there have no respect for one another. they use foul language and do not think twice about it. there is not nothing really enjoyable about it."
bad,Very intense physical labor.  I hurt my food while stacking boxes even while wearing protective shoes. Unpredictable shift hours.  The scanner was recording the number of boxes handled throughout the shift - this was stressful because sometimes the boxes were difficult to stack.
bad,It was my first job as customer service associate and I learned a lot how to deal with different type of customer. Salary was good for a starter and there is always room for advancement .
bad,"This review is regarding UPS FREIGHT, not Parcel. They are two separate entities. "
bad,"UPS is a excellent company once you begin to move up, however when starting as a loader or unloader the pay is not good nor is are the hours full time. It is also worth noting that this is a union job."
bad,Good pay and benefits but dynamic between drivers and management is extremely contentious and chaotic and stressful.  Very difficult to just work hard and go home
bad,"This company has no structure. Management can be inconsiderate at times. The work days are just like work days anywhere else, some good and some bad. The company pays well and has great benefits."
bad,Get to connect with employees and the team helps you to learn new things. It offers 2 weeks of vacation. The health insurance is low cost but deductible is high.
bad,a tipical work day is about 3-5 hours of unloading loading and small picking of different areas and size of packages management is alright they work with you a little bit hardest part of the job would be having to deal with the noise the whole time its not bad it just gets annoying
bad,"If you are looking for a career that has intense labor requirements, low pay, and management that does not take your interest, take this job. The only reason I ever took this job was for the benefits as well as the union. They are the only saving graces."
bad,"My main responsibilities include handling heavy and dangerous goods, ensuring they are loaded onto planes in a set time frame. This has allowed me to learn what its like working in an incredibly fast paced environment where there is little room for mistakes."
bad,"If you can manage handling midnight shifts and tolerate the pay then go far it, other than that if you can put up with midnight truthfully don't do it you only get 10 mins break and majority of the time breaks is not given, so that right should tell a lot and if you don't get enough sleep you will be sleep deprived that's my experience I know everyone is different just helping others out to inform you what will you get yourself into."
bad,"Morale is low, departments keep closing.  Everything is on a ""need to know"" basis.  You can get 5 different answers from 5 different people.  Very strict on time management.  5 minutes to use the restroom, if you use more (off your breaks) you get an infraction.  If you come back late from your break, you get an infraction.  If you're late to work, infraction, if you have to leave early, infraction.  Infractions are one of the few things you can be fired for."
bad,"Not much to say, they dropped the ball on my situation"
bad,"The main problem within U.P.S is the management. The communication between the chain of command seems to be missing."
bad,A lot of friendly people but very unorganized with their management. The warehouse had a very small parking lot to where employees were forced to park on the fireside curbs.
bad,"It was really great getting to work for this company , the employees are really outgoing. I had a lot of fun times working here , although the boxes could get heavy at times. And the management could use some work."
bad,United Parcel Services is great for young adults that are coming out of high school and wants to make a career. The company is not designed for young adults that are trying to establish them selves.
bad,"This location is based in a hotel. A typical day at work consists of providing shipping/ print job needs. I deliver packages to guest's rooms if desired. While employed at this establishment, I have learned to be more patient with others. The hardest part of this job is that the work load is solely placed on me. The most enjoyable part is work/personal life balance."
bad,"It's hard to get the hours at UPS, which is the main reason I ended up leaving. Strict 30 day probation that taught me a lot about responsibility and accountability. I was not using the available tuition benefits which is the main reason for taking the job, so I found it hard to make a living."
bad,"a typical is starting the day off seeing whats on ur agenda to work on, whether its truck or trailer. I've learn that safety is always a top priority  for their employers and employees that they may go to the most important thing to them (family).  Management giving assignment. the hardest part of the job is working night shift. No one cares if u get tire throughout the night."
bad,This company had a good Manager team and handled the store very well but there was a major shortage on hours.The pay and the work was not adding up.
bad,"I've learned a lot over the past 5 years and ready for a new and exciting career."
bad,"Everyday that I work there I have a horrible experience. My supervisor rushes me to work. And the work is overwhelming. They only let certain people have off days, and they do not pay well at all. I would think that for so much work they have you doing, they would at least pay a reasonable amount."
bad,"The work is difficult and more physical than many people anticipate, about 80% of new hires don't last a month. As a sup, your job consists of paperwork, making sure loaders do their jobs correctly, write them up if they make even a small mistake, and occasionally take their place if they don't show up. You are responsible for 7 loaders, 18-20 trucks and on average about 6,000-9,000 packages. Another aspect of the job that I wasn't told about was daily training of new hires. Hours are typically 3am-9am, but during peak season (Christmas) start times are often midnight or earlier. The position is SALARY BASED starting around $14/hr with sups being guaranteed 5.5hrs/day, and God help you if you go over on hours and have to be paid for the extra work you have to do. The warehouse I work in serves a city that is rapidly expanding and is unable to handle the growing volume. Management has been slow to address these issues which makes work miserable for everyone. No matter how you do, you never do good enough. Everyday feels like you're fighting a losing battle and the most enjoyable part of the job is long walk to the car after making it thru another sort."
bad,"Opportunity for growth without having a college education.  as a part time employee the work is not justified for the pay.  if you want to make money you have to wait for full time positions.  the first couple of months you are going to be sore.  management does not know how to communicate, they feel it is appropriate to yell at employees, and only care about unloading the trailers in a specific time frame, regardless if the belts go down every 10 minutes."
bad,"Management puts too much stress on the drivers. They dispatch a 10 1/2 hour day, and the driver is expected to get it done under 9 1/2 hours.  Working for the company, you try to be as perfect as you can.  If you make one mistake, they will find it and write you up.   "
bad,"The typical work day consisted of managing inventory, handling sales and packaging of shipments. Up-sale and/or cross-sales when available. The managers where not there very often and at times were rather difficult to get a hold of when problems arise. My co-workers were good team players, and we solved issues through communication. The job became more difficult due to physical ailments that came up. As much as i enjoyed working for UPS, I could no longer handle lifting/ moving of large objects."
bad,hate every think about ups money people hours . it's not a job you wanna be for a long time . they do care about you at ups never again
bad,UPS is a company with great flexibility and benefits but with unrealistic expectations of the employees.  The office management sets unrealistic goals for the employees.
bad,"i learn how to work with other people ,a typical day at was just a really hard day at work ,thee hardest part of work is when you have alot alot of boxes to move up and down stairs.my co-worker was alright,the most thing i ever enjoyed at work was working overtime."
bad,"Co workers and manager are pretty cool but the job is intense basically for men, it was immensely cold and the breaks were horrible. the ""supervisors"" never notified break"
bad,Company has too many division to provide effective support and equipment  for parts of the company who were added or purchased later in the lifecycle of UPS
bad,A very tough and competitive environment. teamwork is needed to excel and to finish your daily work. A Part time job with flexible shifts
bad,"A day at work is securing parking lots, making sure there is no trespassers, lights out, broken water hose, and fire hazards are safe and secure. Also checking inside the building that I work in securing and checking all lights, doors, and any fire hazards. Also watching cctv cameras to make sure all areas are safe at all times."
bad,Very repetitive work with no room to grow in the company. The only nice thing about it is that it was laid back. Not career oriented.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me loading the truck. And if they needed me to I would unload as well. What I learned was I don't wanna do that kind of back breaking work for the rest of my life... Management was alright. My coworkers were cool. They did a decent job keeping me in an upbeat mood while I was doing that hard work. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the fast pace. The most enjoyable part of my job was when it was time to go home. Couldn't wait to get back home to my bed. I had to be to work between 2am to 3am usually.
bad,"everyone at work is really supportive and helpful."
bad,"A lot of pressure on numbers with accountability at every level, but numbers are also associated with regularly scheduled wage increases. It is a factory type environment - conversations are often politically incorrect. Arguments are often won with volume. Hours get very long over the holiday season, but are part-time the rest of the year, though pricey, health benefits are provided at 28 hrs/wk. Some people are able to thrive under these conditions long-term, but I don't suspect I am one of them."
bad,"The cash registers are outdated, the location is unsafe and a lot of the items sold are outdated. There is no lunch area for workers, and you will be overworked. A lot of people their including management call off work at the last possible minute often times forcing an already overworked coworker to pull a double shift or work more hours without a proper break time. They also get robbed a lot."
bad,Very old culture with old thinking and nobody talks about innovation. Lot of politics and they don't like you if you do something they don't know. Nobody wants to change according to current generation.
bad,"Stable workplace. Friendly co-workers. You have to be prepared to work in a team, learn fast and support one another. Management is friendly and supportive. Allow you to use initiative and implement strategies. I learnt how to work on a new accounting package."
bad,"A part time position for seasonal work. Neatly stocking 3 truck daily to capacity as package flow down the belts, making sure each package on the correct truck"
bad,short shift some times. stand in one spot. Mangement is ok and can be rude. Pay sucks and over work you for 8 dollars. you get to see different companies that ups process and you get to see your own mail
bad,"I load at least 4 trucks a day which have approx. 2800-3500 packages per truck for about 4-5 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with my co-workers. We always help each other but as for management, they have not been properly trained therefore leaving some of their responsibilities on the employees. I've been working at UPS for 12 years and the most important thing I've learned is to load by the hour and not by the package amount."
bad,"In general I keep repeating presentations and reports and I find them very repetitive and not challenging."
bad,"For anyone who would like to know whether UPS is a good start up job, the answer is somewhat but not quite. Yes UPS pays on a weekly basis and the average pay for new employees is around $110 maybe $130 on a good week. However if your struggling and just looking for any job UPS is the place mainly because they will gladly hire anyone. On the same token UPS package handler employees have the most work to do year round and the lowest payout. Package handlers are honestly the most important line of workers, despite the fact that they do not receive any official uniform. The most package handlers get is a small UPS badge after 4-6 months. Pay raises happen about every 6 months as well maybe a few dollars more. I happened to work the worst shift. In the Night Sort I worked from 10pm-3am, not terrible hours, but I'm sure you could imagine how irritated and tired you could be. I wont throw all of the staff and management under the bus, however my personal supervisors were terrible. If you planned on going to work and doing a half assed job loading and unloading extremely heavy freight then i actually recommend this job to you. However if you are naturally a hard worker who will put in the most effort you possibly can to get the job done, it is sad to say that you will be abused and over worked. On paper the end of my shift was 3:00 am. I never was able to actually leave on time because someone would always beg me to stay or stay until 4-5 am, even though I took the bus to work. There were even instances where it had been 20-30 minutes past 3:00 am and other employees were allowed to"
bad,"They seem laid back & fun, but will fire you with no reason and no warning.  Not sure if they sven know what they are looking for in an employee."
bad,"I learned skills to manage a large number of employees, time management. My peer co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is the long hours, too many meetings, high stress."
bad,"It was an okay job, worked 4 hours a day. Only quit because at the time I needed more cash. No dress code besides wearing steel toe shoes. Work by yourself most of the time."
bad,"When entering the work place, I'd clock in and look for the truck I'm working on that day. I would then get scanners and printers for when the packages start arriving. Before we all begin working, the supervisor makes a speech about things that will be happening throughout that week and informs us with how many trucks we will be having to face that night. When the belt begins moving is when the work begins. Packages flying left and right. The belt would jam constantly because of the many packages. I would recieve certain packages with a certain label. I'd organize all packages according to the numbers on the label, scan them and with the printer, I'd print out the new label on a sticker and stick them on the package. I'd then send it out to its appropriate location. Overall the job was simple, just not much help from many co-workers. I would ask questions on what to do on some things and for the most part, everyone was focused on themselves. That would be the hardest part would have to be the work environment was not suitable for a person unless you're wearing a coat, gloves, hat, scarf, and boots. Also, having to learn everything on your own. I'd observe other workers and learn that way. The best part of my job is towards the end when I'd clean up everything to then come home."
bad,"A regular work day is very chaotic. "
bad,"Horrible environment to work in. You would do 10 hours of work in only 4 hours. you have to go at a very fast past, wither your safe our not"
bad,"Het was een administratieve productiewerk, waar je een schema per dag krijgt met jouw taken voor die dag. Indien je klaar was met je blok, mocht je bij toesteming je collega`s helpen met hun blok. "
bad,"good medical and healthcare benefits"
bad,The hardest part about the job is that I would work four hours some days and the management would still deduct 30 mins for a break I dont get to take.
bad,"Lift packages in a dusty in sometimes very cold other days very hot environment "
bad,"I started working and it sounded so good because of the benefits. I didn't last there because I got a full time job now, but I've been waiting for my paycheck and it never came in, so I called hr to see when I can get a paycheck, and the lady on the phone was rude... I mean RUDE!! She told me I would have to talk to my supervisor which works at 3 A.M and she said  ""MAYBE they will cut you a check"" and hung up on me. Also the management is awful!!"
bad,"Doing the job is not difficult, but the amount of work expected in a single day led to 14-hour days as being commonplace. At least we got overtime."
bad,"i go into work early to arrange my work load on my van, I am always over despatched as I am suppose to carry 100 maximum but am sent out with over 124 thats without including pickups which can very from 3-20 on average where as my contract states 75-100 which means once i have finished I can go back to the depot and unload and go home unfortunately due to new management i have to take more out, help over drivers complete their deliveries and do several hours over time each day which is forced, I have had a warning for being unwell and was continually called hourly while i was supposed to be recovering which pressured me into going back into work the same day they also done the same when my mother passed away so i only ended up with 2 days grievance including the funeral, management are now bullying employees into not taking sick days/grievance days otherwise we will lose our rounds which some of us have been doing for years, i have booked two weeks of for holiday and have had my route changed due to this so im going to struggle, no one can book christmas holidays (nov 17th- jan 19th) since new management but are allowed to book eid as a holiday due to the new management a lot of the employees including myself have either left or are seeking new employment. prior to new management i was very very satisfied with my employment"
bad,"Good benefits.  More focused on production than employee welfare.  Seniority is more important than education, skills, or experience when promoting."
bad,UPS is an odd place to work. The first thing I'll note is the pay you get does not balance out with the work you do. You'd think for doing an extraneous manual labor job that you'd get paid a bit more or get raises better than 50 cents each year. You go in and risk injury for 4 - 5 hours just to barely make anything for the week. The majority of management could care less about your safety as they're more focused on whether you've tried running yourself into the ground doing way too much or doing something to undermine a smoother work night. Job advancement is a matter of whether your supervisor likes you enough to approve you and they don't give immediate response as to whether you've been approved to go through the promotion process. A paycheck and benefits do not justify how bad the way things are run here. Do yourself a favor and work somewhere else.
bad,"I worked only part-time for UPS meaning my hours were erratic and could include any time of the day. Mostly I would open and stay until 2. UPS had very specific training requirements when it came to packaging and organization of the store& P.O. Box area. Also, one learned quickly that mistakes in packaging were not only time consuming but considerably detrimental to the customer and to management. All except one of my co-workers were older women, who were nice and tried their best to describe/remind me of procedure. The hardest part of the job was finding the perfect packaging solution for each customers needs, but also remaining within budget limits. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a completely organized stack of mail put away in under a few minutes."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that it is physical labor. You work in a warehouse so whatever the temperature is outside, its what it is inside. "
bad,"There are three types of role but you cannot choose which you would like to apply for which i find unacceptable in a job."
bad,"In short while working for this company i was a slave of sorts. a typical day included unloading at least 4 trucks. i later became aware that one of my peers had previously made 100 dollars a truck, while i wasn't even making 100 dollars a day. i left this company on a sour note. they do not treat their temps well at all and i wouldn't work for them again if they asked me."
bad,"A typical day consists of loading packages into trailers which are sorted into the correct destination. whilst working at UPS i have learned how to correctly load a trailer so the packages are loaded safely and securely, the worst part of this job for me is the working hours, the shift is not very long but the hours are unsociable. I am looking for a full time job with working hours in the day ideally 0600-1400 or 0800-1600"
bad,Logistics was the most detail oriented position held at UPS. Engaged a lot of skills I have learned over the years.
bad,"good benefits , fast pace, tiring, willing to pay school and their always hiring weekends off."
bad,"It could be a symptom of the tight margins in LTL trucking, but there is a profound reluctance to invest in either staff or infrastructure.  For example, when Office 2003 reached end of life, instead of migrating to Office 2013 like the rest of the UPS Enterprise, Freight opted to take the discarded Office 2010 software that the Small Package side abandoned.  Training is almost non existent and staff are force to rely upon the CBT offered in the Enterprise.  However since the workday is consumed by day to day problem solving, the training must be done after hours on one's own time."
bad,"Not the same company it was 10 years ago."
bad,Working on vehicles and instructing other mechanics on the repair and status of maintenance of vehicles that were worked on.
bad,"I worked for UPS as a seasonal helper. I found it quite jarring how I was questioned as to why I wanted to work for UPS. Questions like you have seen drivers sweating and you think that is fun? I always wondered why this question was asked... Is it because I showed up in business attire a skirt to my knees, a button up top, blazer, and my makeup done? Daily routine for me. After applying and interviewing three separate times I was finally chosen to be a driver helper."
bad,"UPS can be a great place to work if you have the time to invest as a union employee, secure job, great pay, amazing benefits. However if you do decide to go management it becomes less so. Pay isn't terrible, but nowhere near enough to live on. Your benefits take a serious hit and your stress level shoots through the roof mostly due to incompetent upper management most of which have no idea what the actual job entails."
bad,"A typical day at work included sorting and mailing packages, packing and shipping larger items, opening and closing cash registers."
bad,I was recently hired for the Farmingdale NY HUB as a loader on the job now for two weeks. I was  rushed thru safety orientation with 6 other new hires we were giving the answer to the test to pass. I've learned safety is not a big concern with this hub  I can list many safety issues but sometime you got to see for yourself. On a positive note realyl nice work out But my health comes first and safety
bad,"A typical day would be coming to work with no work to do. Supervisors have no idea what they are doing or how to help you figure out what to do. When things did get busy it was basically data entry customer service, clerical work to be done. I learned that at some jobs you have to put your feelings aside just to stay positive and stay focused on what is important. Management was a complete mess and the co-workers were even worse. The hardest part about the job was staying focused and not getting involved with all the drama. There wasn't really a enjoyable moment."
bad,"As a loader you it all begins with setting up your trailer (clearing straps, bringing in rollers and a safety load stand). Afterwards you mostly just stack packages in either a 24 or 48 foot long ~10ft high trailer for 4 hours or so, read and scan labels, tape damaged packages, and deal with the occasional hazmat (item containing flammable/corrosive/frozen product[s]). Most often you'll work alone but sometimes get assistance or assist another depending on work load. Irregs (packages with potential to jam a belt/too large, or over 70lbs) will often need to be loaded and pulled into the trailer. Rarely and annoyingly will come down a conveyor belt. You work at your own pace but are expected to adjust to package volume coming into the trailer. Work slow and you will be more than an annoyance, work too fast and you'll be put into unfitting situations where ""unorthodox"" work methods may have to be employed to compensate. Depending on local weather may have to endure freezing or heat-stroke temperatures."
bad,A typical night is loading and or sorting packages in to various destinations
bad,you are underpaid but you can expect that cause its retail and retail jobs suck unless you are a female
bad,"I reviewed them as poor, because lets face the facts here, tey admit online to paying peopl $110.00 to $150.00 an hour for 3 and half to max of 5 hours of work a week."
bad,UPS is a secure job for the most part once you get in the union. However you will be at the bottom of the food chain working part-time during your time there unless you kiss some behind and get to know someone.
bad,I think it needed better management but all in all i still wish i had the job.
bad,A very fast-paced atmosphere. Because of so many time constraints you are required to perform at a very high level on a continual basis. Not a fast advancement organization for hourly workers.
bad,they will accuse you and fire you on the spot for even the little things
bad,Ups is a good experience both for the negatives and the positives. I learn a lot there dealing with people and how to handle certain situations . I been there for eight years and ready to move forward in my life new change n new beginnings
bad,"UPS has a culture of ignoring safety regulations,  if you don't ignore safety regulations you cannot complete the assignment. If you do keep safety regulations, you will have multiple 'conversations' with your supervisor. This creates a damned if you do, damned if you don't culture. Thank God that there is a union to prevent termination over this."
bad,Warehouse workers are all pretty good people it was management and hr i had issues with they were all unprofessional.  have worked for smaller and larger companies with no issues but this management team and hr team was just the worst its a good starting job i guess i would recommend transferring to a hub or looking for a better job. pays okay too.
bad,No breaks given! Over worked and under paid. Not enough hours given weekly. It should pay alot more then 11.oo for a loader. If it was more hours and higher pay then maybe this would work. It does have plenty of room for advancement. I loved my Supervisor!  Ups was a great place to work overall the management was awesome.
bad,UPS is a hard job working at ups was a challenge for me my 6 month of working the was so hard for me I had to spend more time to ups because I needed money to help my people
bad,"UPS will hire almost anyone. If you are looking for an in-between job, this is a great fit. The hours are short, only 4-5 hours per inside/hourly shift most of the time (during Christmas they are much longer). The pay is fair, but not enough to sustain a living wage. They are desperate for new part-time management constantly because they mistreat and blame all production problems on them. The hardest part of the job is getting stuck: not wanting or being able to become management or a Driver, the only two avenues for promotion. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding a similar-minded group of teammates that have fun at work together, despite the toxic full-time management."
bad,"Good company to start your career or to start something new. If you start in operations and you have a degree, you can go into any department - just put in your time & work hard. Good benefits, starts with 2 weeks vacay + 5 discretionary days. Unlimited sick days. Steep learning curve and long hours. Longer hours during peak 12+. Cost cutting and short staffed. Good job security (you'll always have a job... it may not be the one you want). Operations management culture is terrible. Someone is always yelling."
bad,"I took a job position close to home and ended up having to drive 4 towns over to the ""helper"" job I got. I received anywhere from 2-4 hrs on most days and the max I got 9 hrs. But I quit because It wasn't worth the drive for so little hours."
bad,UPS had awesome benefits even for part time employees after 9 months.  If more hours are needed or if your trying to go full time I found it very difficult.  Not too friendly culture.
bad,"I was an employee at UPS for 22 years. 5 as a loader, 5 as a driver, and 12 in management. I excelled as a loader and driver and relatively liked and appreciated my job. I was convinced to take a promotion into management after 10 years which completely changed my perspective. The way I was treated was discouraging. Upper management, manages thru intimidation..."
bad,"UPS is not a very woman-friendly workplace. There have been many instances where women have been mistreated, harassed, and degraded on a consistent basis."
bad,"Founded over 100 years ago, UPS has not quite adapted to the new generation of employee. The company struggles to bring in talented individuals, and is now struggling to keep talent within the company.  Employees make or break a company. UPS needs to get back to that core fundamental and take care of those making the profits."
bad,"Weather is a big thing UPS no air conditioning in the warehouse so make sure you are ready for climate to change everyday 3 to 4 months. Also there can be good and bad times depending how long you been with the company, because of the more seniority you have the better."
bad,"They higher people at 16/hr for peak or when people order Christmas presents, then a day before it’s due, they tell you to re apply or you lose your job"
bad,It an ok job very busy but I enjoy being active. When it comes to management that’s another story there is no team work and very poor communication. Their only concern is loading the trailer fast as possible.
bad,This place runs off of numbers that are made up. These made up numbers are more important to management then the people who make them. Its a borderline hostile place to work.
bad,"Dispatch is either really disrespectful or kinda of nice there is no in between. Very disrespectful to your face and behind your back. Other peak drivers did not really like one of the woman at Dispatch. Also a couple peak drivers said. "" I swear we get set up for failure! And the Dispatchers get anger when we do something wrong when they are the ones in a nice warm office."" Maybe they should try driving in the pouring rain and lifting  up to 80bls packages"
bad,Worked here for about 8 months and the person who trained me was absolutely terrible and literally caused me to cry on one of the first days...managers are kind of uptight and sometimes rude. Some days are better than others.
bad,I went to the interview for the package handler. When I got there I was informed that the hours were not the am/ pm hours in the add! It was 3am -9pm! I informed the lady that I signed up for evening hours because it said am was full but I thought am hours were 5-9.... she said at the piqua location they only have 3 am at the piqua location. So weird that you apply for certain hours but they don’t exist?
bad,"They didn't drug test anyone which was pretty sketchy, even if someone was reported for drug use. This means they hire just about anyone for the work. The hours change a little bit and you pretty much have to meet them. The Union that the workers are apart of isn't great. Most supervisors are from another location and they don't know what they're doing. The training is terrible for what the actual work its. The only reason I worked here for so long was because of the friends I made. They kept me sane and level headed for the most part. This job is a lot to handle and will take up more time than you think and they say. For the year that I worked here, I got a break half the time depending on how my supervisors felt."
bad,If you are looking for a job to get in shape while getting paid then this is the job for you.  Each shift is like a long gym workout.  You will lose weight and get in shape in no time.  Other  than that the pay isn't worth it
bad,Very Hard Job. They work you for  4 to five hours at a time they pay is not fair. Its a very physical Job the management was not nice. Expect to be slaved there.
bad,Working for UPS was alright. The same work day in and day out. A big lack of communication. Very hard to advance past a supervisor. Not the cleanest place to work.
bad,It's okay I suppose but it's really just not for me. But it's probably fine for others as we are not monolithic in nature as a species. That's all I have to say about that.
bad,Nice pay and great benefits. The management were the absolute worse. I I trained myself on how to do my job and they wouldn't let me advance my career to be a driver because they couldn't find anyone else that would take my job.
bad,"communication between me and my supervisor is bad.day one I was thrown in a trailer with no instructions just do,Training is about haz materials than teaching how to use there tools&load a trailer,My sup dosen't say what I'm doing wrong just finds a reason to send me home.I'm learning on my own and wondering why I'm still there I guess I have patients  to put up with it"
bad,They suggested I skip lunch in order to make time and make the 30 days. I was told to just bring a banana and a scoop of peanut butter to eat while i work instead of taking an actual lunch break. They give you a tough route to start. They want you hustling and speeding everything up so they don't have to pay you OT. If you don't make time they will send the road manager to follow you and watch you to see what you're doing and why you aren't going faster.
bad,"Overall the company itself is great, unless you are part time and get sick or injured that require you to take time off. Then the company don't look out for their part time employees as they do their full timers."
bad,UPS is now the place you want to work at you can do better at other job or a better  career when you first working at ups it be ok until you can’t Stay  on how they treat you
bad,I really enjoyed working for this company when I started. I grew through the company extremely fast and really enjoyed being there. I have been promoted twice and make good money and enjoy some of the people that work there. The hardest part about the job is the management personnel above is extremely hard on you.
bad,"After being there for many years the company is changing and I don’t think it’s for most people. I do believe that there are chances to advance in the company is that is your goal, but I also believe that amount of time that you have to put in that job is unhealthy"
bad,"The job was extremely fast paced with no end in sight during the holiday season. Everyone worked very hard to keep up but it was too extreme for me. I think it was a good opportunity to experience the shipping industry first hand, but it would have been better for me to begin during a season when it is not at an extreme level to build physical strength and stamina to prepare for the busy season. I have great respect for UPS and the volume of shipments they move and deliver everyday."
bad,"Old/ broken equipment are Biggest problem. workers have to speed up to compensate for the rollers that don’t spin on roller sections, Workers have to dead lift 100+ lbs to get roller sections properly secured. All of them require either the roller sections to be pushed with extreme football linebacker force, risking the person holding the other side or dead lifted at an awkward angle, these are dangerous techniques that you will feel the next day and if done wrong you will feel it forever, good thing they have good health insurance which is what you will need after taking this job. Please be sure to report all major injuries, so they pay for your recovery. The other major issue is time, it is mismanaged and unorganized, average unloaders are 3x faster then loaders so you would expect them to hold a 1:3 ratio of unloader/loader but they don’t as packages are coming down to loaders twice as fast as they can handle, I believe they do this to stress the loaders into loading as fast as they can to get the shorter day so that the company ”saves a few hours” I guess. But the actual result is just packages thrown hard onto the floor, walls or even the roof, a good portion of packages break on impact from frantic loaders trying to keep pace with the loaders, and if the loaders take their time or don’t have the man power to keep up the packages get crushed as the backup of packages pushing on each other on the belt being stuck and jammed causes just about the same amount of damage maybe more. I don’t know how their package claims department isn’t making this an issue. 🤫"
bad,"UPS is taking a nose dive. The company is pushing for less drivers and more hours worked. When you are already missing dinner every night, the last thing I want is more overtime. You can work your butt off but they will only reward you with more work. Expect to get the worst routes and longest hours until you have put 15-20 years into the job."
bad,It just hard for like get help but they won’t find people to help it keep on leaving me with a lot of heavy stuff in the trunk I have to move take stuff out
bad,"You work 50+ hours a week and given tasks there are impossible to finish in a 14 hour day. Yeah, the pay is good but, I had no time to my self. 2 months before Christmas and a little over a month after you are working 60 hours a week,  and they were trying to push us to 70. They mess with your time card to squeeze every minute out of you. Its an absolute nightmare during the holidays. Then once its summer, have fun cause its 140+ degrees in those trucks with no ac."
bad,Job security is a little iffy. The benefits are awesome and start 30 days after employment. The training is not as detailed now as it was when I started a few years ago.
bad,We barely worked 5 hour shifts and I had to work Tuesday-Saturday from 4am till about 8-9am. It was hard for me to get up so early on a Saturday so I decided it was time for me to leave after the fact that they lied to me.
bad,No matter the years I worked there I wish the opportunities were easier there. I didn't have a good chance at moving moving up to full time after all my years I gave this company. I was told try after 5 more years. And I had already been with Ups for at least 12 years.
bad,"ups was a very good company to work for when I started. After they went public with their stock, it went downhill from there. Management was loading up on company stock be for they went public. Would not let hourly employees buy stock before the IPO like management was doing. ""bonus"" hours are not in the union contract. Management ""tweaks"" the production numbers to give their favorite drivers more allowance on their delivery routs. There is a lot of favortism and Long hours. Management blames the drivers if they can't get done with each days work. Management always cut out too many routs and load up the ones that are left in. Always over dispatching routs. One center manager was very abusive verbally. Always threatening everyone. He was definitely a ""do as I say, not as I do"" person. The few good managers they do get don't last long. They usually quit, or get forced out, or fired. They say they can't treat people that way, and live with themselves, so one way or another they are gone. Not enough room to say all that should be said."
bad,A horrible place to work if you’re a minority or lgbt. The harassment and discrimination is never ending. Both from management and the employees. Union is useless and doesn’t protect you from the harassment
bad,Low pay for the type of work you are doing. It's very physical. Low-performing and high-performing employees are treated the same and paid the same. Raises are yearly. They are extremely relaxed in everything they do. Unless you physically get into a fight with someone it's unlikely you'll get fired. I witnessed everyone's pay cut by 40%. Company doesn't care. Very cheap. They will hire people with a criminal record.
bad,Started on preload went to full-time driver in 4 years. Pay was great but always fearful of being fired. Union can get your job back but still a hassle.
bad,"The job was ok at first until they started hiring more people and cutting hours with all the employees. During the holidays they work you a lot without a break, but then when they do not need you they cut your hours a lot."
bad,They overwork you expect you to load 1300 boxes a day in 4 hours constantly yelling chewing tobacco everywhere it’s disgusting. Pay was good but wasn’t worth going home to your back hurting every day.
bad,"Working at UPS is very fast paced, they dont really care for you, as long as youre pushing out production, youre good. Theyre pushy and give no help.."
bad,"UPS is a union job.  Management and union members constantly at each other. "
bad,A typical day included loading and unloading trucks sorting packages to the right area sorting small packages making small bags moving/parking trucks around theyard
bad,"During the day, I would rarely talk to anyone. The job was fast paced and required quick thinking and even quicker movement. I had to squat/kneel at many points of the day, which was hard on my knees."
bad,The way management talked to the workers is incredibly rude and nasty. The put down their workers and threaten them with sending them home if they dont do what theyre immediately told.
bad,It would be hard for me to go back to UPS because management didn't treat you right the pay wasn't worth enough and it was an argument or chaos  every day at the job.
bad,"People will always give you a hard time , even if you were to keep to yourself. The supervisors would kill the new hire employees with a lower ""seniority"" & simply make you go home upset. You don't matter there, the job does."
bad,It wasn't a bad experience at all just pay wasn't really reasonable to me but it was an opportunity to grow just took a year of doing an unpleasant job for a lackluster manager
bad,At ups you will be moving from the second your shift starts to the second it ends. The work can be stressful at the start but if you stick with it it will become more routine. There are many different supervisors some are easier to work with then others but for the most part many don’t understand how to properly run a dock. Although the higher up management does its job well.
bad,"A good place to work if you thrive in a logistics atmosphere where everything is fast-paced and repetitive. There are no negatives other than the ones that arise from your perception and thus attitude, that you take wherever you go, work, leisure, or otherwise."
bad,Would only work for if your trying to get college paid for. Management does not care to take advantage of employees and even blind side you for certain things.
bad,"Excellent employee, On time work on time Leave on time and help sometime if they need extra help I work as a team with my Coworker and most the time training people what they supposed to do on the job"
bad,"UPS is a very unfair job, but at the same time UPS does have good benefits to offer their employees. Not a bad job for college student to work during college."
bad,"honestly not what you expect coming from a known company, management is the big problem, a lot of pride and egos coming from the supervisors, and really careless if the work is safe or not, just care how they viewed in the work place."
bad,Overall great company. Job security is great. Benefits are amazing. Pay can be a lot better for Account Executives. The culture is very regressive and conservative not very millennial friendly. Promotion is not always based on merit. If you want a company with good stability but are willing to sacrifice pay and at times career advancement this is a good place.
bad,I did like this job but they was no help at all but they was so busy had no choice but to work fast but most of all it was a good joe and I would love to work there again
bad,"You'd break your back lifting boxes for minimum pay. They tell you you'd get paid a certain amount but won't receive it till a contract goes through with the union. Not worth it at all, yeah benefits are nice but only if you see yourself here for 10+ years."
bad,"The people in management are rude , disrespectful, "
bad,"The job is  not bad however, I do not get enough hours to be able to pay my bills.    $11 an hour for 20 hours per week on call doesn't go far, but I hate to give it up just in case."
bad,"Drama filled workplace, you have to wait a year while making pennies and expected to do 3 are more different jobs . Start time changes everyday no stable time to get acclimated to. Expected to fill in for ppl who don't show up understaffed and overworked."
bad,A very tough work environment but you must do your best to adapt to it in order to get the job done. water was sometimes provided plus there are water fountains.
bad,Been at ups for more than 4 years and one thing I learned that this company definitely expect you to put them first before your family and health I’m glad to make the decision to leave I’m happy that I get to enjoy my day with my kids and family before I get to go to work at my night with my my new job best decision ever
bad,"A day at UPS was a stressful day, that is when they needed you. AT the beginning I was get decent hours but that was because it was peak season. once it died off it got to the point that I was arriving to work and they would send me back home. they expected me to only be working 2 or 3 days a week and be fine with it."
bad,"I worked for ups for over 6 months at first I thought it was alright. Until I got promoted to floor supervisor, they pushed us to move our people to fill 3 trucks per one person with some of them reaching over 1,200 pieces all together within a 5-6 hour time frame.  management was never happy even on our best days so dont get me started on our bad ones. just a very non uplifting  place I would not recommend"
bad,This place people come to get it done and go home but a week or two after this it just feels the work load coming down more and more on the body and its just too much
bad,There is a huge problem with management (some of them) where employees and supervisors leave left and right. If they got rid of the hot heads and the people who think it’s okay to yell at their employees then this job would be okay.
bad,Negative environment  hard to work there management was hard to deal with long hours never good enough low moral just hated it I couldn’t do it anymore that’s why
bad,"When management starts to deliver punishments based on personal affiliation it becomes a hostile environment, falsely terminated once and they never treated me the same again, forced me to resign a week later."
bad,"The job itself is tough as it is. That is fine considering the nature of the job. Moving boxes, often packages over 70 pounds can be very tiring. You get a short break and the supervisors are always pushing you to work harder and faster."
bad,"Supervision was horrible. Uneducated managers who had extreme power trips amongst ""particular"" employees. Safety was not a word working within UPS. Get it done was the only Motto."
bad,"The schedule is chaotic, never knowing your start time for Tuesday until you leave on Monday, and never knowing when you'll be leaving. You could leave at 3 on the slowest days, or you could leave at 8, with no way of knowing what it will be when you walk in and a penalty for leaving."
bad,"The work itself is fairly easy, physical but easy. The problem for me was management. They would express frustration that something was not done correctly or 'numbers' were not met yet they would not train or even tell you the proper way to do it (or even what those'numbers' are). "
bad,I dot really have to much good things to say about this place beside you meet a lot of people and it is a very faced paced job but you also get to work as a team sometimes so it was nice to be able to do that.
bad,"Decent company to work for, Good pay and Benefits , Injured people are treated unfriendly. Management needs work, employees are just a number, quick to punish mistakes and slow to reward good work"
bad,"a typical day at work will be good every day i come in i learn how to keep the work area clean , safe  and moving all dangerous hazmat unloading, and loading"
bad,"During  the peek season you can get all the hours you can work.. but as soon as it is over you may work only 3,30 hr a day. if you get more you are lucky... it is hard work a lot of picking up heavy boxes. and supervisor screaming and yelling. and sometimes they mess up on your pay check. and you may not get all your hours."
bad,"I'm still employeed for a few more days but they promised me a full time position only to find out it was seasonal, Manager and supervisor need to be trained because our facility is very disorganized and they are very disrectful.  I dont tolerate being disrespected at no cost and if you speak your mind to defend yourself in a conversation they will make your life miserable, cut your hours and reduce your work days!"
bad,"J'ai travaillé chez UPS au siège et en province durant 4 ans en tant qu'ingénieur industriel. "
bad,"Its intense and not for those that lack motivation. work hard and move up quickly. Be nice to everyone, you are all exhausted. Management is also very over worked and doesn't do much more than yell or simply not care. You are absolutely trading your time for money. This is amazing for. quick seasonal job but it eats up a lot of your time, ensuring you don't have a life. you have money with no place to spend it because you're to tired."
bad,I really think that UPS should acknowledge the workers that comes in as part-time and acknowledge them more and try to keep the ones that buss there buts at work. I really feel that its very racist to some of the employees and the some of the lady supervisor get jeaslous when another woman comes in and work as hard as them and do it better. I was a new comer on package handler and I started on 4 trucks by myself anf was doing it better than most men been there over 10 years. The managers gets jeaslous at you when you leave its there jobs to check the trucks and I feel that they put packages in wrong trucks just so you can have miss packages in wrong trucks. The drivers are racist anf disrespectful and nasty to the woman there and no I love hard work but I hate workers that are very nasty and racist.
bad,"I felt like i was being taking advantage for my excellence as a picker, no opportunity in advancements, insufficient availability in advancements. I was uncomfortable after three years and very stressed"
bad,Had many problems out of my payroll and getting my paycheck from week to week. I never not once missed a single day or shift nor was I late not once the entire time i was employed through them. I was a great employee and was complimented all the time for my quota and my numbers at the end of each day but they did not treat me fairly at all.
bad,"Firstly, I work UPS freight as a union employee. There are other UPS freight employees non union on other accounts such as advanced auto parts and UPS freight contractors which run terminal to terminal taking our freight for about $1.10 a mile. The company senior guys on the road board have it well (like myself), making .73 cpm and about $29 hourly on non driving and typically an easy home daily bid route. However, if you’ve just started and it takes 4 years to get to top rate and our new contract calls for a two tier pay scale so you will never make as much as a current employee. Plan on spending a lot of time babysitting the phone as you’ll probably be on call your first few years. "
bad,Personally depending on your situation you may want this job if you can't find another one. But I would recommend picking a different choice because the job is physically demanding on your body. It breaks you down everyday. Not worth your health.
bad,Management has unrealistic expectations for some people while others have no expectations. There is a lot of petty nonsense and shady things going on.
bad,Instead of working 5 days a week. They could've work 10 to 12 hour a day for 4 days and have 3 days to rest. most of UPS drivers have fiscal problem within 5 years of employment. Despite of all of safety  megere have been put it place.
bad,"I can’t speak for other warehouses , but the southern location in Las Vegas is not a ideal work place. Employees are constantly worried about losing their job. Pay is not enough for the work they have us do , it’s literally pulling teeth trying to get management to do anything for you. You have to keep track of your hours because they will cut your hours or change them in the system and you won’t get paid for it. Speaking from my experience I got thrown into unload without any training , and was told to just “unload fast” that’s it. I didn’t get proper safety training until I had been on the job already six months. They really do a lot of stuff backwards just to make through each day. I wouldn’t recommend unless you really need the benefits and if you can wait a year to receive them, if you need short shifts the job is perfect. Longevity wise it eats at you most workers are depressed, you don’t get paid unless you been there a while or become a driver and sacrifice all your time for pay."
bad,A great place for a college student who wants some benefits with a little extra income. Drivers will make good money but have not enough quality family time!
bad,Love working at up let go for wrong reasons personal reasons not fair how I'm not eligible for rehire at a different location .. I wish to get my job back maybe not go back to Palo Alto but to the ups in san Jose ca
bad,"Management is out of touch with the ground forces.  Expecting too much from and over worked force.  Family time is non-existent,  Expect to work long days and not be around during the holidays."
bad,"I'll start off with the good stuff about this job. The benefits are good, it's an easy job to get, and you essentially get paid to lose weight. The bad stuff is that the work itself is stressful and exhausting, with it being worse when we are understaffed when it gets trashed (i.e. virtually everyday). The other loaders either don't feel like helping or intentionally put all their work on you if they see you hauling it. Rarely do they get called out on their poor work performance (most won’t change anyway). The good loaders that stick out, as well as getting dumped with all the responsibilities, take the brunt of the ire from the supervisors either for not whipping the lesser loaders into shape or as a lighting rod to take their anger out on when things go afoul at the department. The supervisors themselves don’t care about the work, only that it gets done and gets done on time. Most supervisors at my hub just phone it in every night because they're so burnt out and miserable from all the stuff they have to contend with from upper management and their subpar employees. They either rarely listen to any of your complaints, get annoyed when you complain or try their hardest to try and twist it and blame you for them in order to shut you up (like there’s anything they can do about the problems you have issues with to begin with.) I used to go in expecting the worst every night, no lie. Upper management yells at everybody when your department falls behind yet cuts people when your department absolutely needs them. We're underpaid for all the stuff we have to do and put up with. There's"
bad,Fast paste work area! Some good people to work around if you get along well with others! The Pay SUCKS when you first start working there! Keep a clear & good mindset going into work everyday!
bad,A typical day at ups thousands of packages coming all at you at once on a conveyor belt take it off put it in the truck at a fast pace and repeat until it’s time to go
bad,My first time working with UPS was wonderful I enjoy working there what the reason why I left there it was a part time job and copy years past I reapply and right now I'm currently working there but also I want to look for a next job one thing I learned from UPS is you must be on time and do not steal anything inside the building and that is a automatically termination and you will no longer work there
bad,"Als Übergang kein schlechter Job, jedoch mittel- und langfristig überhaupt nicht empfehlenswert. Dankbarkeit und Motivation von Seiten der Führungskräfte, Fehlanzeige. Dennoch das Verhältnis von Arbeitszeit und Einkommen kaum schlagbar"
bad,UPD warehouse was a very fast paced environment. I worked there during the seasonal rush during the Christmas season and it was very fast paced. they overwork the employees rather than bring in the proper amount of employees to handle the work load.
bad,"Productive workplace, always gives the customer satisfaction, friendly people and lots of learning on the job. Fast pace working environment , need to work against the time."
bad,Beginners get treated like trash make them do all the things that other people don't want to do the only way you get treated right is if you have at least 15 years of seniority and up
bad,The hardest part of the job was the management team overloading drivers. Rather work drivers 60-70 hours a week than put another route in. Step over a dollar to save a dime.
bad,Fast paced and competitive.  Tight deadlines and quotas.  Long hours especially during the holidays.  When things are slow they can take your off the board and you don't work or get paid that day.
bad,"Chaotic"
bad,UPS is a company that simply tells its employees what they want to hear to make you go away.  I started worki g for UPS in 2002 and absolutely fell in love with it; people working together as a team all with the intentions of accomplishing the same goal.  That place does not exist anymore.  They simply want as much blood out of you as they can get and then they will leave you somewhere to rot.
bad,"I would say go into the position with an open mind and a willingness to learn and work hard. Like anything in life, you get out what you put into any worthwhile endeavor."
bad,"Would love to work as a shifter full time, took a full time position not able to do the job that I so love to do. I was really good at it. Is making me to wait in progression."
bad,The job is very fast pace and if you can't keep up you might get yelled at. The pay sucks for the work and it's better off as a second job because you can't live of the pay they give you and promotions are nonexistent
bad,"TLDR: Start as a driver, manager, trainer, SOMETHING other than the lowly loader, unloader, laborer, etc. Your pay will be garbage and hours will be less than promised."
bad,When I started at ups in 2009 it was exciting and very approachable. I learned many things..Supervisors were fantastic. As time went on yrs I didn't care for the place to much. I'm so glad I received the opportunity to work here and advance to a full time position as I did. I earned certificates and plaques for my outstanding work.
bad,UPS is a demanding job with little pay. I liked the team atmosphere. Working at UPS helped me get in better shape because I was constantly moving heavy boxes.
bad,"I was brought in every day to load 3 more trucks than some of the most experienced loaders on the crew. While this was happening, I was also made to move pallets across the facility and unload 18 wheelers in the parking lot. I would then be reprimanded at the end of the day if my original five trucks were not done."
bad,"This job is not for the weak. People think they can handle this or that but when it boils down when it gets gritty they will come to the conclusion that I did, this is not worth $11 per hour."
bad,"Fast paced and inconsistent hours. Some supervisors were nice and others yelled all the time. They don't really care about their employees much, but the benefits were ok."
bad,"I had gone into this workplace with such optimism, and it really pains me to write this because there are some supervisors who I have so much respect for. But ever since the new building opened up at the Lexington Hub I have realized I cannot do this. I will never see the promotion I was told I would likely get even though I took the part-time supervisor tests and passed five months ago (and with a college degree, no less). My new supervisor is, in essence, verbally abusive and makes it a hostile work environment. He thinks it's all in good fun but that's really not the way the rest of us see it at the end of the day. Because of his shenanigans, on top of a whole host of problems that have festered over the past two months, I'm resigning on the 29th."
bad,No heat or a/c in the warehouse... supervisors are the worst... working environment is dangerous. work hours are horrible... theres much more that i don't care to mention in this review...
bad,"The work is brutal , fast paced & gross . But they do give great benefits after you’ve worked there for a while and pay off the debt you basically get into after applying"
bad,you would go threw security.witch they where so mean.  then you go to the time clock to punch in. then you would get in your truck or where ever they put you and you would load your truck
bad,"While there are many things that can be said about the company, there are actually a few benefits. They pay for college immediately after reaching seniority, and after a year you get insurance and retirement. There are many stresses that are almost to the point of taking out the human perspective in place with production standards. There are goals that are outrageous and no one has any idea of how to help in achieving them. If you are prepared to be set up for failure and expected to succeed everyday, then this may be the job for you. If that isn't the case, look elsewhere."
bad,"I worked for this company a little over a month. I felt like I was thrown in the deep end expecting to know my job without being trained. When it come to loading the vans on my first day I was expected to load 2 vans at a time without any knowledge at all of what I was supposed to do. As for their rules, I find them lacking in any compassion. When on your 3 month trial period you are only allowed 1 day in the whole time off. I was off 2 days. I had 2 very genuine reasons for my absence and on both occasions I let them know I wouldnt be in and why I wasnt able to come into work. I was informed that if you have more than 1 day off in your trial period you would be faced with instant dismissal. I feel this is very harsh. As for the people I worked with, they were a wonderful bunch and made me feel very much at home. I just feel the person in charge on my shift was lacking in both empathy and understanding."
bad,Slow advancing to full time employment . If you start in your early 20's or fresh out of high school its an excellent job. In most cases it takes more than 5 years of part time work to become full time employee.
bad,Manager took advantage of me just to get me to stay there longer. Listen to your union reps if you do end up as a package handler is the only advice i have to give.
bad,Job would be be great if the hours increased and pay increased. But is your looking to lift a lot and constantly this could be a job for you. Other than that the people you work with are great and its constant work.
bad,"Everything at UPS is a unit of time. How long does it take you to walk from location to location? How long does it take you load a package? How long does it take you to drive to where you need to go? Everything is looked at and nothing is ever enough. No matter how much you give its not ever going to be enough. As long as this mind set continues at this company nothing else other than production will matter. If you're looking for a job that will give you stability, then yes by all means apply for UPS. But if you're looking for a job that will give you more meaning for the effort you put in on a day to day basis don't apply."
bad,"Working at ups wasn’t clicking right for me , staff wasn’t polite driver would be late some of the times . Last but not least I’ve learned to move fast"
bad,"UPS offers great benefits with room for advancement. The overall corporate feel is what ruins it for me. I would not recommend this job to a friend. Unless i didn't like my friend. Shift is in the middle of the night, starting wage is low and you have to wait an entire year before receiving benefits. I tried driving for them but was left with little to no time for my family. If you are single have no social life and want it to remain that way full-time at UPS is the way to go. Part time is not as bad but is only worth it for the amazing benefits."
bad,"It was unorganized, poor procedures to move up in the company, lacks motivation to move up in the company, I did learn how to humble myself in unwanted situations."
bad,"Ups pays great but your body and personal life takes a toll "
bad,"Long hours, hard work, stressful. The jobs destroys your body and you definitely don’t get paid as much as you should for the work you do. Constantly missing money on paychecks."
bad,Basically if you don't intend on going driver you will need another job. The pay isn't nearly enough to live on or actually pay rent. A lot of the supervisors don't have a clue on what they're doing. It's a mess.
bad,UPS was a great company when I started but after graduating college I realized they run you to the ground because 90% of the workers only graduated high school. So unless you have nothing at all going for you and your hitting close to the 30s do not work here.
bad,"UPS was a pretty cool place, but like most job you always have the jerks in upper management there waiting to make your job hard and a living nightmare. I really enjoy the fast pace environment, it was just management that I couldn't deal with overall"
bad,ups is not a good place to work and it's too far and the hours literally change every week the hardest part of the job was working for 5 hours on your feet with only 5 to 10 min break
bad,"Being a UPS reloader was one of the worst jobs I have had. We got paid very little for the amount of work we were expected to do. The conditions are miserable and employees are often reprimanded for not moving fast enough. If you put up with them long enough, it is possible to get paid well, but it takes a long time to get to that position."
bad,"Company filled with people recommended by others, very few outside hires. Everyone you work with is there because of someone they know. Lots of nepotism, sons of VP's, director's neighbor's sons, etc. so there are many people in positions they shouldn't be in, making work difficult at times because the people you work with often don't have an adequate skillset. Most of management is close to retirement and have been working there for 30+ years so they don't really care about working towards a culture change for newer members. In terms of benefits, the salary is not competitive compared to other companies in the area. They need to spend more money revamping their hiring and onboarding process to better vet out candidates and align people with what they really want to do within the company."
bad,"95 percent of the day is chaotic. The money is good, but the more you make, the more taxes are taken out. It's hard dealing with all the supervisors and the center managers. They always find ways to get you fired. Especially, if you don't follow their unreasonable demands. The union can only do so much. You'll be working 15 hours on average most days."
bad,"they constantly create new goals for you to work on each quarter. create environment where inside and outside sales reps compete with each other and outside sales reps get credit for work done in inside sales. Then, inside sales reps don't get the acknowledgement or the compensation for landing big accounts. Hardly any vacation time for the level of work they expect and their is no rhyme or reason to how people get territories. people get compensated on their territories and not all territories are created equal but they expect the same out of everyone."
bad,"The company is a pretty good company to work for. Like any company, it has its flaws, however, management is the biggest one I've seen at my hub.  I've been working here for about a year, and management has gone from bad, to worse. The union is the best thing about the job, but depending on the hub that you work at, management and the board members could be close friends, and call for a conflict of interest with regards to grievances."
bad,its really hard work but can be fun too good people poor management. great benefits 2 weeks vacation yearly. learned how to work with different kinds of people
bad,"they load up the drivers as much as they can handle, then they add a little extra. only stayed so long because of the pay. might as well have been working out of town in the oil fields"
bad,This is a high stressed work environment with the possibility of being injured.  I was injured twice with little concern from management.  I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"delivering to customers that order packages , communicating with customers and giving them a helping hand .  Sometimes your asked to do more then your job , like if it's a heavy package they'll ask you to push it inside their apartment"
bad,"Dealing with Union employees can be rather challenging, hours are to long, if they could keep me there 14 hours a day they would. I do love the people I work with though."
bad,"For the factory job it was not worth it. Ups does not pay enough for the work they demand. Its hard labor in a dusty, hot environment. You also aren't given enough hours so you'd make more money working minimum wage."
bad,The company compensates their drivers very well but you don't have much of a life outside of work. 11-12 hour work days were the norm and trying to plan much of anything outside of work was always a challenge
bad,"The job itself was extremely physically challenging. From the minute you walk in the door until you leave, you don't stop moving. At first, it was miserable for me. After being there for awhile and got used to the labor, it was enjoyable. Management was ever changing, which was frustrating. The hardest part of this job is sharing the same work space with people who don't share the same work ethic."
bad,"UPS is the most physical job and it's non stop. Very busy non stop, there's about 14 supervisors who having a difficult time keeping up with us employers who are loaders."
bad,"I worked Monday-Friday everyday , roughly 3-4 hours everyday . The work is fast paced & heavy . The work isnt hard , doing it everyday is hard and took a toll on my body"
bad,UPS is a huge corporation. They make a lot of money as an organization. We worked hard and asked for $11/hr. They didn't give it to me so I left. I like the UPS company but didn't like the job I had.
bad,"very corporate feel, would not recommend to a friend. does have good benefits, but little room for promotions and management opportunities are unappealing."
bad,"Personally not enough hours to pay bills, also the supervisors weren't always the most intelligent, it's good work if you don't mind getting a little sweaty."
bad,management fails to care for their workers. There are some very good supervisors and some very inconsiderate stuck up supervisors. management failed to make any exceptions in workplace with changing weather conditions to reduce heat illnesses
bad,it was very unorganized. The mangers was very rude and unconsidered of employees time. Never had an issue with co workers. The mangers were very messy and kept of alot of confusion. I was through a temp service and would advise anyone to work there. They also mess up your hours and checks.
bad,"Work load keep increasing, training happens almost never, management does not value employees. It is very hard to grow in the company. As long as the employee has strong ethical values and is willing to take on work, job security is garanteed"
bad,"This is a job you may dread clocking into most of the week. The work can be overwhelming more often than not and management usually only cares about having enough people they can throw at the walls of boxes you're getting paid, measly, to move and sort."
bad,"No advancement without a degree ."
bad,Very stressful high paced job with little to no reward to go along with it. Management is horrible and seems to only care about productivity rather than how they treat their employees.
bad,"I never knock a job, they help me provide food and clothes on my families back but I can say if given the chance I would not work for UPS again. Hours were horrible, Pay was not too worth it, but It gave me an experience."
bad,"● Working with UPS using a system to measure, estimate and guarantee delivery of packages. "
bad,"Make good money and always have a job but they don""t care about their people and expect you to work an unreasonable amount with zero recognition. If you ask for something they just lie and tell you they will do it and never follow through."
bad,"Demanding hours and not equal opportunity; I had more experience, qualifications & skill set for certain positions that they offered to male employees and didn't even give me the chance to apply and be interviewed for."
bad,"At first I thought it was a great place to work, within the first 8 months of my employment I was crossed trained on all the different positions in my department, would fill in for people when they were on vacation, out sick.  I have been crossed trained on other position as we get a different manager every 8 months to a year so we are moved into different depts. My opinion is the more you learn the better off you are, well not in this job.  I have applied for many different position and have not gotten an offer for one same excuse every time, someone always knows more then you.  Will expect you to fill in for people on vacation, or call out sick because you know the job but there is no thank you or good pay raise, in my eyes they will use you where ever they can.  Managers never seem to get to know there employees so if you applied for a position they cannot even tell another supervisor or manager in full truth what they know about you, because they really do not with having a new manager every 8 to 12 months.  Some cannot even help you with a problem because they do not know your job or what you do."
bad,"Days began fast pace managers did not have good interpersonal skills. Negative H&R, did not promote based on skills and qualification. Commander style management used to motivate college kids like drill sergeants. Use part time workers to run operations to avoid paying the base of their employees full-time benefits."
bad,"The job itself isn't great. Honestly, it's tedious and repetitive, and generally sucks the life out of you if you work there for a long time, especially if you work third shift. Most positions require a LOT of physical labor, which will end up weighing down on your after a while."
bad,not the best job to work i was Package handler and i would get told to step up the pace when i was he only one unloading not to mentio the pay is terrible for that position they are not well organized and i had an injury from there they did not want to pay my doctor.
bad,"they treat you like your just a number. They treat employees with no respect. you have to work out of your classification. there is no light duty , for employees who are injured on the job."
bad,"UPS is a strong company that probably will never go out of business. Your job is very secure and safe here. There is plenty of room to grow and move within the company. The culture, management team, and corporation on the other hand, are very poorly managed. The compensation structure is abysmal and should be completely reworked from the ground up. The only hope is to be part of the union as a driver. Management that are full-time are expected to put in 60+ hours a week as they are all salaried. To be a full-time manager or supervisor is to basically give up a work/life balance."
bad,"The job was exhausting. Basically you just come in & go to the supervisor to see what you gotta do that day. They also was not trying to give me a raise that i earned. While i was working there i did more than more job on the regular. I loaded/unloaded, sorted, picked off & bagged packages. I was only working about 2-3 hours a day Mon thru Fri, it just wasn't enough."
bad,The ups store varies from which one you work for. But in most cases the owner owns about 2-4 so if you work for one you working for the same owner. The only thing i didn't like about the job was that people are not going to keep you busy with transactions. so your job is mostly keeping the business store clean and business savvy. they give you an ipad. the pay may have increased due to the minimum wage act in both DC and MARYLAND. but when i worked the pay was minimum wage and on top of minimum wage you had another tax taking out of your check ( the ipad).
bad,"Not a lot of good things to say about my experience here.  I enjoyed meeting all of the great people I worked with and did learn a lot about importing and customs regulations.  Beyond that, it was a negative experience.  Very low pay and the environment was dirty and extremely low morale."
bad,"Started split Shift at the Exeter branch 2 months ago, haven't been payed for a evening shift yet. "
bad,was a great working job if you loved to get fit. was also very hard on your mental focus but with with dedication comes opportunity.
bad,"The schedule was very inconsistent. They call you randomly when you're needed, which didn't work for my family life. The pay is low for such a physically demanding position. The company is professional and the drivers I was assigned to were awesome."
bad,Doesn't pay well at all. There's also no way to improve this within The UPS Store itself. But the hours are flexible and it will pay your bills if you live somewhere for free (i.e. with your parents)
bad,"These people don't care about you or your family.  As long as you get the packages out then you are fine. Some of the most disrespectful supervisors and manager I've ever encountered. Will talk to you any kind of way they feel. Money is good after you have been there for a while but they will jerm you around and play with your money as long as they can. Long hours, so hope you don't have family. They would rather slave the workers 12hrs or more a day,paying overtime instead of hiring more workers on the road to let everyone go home at a decent time!"
bad,"Over worked, micro managed environment but the company offers a great benefit package, turn over is high, management is not the best, too many changes that never turns out positive"
bad,"Wöchentlicher Nachtschichtdienst"
bad,"Long days without any thought of personal life. Will work you as much as possible to get the results they want. Very poor upper management communication and mindset. "
bad,"Too much work for too little money. Most supervisors are rude and do not understand your concerns. However, benefits are great"
bad,"Very early morning hours (4-9am)"
bad,The co-workers are hard working for the most part but management treats you like dogs. zero respect for their employees. fairly easy job  but i would not recommend it to anyone to work there
bad,"While the benefits are great the management for the lubbock facility barely knows what is going on. We were not evacuated during fires in the facility. we were told to clean up drivers urine bottles multiple times without proper gloves or equipment. Supervisors will smoke inside the building when their bosses are gone. If you are injured on the job, it is a long process in trying to report the injury. i was once told they didnt know how to file an injury report."
bad,Overworked to a ridiculous point.  Management chokes you so that your normal working environment is extremely difficult.  Need to start your career here at about 18 years of age.
bad,Only recommend this kind of job for a high school student and not any one with a family aha needs to have good income for bills
bad,Great co-workers and terrible management. Being off work was the most enjoyable part of the day. Typical day at work was getting called several times throughout the night wondering what I was doing while I am on a 4+ hour job repairing a fleet vehicle.
bad,"I enjoyed working at UPS for a while, i got along with pretty much all of coworkers and some of us even became really good friends. i loved the team effort we were able to put in especially when it was time to crunch to get a job done."
bad,Great job but work/life balance is tough. Extremely fast paced environment. Tremendous work load each day. Theres always something to do. Pretty rough during the summers.
bad,"UPS Freight (very different than UPS Small Package) has a culture of mediocrity.  The company struggles to be efficient in the areas service delivery and customer satisfaction.  As a Salesperson, it is extremely difficult to maintain business and grow revenue when we aren't able to execute operationally."
bad,"i learned how to the load the trucks properly, co-workers were helpful, hardest part of the job was not getting paid enough for the labor expected, the most enjoyable part of the job was working period. typical day at work was loading the trucks until shift was over."
bad,"Pay is good but they make you work for it and management have really bad attitudes also you will have no family life, the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at night"
bad,"There is very little opportunity to work full time, and the hours of 3 am to 9 am makes it difficult to develop a sleep schedule. The work is VERY physically demanding with little support. Despite this I worked on trucks that contained two to three times the number of packages of similar material handlers"
bad,"Dynamisch bedrijf, verantwoordelijk geweest voor klanten met een jaaromzet tot E 200.000"
bad,its a very physical job. if your not in shape it will eat you alive. trying not to dehydrate is almost impossible due to amount of work and the amount you will sweat. the most enjoyable part of it is when the day is over and i punch out
bad,Working for the Government and Defense department has been one of the toughest work assignment I had. My manager though was very supportive and was instrumental in the success of this project. He was very flexible with working hours and trusted my judgement when it comes to operations.
bad,"This is a part-time job, but its not your average part-time job. The reason for this is because its so difficult to get extra hours at this place, its even tough to get 5 hours on a shift. If one is full-time, that person can make a decent living in this struggling system, but it is extremely hard to get full-time being that the list is so long. Some people been waiting 8 years and a little longer than that too. A new-hire wouldn't have a shot. The management there is invigorating to an extent and they'll try to make you move at a certain work pace that you aren't accustomed to. They (management) also get the Union involved in certain situations when its not necessary. For me, the best part about the job is the co-workers being that if not all, most of them can empathize with one another about the endeavors of the typical day/night shift; making the work less stressful The benefits here are solid, that would've gotten five stars but the company doesn't pay for it anymore being that the Union agreed to takeover those responsibilities."

bad,"Very demanding on mind body and spirit. Plenty of work with compulsory over time. The more you do the more they want."
bad,"While UPS is a job security workplace it is quite stagnant concerning it's inside operations away from the public eye. Upper management is concerned with pointless paperwork to create redundant awareness of safety issues as opposed to targeting the exact reasons safety issues exist to eliminate them. Upper management personnel do not take advice or criticism well concerning positive changes that could be made to improve efficiency. In a nutshell the saying ""Beating a dead horse"" over and over is the UPS way."
bad,"A typical day began with a phone call notifying you that you were needed, typically giving you an hour and a half to arrive there. Though, if you know how long your commute is, chances are that you will already be gone. After waiting in the garage with the other drivers and helpers, you and your driver will leave, arrive at the first stop of the driver's route and begin. Aside from a few deliveries that only the driver can do, you will be delivering packages with the driver, and by delivering, I mean as the drivers typically do. You will scan the package, receive signatures and post absence stickers if required. "
bad,"As mentioned above UPS is a highly stressful environment.  Upper management such as Center Managers have and portray an attitude of arrogance towards the lower ranking workforce.  "
bad,I started out as a seasonal drivers helper then continued my employment working in the warehouse loading and unloading trucks. The work was labor intensive.
bad,united parcel was an okay job for a first gig it was quite the experience.
bad,"The pay for ups started off low, while working my body out with over 1200 packages to load and scan. Though after 90 days you receive a raise the hard part for most is to make it through the first month of getting their body used to conditioning. The thing I loved about ups was the vibe of the workers and the focus on safety. Management wasn't really up to par once it came to most of their part time supervisors but the full time supervisors always showed they cared"
bad,A typical day at work i would show up an hour before everyone else which my position required to get everything ready and load bins for the processors. I learned how to seperate mail by number bins. The hardest part was working 14 plus hours somedays. Sometimes it will get to 19 hours during holidays. The most enjoyable part was just meeting new people that made the time go by faster.
bad,"go in and load trucks. i can say i learned to play tetris in real life with having to make room and put things stacked neatly together, management was just unbearable always breathing down your neck, co workers were cool, loading trucks in the middle of summer wheres its always 100 degrees or more, the most enjoyable part was the people that worked along side of you"
bad,"hot, thirsty, dehydrated ."
bad,"Would start the day with moring streatching, pre check our trucks and hit the road overloded. Most managers were good to work with there were a few how injoy having the higher power. co-workers are all great and easy to get along with. hardest part of the job was following the trace for dilivery and keeping committed times as well. i did not have a lot of injoyment with this job."
bad,"Typical day a work :"
bad,"Interesting job experience, but not satisfactory for maintaining a long term job."
bad,Its honest work however it requires constant lifting and bending..
bad,"Unloading Freight"
bad,"Too dangerous, people on lifts dont pay attention to each other. Work area very messy."
bad,"I started this job right out of High School. I have now been there for 4 years, & I am ready to move on. The benefits you cannot beat by any means, but the pay, you can. I now have a house, & with just working at UPS, it's hard to pay for what I need to pay for."
bad,A typical day at UPS was clock in and start working. My duties where lifting boxes up and down that weighed from 2 lbs-50 lbs and placing them on a truck for about 4 hours non stop. Everyone had different personality depending on there mood and work load  so I would say co-workers was alright. The hardest part of the job was picking up heavy boxes and the cold weather .
bad, 
bad,Got along with everybody but the boss and his sidekick.  I was the only person other than the controller with an accounting degree.  The boss hasn't been to college and worked his way up the ladder to the position.  So my days there were hard pressed to be positive when they dumped the low level clerical work on me.
bad,"  ◘    Checked packages for proper numbering to collate with"
bad,"While some may think getting paid weekly is good working here makes it kind of bad because the hours are up and down but other than odd pay, management is no good the only plus is its easy to advance and you will be pretty secure as they have a high turnover rate also the biggest issue is working for 5 to 6 hrs a day and only getting a ten minute break its pretty tough"
bad,It is a very simple job. All you do is load packages in the right truck. No advancement within the company because it goes by seniority. It is a decent part time job. The hardest part about the job is getting up around four o'clock in the morning.
bad,"The buzzing of the belts turning-on simultaneously, after an all too quiet warehouse, sounds ominous... and is something that still gave me chills at times, even AFTER working there for five years."
bad,"The hardest part of working at UPS is that hard work is not rewarded. I had to work there for more than 10 years before I could even be considered for a full time position, no matter what kind of effort I put into my work."
bad,The compensation was terrible but the experience is ok. The disorganization of the company is frustrating.
bad,A typical day at UPS would begin with checking into my station then going to the delivery truck assigned to begin with loading the various packages.
bad,"I was hired in as a seasonal driver helper. LOVED IT. LOVED IT. The drivers I worked with were amazing and even helped get me hired into the warehouse once the holiday season was over. I was let go a few months later because I was ""not fast enough"" at loading and unloading the trucks."
bad,"UPS is a large company thet neglects their UPS Freight asset. Regional directorship and above is driven to throw spreadsheets and conference calls at what was done wrong yesterday and not to what can be put in place to make positive and real gains for ""today"" or ""tomorrow"". Facilities, equipment, and no upper level support make this company it a difficult place to manage."
bad,Unloading and Sorting packages.management was good and I learned how to load and unload trucks. my co workers was great had a nice experience with the company.
bad,free pizza day
bad,You have to make sure you get plenty of rest. There are more packages than you see on a truck.It is very hard to try to catch everybox that comes down the belt.
bad,i did not enjoy working for ups warehouse. not a place for a young lady
bad,"A typical day at work started in the middle of the night and ended in the early morning around breakfast. All I would basically do was unload package trailers and sort mail. Nothing much to it at all. I learned how to lift properly and how to work at a mind numbing near slave-like pace. Management wasnt my cup of tea. The managers felt more like they were cracking a whip then supervising you. I think I impressed some of them but by the end I had overexerted myself. I would feel pain in my back from time to time. My co-workers were a whole bunch of guys that sometimes would make me laugh other times make me very upset but all in all seemed to be good guys. The warehouse was a very testerone filled place so that type of environment can breed some brotherly love. The hardest part of the job was the work times, the hours on end of lifting, the warehouse itself because it wasnt the nicest worplace. The most enjoyable part at the time was the money."
bad,"They are willing to spend a grand later, to save a dime now. They are always looking for ways to cut costs that puts the future of the company in danger. I think the management got lazy, there are also a lot of staff movements, so one has to deal with constantly changing methods."
bad,Not a very good place to work if you end up in one of the warehouses.
bad,Although I worked at this company for almost four years. I would not recommend this job for anyone who wants to have a good life. Not enough hours or room for advancement. I worked there part time from 3/10/08 till 01/04/12 and I made less than $150 a week.
bad,"The workday begins searching the docks for a forklift that is either not assigned or not already taken, which takes 5-20 minutes, depending on how busy the previous shift was. More often than not the lift is in poor condition but must be used anyways due to a lack of surplus trucks. There is usually a pre-shift meeting once a week at which safety topics are discussed. During the workday, one must constantly pay attention to all other forklift operators around them as many of the employees sacrifice safe work practices for speed, causing many near-misses and near-injuries. The hardest part of the job is showing up with a positive attitude and the most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,Communication at UPS sucks. Being in the Union is helpful. You don't have much room for advancement and when there is an opening they don't tell you much about it and when you take the position or are very close then everything comes out and then you probably don't want it.
bad,"You could give that job every ounce of sweat and it's still not good enough, I was averaging between 500-700 boxes an hour for nearly 4-5 months and was still treated like I wasn't working hard, and was teased with a promotion that would never come to be. The supervisors won't tell you, they'll even lie if you ask most likely but they get paid a bonus based off your production pretty much saying they will say and do whatever it takes to get you to load that extra box faster"
bad,"I overall didn't have the stamina or strength to be in the position and the only reason I stayed and suffered through it, was to help pay bills. I don't believe ups is a place to work for someone like like me, especially with its pay."
bad,"I would have a very hard time communicating with dispatch. Always had to call for hours, and then never got called back. I had a great experience last year. This year... I got left in the dust."
bad,My manager and co-workers were great but the owner was awful and we were hardly ever given the tools we needed to succeed nor pay to match the copious amount of work we had to do.
bad,You will basically be over worked for a small amount of pay. Especially if your working the graveyard shift I don’t really believe that it is worth it at all .
bad,"This a great job for someone who doesn't mind physical work for a few hours. Its fast paced and you have to learn the sort by a certain amount of time or else they put you into unload. The supervisors are strict and expect you to catch on quickly. I unfortunately didn't catch onto to the sort as quickly so i was moved to unload which wasn't good for me considering I had trouble lifting heavy packages. I got injured and requested to move to small sort which was a lot safer for me but I was ignored and I decided to leave to for my own safely. Also when you first began you don't get a lot of hours to work so sometimes I felt like it wasn't worth it. Especially because of the distance I traveled just to get down there. I think their greatest down fall is the management I felt like they didn't care about my injury and didn't even want to consider helping me out. No matter what job you go to management should always care for their employees, and do their best to make sure you are comfortable and safe. I did enjoyed having a great workout everyday and I met sum great co-workers but still wasn't worth what I was put through...But i learned it wasn't for me."
bad,We would Unload wine boxes out of big rigs all night and ups cars full of packages.. worst part of the day by far.. I guess the only good thing that happened there is they would feed us at times.
bad,The employees are not honest about the amount they sell.  It's all just made up to make them look.  Pressure to sell so people make up numbers about what they sold.
bad,"Weird hours (4am to 9:30/10am or 1am to 10 AM around the holidays)"
bad,"Fast past, hard work and not very good pay. The managers in the blue area were very  incompetent.                                                                                     "
bad,The worst part about this job is the poor management.  The company is always loosing people due to the poor management.  The work is hard but the pay makes it bearable.
bad,"UPS is a great job for college students needing work, or for the person that needs a part time job. There aren’t a lot of hours available but who wants to slave all day anyway?"
bad,You get sent home to frequently cause of how many people they want in your section. To many people with seniority can take your shift and you can’t make a living with little paycheck
bad,"Good place to work,but the pay is low for inside workers ,they should set a pay rate for what got you do.and  need to be full time work instead of part time"
bad,"Come in get your assignment. Do whatever was told for the hours that you had. Then clock out, only time anything change was when it was around Christmas time because we got more over time"
bad,I was a delivery driver helper & it sucked the first driver I worked with wouldn't take bathroom breaks and peed in a bottle and was psycho. I got sent to a driver  I liked and immediately was told the next day I could not work with them again because they already had a designated helper
bad,This job should be used for the medical benefits only. UPS is very strict on how they pay people so do not think that you will be given hours willingly.
bad,BAd place to work.bullying is the norm people off work with stress given impossible amounts of work to do would not advise anyone to to work for ups.unless you like being bullied and being stressed out
bad,"Its a labor job and pretty self explanatory. I really had no problem with the job itself; coworkers are always friendly and welcoming, there are a lot of opportunities to advance in the company for anyone, and it is a unionized work place. The work environment is dangerous but that should be expected in a warehouse. The pay is good for what you do. Its a good starting job for high schoolers since 1) pretty much anyone is hired because they always need workers and 2) its honestly really hard to get fired/written up unless you're being a lunatic. Its hard to find a work/life balance if you aren't working the morning shift, especially for students. I can't say I learned much but a typical day as an unloader usually consists of being sent to unload your assigned truck and moving back and forth to wherever your supervisor sends you. It definitely takes a specific type of person to work here as there will be some people that are rude, will leave you to do all the work, etc. Considering the fact that you will be doing hard labor in various uncomfortable environments, all of those things are annoying but its important to take everything with a grain of salt. Some days that will be hard but if you have a strong enough will, you'll be able to learn how to ignore these things. "
bad,"Dá se to prežít,to ano,ale asi je lepší práce.Odesel jsem ze spousty duvodu."
bad,7am to 12pm worked in a different environment with different people and different type of work do you every day learned new way to pack up way to stay organize
bad,Supervisors are stubborn and difficult too work with. Co-workers make everybody else' job harder. Hours are always cut short and there is no means of hydration.
bad,"On a typical day, management would assign you to a specific location to work for the day. As all packages came in, it was my job to sort them to a specific bin or onto the moving belt. The work was very fast paced and difficult. There was no AC or heat in the building.  I received employee of the month multiple times for my hard work  and dedication when I was an employee."
bad,Its a good job pays well. The management there is less than adequate. They have to many supervisors. They dont enforce rules that are in place. If you are freinds with supervisors you dont have to follow the rules
bad,"Great management and people to work with Fast paced, high pressure environment"
bad,"At the beginning of the shift, the supervisor will give us the workload for the day. Sometimes the workload is extremely hard to keep up during certain times of the day but also can sometimes be received fairly little at times. If the work is slow the supervisor will start to ask if people want to leave early for work if inventory if slow. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay hydrated while doing hard labor during the summer heat inside of tractor trailers with fairly little ventilation."
bad,"we starten de dag standaard met pcm dat wil zeggen een soort personeelsbespreking van ongeveer 5 min."
bad,From the amount of time working at UPS I’d have to say that working there is definitely a No Until they raise the hourly wage for the workers working there.
bad,"I honestly loved my hours, loved the work I did… but had a major distaste for management and everything else. Even with a doctors know with in my grace. They were not willing to keep me because I became Ill.  When I was asked to resign from a position I was never paid on my sick days, teamsters never communicated with me, and never had the opportunity to get my job back. Sent several emails to HR and never heard back but was completely ignored until I showed up at UPS location in Baldwin Park."
bad,i think ups used to be good to work for years ago nope not anymore theyve gone downhill in the past few years it was a very unbearable backbreaking job do not recommend
bad,Ups is not a good job. The pay is terrible along with the hours. Also very hard working labors for consecutive hours.Almost impossible to live off your checks with no other job
bad,I like the people but I got sick alot. In and out of the hospital. And I know I was like a minute or two late but always made sure my work was done even if it's time to go home and even if I had to do it alone.
bad,It is a great temporary place to work. Hours are not consistent. High turn over rate for employees. Processing speed is very important. Employees were very personable. Just no constancy with hours or days.
bad,"This place was a good job when they gave a lot of hours but soon they dropped the hours to no more than 4 hours and it is not the job to be at unless you like commuting, and being patient to move up a seniority list to get a better position and thats even if you get approved"
bad,I’ve been working with ups for two years now in Maine and in New York and it is honestly the only job I’ve ever actually disliked(hated with passion).
bad,go into work between 11PM-3AM NON-STOP picking up packages and organizing them until around 9-10 AM. if you go to the bathroom you will have work hard to try and catch up.
bad,"As a senior account executive it is your job to maintain your current customer base and win new business. "
bad,Seems like a dream come true until it isn't.  Biased and predjudice against women from a particular manager and supervisor causes a very negative work atmosphere.
bad,you have very a tentative and a very good listener and work a radio the supervisor was great the management was very voicetress  . and in the circumstance of the business I totally understand was just a little too much for me.. the training was great he is a great kid.
bad,"No family time. Forced overtime. Management talks down to employees. "
bad,"loved my job at ups, however i was a seasonal helper. i did like some of my bosses, the human resources department was a disaster from the start. I would recommend ups to my friends, and family, just not in the area, in which i worked."
bad,"Many hours go in to a hard day of work. This include 24/7 on call with no additional pay for salary employees. Nights and weekend work may be necessary to meet the customers needs, again with no incentive. You really must love  the kind of work that you do here in order to remain happy with your job."
bad,I dont reccomend working here lack of hour and pay. Bad manegment. Heavy lifting. Very cold in winter and hot in summer. They do have great bennifits.
bad,"Good place, but does not offer upward movement for people like me pursuing marketing. Offers school assistance to help with obtain a degree or multiple degrees."
bad,"very unenjoyable work place. Not fun worked very poor hours with few breaks. poor work place, unfriendly people and management. woke up at 2am and worked until 10am"
bad,Honestly not the best place to work at could be a lot better and there is no reason a server at a restaurant should be making more than you after all you have to go through at ups .
bad,"Always being rushed and pushed beyond your limits for hours at a time, while only given a 10min break. Very harsh weather conditions while not being offered any work clothes. Always getting yelled and forced to work harder so that you can hury up and get off of their clock so that they make sure you get paid for working less hours."
bad,"Hired meat. Treated like garbage. Trailers are extremely dirty, bring a mask of some sort. Every time you put a package down dust and dirt fly up in the air. Imagine that every day for 5 hours a day lets say. Some managers are great and treat you like a human. Other managers are like slave owners. Horrible place to work but if you need money fast go for it."
bad,"First off, you don’t get no type of training when you officially start, than you are expected to load a truck with 516 packages and meet the 9am deadline"
bad,Very short working hours which led to us barely was getting payed any money the job wasnt hard if the hours was better then the work enviroment would be much better
bad,Great place to work at. I highly recommend for students because of the benefits they offer. I mostly loaded and unloaded boxes off trucks and helped my coworkers
bad,"UPS is an good place to work if have no work experience,going to school, just need extra money bt not real good hours. It can be an fun environment if one is social."
bad,"- Unload packages onto moving conveyor belt or scan boxes coming from conveyor belt"
bad,Didnt mind the hard work. The hours wernt the best. But they have expactations you have to meet even thoigh everyone is paid the same as the lazy bum next to you.
bad,"La mia giornata di lavoro inizia molto presto poiché abito molto lontano dal posto di lavoro. Una volta arrivati si timbra l'orario di arrivo e si comincia a lavorare nel magazzino facendo attività di picking ovvero si prelevano tutti i medicinali che saranno spediti in tutte le farmacie d'Italia, oppure componendo degli espositori di medicinali. Niente da aggiungere perché il lavoro si svolge così per tutto il giorno. Infine si timbra la pausa a metà mattinata di 10 minuti e poi la pausa pranzo di 50 minuti."
bad,"Wouldnt do it again. Lots of work with low pay."
bad,i really was not real happy there.  supposed to be part time supervisor  ut ended up working 39 hrs a week.   too much responsibility put on a part time super.
bad,"It starts with a brief lecture on health or safety (pcm)then you will head over to the 3 trucks you have been assigned to. The buzzer will go off and the people in the primary sector will begin loading packages on to a conveyor belt. When I first started loading trucks I was given one truck then moved to two trucks and I began struggling.  I learned that Ups does not take kindly to slower learners. They will expect you to move as well as everyone else  after 2 to 3 weeks regardless of how experienced the other loaders are. The management will not hesitate to get in your face about insufficient performance such as misloads or having a disorganized work space. I was scolded about performance , and even though I struggled with two trucks they gave me a third and expected improvement.  The culture is angry and fast paced with constant yelling."
bad,Basically the job was to load what’s being shipped out so a regular day you come in and get a scan gun you scan the truck then you scan the boxes that’s coming down the belt and the. You take whatever on the belt and load it in the truck
bad,"The company doesnt care about employees. Management is disfunctional.They break union rules, so union has no power. Only good thing medical. Company is unorganized always short staffed always writing people up and trying to find ways to get rid of them."
bad,It was very back and forth with a lot of confrontations going on and people always arguing or whining about everything. If you slow down even for a second they act like you didn't do no work all day
bad,"Not for the type of people that can’t handle humid areas. The company isn’t bad , just poor pay , poor hours and poor management. They offer great Benefits it’s just they take too long to kick in thats terrible."
bad,Taught me about working with computers working with people as a team and to how to work in a fast pace environment. It also taught me about using your body the correct way as in bending at an angle and using your knees instead of your back in certain situations.
bad,Not management but the supervisors curse at you and talk to you any kind of way. They only work you 4 hours if you are a loader during the day and u get 150 to 200 a week.
bad,A typical day as a ups supervisor came with a lot of stress. The hardest part of the job was meeting the downtime due to lack of communication among other supervisors.
bad,Ups is a very difficult place lots of arguing and disagreements and work is only about 4 hours a day if that and you cannot combo unless you been there for years so your stuck with a part time 3 hour a day job your checks come out too 135 at times if your lucky u make 155 you cannot live off these wages
bad,"Very fast paced, straight to the point and busy. It wasn't easy at all and management doesn't like any slip ups. The hardest part of the job is when the packages get backed up. I learned how to stay calm at a job and not worry about the time and just get work done."
bad,this job had become very stressful and competive a typical day had become very uncomfortable management was not compassionate to the employees nor did the have time to trouble shoot fairly my coworker was the most joy
bad,My job as a loader was to load packages in trailers and build walls with packages. The job as a loader is VERY PHYSICAL! You will be moving packages that sometime weigh more than 70 Lbs.
bad,"I will recommend UPS to anyone who needs a quick  job . However, I would not recommend staying there long terms. Reasons they except outrages work contributions. They use twisted psychological manipulation , example when your doing really good they thank you and expect more or when your body is not able to give 100% they judge you and talk behind your back. When they due confront you they act like they are reasonable and your in the wrong. No matter what you due or achieve it will be crushed and you will feel used. However like I said I Recommend UPS to anyone who needs a job with benefits."
bad,"It is hard work and long hours, but the pay for seasonal helpers and regular drivers is great, you are required to work in all weather conditions, the management and communication is terrible at the Roswell location. I woulddo seasonal work for UPS again if they would hire directly,rather than be a contractor through a staffing agency. Man Power staffing was horrible get in contact with and my first check took over a month to get."
bad,"They will work you into the ground understaffed and then verbally berate you for bumping a belt. Management doesn't view their workforce as people, just a number."
bad,The owner was lazy and hardly worked leaving the day to day operation of the store to staff but staff not allowed to make any changes for the betterment of the store.
bad,"Job hours are from 4 to 10 but during peak season which is from November to December is 9 to 12 hour shifts.  Learned how to unload and sort the package which you will have one week paid classroom training before heading down to the floor. You will have one week with a one on one trainer after the one week of classroom.  The management was not professional and not fair. The workplace is dark, loud, dirty, and physical. There is no air conditioned or heater. The hardest part of the job is dealing with immature management and them not being fair with their employees and just the overflow of packages falling on you. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the people there or your coworkers."
bad,"UPS/P&W in NH has had the most turnover, not just hourly employees but supervisors and management I have ever seen in one company. in the first 3 years of operation they do not have any  supervisors still with them, they have gone through over 4 different management positions and are on their 3rd building manger! Even the temp agencies are having a hard time trying to hourly employees jobs filled.  There is no work/life balance at all! Its sad because Pratt & Whitney is a great customer to work for. If it wasn't for the upper management that is making all these decisions. It would probably be a better place to work and UPS wouldn't be behind trying to make their quota for P&W. "
bad,"it was a quick pace and stressful job. the packages were coming very fast. they piled up quick on u it was physically demanding job"
bad,The jobs they assign you can be different but its way more work and not enough pay .. you work 4 1/2 hours but your scramming so much work into those 4 or 5 hours
bad,Working at UPS is a very physically demanding job. I have worked there for over two years and my body is paying the price. The School compensation is the thing keeping me here. I haven't really learned much besides that I do not want to stay there forever. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a sore back I have developed since working here
bad,"I worked as a package loader so I loaded trucks. The drivers had an attitude towards the loaders to the point where the supervisors of the loaders were having disputes. This created a hostile environment for people that find yelling annoying. I enjoyed loading trucks but not every day. I had the 3am shifts and during the winter seasons I found it difficult getting up. Peak hours started at 12am and if you had other tasks after work such as taking care of  a family or going to school then good luck. It is labor intensive, your either running lifting and squating everyday which is good excercise. But its labor intensive and the supervisors yell at you if your too slow or if you take your time and the things are heavy. You hear people getting injured and having to go home with bruises. Its taxing on your body and soul. Do it if your desperate."
bad,"Good pay excellent benefits but awful management very harassing , favorites and the company cares nothing about employees ! They have no consederstion for family or pain !"
bad,"Bad seasonal job. I was lied to about advancement, my driver helper job was suppose to last until 1/15/18 and i went one weekso far with no work and i dont think im going back. Bad job, time wasted, and stress. Never applying for them ever again unless its for a driver position"
bad,It Was A Great Job The Only Thing Is They Didn't Give You A Schedule They Would Call In The Mornings And Expected You To Be There And It's Hard When You Have Small Children It Would Help A lot If We Knew Ahead Of Time What Days I Needed To Be There &&Another Thing Is Its A Seasonal Job...
bad,They don't give enough hours and they want you to work your heart out for minimal gain.  It wasn't the worst job that I've ever had but it is surely up there.
bad,"UPS is another learning experience."
bad,this job is cool but I need more money I'm 19 with boring money I need big money I want to buy a car but at this rate I can't buy no5hing cause if my salart
bad,"I worked at UPS Part-Time. I would attend College classes during the day, Work at UPS at night, and then sleep for 6 hours and continue the routine. Working part-time UPS and attending College at the same time added a lot of stress and took a lot of time out of my schedule that I could have used for studying."
bad,"The job itself was fine, but management was terrible. No matter how you ask for help, how crazy the warehouse would become, our manager wouldn't so much as lift a finger while we slaved away to meet deadlines."
bad,"A once great place to work and call ""home."" No longer. Sliding down into obscurity over the next few years. Overall, attrition is high, nearly 22% per annum. Salaries, incentives, and bonus have drastically declined over the years; career advancement is non-existent for non-diversity candidates. Musical chairs is the HR strategy for career progression and planning."
bad,The position was a part time grunt work job and I left it to return to my IT career.  I lifted Bulk Packages and moved them around the facility. Wasnt much to the work
bad,"Often times you will find yourself being told you aren't doing a good enough job even if you had filled in for others multitudes of times. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for a quick and reliable job to start doing, you only start getting real money after 10+ years."
bad,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
bad,"the job had its good and bad parts "
bad,"Make great money, but very stressful and demanding environment, Lots of overtime opportunities. Constantly checking over shoulder in fear of losing job."
bad,is full of interesting and fun challenges that make you grow as a leader and as a person. you can learn a lot of life lesson in your time working for ups
bad,"working for UPS in NY is probably one of the worst jobs in the city, a lot of stress and frustration. Management expects you to deliver a high amount of packages each day at a fast pace. This is including the traffic, the 5th floor walk ups and double parked cars that make eveything worst. i would not recommend this job to anyone who has a family and likes to spend time with them."
bad,"Used to do loading/unloading at UPS, the overnight shifts, it was boring and repetitive work but you know exactly what you have to do and when you have to get it done by."
bad,"i generally enjoyed working for ups since we were treating each other as a family and working as a unit to ensure that the work for the day is done,we were assisting each other to avoid and rectify mistakes during work."
bad,"UPS has wonderful benefits package, but unfortunately the tempers of supervisors are poisons. They treat lower supervisors terribly. They also have terrible work conditions where even taking time to wash your hands before you eat isn't even realistic."
bad,"no work life balance. stressful work. some days you work 14 hours and some days your fighting to get 8 hours. upper management feels they can dictate how to do your skilled position,"
bad,"very busy, especially when you are delivering at  commercial businesses. you have to pull these large cart from one location to another hoping the boxes don't fall in the street. driver sometimes want to split the routes which is harder for the worker,"
bad,"Working at UPS was overall a learning experience. The environment is fast paced, vigorous work, and at times dangerous. I would not work as a package handler. However, I would work at the higher level positions such as being a supervisor, truck driver, or locations manager."
bad,UPS will overwork you. You will have no time for family or friends. You will destroy your body. You will age fast.   You will have high stress and absolutly no work/life balance. High blood preasure and knees will go bad fast as well.
bad,You have to bust yourself to pick up large packages that sometimes weigh more then you. Its hard to move up unless you want to be a supervisor or driver.
bad,"Demand and standard is high for minimal compensation, and little to no rest. You work hard and build up quality of work while hourly wage is terrible."
bad,"In my opinion I wouldn't be able to see myself working for this job for more then 6 months. I had to wake up at 1 in the morning and take a 2 hour train ride there, then some days they wouldn't need all the workers so I would get sent back home without any work. They should've notified me via text but they wasted my time and cut my pay short."
bad,"UPS doesn't pay enough to be paid every week and it be too hot in the trucks . Poor management, poor security, they take off too many taxes. Alot of quitting employees"
bad,"ups is a fast paced, hard working environment. the hardest part of the job is the on-going bending and heavy lifting. i learned, that in order to have a great job, you need an education. management is pretty good, pretty reasonable."
bad,"The UPS Store, Inc. is a horrible place to work thanks mainly to the fear-based culture.  Senior leadership set unreasonable expectations, so most projects you'll be involved in fail or are never finished.  The verbal abuse and threats come soon after, followed by mandatory overtime hours that are supposed to magically get the project back on track.  I've watched bright, talented people get verbally berated in front of their peers and managers by the VP of the ""Technology"" department.  If you are the person being berated, you can watch as other managers sheepishly step aside and let it happen for fear of it happening to them.  "
bad,"Fast paced environment to work in. Enjoyed because it was a constant work atmosphere. Occupied time is how I expect a job to be, no downtime because it seems faster."
bad,"This place used to have such fantastic owners, now it's owned by a gentleman from Colorado who doesn't care about employees or customers. I once made the mark for a substantial bonus but was never awarded it. Awful place to work unless you feel that is okay to cheat customers."
bad,"The work environment was bad, no one really spoke to each other.  The workload was overwhelming on all the overnight shifts, and the pay wasn't that good"
bad,"A typical day at UPS was very disorganized and tasks were unclear. We did processing, sorting, and organizing mail but were trained poorly. Breaks and lunches were not monitored."
bad,"I did not get any hours during my seasonal employment.  What I learned is the day can be frustrating if the loaders did not load the truck correctly. I did not meet any of the C.E.O's.  The hardest part of the job was getting hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was pay day.  I think the driver got to pick who he wanted to work with witch could be unfair; if that is the case. One of the guys I worked with the boss was on him because he was not working fast enough but he could find things in the truck because it was not sorted right.  I made a statement that who ever sorted the truck did not do a good job and I think they got mad because I didn't get any hours.I wanted them to know that it was not the drivers fault that he or we were not working as fast as they wanted us too."
bad,"lots of work, breaks should be longer, should also pay more. However I do like that they help out with school and fire within. This isn't a job that everyone can do. You have to be a certain type of person to endure."
bad,Fortune 500 company. Learned a great deal about logistics and transportation. Wish I had the opportunity to work in the aviation division of the company.
bad,It was a fast paced job lot of work I loaded trailers all day in hot and cold the management was good the hardest part was the labor the people was good
bad,I really liked working for ups but it was only a seasonal job that really was helping the drivers for delivering package before Christmas but the pay rate was good and I wish I could have got on thru the plant.
bad,Part time employment is almost non livable in terms of both term: workload nor income. Also have been told takes minimum of 5 yr to be eligible for a full time position.  Even if hard work is shown the company doesn't reward or even applause your efforts.
bad,"UPS Is a multinational company whereas it has sustain its stability despite several recessions occurred for the past 10years.however, there is a very slow growth in the company due to cultural differences."
bad,"Your typical work day.... You only work for 3-4 hours, then done for the day!  You learn how to load/unload and how to put in shipping information in the computers.  Workplace is poorly managed! Most supervisors don't know where to put anybody and doesn't know what's going on most days.  All management wants to do is argue and complain about everything you do instead of looking at the positives.  The hardest part of this job is that, if you're in every area most days, it's very difficult to learn anything and how to do it, which management doesn't understand!  The only good thing about this job, are the full time benefits!"
bad,They like to short you out your hours an also your money an they work you to death for pennies. They say the would train you but they don't even train you right they  have  other workers train you an it's not a lot of nice people there I like the fact that they have wonderful benefits.
bad,"They Weren't that Organized with they employees. understaffed, the pay was okay but you didn't get the min of hours that they said you would have to start off with."
bad,The only company that I have ever worked for that would try to fire you for doing a great job. I have been here for 17 years. I run my route quickly and am frowned on for running it too fast. They load me up with more stops for doing a good job.
bad,There are many location that are not managed well including the warehouse I used to work for.  The work load for the company is not properly distributed.  There are good benefits that come with working with the company including discounts and annual paid leave
bad,"Heb er 19 jaar gewerkt,begin was nog leuk maar de laatste jaren, waren, alsof ik in gevangenis straf heb uit gezeten.wilde graag iets anders gaan doen maar naar mate je ouder wordt en alleen diploma havo kun je niet veel."
bad,A typical day at work at UPS is a lot of movement and lifting. What I learned at UPS is how to properly lift heavy objects. Don't really want to speak much on the management. My co-workers were ok. I think the hardest part of the job is the objects with the heavy lifting but other than that its kind of easy. There was not anything really enjoyable about the job.
bad,I started working at ups right after I graduated high school as a part timer. I lasted a year there before I had to move and unable to relocate me in another ware house so I got a new job closer to where I live.
bad,"Sehr lange arbeits tage,stress,nur vorübergehend gut......"
bad,You become very over worked and very under appreciated. They demand too much out of one person. They will cut back hours without notifying then turn around and blame you for going on hours.
bad,"I signed up to do seasonal help, but the problem is that they didn't tell me it would be on-call, instead telling us we'd be working most days. I worked exactly once, and I made more money at the orientation than I did helping deliver packages. It was an extra pain for me, too, since I live in a very rural area, and would have to drive about 1 hour to and back from the facility just to do things that would take about 10-20 minutes otherwise. I'll still use UPS for my mail, but I didn't appreciate the falsehoods they told me."
bad,"Good company overall, although operations are tough and stressful, a lot of the shifts are at night time"
bad,"Very grueling physical work, do not get paid as much as you should for all of the physical work when you first start working here. Sometimes it can be alright but for the most part not an ideal job."
bad,Starting at the bottom of this company can be a challenge. With four to five hour shifts you would think that it would be an easy part- time job. Under paid slaves became the nick name for Ups. After working a few years there are great opportunists thew the company.
bad,Typical day at work was busy. Management was not sequence. The hardest day was making sure you and supervisor was on the same level of training.
bad,"They often needed me to be available for work for approx. 50 hours a week although I would only get about 30 hours a week. Worked with ups for 7.5 years and was still waiting to get a full time position. Once I became a supervisor at UPS they do not want to let supervisors back into the union and I did not know that at the time I got promoted. Good job, just was not right for me,"
bad,The people here are great. management is a little detached and not sensitive to the workers needs. the work environment is not very good
bad,"its a job, but management will curse you for any error. they expect 100% perfection everyday or they will write you up. I would not recommend them to anyone."
bad,"You;re constantly being yelled at unless you're doing amazing work, which isn't easy. The work is enjoyable and gives you personal space for the most part, management is easily over stressed and takes it out on the workers though."
bad,"UPS is a go go go  work place. From the moment the shift starts to moment it ends. This is what I liked most about job at first, the fast pace. "
bad,I am under 25 and my experience at this location has been steadily going down hill. The office culture is not good.  Management acts as if they are willing to help you achieve your goals and pretty much back stabs you in the back with the words and conversations they have with other employees. This place is pretty much a mini high school full with adult drama. Something I am not used to
bad,"although it is a great workout that you are getting paid for, the upper management will not appreciate the hard work that their employees put in."
bad,"Great place to learn about the shipping and logistics industry."
bad,"UPS can be a great company to work for if you have very thick skin and don't mind working with stupid people. The poor decisions that management makes will make your work day even harder than it already is. If you are a loader expect to load between 900-2000 packages on any give day. Pay isn't very good, starting at 11.00 an hour, but OT is paid after 5 hours a day. This sounds great except management does everything they can to get you off the clock before that 5 hour mark. The union eliminates competitive pay, there is a pay scale, and annual pay increases per union contract that runs roughly 4 years. Drivers make a lot of money, but it can take years to get a driver position and they get overworked like the inside workers. The health insurance is spectacular and is 100% free. You MUST be employed for a year to get it. They do this because people don't last at that place for very long. Average turn over is 2 weeks. In the summer it's 120 degrees in the hub at 3 am and 32 degrees or less in the winter. Day shift is even hotter."
bad,"Hard work very demanding. Most people quit in the first 2 weeks if they stay they think about quitting everyday after. This is not a job for  weak people, physically or emotionally."
bad,Providing customer service and taking orders. Helped with loading and unloading trucks. During the holidays I assisted delivering packages to clients.
bad,"Fast-Paced Work environment with lots of things to learn for any new employee. "
bad,"pretty strenuous place to work, when the line starts to move you have to move along with it without stopping. very hot and uncomfortable but......if you like to be very active and physical in the work place this could be a dream job."
bad,The greatest thing about this particular company is the position is easy to attain(seasonal) and in most instances the hours are rather flexible.
bad,A lot of heavy lifting. I learned how the packages are packed and handled through the process. The management was decent. Co-workers have good team effort.
bad,Management is horrible as well as pay. The benifits are the only thing good with this company. Union based invironment. Driver jobs are the only good position but it takes way to long to move up in the company.
bad,a okay place to work if you don't mind working 4hrs a night. fast paced so if your slow be prepared to get yelled which doesn't help anybody move any faster
bad,A typical day at work was good on sum day and bad on sum. it just depends what kind of trucks you come across. you might get a truck with all bulk that takes all day its stressful sometimes and they still want you to work at a fast pace. Or you could get a nice truck that's all amazon boxes which is very light normally. The brakes are only 10 minutes also the management is not so great either. The hardest thing is bending over repeatedly its hard on your back. The best thing of it all is when you leave the end of the day to go home.
bad,"Great place to work when youre a college student. 4 hours a day, full benefits."
bad,"Nesse empresa pude aprender bastante coisas, sobre eletrônica e aprimorar mais os meus conhecimentos em informática."
bad,Never more than 3 hours of work a night. Laid off multiple times. Takes many years to acquire a full time position.
bad,"working at UPS was pretty good and simple. I worked hard for every penny, that job is not for the weak"
bad,"Drive and work safe in a stressful work area."
bad,"Secure job, good benefits."
bad,long hours and hard work. must lift 150 pounds!! all about production.
bad,The working conditions are hard. Its always 20 degrees hotter or colder than it is outside the building.
bad,"The days there were very short and tolerable, but the line of work and the people above made the work environment uncomfortable to be there."
bad,"Not great hours, management pushes you to the point of injury or you move to a different position/job. Relations between employees was great, looked out for each other."
bad,the job taught me tdifferent skills such as how to use a scanner the right way to lift heavy boxs
bad,UPS is a hard place to work. It is a vary physical environment.
bad,"I would enter work the previous night and work all though out the morning till the afternoon. If I lacked my co-workers I would take initiative to cover their work group and this became a common practice once I was able to handle it. I would miss out on my home life, my wife and kids. There was no work/ life balance"
bad,you go in at your start time and just work. the more knowledge you have in the hub the more work areas they will have you in. no AC in the hub in the summer time only in the offices.
bad,"A typical day at work is I arrive go upstairs to our meeting half hr before shift we go over day be-fore's numbers and go over what went well and what didn't also we tried to figure out how to fix what didn't go well. Afterwards we all go to the floor to our areas make sure there is someone doing setup for the day. As a part-time supervisor you have to good communication skills be able to work as a team, make sure everyone works safe. Also as a sort aisle sup or an outbound sup you need to make sure your people have the correct knowledge (i.e need to have updated charts to tell a sorter what belt a package goes to or for a loader what truck the package belongs in.) During the shift there is different paperwork we(i.e different kinds of observations)  after about 4 1/2 hrs sort span we do our wrap up looking for any and all packages that might have gotten missed or trapped so we can get every package serviced. After we go back upstairs finish our paper work and pay our people.  "
bad,"Extensive Labor"
bad,even thought the work was extremely hard the job had good people and the management was good the hardest part of the job was loading the trucks
bad,Typical day consists of sorting packages based on zip code to corresponding belts at a high rate of speed and accuracy. Hardest part is how demanding management is and how physically demanding it is. Most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers
bad,Dispatching from 2pm to close.
bad,A typical day would be coming into work and moving alot of boxes with a short break within the four hour shift. My floor manager was very good and we got along well but other managers often talked negative about me and were mean spirited. My co-workers were helpful at the times I struggled during the job but some were distant. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the fast pace of work for the first 2 weeks. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to come into work during the evening and getting to work alone allowing me to focus more.
bad,"Worked there for seven years. Developed horrible back problems from unsafe work environment. Management did not care, it was all about making their number. Packages were crushed and I was never given proper help to lift overweight packages. Benefits were outstanding, but I eventually left because I did not want to cripple myself any further. There is hard work and there is working in a unsafe work environment. There was nothing safe about the loader job. Just about everybody I worked with was stressed out and physically torn apart. In the end, the benefits were not worth it anymore. Especially if you started out there now, with the current Union contract."
bad,"Recruited from school, worked as a package car auditor where I had to ensure that package cars were properly packed according to their manifests. This task wasn't too bad. I got promoted to become an Account manager. In this postion I was not thoroughly trained and always felt as though I was swimming upstream. I was required to cold call and sell the UPS products. I was not comfortable in this position, felt disrespected and mistreated."
bad,I work here while in college and never planned on stay there long term. From what I have seen it's an okay place to work.
bad,As soon as I clock in I have to unload a trailer then I go to my area which is irregs.Irregs are packages that are 70lbs and higher.I have leaned that senority means nothing there.To me my management team don't do what they suppose to do.My co-workers n I get the job done the best way we can.The hardest part of my job it that I am multi talent in 3 areas where on occassions my called to do all of them in one day.The fact that I am well experience in these areas they tend to dog me out!!The most enjoyable part of my job is when the operation goes smooth the way it's suppose to go.
bad,To much responsibility for a small pay scale. Poorly managed. Meeds alot of improvement.
bad,"Long hours, work with some very hard working fun energetic guys, the hardest part is the weather conditions."
bad,"do your job and loose weight good work out. worked with scanners, load and unload trucks, sort bags and boxes."
bad,Production of freight hardly met it’s requirements daily due to poor management. The benefits were great but the leadership was below proficient. A lot of show of favoritism
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed the first month or so of the job, lots to learn and many positions to be a part of. After peak season, I was laid off due to lack of work and was not notified. I'm now unemployed after being told I would have a job after peak season."
bad,"I believe strongly that the Minimum wage should be raised as a Package Handler, it’s a lot of Human labor and you can do the work but if you can’t keep up with the packages it’s really stressful and the energy is bad in there and management."
bad,"The job location was out laurel md and I live in Washington DC , I do not drive so it was a serious struggle getting to work everyday especially with the small pay. "
bad,The hours working were horrible they didnt care what was going on and wanted everyone to work 7 days a week and didnt care much. plus they spoke very poorly to workers
bad,This is a cool job but dont expect overtime.it not really bus accessible if you work the late shift you will get off around 3am and busses dont run at that time
bad,Constant battle between the union and management. Management wants to run low staffing and high volume so the numbers are good. Employees want and often need help but don’t want to ever BE the help to others. Clock out time comes and people leave a mess the for next shift
bad,So with that being said I really didn’t enjoy working to job I was very tried but I tried and tried to be successful with ups but they started cutting my hours so I decided to resign so anytime I want I can come back to join the ups family
bad,"UPS delivery company and are responsible for packing items so they can be delivered safely to the destination. Successful resume samples for this position showcase duties such as using hand tools, assembling cartons, sealing products, and completing other tasks as assigned."
bad,Management made me feel worthless at a job I've done for almost two years at another package delivery company. Stopped working for them because it wasn't worth dealing with what felt like constant mental abuse.
bad,Worked for a stingy franchisee no benefits or good pay for everything that needed to be done .........................................................
bad,"very hard work you have to be dedicated.Management was not very good at the Lake Charles, la, location. A day of work was fast paced and very tedious. You had to be focused."
bad,Unload each truck that came in my area in a quick pace everyone is helpful an friendly an are willing to help the next person in need of help hrs or flexible
bad,"Ok gotta new job , wanted some new for myself got warehouse experience . Learned new things met new ppl . Worked overnight it was kinda tough but you get use to it"
bad,I learned a lot from this company but its always had its pros and cons like any other job. This company taught me to work hard and to keep pushing no matter the circumstances but it also taught me how to maneuver and how to not over work myself when situations get tuff .
bad,Had to match each zip code to a color & i scored a 98% on the test in less than 2 weeks which got me a dollar raise. The work is very fast paced & some of the boxes were very heavy.
bad,ups is very fast paced and stressful there is always something going on and you need to always have your eyes open and be alert.must be able to stand for long time and move fast
bad,Its s constant work environment with minimal down time which helps time go by. Its on a open dock so you ate exposed to outdoor temperatures at all times
bad,The people in general are very disrespectful. From upper management to the loaders. Fast paced job no one wants to be at and it shows. Competitive wage can’t complain there.
bad,"The biggest issue I had with this job was the physical toll it took on your body. While there was an employee who's job was to follow up on making sure everybody worked in a safe manner, he like many others were just going through the motions. Rules were broken left and right, mangers knew and didn't care, and they did not value their employees. I would not recommend for anybody to work there. The amount of illegal things that took place there were insane. I call it like I see it and I understand most places do not take kindly to that mindset unless you're in management."
bad,it ws hard and fast  paced  the cultures is good  if you new how to work  your schuaed and how to ask for more work yoh can have the opptunety to make as much as 1700 a week but you would never get it out of them  management sucks and works against you and you can never get a  hold of the right rank to solv and issues like getting paid other than that i loved working there
bad,I didn't really enjoy my time with this company the pay wasn't enough for me to survive in New York. I did love working along side my coworkers we had a great work relationship.
bad,"Your entry role at ups would be part time, you bust your back within 4 hours. You rarely go over 5 unless its black Friday.  The management where i worked at at lathrop ca was unprofessional they don't respect you. It's a good  pt if you need benefits quick, but the wait to advance is long, it's union so it's all based on seniority"
bad,4 hour shifts paid weekly good for side job unless you make it a career meet different type of people no background checks good assist for networking with people
bad,They were very unorganized and gave me the run around about my pay. I was told a different pay then what I was getting. I felt like they put all the work on women and not enough on the men.
bad,"The job in it of itself is easy, I work in one of the easiest areas despite the fact we get 40% of the volume. Management constantly reneges on production numbers, and neglects to tell you when breaks are until minutes have passed. Some days they send you home 20 minutes into the shift, or sometimes you work an extra 5 hours without notice. Sometimes you get put into dangerous positions and are expected to work. The only real benefit is the somewhat flexible hours and the medical."
bad,The supervisors don't really care about you they just rushing you because the faster you do it the more pay they get. They don't treat people AT ALL with respect. In all honesty the workers should be getting way more pay than anyone there. Stressful environment. Had one supervisor shout and throw a package violently at me. Overall do not work for them
bad,Too hot and not enough pay to work as hard as UPS works their people. In my opinion the job is not worth the pay at all. General managers are very rude also
bad,"This place is no ""F's"" given work environment, people walk away from their responsibilities, have 3 on the clock smoke breaks, while you have to pock up thw slack. I have an old school latino work ethic, if you do as well, you'll be used and abused. If you have an outgoing employee with great work ethic that is uses to being compensate for your work this place ISN'T for you. However, it is well know, the benefits are great."
bad,Needs more structurer and balance really bad management love the hours and the work is good if the belts would not shut off so much and we could just work and finish.
bad,I love working with UPS bcoz they are cultural they know how to talk to new people even if you don’t know how to speak English or French they will treat you the same
bad,I was told when applying that the standard minimum wage was going to go up by two dollars for everyone working however several months later everyone was still working the same pay
bad,"un día típico en el trabajo regular a malo"
bad,Hard work less pay and less time for a days work. Short time for Break. Break over by the time you get to the cafeteria and bad management. Provision of working material and uniforms needed
bad,"Little work over the entire month of September. Too be honest I have no idea how good this place is. I worked so little, that I feel that I cannot make an accurate review about working there"
bad,"Management treats employees different. Although the pay was great, management made it a very stressful job. I enjoyed working there but it was very physical and mental."
bad,Believe poor management and a lower than desired pay rate lead to me leaving the company.  Unsafe work conditions and unstable hours  not enough to live off. Also promised position within company but it was time restrictions on when promotions/advancements were in place. Typical day was 0300 am till 0830
bad,"We were underpaid for the work we did and I got terminated from my temporary position because they didn’t want to let me take maternity leave and I was working there when I was 9 months pregnant. Also, I didn’t really get any hours."
bad,"Extremely physical job. I don’t get enough hours, barely work 20 hours a week. My checks are under $200. You get paid weekly. YOU HAVE ONLY A 10 MINUTE BREAK. The people are ok it’s some weirdos there. But I mean it’s decent."
bad,"Working at UPS as a Driver Helper, Loader, Unloader, Sweeper, and Pick-off (occasionally) is a whole lot of fun. It's demanding, but it's fun."
bad,"if you are into taxing your body, and mind to its limits then being asked to do more....apply for a position. but if you want to see your family and friends while the sun is still up, forget it."
bad,"Didn't even know who my manager was, store is disorganized both from a leadership perspective as well as an inventory aspect."
bad,"It's just a matter of time. Everyday you get ""hurt"", something, a pulled muscle here, a cut there, whatever, no big deal. Eventually, and you might not know it at the time, you will be injured permanently."
bad,"I thought I would enjoyed working here, but the way it's set up for package handlers was ridiculous. There would be times there would be way too many packages coming down the belt line over flooding and I would never have time to scan them all and write my truck code on it. This would make it harder for me because there's a supervisor on every belt so they would literally tell me to spped up the pace when the job is already fast-paced."
bad,"Supervisors are clowns, most can not drive a truck themselves, but will tell you all about how to do so.  They are short of staff, so if you want 50 hours a week, you can get it.  Pay and benefits are good, the rest sucks.  Dirty working conditions, poor communication between everyone.  Everyone is miserable and just yell at each other."
bad,Loading and unloading the trucks either on the morning shift or the evening shift. It's a great workout and your going to drop weight and get bulky as time goes on. Putting packages onto a conveyor belt when unloading and loading. You can't be late to this job. And after 1 year of work you get paid vacation and then all the holidays you get paid for as well after the first year. And you can grow within the company to become a manager or assistant manager of ups.
bad,They push hard to get the workload done for the day finished as fast as possible. The building isn't big enough to get the amount of freight in the amount of time it's expected.
bad,"Not  a job for me there's better opportunities. The job is extremely stressful. You will be told you will be working 8 hour shifts and then when you get into the account, they will start working you for 12 hours a day and sometimes weekends"
bad,"You were not able to leave until all the packages were scanned. Most of the time, when you are new, you are sent on a new route with barely any knowledge of the route. We called this going out blind. No GPS allowed. If you have a family to attend to, this is not the job for you."
bad,Ups has its ups and downs but usually they don’t know how to value it’s hard workers. They usually put the hardest worker in a trailer by themselves And expect them to do everything
bad,"Starting work at UPS will seem like a dream job. They will tell you that you will receive paid holidays and vacation. They will also tell you that you will receive health, vision, and dental benefits paid for by the company. These statements are true but ONLY if you are able to make it for a full year. They will not bother explaining this at any ""interview"" you attend or any literature available in recruiting materials. The only benefit ""immediately"" available is tuition assistance which can be used after six weeks of employment depending on your location. The only full time union jobs available as of 2019 are delivery drivers, which get hired by seniority from within the company and experience regular layoffs throughout the year. There are no longer and will not in the foreseeable future be any full time position in a package hub that is not management."
bad,"Solid compensation/benefits but increasingly more pressure to keep up with production demands. Hardest part of the job is getting people to show up to work everyday. It's hard work, many aren't prepared to do it and turn over is high."
bad,"Great seasonal work and great for job experience in general labor. UPS in hiring for part time work now in the Rockford area. Great benefits, insurance, paid time off, sick days. Management experience if qualified. Great atmosphere to work at."
bad,"Working at ups I had to load and unload there and we had to work very fast and the warehouse.i did drive help to,dive help was a good job at ups it was a easy but heavy type of job to do."
bad,I really don't like the ups job at all. Overworked and under paid pretty much. If the pay equaled the amount of work we were doing I would have no problem staying.
bad,I liked it but the travel distance was far for me to take a bus with people who that was robbing for the other employee check after cashing so I left so I wouldn’t have to worry
bad,"Loved my job, super easy to get fired over things you dont have control over. Some discrimination around the warehouse, management used training tactics to try and fire you."
bad,Upper management only concerns themselves with what happens on paper. They have no time or do not care about how to make working at UPS more manageable.
bad,"The place is stressful  45 min. Lunch 3 fifteen min breaks, clean bathrooms,  working weekends consecutive mandatory the lunch room is too small                                        Long hours working. They tell you some Saturday are mandatory but every time day want said  is mandatory Saturday you don’t have live"
bad,Management could be better. Employment could be more specialized. Work conditions could be much more improved. The work pace could be much more stable.
bad,"this job is very physical, managers need to do a better job with how they talk to employees. the work that you do isn't worth the pay. also company needs better benefits for part time employees."
bad,"Working here was ok, the fact that you worked that hard with no bathroom breaks you should at least get paid more. I've personally seen people quit mid-working and I questioned myself is this really it? It wasn't."
bad,They promised hours but could not deliver. They floor managers were cool but they made promises they couldn't keep i was called in to many times only to be sent home under false hope of work
bad,I've worked on the unload belt for a year and it's horrible I get cut most of the week and below 3 hours a night. Needless to say my last paycheck was 120 dollars it's terrible definitely on the job hunt.The work is hard strenuous and tedious and the pay is terrible I now know what ups stands for.
bad,"Not Such A Good Job , Don't Really Get Any Breaks , The Workload Around The Holidays Get Hectic , Have To Work Real Fast At All Times , & You Get Real Dirty At The End Of Your Work Shift"
bad,UPS is a very busy place of business. It’s fast paced and sometimes and be overwhelming. The outside weather determines the inside weathers and that makes it hard on a lot of workers.
bad,"I liked the job, but there was a lot of different managers coming and going.  They asked me, I agreed, but then was never properly trained correctly with what they wanted me to do."
bad,"It's a grueling and frantically paced job for the preloaders and the delivery drivers. Management is asking too much of their employees, which would explain their never-ending inability to retain enough warehouse employees. If there were more realistic expectations for job performance, UPS would solve some of their staffing issues."
bad,"Get to work, go to your assign spot. belt starts up and you start scanning and loading. Management rarely acknowledged safety conditions when previous shift did not perform their shift duties. All about the numbers."
bad,"It's a hard working environment, they treat there workers like there nothing, pay rate is not good, working conditions are terrible the only reason people are there are for the benefits."
bad,"Although some management is awful others are exceptional "
bad,Good place to work if you dont mind retiring with all sorts of occupational injuries and diseases. They pay well though and you dont need a degree to advance.
bad,UPS fired me for complaining after working at UPS for over 28 years. I even bought my own car to deliver to customers for UPS. It didn't make any difference.
bad,"Very stressful job taking calls from german customers continuously trying to trace packages awaiting delivery. Regimental company, for example for a 15 minute tea break you had to be logged out and back into your phone within 15 minutes. You weren't allowed take breaks in between calls to complete paperwork on the previous call so very stressful. Not for me!"
bad,"On a typical day at UPS I would be overworked, on most days performing to a higher standard than required. While on the job I learned how to deliver parcel, load/unload delivery vehicles in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is being on the road."
bad,Don't expect much! Low pay and you cannot come late or god forbid get sick because if you just got hired they will fire you and come talk to you about being sick! Teaches you a lot of things but I'm glad i left i hated the time i worked there
bad,"You have to be able to work in the weather, all elements,  Working during the holidays was very busy.  I was a package handler working off the docks and helping drivers/"
bad,Ups will work you very hard at a very fast pace.Its challeging but also be fun .It also can be stressful but relieving.i learn how to lift at UPS.that now is helping throuhh life.
bad,Great place to work - great pay - great place grow your talent and development your skills. It is also a place to challenge you in many areas. A place where your level of upward growth is only limited to your own drive.
bad,No room for growth in the department I was in and the pay was a 10.00 which does not feed a family so recommend as a stepping stool used for beginners.
bad,Unfortunately they don't pay enough for the amount of work you are doing and it takes 4-5 years to get to top rate which is what you'd need to actually have a life
bad,"the experience at UPS wasn't as nice as Fed-Ex, the management wasn't the greatest but I was able to work around the chaotic management the employees made it easy."
bad,The drivers will blame you for everything. Constant complaining as soon as they show up. work overnight or any other shift where you make no contact with them.
bad,Didn’t like working 3rd shift. Fast pace. Overtime everyday. No space to put personal belongings. No lunch break. 1 10 minute break no matter how long you stay.  Overall just a very not good place to work.
bad,"Working here is neat if you are desperate for a job and provides an opportunity to bond with your co-workers. Aside from that, the Managers would do as much as they can to minimize costs i.e. your wages. Such as giving you a lunch break only 1 hr. into the shift this means the rest of the shift is going to be a mess. Or sending a load of workers home, only to be buried in volume of boxes and the remaining workers have to work extra hard. On top of that the management is inefficient, and it is enraging having to follow their directions sometimes, and watching them run the place to chaos for the rest of the night. Lastly, it is not uncommon to drink alcohol and smoke tobacco at higher rates, due to the mental rage UPS brings."
bad,"Mett quota of 1200 boxes unloaded in an hour, and management tells you to move faster, work harder, and yu already are going, Then get in your truck and watch, very stressful. Not worth the pay and only get 5 hours and part time starting out"
bad,"Overly demanding for the small amount earned. It takes too much to move up and seniority, over skill, is the way they hire within. I was in so much pain every week because of my old injury. I just needed a part time job but the managers and peers push you to break rules every day, rules that are meant to protect you. Its too much risk and pain for what you earn."
bad,"The work is extremely hard, I was told loading three huge tractor trailers in 5 hours wasn’t fast enough. I made a whole 11 dollars an hour while trying to survive the heat, and awful attitudes of the managers and even the trainer. It was the worst job I ever held. Modern day slave work honestly."
bad,"The Union and benefits are great, as is the college assistance program. The management quality can vary but a  great manager is your best friend while a poor manage your worst enemy."
bad,Management was poor. Low salary and no benefits. Material handling was stressful most of the time. I only lifted a maximum of 30 pounds in the department I was placed in.
bad,Extremely fast paced job. Deliver businesses before 5pm with your truck packed to the brim. No time for family or much else because of exhaustion and working late.
bad,my fist day on the job we come into the warehouse and they show us around the warehouse then we go in a room to watch a safety video then they give us a blue vest and a scanner then you off to work...its really no help
bad,"Not going to lie the job is hard work,  it's physically demanding  but saying that it keeps you fit."
bad,"Didn’t really like working there, trainer didn’t really train me to my fullest potential. Extremely hard job and too fast paced for me, I couldn’t keep up at times."
bad,"UPS itself wasn't a bad place especially depending on what your role is there. I was a loader, loading packages onto the back of a truck before take-off. I didn't get paid much for the hours I was working and the work was bad for young people because it begins to damage your body the longer you work there."
bad,This was my first real job and the job help me stay in shape I lost allot of weight working at this job. The pay was average but good but the hours was not enough to live off of.
bad,"UPS isn't enjoyable. It's basically a free workout, so there's that at least, but besides that, if you have good coworkers and the insurance, this place is honest to god miserable. The management is terrible more often than not, nobody communicates with other supes, the conditions are less than favourable-would not recommend."
bad,"Great learning experience, Wonderful people to work with, and a place for career growth and development. It taught me to have think skin and be open minded to change"
bad,"Work environment was very hectic; managers weren't necessarily professional. Very uncomfortable work conditions, especially during the winter months. Wouldn't recommend."
bad,It has been so long since I have worked there I don't really remember to much about the work atmosphere. From what I do remember it was a nice place to work.
bad,This job is not designed for women. Not to degrade women but this job is not for us. There is one bathroom in a very large building that takes 20 minutes to walk to.
bad,"Once unionized, the benefits are great at UPS. Unfortunately they pay too little for back breaking labor and use new hires in an abusive fashion as they aren't unionized. Good for supplemental income if you can handle the work and stress."
bad,"As the title says, it's a good place to start out if you are in the right facility. Every facility is different, and sometimes that difference is staggering. It's hard work, so be prepared for that. You are expected to work very quickly, with minimal difference between the time it takes to handle a 2 pound package and a 150 pound package. You will be handling thousands of packages every day. There is a high turnover rate for everyone that is not a driver, so you'll be seeing new faces all the time, including supervisors. Unless you are a lifer as a part timer, the only way to make more money would be to become a driver, (and it can take years to get there) which is also very stressful and fast paced. Sometimes moreso. I've seen new drivers break down into tears."
bad,Management sucks. It is the most inconsistent and disorganized workplace I could imagine. Only plus is the job security and the benefits that you have to wait 1 year for. Hours during peak pay well but they are detrimental to your body's health.
bad,"Although it is a fast paced work environment I have learned a lot in regards to managing people and time management. The day at work consist of non-stop movement. You are constantly on your feel. You should invest in a good pair of hard leather, steel toe, work shoes."
bad,the push pretty hard for you to unload fast. at times the expectations seemed difficult to accomplish with the time frames given. You have to work wreckless to make it.
bad,"As a part-time Supervisor, I did not feel like I was in management but was a Team-Lead instead. Worked just as hard as the workers and was responsible for 10-15 employees as well. 16.58 was the starting pay."
bad,"Union environment, very strong representation. Poorly managed. Way too much gossip and rumors float around. Great pay and benefits. Unprofessional promotion process."
bad,"Benefits definitely what kept people at this job along with getting paid weekly. Aside the way they worked you while being there, you would think they would pay more. In order to become full time would have had to be there almost 10 years."
bad,"I reported to HR several times on a daily basis about harassment in the workplace and instead of taking care of the issue at hand they placed me on an out of service because of my disability, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder."
bad,This company is okay to work for but do not expect a full time position. Also if you have an injury from the military that requires surgery they will tell you that you are approved for short term disability then after surgery they will deny you benefits
bad,"Fast paced environment, trained but walked through expectations fast without ability to ask questions.  Employees usually stick to themselves in this environment. No paid time off or sick time off."
bad,"I’m retired at 35 from an injury from this company and they screwed me over! Worked for 12 years, was good till this injury. Other than that, I have nothing more to say."
bad,come prepared for work stay health and hydrated for a good workout. Get a good rest a sleep before you work. They are very helpful training you and providing you with extra help in and outside of work.
bad,This job is great for young men and women. The down side to this job is that its labor intense moving boxes for hours straight. The plus side is that when you pass your probation your benefits kick in. so if you are young and have a small family and need work this is the place to go
bad,"a young person can learn a lot working here but an adult who has bills to pay should steer clear, a lot is expected from underpaid employees who have not been trained properly"
bad,"best part about this place was the work out you would get while working... paid way to low to be buried in packages. no help, and gets worse every year"
bad,I finally hired on as a temp seasonal worker. First they had me fueling trucks but the exhaust from the trucks just about killed me. I quickly switched out to sort. Few things to share. Found out it takes about ten years of seasonal to be offered permanent part time. Try another six to get full time. Then once full time a job title means very little they switch you around where they need you and will force you to work 6 maybe 7 days a week during the heavy season. Again this job really has no future. If single and living with parents or even grand parents try a seasonal position. Forget driver helper hours based on need but does pay 5 bucks more an hour.
bad,Worst thing is seniority. Everyone acts like they are better than you and are entitled to more due to having more years with the company. Turnover is horrible and management does not know how to manage.
bad,"They make you work 10-14 hours per day, 6 days a week. They make you work like a slave and then barely pay you for your time. They only give one 10 minute break each shift"
bad,"Very intense manual labor for not enough pay. I have enjoyed most of the part-time supervisiors and have very good coworkers. Although safety is a huge focus, no one actually seems to care much when an employee gets injured on the job. We get one 10 min break per shift and employees can't ask for any days off the entire first year."
bad,"go clock in start working, management would show up about 30 minutes or so after the sort started. Management was very unorganized, they lost my check multiple times and/or couldn't locate it at the time so I would have to wait longer to get paid."
bad,"I wanted to make things work at UPS but I am subjected to verbal abuse and insubordination. When I try to receive support from upper management, I usually receive ridicule and no help or assistance."
bad,High stress working environment with very little concern for employee wellness.  Unrealistic expectations handed down so no team can be successful. Great direct management.
bad,I worked there 14 years ago. My reviews are not pertinent in any way shape or form and making someone complete this section is totally asinine. Why is it required?
bad,Very hard work. Trucks not as safe as needed to be. Very easy to injure yourself when handling packages. Other than that ok place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement
bad,"Great pay, great benefits, but very poor work, life balance.  If you never want to see your family or friends then this is definitely the place for you!!"
bad,"Ups is a good place to work however they do have certain hiccups when it come to how they treat their workers."
bad,Allowed my great opportunity.  A Company that promotes from within.  Great job until Christmas time.  Way too many hours and unreal expectations during holiday season.
bad,"They don't really give you any hours, your pay is not enough to survive off of and they treat you like your outside life or other job that you may have is not important."
bad,it is a stable job with benefits.  I work 8 hours every week and schedule rotates including some weekend requirements.  Supervisors give some flexibility for time off
bad,"Can be a great place to work but my experience was not very grand. Had to call in at 3 am everyday just to be told that I wasn't needed to come in, and when you do come in it barely goes 3 1/2 hours. good place if someone lives at home or something, driving positions pay very well."
bad,"Low pay, horrible Hours and management really sucked. They have no morals and talk to you like your not human. And you get paid a little over minimum wage"
bad,Work your way thru college. Education assistance available. You will gain knowledge of wharehouse management. Learn valuable life skills and how to be safe and keep your employees safe
bad,"Working Monday through Friday for a guaranteed 3 1/2 hours is not ideal but you can work you way up to a different position or become a supervisor. It is a fast paced environment. Not very difficult, come in, do your job, and clock out then repeat the next day."
bad,Great place to work while going to school or part time in general. Short hours with great benefits. the jobs are fairly easy to learn and being trained helps with that. Job culture is good.
bad,"UPS Burtonsville, ""The Free Gym,"" was a good experience. As a preload sorter, you work 4 hour shifts, maybe more depending on the truck loads. The work is hard, hot and even back-breaking at times but it teaches most people perseverance."
bad,backbreaking work for not enough pay. people slack and you're left doing their work. okay for students i guess but overall i hated it and will never go back after walking out mudlhift
bad,You have to be young with a lot of energy to unload tractor trailer trucks daily. You are expected to unload a trailor in 1 hour and expected to unload 3 trucks in a four to five hour shift.
bad,"I wasnt't actually working for UPS it was The UPS Store, you get no benefits, the pay wasn't very good, the customers were terrible, and the work was pretty labor intensive and not worth what the trouble."
bad,"The benefits are very good and they pay for school, but you'll be doing manual labor in either very hot or cold temperature. Only offer part time jobs at the beginning and it takes a while to gain a full-time position. I would only recommend this place if you are looking for a way to help pay for school and can afford to live off part time pay."
bad,enjoyed my time at the company. I learned a lot during my time there and made many connections with hard working individuals like myself. I take every situation in life as a learning experience so I appreciate having worked at ups.
bad,Great place to work. Very laid back minimum hours. Amazing benefits. Friendly coworker. Over all a great place to work................................
bad,"A typical day at u.P.S. Consisted on upon my arrival I would have a staff meeting,get assigned truck to unload,unload at least 3 trucks assist others in completing their tasks."
bad,The pay here at UPS IS TO LOW for the hard work   I'm looking for a new and better job already it is to hot and you work to  hard to ONLY GET PAID 250$ per week
bad,Great experience fun work environment. Supervise employees dealing with new merchandise. Make sure none of the merchandise gets ruined by any of the employees.
bad,UPS is not a good job unlesss you turn it into a career because they work you like slaves for minimum hours and pay. Management only care for the package rate on the hour.
bad,This job was definitely not easy and very taxing. I worked from 3:30AM to 8AM Mon-Fri. I unloaded bulk trailers which meant packages were 70lbs plus sometimes up to 150lbs. I would unload 3 to 4 of these trailers on a typical day. If you like having your entire day to do whatever after work this might be a good fit for you. Personally I have a lot going on and the hours really messed with my recovery and sleep so it was not for me. Pay started at $11 and moving up to a part time supervisor is not hard to do if you are interested in that. Breaks were only 10 minutes which was really short after 3 hours of lifting.
bad,I was required to load a trailer with packages varying from 0 to a 100 pounds and had to keep up with the flow of packages coming off a conveyor belt being sorted by a sorter. I typically loaded 1200 or more packages a night and struggled with constant back pain from the job even though being at a very young age.
bad,Hated every minute of working here. People treat you like trash and never thank you for a job that is well done. I would not recommend it for anyone that wants a long term job.
bad,I liked the job until tbey gave me a No Rehire because of lack of work. That was not the truth when I'm being sent to other areas to work because they need help or was behind in they're work
bad,"Management made no attempts to help workers, whether it be dock or drivers. Dirty and not safe work environment, with equipment constantly breaking down."
bad,The place itself is great but the management is HORRIBLE and needs to be changed! The warehouse is very old and extremely dirty but if you can deal with all the rats and spiders you'll be fine.
bad,"I have been working here for 3 years and am still currently here. This job pays for my school compelety, which is a huge benefit. But if you are not in college I do not recommend working here. You start with only 10$ an hour for doing very hard physical work. The management is also bad. Once you have worked there for a long time it is hard to get a promotion."
bad,Supervisors are not supposed to work here but as soon as you hit the floor you are most definitely obligated to do so and sometimes have to work harder than a lot of hourly employees.
bad,"I say this now. If you're a college student and need a job, this is perfect for you. The benefits are outstanding. If not, Keep looking. On the morning shift, You are simply doing 6 hours worth of work in 4 hours."
bad,"UPS is third shift work which is tough on anyone. You don't vacation time until you've been in the company for a year, although you can sometimes work with management if you need time off. Management does not work together which in turn makes it a bad work environment for employees."
bad,Fun to work worked temporary  easy going very fast paced management very cool and respectful a lot of overtime easy to talk to co workers nice and clean facility
bad,They work you till you are broken. Some days there is no work at all. You drive all the way in just to be sent home. If doesn't pay enough for the work they want of you.  Women doing the men's jobs because they can't keep enough employees there to do it. People staying abs quitting after only being there an hour on their first day. It's  crazy there.  They make you take thirty minute lunches even when you are only gonna work a short shift that day.
bad,"Worst work environment. Poor communication, no accountability, stressful, passive aggressive and petty coworkers, entitled union workers, and so on."
bad,"Very exciting and full of energy. Loved the environment. Could be a little bit of hard work, but still pretty cool. I would recommend it to anyone in high school just for the experience."
bad,I enjoyed meeting all kinds of different people while working there but it is a very demanding time sensitive job that consists of constantly picking up and moving large heavy items that cause a lot of body ache.
bad,"I worked seasonal as a drivers helper, did not have much contact with the main hug.  I liked working with my driver, other than that, I do not have much to say."
bad,You just have to come in ready to work. Make sure to bring some gloves to prevent too many hand injuries. Also make sure to bring some type of liquid to stay hydrated.
bad,working here is kind of tough due to weather conditions. other than that it was an cool experience to deliver items for the holidays.
bad,"The hardest part about the job to deal with is the culture. The majority of the people don't care for being on time or advancing and are there only to receive great benefits after one year of employment. Management is terrible and though there's nothing wrong with working hard, it's like they reward you with more work for working hard and it is annoying to help someone else when they don't care to work efficiently."
bad,"a typical day at work is very overwhelming depending on what your doing and if your supervisors chill or not,i learned how to develop patience and communicate with people a lot more effectively,management was okay in a nice way of putting it,the harder you worked the higher the expectations were,the hardest part of the job was when we have to clear a pathway for egress on the trailers which isn't hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with,everyone worked together or at least helped each other out if they had the free gap of time."
bad,"It's disorganized, you are given a specific job but may have to do multiple things, the supervisors don;t treat everyone equally the same there is a lot of favoritism. The co-workers are very helpful and friendly. On a typical day it can be very slow with almost nothing to do on the day but when the drivers come back it can get very busy and hectic especially during peak season. The most enjoyable part would probably be the amazing co-workers and the fun events they have."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job the employees are horrible not enough pay the managers are great  UPS does not let you get over 40 hours a week
bad,Just as title states. Most long-term employees wish they weren't. I can't say I blame them. Hopefully it was just my particular location. Horrible to say the least. Unorganized and unprofessional.
bad,hard work very hard work and not equally compensated. very tough working conditions and management needs more training.
bad,"I worked with the company for over two years. As an hourly, you are treated as a machine. I worked at 2 different hubs and under 4 different full time managers and only one actually treated me as a human. The others wouldn't acknowledge the hard work and devotion I put into my work. The upside is you can move up easily in the company if you are a hard worker. I got promoted to supervisor a little over a year of being there, but even then you have to deal with the full- time managers more. In the end they pay good but the overall respect for the hourlys is very limited."
bad,"I enjoyed working here. Unfortunately, it was an oncall job and the days were inconsistent. There no bad part. Regular training on devices and appropriate conductin a courtroom setting."
bad,"Clean  and making break fast"
bad,"Doesn't matter if you have been there 11 months or 11 days still same pay 10.15 an hour, and NO BENEFITS,also was supposed to be getting bonus on our checks,NEVER RECEIVED, if supervisors don't like you,there isn't room for advancement, EVERYONE there ALWAYS plays the I'VE BEEN HERE LONGER CARD!! UNION STEWART is a joke!!"
bad,"Ideal workplace for some one who wishes to learn and sharpen their skills. "
bad,"While working for UPS I gained physical strength, package handling/receiving knowledge, and time management. Though the experience was good, there is room for improvement in terms of communication between management and their employees as well as improvement in the pay wages."
bad,"The job description is not at all what you actually do at the Mechanicsburg location. "
bad,"Starting out not many hours. 10 bucks an hour starting off with decent incentives. Becoming a part time supervisor is attainable but it gets bad after that. Get yelled at everyday for stuff you can't control. Everything that happens is your fault, just gets old. You dont get paid for all the time you work. Especially at the toledo hub. only 10 minute break."
bad,"Working at UPS for 3 years ,I felt that even though you could get used to the pace and strain of the work, It took too much of a toll on me, made me tired all day and when you had a bad day up there it was a really bad day."
bad,"I actually enjoyed working as a package delivery driver, but I was in the minority there. Everyone seemed to hate the job. Working 10-12 hours a day makes for great pay, but makes a life outside of work nearly impossible. The management lies and hints at the idea of getting a full-time position to make you work harder, then cuts you loose whenever they don't need you. I would've loved to stay here for the long-haul if the management was more honest."
bad,Not really an ideal place to work unless you can afford to get less than 25 hours a week making 8.50 per hour. If you can somehow stay there long enough to become a driver then maybe it would be a worthwhile place to work. Honestly you would have to wait 7+ years to become a driver.
bad,"the management was very poor, the staff members were unorganized and the payments were always late and not correct, also the hours of the pay was wrong and they do not tell you that you start being paid as soon as you do your first delivery."
bad,"Fast paced and very hectic. Lots of miscommunication. Unpredictable hours, often less than 20 a week. Very day to day work load. Poor relationship between management and employees."
bad,"Provides the highest level of prompt and friendly customer service; greets and thanks customers"
bad,"They like to take money from the employees when they transfer to different areas of the company, or not pay them the appropriate amount that they should for performing other jobs."
bad,"punch in, wait around for 5;50 to start. since other people have majority rule of working the longest they decide what positions they'd like to work at. Either bagging up smaller packages, unloading all ups trucks or loading up the semi with packages that a running down the belt. more than occasionally employees argue whether the supervisor butts in. Some are fowl comments to each other. No tolerance rule does not follow with this ups site. usually I'm in the trailer. Packaging in from top to bottom. Most nights everything fits, and when it does not we have to wait until another truck from morris to come and we load up the rest in there. We also wash the smaller ups delivery trucks on a daily basis."
bad,typical day on the job is pretty fast past.  I learn that safety is very important. management is pretty decent co workers are friendly. the hard part of the job is to stay efficient the most enjoyable part of the job is to meet new people.
bad,I was hired as an seasonal worker and did not have a steady set schedule. I was called when needed. Sometimes not called at all. When I did work fast paced and not well organized.
bad,I don't feel I have enough long term experience here to speak intelligibly. What I do know is that the work was hard and the hours were very early and the compensations was low.
bad,"Pay is alright, but you get next to no hours. All of the management is not competent.  It is an alright job if you jsut need a litle money here nd there but in the long run it is not worth it. Long waiting list if you want to get full time here"
bad,I sitt in a pre-sort meeting. I set up a belt and direct people where the work goes. I record their time. I am to think of the customer.
bad,The actual work load and work environment is very easy but the management needs work. Also the owners are a husband and wife who have very different ways they want the store ran which makes things difficult
bad,Not really my type of environment...Too much work and too little pay! UPS employees should make at least $15 starting pay in my opinion.
bad,"This job is not for the faint of heart. It is very hard physical labor. My job was technically part time, but when peak season hits it is anything but. Start time vary from day to day which makes it hard to plan around. It was a steady pace of lifting and lowering packages between 1- 70 lbs for about 4-6 hours Sunday - Thursday. "
bad,"Unload up to 20 trucks a day, must work very fast, only a 10 minute break and have to lift up to 200 pounds boxes a day. The supervisors are constantly yelling"
bad,"I honestly did not care to much for my job or the Management/Supervisor while I was working for Proffers. My opinion is that the Supervisors talk to there employees in a very negative & unprofessional manner, as if sorting through rotten fruits & vegetables all day isn't hard enough, you get yelled at practically your entire shift about everything your doing wrong, even when its there failure to train you efficiently. I never heard anyone get praised in a positive way for what they were doing right, there always yelled at in front of everyone in the warehouse for there mistakes."
bad,"Working for UPS has to be one of the worst jobs ever (unless you are a driver). As a pre-loader we work the early am shift, which makes us be to work at 4 am and sometimes off by 8 or 9 am. So typically we look to see about 18 hours a week. we have to work in the back of these trailer cars where the fans dont work. long story short if it wasnt for the benfits UPS is a bad job"
bad,I was only getting 3 hours a night. That wasn't worth the gas usage. I  loved the job but wish there was more hours given to me while I worked there.
bad,You are expected to do it all. On an average day you will wear about 10 to 12 different hats. Does not leave a lot of time for your actual job function.
bad,Outside work in all weather.  Some computer work.  Short hours and night work. Many payroll issues and they never sent pay statements so you didn't know what you were being paid for.
bad,Fact paced call center environment at the company with little room to grow in th area but overall the people there were nice and pleasant
bad,As soon as you step on to the truck boxes are flying at you. Can be hard to keep up until you are used to it. Worked in the summer so it became very hot in the trucks. But the good part you worked four hours then you went home.
bad,het was het eerste bedrijf in delogiestiek en ik heb daar wel veel geleert over werk in zon sort bedrijf.
bad,Ok place to work managment is unorganized and set themselves apart from labourers. People are good most of the time but most of the ones that are there are there because they need the money. once you join the union sit back and wait 3 years to get to your top rate witch is $20 if you can last that long at minimum wage. I only recommend those who are going to school to apply
bad,I would arrive early in the morning and load a minimum of four trucks daily and then communicate my assignments to the drivers and management. The hardest part of my job was when packages were mislabeled and management was not always available for concerns.
bad,"This place is very nice great Doctors loved seeing all of the patients "
bad,Working at UPS is a fun experience learn a lot new things I enjoy working  with co worker I enjoy working with the aircraft.
bad,"Unload trucks filled with boxes, keeping safe and alert while handling heavy packages."
bad,"Short work hours."
bad,You work hard for little money and no benefits for an whole year
bad,"Pleasure to work for this company, I would love to work there again in the near future."
bad,"The staffmark division of UPS is very lousy. They get attitudes when you miss a day, as if you're whole life revolves around their mail processors. When you take a day off, expect to be taken off the schedule, FOR AT LEAST TWO DAYS. I knew that my time was worth more than $9.00 and I didn't deserve to be treated like a slave by these people, so I just left. They even moved our breaks back an hour JUST TO INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTION. C'mon man, that was one of the best parts of the day."
bad,"This company over supervise their employees.  Supervisor stand over you shouting at you to ""go faster.""  The benefits negotiated by the union are very good, however, only full time employees enjoy them.  It take about 10 years of part-time years to qualify for a full time position.  History of firing their employees without just cause."
bad,"Accepted job as seasonal driver and first day out to drive with supervisor was assigned two trucks with 650+ packages and 150 mostly county deliveries of which I had never been to this area before. While close to 500 packages were bulk commercial stops at 5 or so businesses, the rest were in the county in unfamiliar areas.  The hours were crazy also, working 8:30am to 8 or 9pm at night. How is one to have a family life? After 8 days of work I'm bowing out as learning everything about this job, being let go after 2 months, getting about half the pay of a full time driver, and being overloaded to the max just isn't worth it. To management....if you didn't like me and trying to weed me out, congratulations! You succeeded!"
bad,"Management was awesome, fun coworkers, was fun working all aspects, whether cooking or taking orders. Good college job."
bad,Hard work with loading and unloading but not overly exhausting.  No flexibility with ours
bad,Not enough hours and it takes a long time to be promoted. Sorting packages at a fast pace is not a bad job but could be very stressful.
bad,"typically all you really had to do is pick the boxes off the rotating rakes and load the trucks. management was average, on some lines there were good supervisor and other not so good. hardest part was loading over 1000 boxes on a small bus in 4 less then 4 hours in order by stop"
bad,grreat job for a student or someone with very little time to work. unfortunately they only offer part time positions and i just needed more hours.
bad,I come in clock in make sure of the area im suppose to be at. I loaded tucks and unloaded. It was a typical warehouse job I worked at night which cause me to have only about 4 hrs a day.
bad,"UPS has awesome healthcare benefits, that is the only reason I am still currently employed there. I am unsatisfied with the overall environment, it is not safe for women unless you are in a management or corporate position."
bad,"Great benefits, but only sustainable for college students due to lack of hours available"
bad,Mean management and unionized staff. Treated disrespectfully. Not enough pay and poor bennys to get treated so badly.
bad,"Mean place to work where the ""unionized"" staff treat the management like garbage."
bad,Great part-time job if your looking for benefits.  Very fast pace environment
bad,typical day would be from 8 am till 9 30 pm no time for anything but work
bad,ok place to work but beware of how many hours you input be ready to show proof because they like to take of hours with employess noticing.
bad,"Good bad benefits for being part time. Don't make a enough for a weeks pay. If you go into management, You'll get paid like a full time job anywhere else without having to work 40hours. UPS can be great for you, depending of what you make out of it."
bad,"A typical day at work usually included one rush of people and many individual entries"
bad,A typical workday consisted of hard work and dedication that was truly worth it .
bad,Every day at work we had to either load and unload trucks or we had to slide package on the conveyor based on the color combination on the package. The management was good they handled any problem we needed. The coworkeres didnt really associate like @ previous jobs but they werent bad. The hardest part of the job was waking up every morning @ 2 or 3 in the morning to go to work to throw heavy boxes.
bad,"United Parcel Service of North America, Inc., typically referred to as UPS, is an American global package delivery company headquartered in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States in Greater Atlanta. It delivers more than 15 million packages a day to more than 6.1 million customers in more than 220 countries and territories around the world."
bad,"Assisted UPS Driver on deliveries and pick-ups. Acquired experience on using the DIAD, the onboard shipping and receiving computer. Performed any duties as assigned by supervisor."
bad,The benefits were great at UPS. Sadly the working conditions seemed to decline year after year and eventually I left for fear of getting injured; Also I enjoyed the work but I decided I wanted something different for a career.
bad,"Lots of hard work"
bad,"Positive work environment, although growth in the individually owned company is minimal."
bad,You had to meet a certain quota for loading and unloading different sized freight trucks each night.
bad,"hard company to work for, they dont worry about there management personal, got rid of the hard supervisors"
bad,its a hard working place. pay is a little less what you expected it to be.
bad,"Um dia típico de trabalho DE VERDADE acontecia geralmente apenas no fim do mês, e nesses dias a gente chegava a fazer mais de 15h de trabalho consecutivas. Aprendi bastante sobre estoque e sobre como a questão de horários é complicada quando se trabalha com logística. Na empresa éramos todos ""novatos"", inclusive a direção, que era formada por funcionários vindos ou de São Paulo ou de outras empresas, mas que em boa parte eram novatos naquele posto, e que por vezes ficava meio perdido, não quanto ao trabalho, o qual conheciam bastante, mas principalmente na forma como lidar com os colaboradores que estavam nos níveis operacionais. A equipe de trabalho do estoque era uma equipe muito boa e unida, e, inclusive, conseguimos fazer o que a empresa precisava (o estoque estava vindo inteiro de outra empresa), em tempo menor do que eles haviam estipulado, e com muito menos perdas do que eles haviam previsto. A parte mais difícil do trabalho foi a que me fez desistir, que era o fato de não termos horários fixos."
bad,"Seasonal employment doesn't last long, you are only called if the driver in your area needs help, and the rate of pay per hour is very low with no benefits."
bad,"Hard job to keep up, tough mentally and physically.  Only worked a few hrs a day.  Only worked 20 hrs a week."
bad,"my old boss at liberty tax also was my manager here, stocking boxes and marketing."
bad,"Working at that specific location, I wouldn't be able to cash my checks because there was no funds in the payroll account MULTIPLE TIMES.  Wouldn't get paid OT during seasonal. "
bad,I enjoyed this job because it was an evening job which allowed me to have a day job as well. I had several responsibilities.
bad,"Good for a stepping stone, not so much long term if you go into management."
bad,Re-pack damaged packages when needed. Put on strapss to prevent shifting or damage to packages being transported. Adjust or replace rollers by hand and make sure packages are in the right place before loading. 
bad,"They didnt care about me as an employee, they treated me poor, and i would never have anyone work there"
bad,Unloading trailers and earning very basic pay. Work day started early and ended in the afternoon.
bad,"Working with the patient and keeping the place safe and clean. The most enjoyable part of this job is how the patient kept a smile on your face, and tell wonderful stories about thier life."
bad,Typical night consisted of unloading packages. Management was ok. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hardest part was unloading packages that weighed 80 pounds. The most enjoyable part was it was only a few hours a night.
bad,"Start time is generally between 4:30pm and 6:00pm. Packages come down on the slide according to what the total volume of the warehouse, also known as the hub, was. I started out making $8.50/hr but over time was making $19.47/hr due to yearly raises. Some of the supervisors were ok. Some were jerks probably because of the pressure put on them by their superiors. The hardest part of the job was when the boxes of copy paper came onto the slide. There were many and they each weigh 52lbs. It was a workout to sort them to the correct belt. The most enjoyable time on the job was when the volume was low and we could conversate."
bad,"pace was frantic, supervisor yelled"
bad,Easy job but not enough work.Hours were good pay was good. got 2 break and one hour lunch.
bad,you get in and either load or unload trucks. Unloading the trucks seemed to be the easiest job there because you set the current flow for your truck. Loading was the worst because the flow was none stop.
bad,Hectic work environment where management was lacking in leadership capabilities
bad,"Career progression from dock loader, part time supervisor, driver to operations manager due to multiple promotions based on job performance and achievements. Increased responsibility within the distribution management team. Managed 15 supervisors and at times over 200 union employees."
bad,"While i gave the job my fullest effort, the working environment wasn't condusive to job progression, it was very much 'in at the deep end' from the start."
bad,"good pay and benefits,good peopled to work with,very demanding"
bad,I always worked hard by loading and unloading heavy packages
bad,this comany was bought out and is no longer in existence. management expected women to wear skirts and heels to work. middle management was not supportive.
bad,It's physically demanding but it just not enough. You do not get payed enough for all the work you do.
bad,Input data. Too many demands in little time. Management only cared for management.
bad,A typical work day in operation was 12-14 hours. Responsible for training and development of Service Providers. Ensure all Service Provider issues and concerned are addressed. I learned how to deal with different personalities. Learned how to communicate with different levels of management. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. Work is difficult but you felt part of a team.
bad,The company was good and provides a great service however they are franchised out and the owner of my store was also the Manager. She was not in anyway a joy to have had worked for.
bad,Worked for company for many years but there was no room for advancement. Private owner great for high school students.
bad,A typical shift consisted of 15hrs with only two fifteen minute breaks. Most of the supervisors only spoke Spanish which for most people was very hard to communicate.
bad,"only worked there for about 5 months. it's okay, nothing special, nice part time gig."
bad,"Good: This part time position is great if you want to pursue other activities during the day or go to school since it is an early morning shift 3 am-9am average. The pay is decent and Union benefits are excellent. Full health coverage for spouse and children, 401k pension etc. Company likes to hire from within so becoming a driver or supervisor happens fast and often."
bad,when i worked there as a loader and unloader and when promoted to shift belt supervisor my supervisor would curse at me and constantly say things that would belittle me and continued to do so until the day i snapped and walked off from the job that day and quit and when i brought it to human resources they took my information down but i never heard back from them afterwards so they didnt even do a follow up and i was even excelling in my work i brought my belt to meet their quota and then some i was always hands on with the work with my crew and i was rewarding them for knowing all their safety procedures and how to properly handle boxes and stack walls yet my supervisor continued to belittle me maybe other facilities are better for someone else but the phoenix hub is not worth the work to be trash talked
bad,"Enter at own risk, no room for progression, ok pay, I was in management, all I can say is it starts at the top....if you want to make a career working 4 hours a day early in the morning 4-9 go for it, you will wait for a driver position for about 3 years and then you will be a slave"
bad,"It was a safe work environment, but they treated most employees very badly. There was no AC during the summer, and there were no opportunities for time off until you had worked for at least a year."
bad,Very morally disturbed environment . The management was rude and you were treated as a production number and not a employee. The pay was ok but even that didn’t outweigh the mental and physical strain this job put on you
bad,"I just love working,Learning new experiences,helping out coworkers...."
bad,"Working at UPS was a challenge, it was fast paste and sometimes i wasn't able to keep up. They throw the new hires in and basically say sink or swim. I believe that there should have been more training but some prefer it that way. They are also willing to change but in baby steps, they still haven't reached a point of safety but are growing as a company. Downside the employees are just a number on a machine, they really don't care about them."
bad,"It's all about the union, you are treated like trash until you join then you are royalty. Super uses personal things to get you to work hardy but it is only demoralizing. Everyone who has worked there longer acts like they are your boss"
bad,"Be prepared to be worked as a preloader (hours are 4:00 AM-10:00Am) for weeks before becoming a driver. You will be pushed hard every day and every minute to as efficient as possible. Training is provided but be prepared to struggle with the DIAD computer. Management is solid with the exception of one manager who is short tempered, rude and will strongly imply to work through your breaks and lunch. Co-Workers are great"
bad,"After working at a UPS franchise for almost half a year, I really enjoyed learning more about the shipping process and helping customers satisfy their needs."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me loading trailers for an average of 4-5 hours every day from Monday-Friday. I learned how to properly lift heavy packages without putting much strain on my back and also loading at a face and efficient pace. I had the chance to go management but would require me to not be union anymore. The workplace at UPS was good due to the people I worked around and with. The hardest part was at the end of our shift when it would get the heaviest. The best part of a day at UPS would be mainly at the beginning of the day when it ould be the lightest.
bad,You're in trailers all day or night till the morning or night depending on your shift. It's tiring. Especially if you have college classes. The work isn't hard but we fit backed up too much so it was a struggle. People either quit or didn't show up on time.
bad,The Unioun was nice the people that worked there great the management was a bit sloppy but over all a good place to work I’d recommend it to you if your ready for a work out!!
bad,"Stable job with great benefits."
bad,"Your mental health is not worth anything they could pay you. Management is awful, and if you are told you’ll be a loader on nights—Run. UPS is a soul destroying workplace."
bad,"I enjoyed working there but i got hours tooken away I worked overtime and didn't get payed for my over time was very upset . I had to go into surgery and couldn't work for 6 weeks I had let them know I was also doing the process so I get the permission off being off but I tried going back about 3 1/2 weeks later after my surgery and when I got there the supervisor Let me go because they ""were letting people go"" witch I had found out I was the only one they let go I was very mad and upset"
bad,"You work hard with inconsistent hours and workload, then you go home dead tired with very little money at the end because of the taxes and union dues."
bad,Extremely physical job. Must be in good physical shape. Benefits are good. I recommend to many but the starting pay is too low for the labor involved. It is worth it if you stick it out.
bad,"Although the job description may be convincing, this company highly lacks appreciation of their employees. This job is good for anybody going to school that needs the extra money to get by during the time. The benefits are good, but it doesn't make up for how poorly it is working here. Management here is terrible, other than the supervisors. This company does everything in their power to pay their employees as little as possible."
bad,Ups is a tough company to work for production is the most important thing and you are only a tiny link in the chain and once you get time in and performance changes. Your job will be threatened almost daily and management will find a way to get rid of you.
bad,Work was fast paced and extremely physically demanding. Many coworkers were competitive and boastful. Management was not trained properly and was often someone promoted from within without proper ability.
bad,UPS is ok if your looking for a part time gig the pay isn't that great.. there is no breaks in between shifts and overtime is rarely available out of season unless you know a supervisor from the next shift thats coming in
bad,"Its very welcoming for the most part and it's great to be apart of the UPS culture, good values, decent shift times, weekly pay, but as soon as management messes up they will blame you for their mistakes and become very rude. Training was also terrible, person teaching you isnt even doing the same type of route you would be doing nor could they even bring up an extra scanner between 3 people trying to be trained. Said they will bring it up and never did, really unprofessional honestly."
bad,"Thank god for the union. "
bad,A typical day was very busy. Management was easy to get along with. Work schedule was flexible with my school schedule. Helped me to become a more versatile worker.
bad,"I worked there a while back but at the time, it was fairly typical work environment with expected duties as a shipping clerk. At the time, I was part-time."
bad,"It was good "
bad,"Overall UPS was a stable career. Good pay and benefits. However, there is no incentive to move from a Union job to management. Pay by the hour was less (no control of hours worked in management). Medical/Dental plans are significantly weaker. UPS talked me into management and once I committed it is against company policy to go back to an hourly position even if desired. If that was allowed most management folks would go back in my opinion. The more work and accomplishments that are achieved the more is expected.   The stress the company puts on its employees is not worth the pay, which is why I opted to move on once I was vested after 20 years. 14 more years with that company for a full retirement would have been a nightmare!"
bad,"Loading and unloading is hard work. Break is 10 minutes and paid. Sometimes work is hard and there isn't someone to help you, and this is a physically demanding job, so if you need help and don't get it you can hurt yourself and slow everything down"
bad,Overall the experience was for the most good. I like the hard work and fast pace of the jobs. Dislike how management ran the area and the hub. Dislike how they treat their employees who been there for years and is loyal to the company in turn pay more to new hires without giving a pay raise to their senior employees.
bad,Good pay decent work hour they promote from within the company n good discount n good benefit are provided to u non stress working environment  laid back job
bad,UPS is a good starter job but almost impossible to make it a career . Want to much out of you for little pay Also no breaks at all . Plus would harass you about using the bathroom
bad,"Sucks the whole first year. but that's to be expected. The work is not that physically demanding if your in capable enough shape to move boxes, or deliver boxes."
bad,It was like a 5 out of 10 .. just cause how things was there . It was good pay just not enough hours and didn’t like loading the trailers by my self ..
bad,Ups is a place where you are likely to start in the warehouse you move up by bids on a bid sheet. Hours are more then likely giving by the volume of the building
bad,"the job is steady as long as you're a working mule. benefits are amazing, but all the younger people make it a better enviornment than the older people who has been there for 15 years"
bad,"Not enough training, management belittling in front of coworkers.  Managers always looking over your shoulder. Stressful.  There was fun activities for employees.  Also health groups and 10 minutes stretch time each day."
bad,"A very fast paced, physical work place with short breaks and less or no time to relax. With no set schedule work can be a surprise with added duties and unexpected task or duties."
bad,"During my time with UPS I experienced many long days of work, sometimes up 12 hours a day of manual labor. My co-workers were friendly, but upper management was very strict at times"
bad,Harder working busy do. Some slow and fast paced small sort. Unhappy not enough small pay. Doing what for helping teams share and must fairly attend peoples.
bad,Pay is terrible unless you are only looking for a part-time job. On your feet all day only a 10 min rest. Benefits do not start until you have been with the company for a full year.
bad,heavy steady lifting for up to 5 hours per day but that is as long as the shifts are. shifts rotate around the clock but only part time. work in the heat of summer and cold of winter loading semi trailers floor to ceiling wall to wall with boxes.
bad,Diverse job site sometimes nice atmosphere. Hot warehouse not many water fountains. Great job benefits. The insurance is the best. Wear and tear on the body.
bad,"Overall, this was an okay summer job. I would never work there, It was a lot of physical labor for a low pay rate, My manager was really cool and the coworkers were nice and helpful. Didn't fit me well."
bad,"Management needs work, the job would be a thousand times better if they cared about your well being as much as they do getting the boxes from point A to point B. All in all it's a secure job and always has room to advance with some time of course. I wouldnt recommend it really unless you absolutely need a job or of you want to get help paying for school."
bad,Ups has nice benefits. But the work environment was bad. The pay was pretty bad for the work they had you do. Ups is good for people that are going to school.
bad,"During peak season they give you all the hours in the world then right after you get no overtime and if you do they will take it off your time card and put it  on another day. They now only want to pay you only the union guarantee which is not that much to begin with (only 3 and a half hours). They are always trying to get you off the clock as soon as possible so they always say ""we trying to get out of here"". supervisors are not supposed to work but they do anyway so that they can send you home as soon as possible. Also you are constantly harassed by the supervisors , ""You done yet?"" ""how many?"" ""are all your trucks in?"" It all gets repetitive and it drives you crazy."
bad,"I was too old to start working here for a part time position, and not looking to go to college.  I was 55 when I was hired.  I thought it would be a smooth transition to a full time.  Unfortunately that is not the case, and I coukd not wait for years for that opportunity."
bad,"I had great management when I working there. The work is very labor intensive. Customers can become very difficult where pricing is concerned. Good crew, most stores are franchises.  I must admit I'm wasn't a fan of this particular job."
bad,I never really liked it. they pay you peanuts and expect you to act as if you're the general manager of the company with a bunch of responsibility
bad,"If your into air crafts, waking up early or staying up late and shipping and receiving well this place has all that. They make the pay seem good however by time you balance about 150 per week for 18 months before they give you the initial 22hr or benefits. If you want to work your way up its nearly impossible as they say they promote within however it was very unheard of."
bad,"It was ok, the job just wasn't for me. didn't like the place the managers was unfair when it came to different things. hours was great just not for the money"
bad,"No much to say, in fact it was nice working with UPS then, The management then was not all that bad  and all my co-workers were just like family."
bad,I really enjoyed the people who worked there although the amount of work that has to be done will leave your back very tight in need of massage. unless you enjoy hard labor i wouldn't suggest working here
bad,"The work itself was not that bad at UPS. As a package handler it was pretty simple, sort the packages to each truck, scan them to that truck so the system knows where it is. Afterwards we would move and re-fuel trucks so they were ready in the morning. "
bad,"This job was seasonal, management found steady work near your home. Learned locating and handheld devices. Rarely worked"
bad,"Loading and unloading vehicles, utilizing a computerized tracking system.  Responsible for meeting strict deadlines, and for maintaining the accuracy of all tracking reports."
bad,"On the night shift at UPS we start off sharing safety tips and go over the day.  We then proceed to sort packages and make sure they are sent to their appropriate destinations.  The sort takes an average of two hours every night.  When we're finished with the sort we take a 10 minute break.  When our ten Minutes is up our job is to wash the UPS package cars.  The hardest part of the job is the that it is physically demanding.  We have are constantly moving to ensure that we have an efficient flow of packages, so we can get them loaded on the trucks and shipped to their destinations on time.  I enjoy washing the package cars the most because it's not as stressful as keeping a constant flow of packages, and we can often wash at our own pace.  Throughout my time at UPS I've learned a lot about how to safely handle heavy objects.  I've also learned a lot about their package tracking system, why it is important to the company and the customers, and how I can utilize it via scanning packages and knowing how to use the scanners properly. "
bad,Just unloading and loading trucks the area have to adjust at first but after a while its easy sailing
bad,I load up trailers with all different size packages for 3-5 hours straight.
bad,"You get cheated on pay here. Alot, for very hard work too! There are some perks. You will be in good shape at this job, also you can become  supervisor. The draw back of that is you get only a 2 dollar raise and are no longer in the union, meaning you can be fired at a moments notice. For the most part you will be handling packages in really terrible conditions."
bad,a typical day at work would be very busy and packages everywhere and just everyone getting frustrated cause its to many packages coming down the line .       I learned that even though your job might get a lil crazy just take a deep breath and keep going .  management can be good at times and bad you just have to have the will power to do whats right even when you dont agree . the hardiest part was the lifting to me but i did it . the most enjoyable part would be meeting new people everyday and making someones day with there package
bad,"A typical day would be unload trailers, help other co-workers with their trailers. I learned how to sort, load and unload. Management had problems managing because they would cut co-workers who had more seniority making the work load harder and pull people from other departments to help out. I got along with all my co-workers and all them complained about the job, the heat, and the management. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks that were not properly loaded right and heavy packages come tumbling down and hit me in several parts of my body. The most enjoyable part of the job was having every Saturday and Sunday off."
bad,Pretty much clear your 30 days of training with minor supervision and you will see what you have to look forward to. FYI its not much but it will pay your bills at least after 2-3 yrs are established. First paychecks will be meager ranging from $150-$180 a week [based on 8.50 starting rate]
bad,"you can stay there forever if you wanted to, but then i suggest you seriously evaluate your life."
bad,Responsible for delievering packages from warehouse to customers doorstep.
bad,Long Work Days I Loaded Trucks For Four Hours An Day. Less Hours.
bad,"Sometimes very little work to do, other times way too much.  My bosses and coworkers were great but it was pretty hectic since we were located on a college campus."
bad,Working with UPS gave me the opportunity to work with different people to learn something new. The hardest part of my job was to lift 100 or more pounds and didn't get any help from my team members. The job was okay. It wasn't really flexible with my schedule and outside life.
bad,"Each day is basically the same. Again, the task isn't hard. All that is required is to unload boxes from the truck. However, it's tough manual labor because some of the weight of the boxes are 75+ pounds."
bad,"If you like to do the same thing every day for pay that isn’t worth the effort then you’d love this job. It is the standard warehouse job that you’d expect, but it isn’t as modern on it’s ideals as current competitors."
bad,"Working at UPS was pretty good until the end. After Christmas, they just told me to stop coming in and ghosted me. I know it was a seasonal job but it was unprofessional how they dealt with things. I didn't know when the job was going to terminate. Currently without a job"
bad,Learned a lot but would never go back. Spent 9 years and decided I would leave rather then kill myself. Did everything that was asked and more but was no advancement b/c I do kiss up.
bad,It had bad management.I was there  years ago when they were not making much money.. I know alot of the supervisors has left. I dont know how it is now.
bad,Get ready fo an experience. Most people quit the first week or so. Takes 2 weeks for your body to adjust to all the repetition of lifting and moving packages of different sizes and weights
bad,Sometimes I didn't like this job because some people where bad at work the they get mad mad for nothing and if you mest the work they call you why you didn't did the right work
bad,"It was very hard work, you will definitely sweat and be tired at the end of your shift. They have breaks but only for about 10 minutes. It was very fast paced at time making it stressful."
bad,"A typical day at UPS is one usually filled with some form of frustration and resentment. The management is not what I would consider “effective” and sometimes tend to make baffling decisions that I and many other workers don’t agree with. Despite management woes, my co-workers are definitely a joy to work with. It certainly gives a “comrade” feel working with them as we all do our best and work under the conditions together."
bad,"Very stressful job, recently started getting paid enough for what we do however it is still not enough. Hardly bring home a $300 check every week. The fellow coworkers there are great! You’ll meet great people. Would I recommend this job? Yes, only to people who need a second income coming in."
bad,The work load is fast pace and stressful. I tried to qualify as a package driver for 30 days and i was unable to qualify an impossible stat that couldn't be accomplished.
bad,"I worked inbound shift for 7 years getting paper work ready for dock man/handed them their work load.  Arrived road drivers, worked side by side with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was socializing with all different shifts."
bad,"The benefits are great but they don't know how to manage"
bad,The work is not the issue if you are a hard worker by nature. You will be asked to move around and help others while keeping your task in check. management on the other hand is very pestering and somewhat disrespectful. You get one 10min break (if your area doesn't run through break). And supervisors may act funny with paying you for the full time you've worked...
bad,"typical day at work: (small sort) walk in, stand at my location wait for the work to come to me and scan the packages as they come and place them in the correct locker."
bad,Worked here fresh out of school. From 1 am to 5 am constant moving. One break per shift and if your peers working along side of you did not pay attention to your section it would get overrun.
bad,"The position I worked under involved me handling numerous packages. That flow down a metal chute connected to a conveyor belt. I had to place and stack boxes into neat walls. Read the labels on the packages to make sure they belong to their proper trailer. Work at a steady pace to avoid the chute from overflowing with packages. And make sure to have a clean and safe egress to move around in. "
bad,"i would recommend this as a second job not a main!"
bad,It is an okay place to work but the management is horrible over all and they treat regular employees poorly. The benefits are really good but you have to be there for a year before you qualify.
bad,"Very hard super fast past work, not a clean facility. Large amount of work in a short period of time. very triering. You must stay alert it can be dangerous"
bad,Sort normally start anywhere between 3 am and 4am depending on the load depending on area or supervisor you might have a later start time 10-15min break which feels like 2mins. they will try to rush the work out within 4 hours. remember to move at a smooth and steady pace ALWAYS lift with your knees and NOT YOUR BACK...GOODLUCK
bad,Great employee benefits are great!! Job is very difficult to manage home and work life. Overall great experience I would recommend Ups for a career. Great job
bad,"alot of lifting  boxes off of trucks but the pay wasnt good at all "
bad,"An average day would start around 5 am, and last till around 9 am.  It is demanded that you show up ready to work yourself hard and efficiently.  Making errors during the day would be addressed trying to seek perfection.  The hardest part of the job was being on top of your game every single time you walked in because it was typically going to be a tough day.  The best part of the job was being paid weekly and the opportunity to get more hours during the holiday season."
bad,Moeny and benefits are great.  Management is incompetent.  The management style is to berate and belittle.  Job gets done but inefficiently.  Literally too big to fail.
bad,"Working at UPS is probably one of the easiest things to do but the lack of communication and coordination with peers made the job a lot more complicated then it should be. Stressful pace at times were it feels like you’re moving non stop and it just feels like a dead end job. Only reason to work here is if you need health insurance, I’d say that’s the only benefit to working at UPS."
bad,A great mix of coworkers but most supervisors are standing around doing nothing again not all horrible expensive cafeteria unsafe work environment workers constantly being injured on the job be careful
bad,Excellent insurance back in the day for part time work. Advancement opportunity is willing to complete four year degree. Just can't support family on part time pay and have time to go to school.
bad,"UPS (under paid slaves) a very well known and reputable company but for the physicality of the work, the compensation is a direct slap in the face...."
bad,"Typical day at work is very hectic, I learned how to work with different types of diversity, the management team is not very helpful in training their people the company believes in throwing new hires into a job without the proper training. I think this sets people and your team up for failure. The employees I supervise on a regular basis are awesome they bring joy and are a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of my job is to obtain a great performance standards and deliver the high expectations required in the amount time given. The most enjoyable part of the job is the part time hourly employees and knowing they respect the job you and them try to accomplish on a daily basis."
bad,"Loader or unloaded is where they start you at. Slave work. Throwing boxes and scanning. "
bad,"This job is like a gym membership that pays you, it teaches you strong leadership skills, they work you as hard as they can comparable to the US Marines, and the pay is low compared to the amount of work they throw at you. They pay for colledge from day one if interested and they have an employee discount site and after one year full benefits kick in like full health and dental, 401k and several others but its up to you to decide if its worth it for you."
bad,"you have good and bad days"
bad,"This is a very fast paced job. A typical day includes loading multiple UPS delivery trucks simultaneously (3-5). If you are good at your job they will give you 4 trucks to load. At times the job is physically impossible to where safety can become an issue. Management expects you to be in multiple places at the same time, which is impossible to do. Do not be shocked if they expect you to do the work of 2 or 3 people. "
bad,Every day I loaded my three trucks until it was time to go and it was a good chance I would have to help someone with their load. I learned how to load trucks and work on the slide sorter. Management was understanding and nice. My co-workers were really nice. The hardest part of the job was helping with someone else's load when I was completely drained from mine. I didn't enjoy UPS at all.
bad,"management is always on top of clients packages"
bad,"The job was fast paced, so  the shift would go by fast. The workers are all focused on their own job, but we were all a team, so when someone needed help, someone was there to help."
bad,"It ery great working at UPS. I learned how to sort out packages by streets, address.Learned how to drive the truck . Mostly one there was and great to work with ! Best job I evey had would love to work for them again!"
bad,Ups is a okay job you can't pick up any hours. the Labor isn't too hard but they expect the most and expect you to break your back but there is no increase pay.
bad,"8:00am until you finished route"
bad,"Many training about call center. "
bad,"Benefits is the only reason I am still working at the job. Physical, fast paced job. After many years of work you will most likely have joint problems. Hard to quit because of the benefit package and decent hourly wages after many years of work."
bad,they make you stand there till there's work management sucks. peek seasons does not count towards your 45 days of union very unhappy.
bad,"This job is only recommended as a side job for extra money. The health benefits area amazing for a part time worker, but the working conditions and management make so that it’s a living nightmare for 3-5 hours a day"
bad,This job is not for somebody I cannot work at a fast pace you are required to stack boxes neatly into walls at the pace of 200 boxes an hour. Is hard work
bad,At this company the main focus is that employees work as fast as possible at all times. The pay gets messed up more times than not and when you try to fix it you have to talk to at least 2 different supervisors who will tell you to talk to HR and then HR tells you to go to your supervisor. They don't care if you are sick you are still expected to work even after you puke on the floor they won't let you leave until they find a person to take over your task.
bad,"UPS is a good place to exercise and get work experience but the only concern I have is the pay and the “other employees” they hire, with rude attitude, bad communication and bad teamwork. I’ve been falsely accused of things at UPS and do not appreciate it at all. One HR rep wasn't understanding at all. Complete trash bags! I’ve been written up 2 times from these false accusations and don’t think it’s rightBut overall, it’s right. However, there are more than one things I have concern wise about this branch."
bad,It’ll make you very comfortable for a couple weeks but also bring you to alot of your senses on what you really wanna do for the rest of your life and then some.
bad,"Not all supervisors are bad but most have no respect for their employees. They can also be forgetful and play with your money. If you work hard they’ll abuse you, it’s stressful, low paying and all the company cares about is numbers and money. You can advance but you might get the same feedback at any position."
bad,"Weird inconsistent hours, can be anywhere from three to five per day. unsafe work environment, with constant threat of heavy packages falling on someone. threat of heat exhaustion, due to quick paced work and little break time."
bad,This job was the worst I had since trucking. Low wages and very high co-payments to see your own doctor. They expect you to perform at a very low wage. It’s not worth it at all.
bad,Job was simple enough. The hub i worked at didnt make money as the industries around were slim. Whining drivers and customers was the most stressful part of job. As the hub operated in the red resources were limited.
bad,The lifting was to much for me... plus you only get a 10 minute break....but you cant if your truck isnt clean....  but it was okay for people who likes lifting
bad,Working here is extremely stressful and can be very frustrating. This job requires you to be strong and to be able to work lifting for 5 continuos hour
bad,You work 16 hour shifts and prepare off the clock for 1-2 hour at work and an additional 1-2 hour before and after work at your own house gearing up and gearing down.
bad,A good place to work temporarily only. Only thing good about this company is that its a union job with extremely very good benefits. Its a good place for someone who wants to work part time or anyone close to retirement age. Starting pay is minimum until 2 years and isn't worth working for that much for the amount of work that is given.
bad,"It was pretty strenuous to work here, very fast paced and never stopping, worked about 6 hours a day, moved around frequently to other positions, pretty good labor heavy. It was part-time, so the work/life balance is pretty good, worked mainly in the mornings, had the rest of the day opened. Didn't learn much of benefits as they don't start till you've been with them for a while and I was only there a short amount of time. I will also say, where I worked the management was excellent."
bad,It was overall a good job but it was very unorganized. It was a lot of team members leaving and coming back as they pleased as well as people’s car getting broke into.
bad,it was a job i had when I was just old enough to have a job. low hours low pay but good benefits. not a job id recommend to someone who needs full time work
bad,"Too much competition/ trash talk."
bad,"With my half hour commute one way, $4.00 a day in tolls, money spent on gas, and my low pay checks, I was barely pulling in $30 a week which forced me to leave."
bad,Productive work place but its very harsh on your body. Harsh lifting yet its very easy sometimes. Very fast flow of work. High levels of stress in the work enviorment as well
bad,"i learned alot bout this job just wish i could have had it into a career.the hardest part bout the job is you know you working for least pay.the managment need some work but my other coworkers where good. its in a warehouse so the workplace various with the temperature outside,"
bad,"It's a great job for someone who's looking for an off the desk job and is willing to carry 0-70lbs of packages into loading trucks, very productive at times."
bad,They were disfunctinal and didnt teach me how to sort the mail when I first got there. The hours were all messed up. I worked 10 hours one week. When they told me that they were under staffed
bad,"Not enough workers, they send people home before work is done so specific people are stuck staying to finishing trucks withno help. The only thing great about this company is the insurance."
bad,"I took the early morning shifts so that I could also focus on school. However, the management was extremely rude and inconsiderate as well as unprofessional. They were inconsiderate to the workers and the workflow induced on them."
bad,"It was a fairly easy job. I loaded trucks some day when we were busy and other days I would sort packages. The hardest part of the job was lift boxes over 70 pounds. I learned cities, towns and zip codes working there and that when your are constantly occupied time flies."
bad,As a loader you load 300 or more an hour.You work in 100 degree trailer. The benefits are really good but you have to work there for a year before you can get them.
bad,"En UPS lo mejor es el salario y el subsidio de alimentación; la tecnología que se maneja, el sistema operativo y la seguridad industrial."
bad,"hard work and very poor safety standards. job did not require alot of skill., only a strong back."
bad,"While working at UPS i learned what actual hard work was. They offer tuition reimbursement, which is nice. I like how the job is pretty laid-back and the management gets to know you and is there for anything you need."
bad,This is a great company to work for. They offer great compensation. Management can be very political. The tests to get in can be lengthy and difficult but worth the time.
bad,It’s good working at a part time if you need a second job. But wouldn’t recommend for anyone wanting to work as a full time employee. The workers there are friendly.
bad,"It's tough work, and you're going to lose a lot of weight, but once you get used to it, it's not bad at all. The management has all done the same job as the loaders, so they know how it is. Everyone is really easy to get along with as well. It will make you appreciate jobs with A/C."
bad,good people to work with however it just wasnt for me. i had trouble keeping up with the demand of the work and the physicality was very rough on me. i need something not so physically draining
bad,"I personally feel like they work you harder than you get paid. Once you come in at 4AM you are filling up one huge truck by yourself. And you have to fill it top to bottom , all the way from the back to the front. At times you arent being helped and you have to do it on your own. And on top of that you are doing this until 9:30 and sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming."
bad,It's a good job to have just for the work you do you don't get enough hours by the end of the week. But all in all ups showed me how to be on time and prepared to work as my first job now I take good habits in being a great employee and sales associate
bad,You have designated trucks to keep an eye on. Making sure the trucks doesn't get backed up and overflowed. You are usually put in the truck that your supervisor feels that you can handle.
bad,not all that good but the pay and the hours was good really its was an okay job overall because it always keeps u busy no mater what and i like that about a job
bad,Management Team are messed up they don't really care about employee also a lot of discrimination and racist people....
bad,"This job was like no other. For one you’d work packing 53’ trailers for five hours all to get a ten minute break. This job was a good workout but at times it could feel draining. Other than calling for another worker to go in your trailer, the manager would never be much help. The pay was somewhat fair but it was hard work."
bad,"Slide packages on a moving tray. And the machine sorts the packages, the  drops the packages in a bag then the bagger zips up the bag when it’s full and places it on a moving belt."
bad,They have too much people working there is very over crowded but it was a good company to work for and the hours at the time sucks I would of loved to have another opportunity to work here
bad,The work environment is fast pace and very heavy products and boxes. I really didn't like how hot it was in the trailer and pace was too fast for one person loading two trailers
bad,The job was ok in the beginning I was fresh out of high school and wanted a job then I seen all my friend around me with high paying jobs I had to leave an find me something pay a little bit more
bad,Supervise employees.  Training all new hires in the building.  Loading and unloading trailers.  Ensuring that all work is completed at required times and work environments remain safe.
bad,I loved there I hate i had to move ... They could gave overtime & more hours ...But besides that its a great place to work at .... I will try again if I ever get an chance to
bad,"Its a good job for benefits, good pay plus it's a easy job you work at fast pace.. Great management.. I'm a loader and I unload... but the most important thing safety for me and employees"
bad,"If you're not willing to advance within UPS by becoming a supervisor or manager, then i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. Although the pay rate isn't too bad, the lack of hours makes your paycheck a serious joke. Even though the benefits are outstanding, you have to wait a year to be eligible. The hardest part of this job is the heavy lifting which can make or break you."
bad,"My typical day at work was stressful at some points but, I enjoyed working with the co-workers and the people I got to meet out on runs. The hardest part about the job was when a house had more then one package with boxes that weighed anywhere between 50 and 70 pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job was, being out and about."
bad,it was a good place to work at and the people there helped you when you are struggling. my boss was also a good person told people when things were being done wrong. would recommend  the ups out in stead.
bad,A typical day is just trying to get everything done on time. You do not develop any skills or experience that would help you to find a career. The supervisors are laid back and fun to work for. The hardest part of the job is working in the summer in a warehouse with no air circulation.
bad,Its a good job and has good benefits its also very high paced buts its a good workout .The management is very supportive everyday I gain good people skills and a understanding of the workplace.
bad,UPS was a great experience in the field of shipping products from one point to another. The company was over 100 years old when I worked there for 19 years and 6 months. Sorry the company had experience a downsize that affected so many people over the years.
bad,"It was fun working at the hub because I took the big 70+ packages out of the 53” truck and that was my only job and I loved it it was quick paced I felt healthy and always walking I recorded every night around 27,000 steps or more"
bad,At UPS I enhanced my skills I already had as well as provided the opportunity for personal and professional growth and advancement.
bad,Yes I work for a newspaper Company that we deliver so I could do the job with no problem far as delivering to people's address different routes I work for the New York Times and the The Raleigh paper also deliver for the durhamHerald newspaper company in Durham North Carolina so I no RTP. I also know the Chatham County area to  Pittsboro and siler city nc
good,"is not fair job for everyone  "
good,They will hire you in and say ok you apply for a full time drive spot great you will automatically without a doubt be a part time employee. Oh and if they want you to scratch(finish your route ahead of time)! They only want you to so you don't take money from them by not staying out to long so they rush you. And if you don't kiss there butt they will not keep you as a employee in general you will get lay off whether your quote on quote a full time employee or a part time employee they will lay you off
good,Direction absente et ne répond pas aux réclamations des employés. Les chauffeurs sont les seuls employés considéreés
good,I worked in ups as a loader with trainer. i really had bad experience because when they gave me  contract papers it did say hub sorter but they gave me unsuitable job and there's no health and safety environment when i was scanning the packages other packages caused bruises on my arm. and also on contract papers it did say that training for six weeks but I only lasted 1 and half weeks they decided to takes out of job with false information feedback.
good,"No lunch, you would get a 10 min break but if you clocked in at midnight and there was a truck ready they would give you your 10 min break then youd work till 730 am without one"
good,No comment not a good job the hours suck and i would never go back to many ppl smoke outside and some ppl leave without saying so as for security is good
good,"Packing 50 pound boxes back to back 4 hours straight with only a 10 minute break.Also the work environment was terrible whatever temperature it is outside it is inside "
good,very long fast pased days they turn to nite up at dark home at dark no balance learned management is not managed hardest part is going back not worth the pay. sleeping on the shuttel
good,"I left this job after one month. I’m not lazy, I prefer hard work. But, having to be at work at 3:30 a.m. and gone before 6 a.m. didn’t work for life. I was spending half my paycheck on gas and the rest on whatever small amount of groceries I could afford. "
good,Not recommended for the weak or timid. Opportunities available but far in between. Benefits better than job itself. Anyone can be a supervisor there. Babies trying to instruct adults.
good,Sorted packages in the back of the truck as we needed them. Had to have organizational skills in order to have all the packages ready to go so we could get the job done in a timely manner.
good,as a seasonal hire your drivers attitude and compassion for his fellow man determines how comfortable or uncomfortable you'll be
good,When working for the UPS speed is a top priority as well as safety.I learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis management is quick on responding to any questions or problems.The coworkers are friendly there is no hard part on the job.
good,"the job was an exprience.   I learned quite a bit about U.P.S"
good,"I worked for UPS for 8 months and I loved going to work for the first couple of months. A typical day consisted of maybe a 800+ boxes that you either have to load or unload. Co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow of the boxes. The most enjoyable part was the break, which was only 10 minutes long."
good,Work was pretty much all over the place and no organization but it's a job when you really need it.
good,"I worked as a package handler for ups. There were long days and short days. I liked going in early and getting out early. The pay was decent, the job it self is not what i want to be doing as far as a long career"
good,"No oversight or verification,  these people cared less about whether you would steal their boxes than they did about the boxes just being gone, out of sight and mind."
good,Not enough Hours for me to make a living. I wasted more gas then making money. The culture was ok and the managers were also able to work with me but like I stated not enough hours.
good,"Not enough pay for the workload I do!  Management doesn't see what goes on in the office, nor do they care!  Benefits are good, vacation time is fair."
good,"Fast-paced. Was a good work environment at one point, but new management is clueless and expects us to do our job (unload), their job (a load), and then jump over and pre-load after we just finished unloading. So... essentially we do everything at the plant, yet receive no recognition or appreciation. New management is horrible. Proceed with caution!!!"
good,"If you enjoy working with immature 20 somethings go for it. Backstabbing culture, Managers only like bum lickers, Whipping culture, limited training. Stay clear."
good,"Working for a franchise store is hard. They definitely all have their own way of running a business no matter what. It isn't a company that could promise too much to you because of ""restrictions"" within the franchise itself. At most locations, they only offer part time; so its definitely something temporary if you're looking into it."
good,"The position was not what it was billed as. I was hire, in what I thought, as an associate/printer (emphasize printer). The owner meant well but put to much demand and pressure on associates to upsale (sale beyond what the customer needs/wants). I met some great friends there, that I will cherish."
good,"the manager and owner of the branch i worked with really did not care about their employees they only care about was money, in ocassion the owner bought food but just that we continued working with no break, they are very hateful people most of the time, but of course it was just the branch i worked in i cant speak for other stores."
good,I was a seasonal package handler promised a potential full-time career as a drivers helper or a fully certified driver based on my performance except they never actually followed through. All they did was make the excuse that they over-hired and exhausted resources with the seasonal helpers.
good,"This job is mainly based for desporite people who seek jobs in my opinion "
good,"Very hard labor, minimum hours for minimum pay, no employee appreciation, punishment for minor mistakes, needs multiple years of employment for any job position advancement."
good,this was a wonderful experience of work challenges for the time I was employed there. Good organized supervision on staff and a pleasant work environment.
good,"It was a fairly easy laid back job that i enjoyed, the owners of my particular UPS store however made working there very difficult. Things were constantly in a state of disrepair an it took the better part of forever to get anything fixed or to get any new supplies. They punished you harshly and without warning, the manager had little to no power."
good,Be ready to work eat good get good rest and be prepared to work in the middle of the night it's best not to be so social to avoid rude management you will get plenty exercise
good,"Typical day was clock in at 8. Get on the road by 8:30, 100 plus drop offs per day and an average of 40 plus pick ups per day.  It was a very tough job on me."
good,Didnt enjoy my experience here only worked seasonal but i probly wont ever go back they constantly had my pay rate incorrect and cut my hours alot all around unprofessiinal people
good,"It was just a seasonal job for one year. UPS found time for me to work when it was beneficial for both me and the driver, they also took location into account. I learned how to use the DIAD and where to place packages at residential homes. This job consisted of a lot of moving quickly and good people skills."
good,"Enjoy the first 10 year of service, work very hard and got  the return also but from last five year thinking that there is no carrier in ups now. Thinking to move from ups"
good,"overall I love that the store is a franchise. and the customers are great people. "
good,my nite is very routine aircraft come in we unload  then up load. all have to be done in a timely manner.  have to oversee 15+ works.
good,"good for people with out a family , no advancement, low possibility of pay increase, no benefits"
good,"Haven't had good experience to work with the branch in Meadowvale town center. Boring place, less money and desi taunts."
good,the only thing i love bout ups freight is the pay other then that the management was really bad
good,"Was told if I could make $10,000 sales I would be compensate a rewarding bonus plus a $2.00 raised but instead I only got 0.50 cent raised and no bonus. Also was told if customer give us tip we could keep but instead the manager said we were stealing from cash register even though by the end of the night the cash register was balanced. And break were short only 30mins lunch breaks."
good,it was ok had a great time riding with the driver delivering packages to customers homes 
good,Very difficult location to get to work. Many routes are jammed at the expecated time of arrival.
good,muchas dificultades para poder saber los horarios de el transporte y en dado caso contesnta rh que llegue como pueda.
good,Management was terrible. When you first start out you can’t bring your phone into the facility. Pay is horrible. If you don’t have your badge to get in the building they make you wait outside until the manger comes and get you
good,Peers are ok as far as the non discriminative ones which is not the majority. Controlled by white males in the Union. Looking for a certain look and they do not appreciate hard work.
good,Unfriendly unsupportive very mucch all about profits. Managers consistently under value you yet will take the praise right in front or behand your back
good,Work you like a slave. Then had the nerve to cut our bonus money without raising the pay because the stupid unions couldnt come to an agreement for the longest! Which is why I left. But I'll admit if you're a good worker it MIGHT pay off. Because after only 3 months of work they picked me as a candidate to become supervisor which pays wayyyyy more. But because of the pay cut i left before becoming supervisor.
good,Not the Worse Job. Needs Improvement in some Areas. Overall Decent for the Ideal Candidate. For the Individuals that are Adaptive and Patient the Job will be more fulfilling for you. Its a good workout for the amount of time you work plus the amount of weight and the consistency altogether makes out for a decent work out routine. By the time you realize it you done lost weight and gained strength
good,"No managing good and people will come in when they wanted to is day that would be there for 15 hours because nobody showed up at work We’re never allowed to do 40,hours"
good,"its a job, pay is pretty poor, be prepared to put in a graft, the job is nothing special no route to progress unless you are in the very small clique (which you wont be)."
good,It would be much wiser to actually be an part time to full time employee as oppose to seasonal work.  Pretty much they work you like an official associate at a much cheaper rate
good,Hay mucha injusticia y discriminación sin oportunidad de crecimiento .
good,"Under the right management, this place was great. That management got changed and everything was different, not for the better. I enjoyed my time here until that happened, then I got out as quick as I could. I hope things change for the better."
good,"Even though the driver training was rushed, I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with UPS. "
good,I have an extremely strong work ethic. Can motivate others for common objectives. Work well with others and always sees job to completion. I believe I would be an asset to your company.
good,If u can't load a million  boxes a shift don't go there they only have four hour shifts n I was working double shifts every day just to make a full check
good,I do not have an opinion for or against UPS. The opportunity to have a job was enough for me at the time. I appreciate the opportunity to get back on my feet and earn a paycheck.
good,"Good people to work for, team environment but a lack of respect for security and the equipment security needs to do their job properly. Human Resources need to have better communication with security as well in order to create a safer environment for everyone. I also believe UPS needs more lighting for the trucks that comes in at night, they had problems weekly, turning into the employee parking lot and causing other issues. The employee gate was too small and wasn’t insulated well at all but I believe they rebuilt and have a new employee gate that provides the stability and comfort they need. The mixture of youth and leadership among the employees that have been there for years create an exciting work environment and helps time go fast because everyone is working hard for one goal. It’s a great opportunity for anyone who wants to work hard, get paid weekly and they also have a seasonal hiring period around the holidays, so if you need an extra part time job before Xmas, UPS is an ideal company to work for. I also met a lot of good people, that’s what kept me going, I took my job very seriously and gave everyone the respect they deserved."
good,"Just wasn't for me don't feel your appreciate as well as respected. You work your tail off just to be told hurry up. you only get 10 min break in a 5 to 6 hour shift. That's just someone taking advantage of the laws by doing that. pay is lousy for that kind of work. Take care of the little people, that's not whats happening there."
good,You don’t have to deal with many people but it’s very hot and the work doesn’t add up to the pay. I work very hard yet cannot do anything throughout the week or I’ll be broke. It’s no overtime either
good,"Long days, always moving, on your feet. Packing and shipping skills are a must. Must have great verbal and written skills. Great knowledge of Computers and helping customers with phone, fax and emails."
good,They work you like a Dog and you try to do everything so you get hired on full time. But they tell you that you did a great job and they wish they had more opening to hire you but let you go anyway.
good,"All I can really say is that the pay was decent, and the fact that they let me have overtime was a bonus. Though it is quick paced a little stressful and tiring."
good,"I worked at the UPS STore for about 18 months. Since it was a small business there was no guarantee off hours or a set schedule, and also because it was franchise owned, the owner did not have to provide insurance or any benefits at all. No paid vaction, no health or dental insurance, no set schedule, no guarantee of hours. If you are looking for a place to work, I recommend you keep looking"
good,"A steady pace store with Packing, shipping, printing, binding, faxing, etc.. the hardest part is living pay check to pay check. Also filling in this request as it won't go away."
good,"Good place to work if your full time. If your part time you are on call basis and can be put to work at any time.You never know when you will be called and you can,t judge your day as to sleep time and so on. If you refuse work to many times do to you been up since 5 am and called at 3 pm and do the run safe they let you go"
good,I was not there long. Was just a holiday temp. I do know that they refuse to work with you if anything happens during the holidays. Even outside of the holidays they refuse to work with your schedule if things come up.
good,"UPS is a great place to work.  So long as you stay social with your coworker outside of work, and always attend the union meetings, you should get plenty of hours, and possibly even a promotion."
good,Company has changed and it is not as competitive. Human Resource Department is not organized and it is hard to get an answer when trying to advance within the company.
good,"Eran 10 horas laboradas y una hora de comida, 6 días a la semana, sueldo bajo (las horas no cuadraban con él sueldo)."
good,You are expected to do the job of several people for a low salary without proper training. Your management team is not able to support with most tasks of your job as they do not know how and barely understand their job due to lack of training. Not proactive and preventative.
good,This job isn't really what it says it is. When u first start off they put u in these hot as trucks then expect u to build boxes all the way to the top even when there is just a little space at the top. U get paid every Friday and some of the managers will cuss at you because there's a avalanche of boxes coming in the truck and your not able to stack them up fast enough. Then u have to stay there a whole year just to get benefits for yourself then another 4-6months just for your family to be added on.
good,Management was implemented by franchisees. Sometimes the management was inconsistent with constant changes which made it difficult to follow the rules that were set since they changed so frequently. Work place was friendly and at times fun.
good,"UPS is great as long as you have no life, no illness, and no family that may need you  If you get sick, you better show up with fever, contagious, whatever!  No understanding, no help, ready to get rid of you any second!  Co-workers are nice, management, not so much. Very physical job requiring you to lift 75 lbs.  "
good,Takes long to go full time.Management is a headache;would rather be getting full time hours with pay set for people who have been working for more than 5 years.
good,"Work-Life Balance is terrible. Culture is militant. Management doesn't rely on it's team member to assist with decision making, the number make the the decisions."
good,"The environment of working there wasn't much exciting. Everyone is much in a ""robot"" mode that takes the life of the building."
good,"I was a part time and on call sales representative. I learned to process in and out going packages. Handled cash register and balanced drawer at the end of the shift. Stocked up inventory supplies and  janitorial duties. Greeted customers and answered phone calls. Assisted all customers needs using the fax machine, copy machine, passport picture, and laminating. It was a fast pace store and fun to work at with a great stuff."
good,"Sorting packages while checking for damage, move sorted bins of parcels to staging area. Co-workers was helpful and pleasant. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with staging when management change the format."
good,"UPS is not a job for people with medical or physical problems and they always hire people with those types of problems . I usually am at the mall delivering , it can get confusing with where to go to get to certain stores and using the DIAD for signatures , Coworkers are outgoing and caring ."
good,I worked with driver to deliver packages to the customers. I liked seeing the customers face when they are happy to get their packages. I really enjoyed being able to work with UPS. It is a great experience.
good,"Overall bad environment, not family friendly "
good,"I had a great experience dealing with the general manager, i was the manager at the store before me there were also other manager that resigned. One a week the owner would call me and tell me that he was going to fire me and that there were 4 candidates that were more qualified. He didnt respect my decisions with my workers. When i resigned was because he told me that after being there for 4 months he wasn't going to send me to my training because probably I was going to get fired."
good,"Unloading merchandise , learning how to use different machinery management was organized , coworkers were fun and friendly , the hardest part was working alone with heavy loads, most enjoyable part of the job was the enviornment."
good,you meet new people the drivers are cool the work is good for permit positions i only did the seasonal part so it was a bit hectic overworked and under paid for a billion $ company its not pretty fair ..they mess up your check every week its only 59 days of work there ofice is not very perfectional they let you know pretty much that your disposible and that they will get rid of you its nice if your in high school only like that you dont take anything personal
good,the work environment is very poor the pay was not enough to cover my cost of living at the time of employment  they did not allow employees to call out in the event of a family emergency or gave the employee a very hard time before allowing them to leave there was a lot of favoritism with in the management team
good,The company is world wide and most of the employees are long time employed. The company has many delivery trucks in its inventory.
good,"I was a package handler, loading packages into a truck in cold and sever heat weather. It was a very physical job which i was used too just wished they had full time positions other than you becoming a supervisor to receive full time pay."
good,A good company to get a start with but working at a UPS Store unless you are an owner is another dead end job. Worked well with my schedule but management was lacking.
good,"Hired on a seasonal basis. Out of 70 people trained only 8 people were going to be hired, for I was one of the 8. I pre-loaded trucks so I learned the basics with reading  labels and organizing them numerically on the correct truck.  My co-workers were very helpful with showing me tricks on loading the trucks faster. Making sure correct packages went on the right truck in a certain time frame was the hardest part of the job.  After peek season was through I was told that my hours were going to decline. My schedule changed from working every day to being an on call. I was on night shift so if I was called in, it was an hour before a shift (3:30 am) and I was called at most, two times a week.  I worked roughly 8 hours a week."
good,"very productive business using assembly line method"
good,"A typical day at work for me was cash handling, store management, shipping, mail box accounts, and packaging."
good,Clean place to work. Great people to work with. but the pay wasn't that much and not enough hours.
good,In the warehouse the female / male population that was approx. 2 females for every 100 males.  Sexual harassment was rampant and management constantly overlooked it and made it unbearable to work there any longer.
good,"Order pulling, Production logs, stocking and clean environment"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that u feel like your serving your community
good,Delivery packages to businesses/residences. How to work fast and be thorough. Drivers were helpful and learned how to be more
good,Great PT job if you don't mind the wait on a phone call that's sends you to the next town for work or never comes...students
good,"they work you extreamly hard work, but it is hard to advance in the company."
good,The call center atmosphere is always there. You can guarantee your self a job to keep all you need to do is show up everyday. They really do appreciate people who come to work and provide upmost customer service and being able to perform job duties.
good,"Branch management does not listen to the employee. Its their way or no way, their way is the only and best way. If you have a mind of your own and think for yourself, you will be singled out and put on the Dispatch do not work list."
good,"Bcp trop loin du domicile, horaire de travail me correspond pas, 30 min de pause, fini trop tard le travail (21h30-22h30)"
good,Çok büyük bir organizasyon olmasına rağmen UPS Türkiye maalesef çok kötü durumda. Maaş ve yan haklar oldukça iyi. Ancak suyunu da çıkarıyorlar. Benim işim bu değil diye birşey yok. Her işi yapacaksın. Ve yarın acaba kovulur muyum diye sormadan uyuyamayacaksın.
good,"If you can put up with all of the hassle, then I would recommend it. The Company itself is a good company, But the management at the Houston Terminal has a lot of growing up to do,A lot of favoritism at that terminal."
good,treated unfairly they were going around the benefits and some were very unprofessional no proper training is in place and the everyday job tools are limited.
good,"UPS-GREAT COMPANY however, the"
good,"When I was there innovation was dependent on who you were or what you looked like. It was a stagnant, oppressive atmosphere which did not value the talents or skills of women of color."
good,Bon job bon salaire travail un peu dur surtout au niveau de certain colis pas de limites de poids sale ambiance  a cause des responsables
good,"This is a very difficult place to work for those without a hard shell, and a big heart. You have to be able to learn quickly and be flexible to the learning process cause it changes daily....literally."
good,There was no time for lunch i always had to be watching for packages. Worst management ever i didnt get a whole of assistance or accommodations. The employees were wonderful and helpful but upper management was not up to par like they said it was.
good,Decent place to work long hours and very little work life balance.  Met a lot of great people who I remained friends with through out the years lots of opportunities for some.
good,Ups was a great experience definitely a place to work if you want to network. You never know who might walk through the door that can change your career just within a conversation.
good,Co workers are very rude and entitled. Supervisors only care about getting freight moved not the safety or well being of employees. Supervisors have threatened my position because i wasn't feeling well on a busy day.
good,"there is not a place for personal items, "
good,not a good place to work. staff rude no proper training is really given blames employees. new management has shot the place down. Great co workers but to little pay for all the hard labor
good,Position was temporary seasonal. I worked with different drivers each day. Most were really great to work with but some had very bad attitudes and deterred me from working at the job.
good,"low level employees and management are constantly under stress from the top, you have to meet a certain number of packages per minute, and ensure your employees follow this protocal and many other sometimes unnecessary protocals. Huge levels of stress for lower management as the building is very reliant on your employees getting the packages in the container on time, and them removing and replacing the containers, and loading them onto planes and trailers, and tracking hazardous material."
good,"There's always something to do, but the division of responsibility is not always clear and management is not good at assigning clearly defined roles for people."
good,Not the company it used to be.  Choose your department wisely.  Eliminating high paying experience for lower paying inexperience.  This will cause less tendered employees that don't have the leadership skills to develop the company's next leaders.
good,This is a place where you work for a company that pays enough to survive but it’s not a long term job unless you can work your way up the ladder to a position that pays a lot more.
good,"A lot of Lifting ,Loading Trucks ,Sortation Of small and large packaging ,Unloading trucks,labor, Warehouse. five to fifteen minute breaks one half hour lunch Little or no room for growth or promotion"
good,"I didn't work for UPS, I worked for The UPS Store. The work load is easy but often feel as though we should have benefits or be paid more for the hard work we put in."
good,Worked as a Part-Time Supervisor for 4 Years while I was obtaining my degree. I always put UPS first but the company didn't seem to appreciate it when it mattered.
good,"typical day includes packing and shipping a variety of items. notarizing documents, helping customers with computer issues and shipping problems. filing lost or damaged package claims."
good,Société mal organise quand jy était salaire dérisoire heure supplémentaire non payer et rien en compensation
good,"The company culture is stressed, overworked and under managed. There is a gaping hole in communication and training new associates. The implementation into the company is a joke."
good,I enjoyed my job very much poor management and a rude supervisor made the job a nightmare. It took away from the enjoyment of going to work each morning and the fact we never had scheduled breaks they always changed. They also changed our work hours daily so we never knew what time we were getting off or coming in the next day until the end of the shift each day.
good,"Job itself was great and compensation was great.  Computer design skills gained, along with large blue print formatting.  Biases caused some not to receive hours for no reason but to make them quit.  Extreme favoritism shown.  The negative atmosphere made it unbearable to withstand regardless of compensation."
good,"Worked there for almost a year and had to relocate due to uncertain circumstances, very good job but very hard, and a big lack in structure higher up in the command."
good,"The work environment was hostile and we were constantly held to a seemingly impossible standard on a daily basis that was not  up to you whether or not you could upheld. Days where you upheld the standard, were essentially lucky days as the next day you may not be so lucky."
good,UPS as a company is a great company. Just the freight side of the business seems like the redheaded step child of the corporation. the freight side of the business is running still on 1990 software and paper. time for them to invest into the freight operations or let it continue to fail and fail the customers or just stick with parcel services.
good,"ups works there employees like slaves and you don't make nothing at all you make like 180 a week a day at ups is about 200,000 packages and non stop working supervisors don't pay attention they sleep"
good,"Job productivity didn't really had no value. Job management was not really providing help our new information for work management; our productivity. Work hours were not enough in pay,"
good,I worked here just between jobs because it would work with my schedule for my kids. I didn't like it but I didn't hate it either. The pay was low but the job was pretty cool.
good,Was hired as seasonal driver. I felt the training could have been a lot better. I never really learned how to use the handheld computer properly and that reflected poorley on management view of my worth as an employee. This company has high stress and pressure. Most of the drivers hate there jobs.
good,If being overworked and underpaid is your thing this is the place for you. I worked 65-75 hours a week for over 3 months before I had enough and left. Twelve hour days six days a week with the mandatory overtime. I kept telling many managers that I couldn't keep working that many hours and they said ok come in Saturday for twelve hours of mandatory overtime. The upper management doesn't care about employees just performance numbers. After six months and a great performance evaluation I got a eighteen cent raise. It just wasn't worth it anymore.
good,"It’s a stressful environment, long hours are required. Everyone is spread thin as possible. People falling out from stress. Invisible to family November-January."
good,"Currently a part time supervisor who is not allowed to work over 35 hours to avoid the company from paying me over time; they will have you not work on a day to save money. Salary is roughly 22,000...I was paid the same in the military but had 30 days of paid vacation a year. (I need a second job). We only get 7, or are told 7, but the books say otherwise.The salary pays off when you become a full time supervisor at $65k, but then your work life balance in non-existent. Full timers work about 14+ a day."
good,"This company had recently been purchased by UPSCS. It has a family atmosphere at first, but began to feel corporate as time went on. Wonderful opportunities to learn about the industry."
good,"Great company to work for but benefits, pay and management team is not that great."
good,If hou misplace one box then it will be sent back. So you have to remeber where things so. And you have to come ready to work everyday. Keep your mind clear it can be stressful but youll get the hang of it.
good,Management in Middle East is not empowered due to the partnership control in Middle East. Partner in Middle East at the time of my employment dictated the structural changes and employment terminations without any proper reasoning there by over riding any decisions made by the global management based out of US. I was hired by the global management based out of US.
good,the job required staying in a freight trailer and stacking packages. there was not much else to the job other than keeping up with the flow of incoming cargo.
good,Ups supervisors are the worst I have encountered in my entire life.  They promoted two supervisors their second weeks with the company and with no experience.  They had no supervisor experience and no work knowledge.  This let to unorganized and chaotic work environment.
good,Supervisors will belittle you in front of other employees. The work can be heavy at times and no one will come to assist until you can't not walk anywhere and then get blamed for stacking out.
good,"I would only recommend this company if you are considering a career in driving. However if you are considering being a sorter I don't recommend anyone that may have health problems. The work conditions exposes you to the toxic fumes from vehicles in the building, as well as causing a physical toll on your body lifting heavy packages on a nightly basis."
good,"The job was fast paced, there was a lot of work involved, however transportation was a challenge that late at night. pay could have been better- heard amazon has better work culture and environment where everyone is valued."
good,Busy and fast pace. Everyone gossips and lies. managers are always walking around and more then happy to help you. in the hub they have weekly free food and drinks. and bring basketball goal in there
good,"It is not a bad company to work for. The daily customer interaction is great and you are always on your toes. Everyday is different and new challenges range from shipping oddly shaped items to having to help a customer with a last minute print job that you finish at 2 am the night before it needs to get done. It is a good place for someone to start off working at if you've never been employed before because you are responsible for tons of different services from packing, shipping, customer service, printing, faxing, notarizing, freighting, and of course cross selling and upselling. It is always fun for me to work on new print projects and designs, but the worst part is how you don't get paid well or get any sort of benefits. You get a little too overworked and overwhelmed especially during Christmas peak season. Each store is franchise owned as well, so the managers/owners are a little cheap when it comes to handing out benefits, good hours, and good pay. It is a good stepping stone job, but not really good for someone permanently unless you become a franchise owner in my opinion..."
good,"Very hard work, bad working conditions 100 degree / 20 degree trailers, most of the time when asking for help was told tough luck just do it your self, and the the supervisor walked a away."
good,"Old school processes, reluctant to change management, no room for growth, a bunch of old people, mistreatment of lower level employees, would not recommend for millennials"
good,Physically difficult job with minor compensation. Potential through seniority and unionized workforce to change jobs withing company. Many employees require second job to make living wage.
good,I wanted to work full time although their policy is to only work some of their employees only part time.  Therefore it was costing me money to go to work.
good,"A typical work day with ups would be. Meet my driver at a parking lot, that is close to him. Straight to delivering packages when done get dropped off an sent home"
good,They said you will work 3 1/2 to 4 hours a day that's a  lie they kick the new people out fast and quick.They ask do you want to leave early...Do you want the night off what what happen to the 5 days a week nothing but lies....
good,"It was a tough environment to work in, few discriminations and managers/supervisors always on your case. Learning experience was good but working there was not likable. "
good,"Working as a Package Handler is part time, fast paced, heavy work, and you get paid very little. You wont have the benefits right away, you will only get them once you complete a year with the company, so if you injured yourself you won't be covered. It will take a long time to move up as a driver, they are really strict about Seniority. If you want to transfer to another department it would have to be ONLY for school, if you haven't been with the company for a year you will lose your job and you would have to reapply again. I can go on and on about the place but the only thing that it is good about this company are the benefits. if you want to go to school and you want to get Tuition/ Reimbursement you would have to be a Part-Time Supervisor."
good,"I learned a lot there. The work allowed me to push myself to the limits of what I could accomplish in one shift. Typical work day was on average 10 hours or more. The people were friendly, for the most part, and kept up high spirits in a very stressful environment. They were probably the most enjoyable part of the job. However, on the eve of being hired permanently I was let go at the end of my contract instead. This happened because of an occurrence entirely outside of my control. So they are fickle and they do let people go very easily and without much consideration to all factors. The saying ""to throw the baby out with the bath water"" would describe the behavior quite well. I saw this knee jerk management style  time and again so when it happened to me, I was not surprised."
good,You may have heard that UPS is a great company to work for...and it is...if you are on the brown side of it. This is a Supply Chain Solution so pay is much less than expected but the work load is the same if not more.
good,Ups is a company that provides total customer satisfaction.Hours are long and hard.Pay is competitive with benefits that are also competitive.coworkers worked as a team to ensure satisfaction.Hardest and most challenging part of job is the weather conditions.What I enjoyed the most is the daily face to face interaction with the customers.
good,I love how i got the experience but i did not like how unprofessional this company was. They weren't ware of starting times and messed up on pay checks. They also told a couple lies about advancements.
good,"A hard working job, the requires you to work at a fast. Mangers were not helpful at all, they would not take the time to listen or help you out in a working situations."
good,The job was okay until I realized I was being taken advantage of by my Co workers because I was new. I'm a hard worker and they took advantage of that and they weren't very understanding when it came to my personal life
good,Great job to obtain after college to gain accounting experience. Management is willing to work with you if you want a work  life balance. There is plenty of overtime.
good,I learned the management does not really care about hard working people. Co-workers were rude. The physical aspect of the job was the hardest.The money was good.
good,"UPS is a good place to work if there is no more job opportunity available at the moment. Very hard labor, with low amount of work hours and management is very rude too"
good,But since you require it: the managers were okay but sometimes the chiefs would outnumber the Indians so to speak which would lead to one boss telling you to do one thing and another telling you a different way. Very difficult time of my life. The hardest part was trying to figure out who the boss was and the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for if you are a single person an do not wish to have a life outside of work. UPS is a company that likes for all its employees to live and breathe ""Brown"". The stress level that comes with this company is not for people with weak skin. You have to be tough and able to handle a ton of pressure and stress and able to work at an extremely face pace from punch till punch out."
good,"nothing to say about this job  it was ok to work there there could have been more hours "
good,"At UPS, each day would be different depending on how fast or slow  the work flow was. "
good,"basic warehouse job, plenty of work very busy keeps you moving"
good,"Met with clients, and designed business cards, posters, and flyers. I learned how to process domestic and international shipments. Basic office skills were needed as well. They included copying, printing, and faxing."
good,"UPS offers great benefit packages. Great room for advancement and average compensation packages,"
good,Horrible hours that interferes with your health mentally and physically
good,"Eine Erfahrung Wert aber schlecht bezahlt, da Beitritt durch Zeitarbeitsfirma."
good,"Great part-time job.  Learned to communicate with business customers. "
good,"when  you think of a job, you think of an opptournity,  a chance  to  keep money i  your pocket  while you achieve your goals in life. but a job at Target  is  not  the one  for you, with a  bi-weekly pay, no union, and no chance for real advancements. i actually got written up for getting more hours,  cant believe that.  its simple  i they like you you get perks,  if  not   they fire you, thers  no job security at all."
good,*A typical work day was to get to work on time and start receiving phone calls
good,"I work Monday-Friday 12pm to 5:15pm. I answer the phone, help the customers trackin package, and locate a way for the customer to get the package. I coordinate pickups and drop offs of packages. I also coordinate vacations and time off with six different employees."
good,This place is soooo FAR behind the times! The people that hold management positions are the same ones that worked on the line (loading/unloading). They took the brow beatings for years and the one's beating them promote them...WHY? Not merit-based (that's for sure)! This is a dying brand (similar to Best Buy/Circuit City)...The drivers make more than their supervisors...How can the morale be good for management (which reflects in how they treat their hourly employees)?
good,"On a typical day I handled 400- 500 packages by myself as a handler. After I would finish one trailer, I would immediately start on the next. The number of trucks I would load a day varies, seeing as how so did volume. There were 10 minute breaks, you worked for about 3 more hours, then you were done for the night. Start up the same routine 3 pm the next day."
good,the job was stressful. the work was extremely hard with little safety standards in place
good,I was only here for seasonal work. I had damaged my rotator cuff while loading city trucks. I will not go to work here again.
good,"If you are packing the truck with boxes, it's not a very great job. They demand that you do 500 boxes an hour. Very difficult to do, especially in the heat. If you can't keep up--you're FIRED. See ya."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in at 3pm, since season is over, The most customers I get now till 6pm is atleast 5 paying customers. There really isn't anything enjoyable about my job. my boss sits in the back and I am the only one in the front. The Employees there arent really sociable but I learned a lot from working there for about 2 1/2 years. I learned a whole lot. I am very confident that I can get a better job and expand my work knowledge."
good,"Dispatching loads, multi tasking, time management. Ive learned to work unsupervised and in a team environment. The hardest part of my job is managing my time and knowing each customer individually and the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at the end of the day the customer was happy with my service."
good,"this job had some good people, the work wasn't hard, but the hours were very long."
good,i hated working 3 am until 7 am with constant lifting small and large boxes and a rapid speed.
good,"it a ok place to work does not pay that great , and it union. also most people are nice , the hours can be different from day to day sometimes."
good,"Very intense with a fast pace. Have to be aware of all safety and compliance regulations. Work one on one within your own work group to minimize safety infractions, service, and cost reductions."
good,Wish I had more time to show them that I could of been an asset to them. Driver kept me longer than I was allowed so that’s probably why I didn’t get it
good,"Long meetings."
good,I worked there for eight years for different operations I was treated like a dog I was sexually harassed by a manager nothing was ever done by HR I want a few more years work my way into another operation and then their operations management bullied and belittled my life outside of work and made me come to a point of quitting I would not Recommend anybody working
good,Not a very good place to work. The management tries to get you fired every chance they get. I was followed in my big rig for over a week so they could find some things to write me up on. No one is perfect. But it took a week for them to find something and they would not give up until they did. Management is relentless when they don’t like you and want you gone.
good,"Management is go go goso it's stressful in that sense when your around them and first start after that it's easy money especially if you have a van station wagon SUV or truck or u just know the area like the back of your hand, technology goes down at times so be ready with paper and pen and to enter your work twice, it's good money but it sucks at first untill you get a hang of it oit.once"
good,I was a seasonal person and the management was not helpful and rather neglectful in all areas. I had to go to HR almost every week to make sure I got my paycheck the manager wouldn’t help me. Eventually they gave me another manager and he did help me somewhat. The main prob was getting paid. There was no system in place to fix this accept HR they really helped me. The position was straight forward and easy to achieve  and work.
good,Made it out to seem like you get $12 an hour after training but they lie. Management never wants to give you that $12 and finds any excuse not to even if you are a good worker. However they would give $15 an hour to part time employee they dont want to loose yet dont care for employees who work many hours. Management takes advantage of little people. Know what you deserve & dont let management walk over you if you decide to work at the ups store.
good,Management and promotions are a popularity contest. The more people you know no matter how much experience they have. If you feel harassed by you management and you are not in the union it doesn’t matter.
good,UPS was an extremely fast pace job. An average workday was always busy. My organizational skills were improved a drastic amount after my experience here.
good,"Just hard overall, very fast paced work environment, Not a long break at all only 10 minutes, managers always on your back even if your doing what your supposed to do. Not a good pay at all for this type of labor work."
good,Thought I would move up and make good money here. This job is very competitive and moving up is hit or miss. They will work you hard and if you can’t perform your fired.
good,"It was a sometimes hectic environment where there is always something that needs to be done and, there is always something different to explore at UPS"
good,"I had a great experience with UPS, leading up to the end of peak season, i have a kid and was ok with the weekly pay, until i looked closer at my stubs and realized that the “$200 bonus” was fake! One pay period i got paid 182 and i was there everyday, that led to me resigning and never coming back!)"
good,"Good people there all the way around, the pay is not enough for a part time Dockworker, other similar places are paying way more. Dock operation is a little unorganized and there Is no program to move you up into a better position. However good place to work if you already have a job and doing this job for extra money,  they will work with you. If your looking for a dock to driver program they don't have one."
good,"a typical labor warehouse working environment "
good,"My job is threatened daily, the full time supervisor calls me useless when Im not even in his department and I get blamed for things that I was never a part of."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y con un horario muy flexible.
good,Did not pay well for the work that was required of you. There was little time for a break and was difficult to pick up hours. There was also no future for me there.
good,"Working at UPS business office is like working for a company office from 1960.  The management style and office practices are sorely out dated.   Work life balance is claimed to be highly regarded, understood, and supported; but the reality is much much different.  "
good,I was a loader at UPS. Teamwork is very important. The Heat can be a issue if dehydrated. I like meeting and working with new people. The management could be a lot better.
good,"No work life balance, eats there own no second chances. Long days you have to do more with less sets ridiculous goals. Management employees pay for health benefits hourly employees do not."
good,I started working here over their busy Christmas season. My issue was after running up driveways all day I developed severe pain in my chins and calfs. To the point I went to the ER.
good,"The workload is stressful and overwhelming. No benefits such paid vacation, health benefits, and  no paid time off accrued. Management did not lead by example on team player qualities."
good,With working in The Ups Hub was a job ill never forgot. I worked up many sweats which i don't like doing at all. I got everything done within a timely fashion.
good,The person I drove with was great but the office dose not keep contact and will not return messages. I had to call their cooperate to receive pay when the office and HR would not return calls or messages for a full day of work I couldn't get paid for.
good,The management lies about positions to get you to work harder for what? Nothing but back breaking pain at the end of the night. Fedex pays more per hour
good,"great place to work , but the Union is lacking in protecting the rights of its drivers and whenever they can screw over the driver they will screw the over."
good,"I loved the job itself, but ended up at a toxic location. I was a graphic designer for a UPS who was privately owned and it was difficult to work with. The manager would take tons of orders and then shove them all at me. I would always somehow get them done on time, but with the stress it caused, it was barely worth the pay. He would put customers who came in last in front of ones who were there first because he knew them personally. I also feel that this rushed and ""put my friends first"" mindset hindered my work ability. For example, asking an artist to finish a 1 week job in a day really cuts the quality of what you get."
good,"UPS was interesting. They spend 4 weeks getting you uniforms, showing you around the plant. 1 week teaching you how to drive. They never want you to go in reverse, but they spen three out of five days on it. They send you out with little training"
good,"Daily staffed helpers by calling them directly and entering them into a system that assigned the helper to a specific driver, Responsible for reviewing helper hours for accurate recording of time and assignments, Communicated and interacted with Management and Human Resources regarding helper performance, Distributed a tracking device to track the driver and the helper."
good,"Unstable hours weekly "
good,"No training...learn as you go"
good,I worked part time but there would be a long wait if I wanted to move up in the company for a part-time  employee you were looking at a couple of years to move up I felt like they used there part-time employees and they knew that they would quit before moving up
good,"Preach safety & communication. Nobody ever knows what's going on minus well-seasoned employees. All supervisors have walkie-talkies&cellphones& never use them.Anyone can be a supervisor after one year of employment. Supervisors should have:"
good,I was supposed to start early November but recruiters messed up. They made promises of bonuses. My paperwork was held up for two weeks and they made me reapply.
good,"I did not enjoy my time at ups.  The management team is very tight-lipped about your job status and often critical of their drivers.  "
good,I found my safe haven at UPS while I worked with workers who found me a pleasure to work with. Handled myself well and didn't face much opposition from other workers.
good,"They expect you to work so hard for them and show up every day to receive a 95.00 bonus every week. Not enough people working in your area so you will be constantly yelled at if your area gets backed up. "
good,"Good company to work for. Need to improve on work lofe balance and treatment of management employees. Management employees should be compensated just as well as union employees, salary and benefits."
good,Was a good job like the experience wanted to stay but life caugh me a bad time due to the deaths in my family i had to move with others that were sick. I like the everyday loading then i got the raise to a better job.
good,I have mixed reviews about UPS. You must have thick skin to work at UPS. UPS could be a fun great place to work at but some people can make it hard for you. So you must be prepared to take the gold with the bad and remain confident.
good,The workplace culture was very cut throat as if management and employees were in a war against each other. The management structure gave little guidance and little communication. The rules of engagement changed daily to cater to certain employees. There were no consequences for bad behavior. Good employees left in drones due to the inability of management to lead.
good,"They always tried to cut corners and doc hours whenever they could, giving 1+ hour for 8 hour shifts. Only person who didn’t close was opener. They sucked. Would think you’re faking sick even with a proven doctors note."
good,The hours were miserable. The management team put the production rate above all else - including the feelings and contentment of the preload team. I never understood why the company did not hire more team members to compensate for the work loads.
good,Hardest part of the job was managing to pull trough when the facility was short staffed and everyone is frustrated after peak season. You cannot be afraid to get your hands dirty as you will need to to properly show your workers how to do things or the speed or pace tp move on for the day. Most enjoyable was the different types of people you get the opportunity to network and work with. The workplace is really upbeat as it was overnight and you need everyone filled with energy optimistic for the days load. Management was just as hardworking as the employees because a lot of the times operations had to fill in for being short staffed.
good,Overworked and underpaid. It wasnt work life balance because they didnt give enough hours for you to make at least a decent living. Horrible management and they need to hire people that actually wants to help. Not just be bossy all the time.
good,A typical work day at UPS is 12-13 hours per day. There are about 3 meeting on average unless a post sort is called. Most of the responsibility is on the operations with minimal support from other functions.
good,"If you are an hourly employee, UPS is a great company to work for. However, in any level of management, you will be over worked, under paid and expected to sacrifice time and health to meet unrealistic expectations by people who only hold higher positions due to longevity with the company, not knowledge or capability."
good,Very hard work picking boxes up from conveyer belt and loading them onto trucks. Short break times feels like you don't even get one. Good job to pick up for quick money.
good,"Highly stressful fast paced work environment have  new goals and agendas everyday. training programs non existent high standards for safety, long long hours"
good,Overall this job is very flexible and enlightens a different way to earn money from the company but on the other side management can be difficult to consult for the opinions of your job duties and responsibilities as to performing the job.
good,The work was incredibly physically demanding but I was in the best shape of my life at the time that I worked there. The hours were short and on off shifts. Very low pay with little to know benefits as a package handler
good,"The manager is amazing, however with all due respect, I would like to discuss in person the review on the business. I feel like it is something that is better left for face to face discussion."
good,Misleading when it comes to getting advancement in reasonable timing. The supervisors are disrespectful at times and its more like slave labor than a job that you can make a career out of. The only way its worth doing is if you're a driver. Its limited opportunity to do that.
good,Job security and growth opportunities are good. Not the place to work if you want to make money. Culture is also very old fashioned. Thrifty company for sure.
good,If you are looking for a job where you get paid a good amount to support your family or needs then this is not the place for you to work the hours are based on your supervisor so you might not know if your working that day or not the conditions for under what you work are harsh during the winter there is no heater and during the summer there is no fan your lunch is 30 minutes or less you basically work constantly for little to no pay.
good,When you finish unloading a trailer then you had to go and unload another. Unloading trailers were pretty easy but starting the night off you didn't have help. Some packages were up to over 100lbs that's when you were allowed help.
good,"UPS is a fast paced job, which proper training is needed for. Unloading heavy packages at a fast rate with cold & hot temperatures in trucks vary so being able to adapt is important."
good,I don't see myself being a driver for 25 years there quite a bit of room to move up in the company. It is very fast paced and quite the learning experience. I have no regrets thus far.
good,"This job is only worth it during peak season. After peak, hours are cut way back, they do everything they can to push people out by having them quit. They don't acknowledge people interested in moving up."
good,"The job is very quick paced. You load up to 4 trucks at one time. They don't want the belt to shut off, so at times you are chasing your boxes down the belt."
good,"I need more an hour to live, they pay pennies until you think your going to die, and you have a job of crazy hours, They need to pay where you can eat and put a roof"
good,Waited on customers Sorted mail completed print jobs packed items interacted with customer trained on regulations . Managed and helped train team members The owner  Taught me how to manage people
good,"loading and unload boxes the entire time, which can get pretty tiresome as well as having to start really early in the morning, not a ideal job for me"
good,"The work is intriguing and you have the opportunity to learn a large range of skills; like standardized packing, mail distribution, customer service, and Quickbooks to name a few. The people are nice but management is slow to respond to issues."
good,"Very low pay. Very difficult to advance because of employee union. Seniority based, very difficult to get a steady shift. Less than 10 hours a month. Supervisors have little freedom. Insane expectations. Computer system buggy and flawed making you double back and do more work."
good,"Management lacks direction, organization, and communication with it's employees. Most of the lower end management was left to pick up a lot of slack from people above. Members lacked the preparation to handle the holiday volume, even based off previous years volume increase."
good,I enjoyed the work here and learned a lot but did not care for the manager at all. I was treated poorly and seemed to work a lot harder than I was being paid.
good,You go in and clock in and just start processing the mail through the computer. They text you in a few hours in advance from the time you are supposed to come in. That's the most in advance they'll let you know your schedule.
good,Small to large packages. Heavy lifter. Worked very fast pace. Worked closely with management due to work inspiration and stress handling. Was very good at managing time
good,They are a very fast paste job and you have be willing to work on your feet for over 6+ hours a day.You have to show them your ready to work and be able to pick up 70 pounds by yourself.
good,Great company but seniority driven hang ups type of company. Some of the employees hang ups is seniority driven I feel the most experienced should be given preference to some of the positions at UPS.
good,"This is a tough company to work for. There are benefits available for both full and part time employees. There are some truly amazing supervisors but they are FEW and FAR BETWEEN. I loved this job but it's a physical grind. It's literally the most physical job I've ever done. The only recognition you get is when you finish the sort early which doesn't happen often. When it does happen they send you home early. I loved the days that I was out on the road. "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job with UPS from past 17 years is People. The team that I have and had is/was excellent. Best part is we work together during challenges. We achieved great things together.
good,Declining work culture with constant  harassment    Top-down management fails to recognize local conditions such as weather in Buffalo as opposed to Arizona.  Ever increasing workload with little or no relief. Workloads tend to lead to unsafe conditions.  Local management is not empowered to make decisions based upon their operational workforce. Consistently sides for production over safety.
good,"Days working there were long and exhausting. Very physically demanding and long, overnight hours caused me to be tired all the time. Pay rate, however, is great, and there was plenty of opportunity for overtime and extra pay."
good,This job cant pay bills this is a job used to work while in school. There is no job culture at all. You are forced to upsell upsell and for what? but makes sense this is a failing franchise. wont last more than 7 years
good,"Start at 7.30 a.m start scanning previous days received parcels, receiving customers and attending them. scanning parcels for shipment. Tracking shipped documents for information purpose and client inquiry."
good,This compay is very fast paced and short staffed so you are always on the move. You never sit still and if your the go go go kind of person this is the job for you.
good,"UPS tries to push the production of a lot of work in a short amount of time hense everyone beginning as a part time employee. They are insensitive to the needs of the workers. We work in a warehouse during extreme temperatures and most times without operable water fountains and ice machines. UPS gives us water on days where the forecast predicts OVER 90 degree temps. its hard to move to other positions within the company. The entire building needs renovations in order for a more smooth productive work day. The facilities and equipments we use to do our job are old, outdated, dysfunctional, and needs replacement, The operation of these old devices cause more than necessary strain on our body."
good,OK PT job until something better comes along.  No benefits and hour wage is aprox. $8.00/hr.  No raises or chance for advancement.  Lots of down time except during the Holiday Season.  Communication between the owners and employees is little to none.
good,"Very impersonal work environment, employees are just a number. The most important thing is the bottom line!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"awful coworkers, managers who completely disregard zero tolerance and then get angry at you for falling behind on your work throughout the day. You get locked in and locked out, just inconvenient overall"
good,"Management is unorganized. You have to call numerous times to get somewhere with anyone. Interview is quick, easy and painless. Work/life is  Inconsistent."
good,"Your superiors are clueless. So clueless you begin to question the workforce and purpose of life. I mean you would think its as simple as deliver the boxes and be safe. No! ""You were over allowed on your backing goal"", ""sign here"".... EVERY MORNING. The union aint diddly. The only thing this job left me with was a tuffer pair of u know what. You have to deal with and take so much bs and the politics are served unethically with a dash of favoritism and topped with shafts suxers.  only thing you think about is a drink after clocking out. Dead as serious"
good,"Fun, fast-paced job, didn't last long due to the holidays. Wish it could have been a full-time position. Friendly workers (most of them). Very physical position."
good,"Typical day at work would be smooth from 4 to 12 pm."
good,"Besides the fact that management was very disorganized, my co-workers were very nice and helpful. The work environment was very fast-paced and you had to get your work done or else you would be very behind and that aspect was stressful."
good,"If you like to sweat and work till you hear a bell then UPS isn't a bad job. The people you get to interact with day to day are great people with amazing senses of humor. However the expectation of production is fairly high. In unload you're required to move 1200 pieces (one piece is one box, people) every hour while also making sure the pieces were hitting the conveyor a certain way as to make sure the label on the box was facing the right way to be scanned by an automated scanner at the end of the line. If you take the time to master the craft though and can keep pushing even when you start getting tired the most difficult part is dealing with the management above your immediate and full-time supervisor and accepting that you'll most likely NEVER promote yourself unless you'd like to drive. The biggest problem I had with the job was that you worked 15-20 hours a week (3-4 hours a shift) and only got paid $10/hr. A $150 paycheck every week was not fun to live off of."
good,"Working at UPS can be fun, but stressful at the same time do to poor management and sloppy work ethic employees. Having a supervisor that can run the area smoothly without breaking down to the moment things is not going his/her way can make the day seem easy."
good,"Very hard work for the pay, and they force you to donate to causes you have no affiliation or intention to donate to straight out of your check. Even though its part time its back breaking work"
good,Working here was okay but I couldn't do it forever. The environment was insane for the most part. There was poor management and the poor training explains why.
good,whether you are healthy or injured your experience may be the same.  the culture here is very structured and military like which I enjoyed but hard work doesn't seem to be rewarded with anything other than extra work. with the idea being that you are the one who can  handle it.
good,"Had the opportunity literally work with hundreds of companies and work with just about every database out there. During a typical day, I would drive over 200 miles to work with many of UPS' high-end clients."
good,"It is a fast paced environment and demanding."
good,"I think working at ups was a great learning experience for me as far as working with people as a team ,managing time and making sure my work is efficient"
good,"●	Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule ( load, pack, wrap, label, ship) ●	production worker Keeping count of all ship outs ●	Follow quality service standards and comply with procedures, rules and regulations."
good,"During the holiday season the standard day was 2 am - 9 am. You get one 10 minute break regardless of how long the day is.  Unionized company so the management can't help you if you fall behind, instead they shut down the belt until you can catch up and slow everyone else down."
good,"whilst working for UPS I was consistently pushed to work harder and harder, this wasn't always possible because of things such as the weather and traffic and so on. But more than once I received a phone call from the office saying 'you need to work harder and faster because if to we'll just have to replace you', this isn't exactly a great motivator when the people who are supposed to help you end up getting on your back and making threats such as this. However the driver that I was with was very helpful and a really nice guy but that is the only positive I have taken away from this whole working experience"
good,"not many hours, if you are in college this is a great job for you. easy work, in and out. the hardest part of the job is lifting, you have to be able to lift 70 lbs or more."
good,"The job was good and very busy during the holiday season.  When ""peak"" arrived in March there was no more work.  Would come in and not know what you would be working on.  Most were sent out to different accounts to do the work they didn't want their employees doing.  Would rather train new people every week then to make one current employee happy.  Management was quite hands off and unprofessional.  The pay was a joke.  Tried advancing a few times with no luck so had to move on."
good,"Overall, the job is a tough one, and a relatively few bad apples in management made the job tougher for everyone. Compensation had been dropping for a long time, and new guys in the door are basically screwed."
good,This was a distribution center. I liked the fast paced work environment it definitely made the day go by faster. With that said just to far of a drive.
good,"eh and a shrug is the best way i can describe working at UPS, just stereotypical of what you'd expect at a warehouse job. management was always rude except for one that didn't hate his life."
good,"You felt like a number and a temporary employee. The company as a whole is wonderful as they support the community in numerous ways, however the individuals they have placed in management positions will eventually get them sued for discrimination, harassment and creating a hostile working environment."
good,"Literally one of the best minimum paying jobs around. Working while being friendly and making your customers feel comfortable. Great place to work while going to school, very flexible hours. Not a job that can pay for all your bills."
good,"My day would start with meeting with a driver usually at a random location like a restaurant.Then the day would proceed by delivering packages to its designated destination.Followed by a lunch break mid day,pretty standard."
good,veel wil ik er niet over kwijt maar er wordt totaal en alleen maar naar de cijfertjes gekeken en hoe ze het beste en het meest kunnen bezuinigen. het werk zelf was erg leuk en collega's waren ook erg leuk. persoonlijk contact met de klanten is het leukst aan deze baan.
good,Fast paced if you are weak or have thin skin this is not the place for you. Work is all about production and moving the packages as fast as possible without stopping
good,"This job isn't for the light-hearted. Work is physically intense, and even more so during the summer. People getting heat exhaustion isn't uncommon. If you're fit, and can handle hours of intense workouts, this job is all for you."
good,Hourly workers get treated alright by management but the pay is pretty bad for the work they have to complete. Part-time supervisors on the other hand get treated terribly and for little pay.
good,"Worked for a private owner who was horrible. Underpaid by industry standards, no praise for beating sales goals multiple months at a time. lack of direction"
good,if you work hard you will move up with in the company they work with you when you are having problems always looking to advance someone to another position within the company
good,"Worked with 23 managers, 10 Plant Managers. Worked all three shifts. Went to school during the process, and worked with all types of employees. First building design occurred with PD2, because volume layout minimized the area. Handled Forth Worth, Granbury, DFW, and Arlington. Work PD2 for 6 years. Preload location was Allen, and Plano. Loading UPS drivers for delivery. Building design for Allen mobile, because it was a single belt load operation. Hardest part was the part-time pay. Most enjoyable moments is being in the now. Looking back on the knowledge gained by mistakes to prepare yourself for the future."
good,"i am on call for city driver until 3pm then if they don't call me i can go in to work the dock starting at 5 pm  if i get called in ill drive and do my deliveries, and pick ups till 5 then work the dock till trailers are all loaded for the regional drivers"
good,Ok place to work for quick money or part time money.  They don't hire full-time employees.  Most of the people who have worked there for 15 years or more say that they hate their jobs.
good,"I loved my co workers and clientele, but it was the worst managed store i have ever been in. I would not recommend any one person to work for that women"
good,"This was a temporary job for personal experience.  I aided the regular driver in delivering packages to businesses and residences during the holiday season.  The job was great and met my needs. I learned a lot about the organization, people, and how this incredible job gets done each day."
good,fast paced hard work for little pay been there 13 years and still part time you only get around 3 hours a nite
good,starting out its back breaking labor for little pay and prison like conditions. But if you happen to move up its a place with great benifits and its unionized.
good,Heb hier gewerkt op verschillende sectoren en het aanleren was niet aanwezig. Collega's waren top maar de leiding gevende vond ik niks.
good,this company is very fast paced and you get a lot of exercise from running to and from the truck
good,mainten warehouse to keep things clean over & under pallets.use fork lift pallet jack.brooms shovels picking up spices.
good,You have to be a great leader to be in management; you have to build the trust with employs to get the production from them. Dispatch drivers daily with an 9.4 plan day. The excessive hours and not being compensated for them.
good,"Help customers as they come in."
good,I was only there for a year and a half and i cannto really remeber much fom almost nine years ago
good,"My time at UPS was very educational in many ways, particularly in the workings of very big companies, their management styles and employees."
good,"UPS is a great career don't get me wrong. But if you want to make the good money expect to do some serious unfair crazy labor for 10-15 years for 20hrs a week and roughly 10-15$ an hour. It's a good job, but only if you want to stick it out for ever!!!"
good,loading/unloading freight using forklift and proper technique for staging. Not too much to enjoy about the job but it's pretty fast paced and constant moving
good,"Your day will start and end with data and metrics.  Everything you do is measured and critiqued.  If you like a ""big brother"" environment, you will love it at UPS.  "
good,Worked 12 hour shifts one day off when worked slowed down all employees soon after were laid off.
good,"Typical day is I wait for them to deliver the container that has the days deliveries.  Separate them according to address and stock gas golf cart with deliveries.  Deliver items to proper address.  Come back and restock the golf cart with packages to deliver.  One of the hardest parts is the heavy packages that don't fit in the cart, trying to arrange things so they won't fall out, and of course when it rains trying to keep the deliveries dry while getting soaked.  The best part is knowing I got the packages delivered and I've put in a full day."
good,The work that is done in any UPS facility takes dedication and a committment to ensuring the best effort of the employee. It is expected that you will maintain a safe working envoronment at all times by knowing all safety procedures. The job is physically demanding.
good,"long hard stressful days"
good,I have learned to appreciate the good people within the company and my family time. The hardest part of the job is knowing when to walk away. The most enjoyable is helping people.
good,Typical day was from 9-5. Learned a lot about the packaging business and the computer softer ware that is used within a UPS store.
good,"Work hours are never the same.  The hours were determined by the mail load recieved that night.  A person could work from 8-10 hours one night and 12-20 hours the next.  "
good,ups is a great place to work but is hard to keep the job because of the superviser.
good,"I learn to be on time. be proactive, and put in the effort. I also learn what it takes to work the night shift. I gain helpful experience that will follow me to my next job."
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced and tiring.....Learned what it meant to be a slave. Management just wanted you to work harder so they can get bonus and not pass it down to the actual worker. My co-workers were ok hard working people for the most part. The hardest part of my job was actually working and the most enjoyable part of my day was clocking out.
good,I really enjoyed my experience working with ups. It was challenging but fulfilling. My supervisor was eager to teach all that I was destine to learn at a reasonable pace.
good,"Fast paced company, time would fly by because of the amount of work to be done in such little time, and friendly co-workers."
good,"Shifts begin between 2 - 3 AM typically, processing high volume of packages into multiple vehicles for delivery."
good,"Working at the UPS store was a great learning experience. I learned about customer service and sales. How to carfully package and ship an item. Management wasn't the friendliest, but helpful."
good,"unload trucks,audit packages . hardest part was the big orders during the holidays"
good,"trained new hires 3-6 weeks,recertified driver on road test.OTR"
good,"management were not fair at times. we had good benefits and pay, but no hours.the most enjoyable part of working there was going home."
good,"Arrive, Check in at Security Office, Security would check me with a scanner, report to office and clock in, check assignment, and proceed to Unload/Load, Park and Dispatch all incoming and outbound Aircraft."
good,Very little family time and on call on weekends and holidays
good,"However, you don't feel comfortable to work with due to the job security are low, Especially for a worker over 50."
good,"I drive a big brown truck, there's not a lot of excitement around that. What I find most enjoyable is my customers and the relationships I have built over the past 30 years."
good,I was a seasonal worker so I did not reap the benefits. I would have liked longer hours but seasonal was the only thing available.  The pay was great.
good,Be ready to work. It is fast paced and work work work. Loading and unloading small medium and large packages. It was a great part time experience. I would recommend to anyone needing extra money.
good,"Mixed messages and bureaucracy rule the day here. The actual job is not so bad if they'd let me do it without unnecessary micromanagement. "
good,Franchised so owners vary as well as their expectations.  Peak involves very long days and inability to have an absolute end time to the workday.  Hard to communicate with corporate office.  Customer interactions vary and are demanding.
good,I love the job and fellow coworkers but with the lack of communication with the management it makes it’s hard to work at times. Also very very low hours.
good,"The work is simple the drivers help you through the process however the dispatchers they call to see if your available I tell them yes I'm available all week  they always say ""I'll call you later"" if they do it's a miracle"
good,"For the pvd driver program it's good. The only problem is that there are non benefits and there is no way to gain full time employment.  I've been a pvd driver for 3 years now and when I'm done the only thing I'm asked is if I'm coming back next season (Christmas rush), never ever been asked if I wanted full time job"
good,"I feel the management there is lacking, they pressure new people too hard during the peak season. And hire on loads of hands of the at the time, while you're likely to make back I wouldn't recommend if you are lacking in physical prowess to handle over 8 hours a day even though they hire you for 4 hours if you get hired during peak."
good,I want to still be working at ups. It just wasn't right for the supervisor of the building to lie and say I don't follow directions. Isn't right for a person who comes to work everyday And ontime
good,"UPS is a great company but it has a very old minded culture, the work life balance does not exist, they expect their people to work from 10-12 hours once you are a full time supervisor, its not great for women in the age of having kids, only 6 paid weeks of maternity leave"
good,Worked sixty to seventy hours a week never called off. Told me that they would bring me on full time and didn’t. Worked Christmas Eve then never got a call back.
good,"Company does a great job selling you the position. They'll spend the money on a flight and hotel for a seasonal driver. Just to discard you. "
good,Great place to work until the store owner tries to tell you how to vote & talk politics daily.  Christmas hours are crazy & was expected to work open to close with not sitting down to eat lunch.
good,i just started this year as a drivers helper for the xmas season and so far the drivers have been great but the hours are not enough .i really like working for ups but not getting any hours sucks . today i waited around all day for a call to go to work and never got called .i own a business that is a little slow but things are starting to pick up . i feel that if i do not start getting the hours that i need i may call it quits and give up this job .i will at least stick it out until i get paid and see how much i make this week .  another thing that i do not like is their text paging system i am not the type that likes to text people back and fourth .. i thought that i would be working at least 30 to 35 hrs a  week . and so far i have not even came close to those hours .i am having mixed feelings about going back to work for them after i get my first pay check .
good,"there is a lot of lifting involved, able to work multiple shifts on occasion. met a lot of interesting people. there were bonuses given  if you met certain criteria."
good,"Just"
good,"Old fashioned work environment with little regard to work life balance"
good,"Decent workplace but security at the time was through an outside company.  The workers there are union, which made the non-union security job more difficult"
good,"I liked the work, but it was demanding and strenuous at times. The work hours changed up so much we never knew what time we were working until they text that day. And we never knew what time we would get off."
good,This job is not good for anyone who is still in highschool because its hard to balance working there and school especially when you have to work monday through friday
good,"As far as what was being upheld at my location was another story. I was exposed to racism, sexism, and a glass ceiling. I was hired as a dispatch supervisor, in turn I was an over-paid under valued receptionist. I was never properly trained after making multiple attempts to management about my stagnant position in the office. I was over-looked for positions with in my department, which were offered to my equally talented male counter parts."
good,"The jobs benefits are amazing. The attitude at work is consistent with a locker room. They ""ween out the WEAK!"" I have seen grown men in good shape vomit from heat exhaustion. New employees receive a treatment similar to hazing. You have to be able to block people who are trying to aggravate you out!"
good,"Call center enviroment was very childish and high school in nature. Cliques of people enjoying bullying other associates, HR handling was poor with nearly any situation. The answer essentially being just ignore it. Supervisors were often ignorant to their own processes when asked questions."
good,"Worked night hours, I was a package handler probably why I hated my job mindless boring work. Somewhat physically demanding. Pay isn’t very good for what you do."
good,"This was a very good job to have, however at the time of my employment at UPS I was not equipped with all the necessary resources I needed to make for an ideal work situation."
good,UPS is among the greatest companies to work for when talking about monetary compensation the average driver with over 4 years in makes 6 figures a year no problem. But that comes with the price of working 12-hour shifts 5 days a week as a driver. The benefits outweigh the negatives but be aware when applying. You will be working and it will most likely be the hardest job you have ever worked. But at the end of the week on payday you will be well compensated.
good,School money and benefits are nice but wages and management are poor. Stressful and little reward overall..nice starter job for young people but advance opportunities aren't worth the effort.
good,"handled high volume of packages daily"
good,This was not the job I thought it'd be. Hard work and constant criticism wear on you. But the morale stays high somehow. Met some great people here...
good,"It is not that bad place for working, everyone is on her or his task."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me organizing boxes, mail and  creating labels for customers to ship out their items through the store. I learned that sending a package is not that simple.  There's a few more rules and regulations than I had anticipated. Probably the hardest part of the job is the building size. With such a small place to store boxes in; it leaves little room for us employees to walk and move without running into each other. The customers that walk in and out of the building make everything worth it. There are so many great regular mail box customers that come back throughout the month that talk to us on a personal level."
good,Fast paste job. Willing to work hard and be able to pick heavy boxes. Be on time and willing to work on the weekends for peak season. Be ready to get your hands dirty and clothes.
good,"Customers were great, my immediate supervisor was patient and  proficient. The owner cared nothing about the employees, whatsoever. Would not keep tools and product around for us to perform our jobs. Greedy and not willing to go the extra mile he often wrote our paychecks on non- sufficient funds account. Made sub-standard wage for a position like this."
good,From my experience be careful who you trust. Come in do your work and keep up with amount of work you have. I had to memorize a lot of zip codes for all states and what belts they go on. I had to know how to load trucks and build stable walls of boxes. I have to be able to lift 70 pounds or above some items required more than one person.
good,"Overall experience wasn't what I was seeking for employment. Management seemed very disorganized. And employees weren't very friendly or helpful. I did not get paid hourly what I was told I would be making at time of employment. No"
good,"I have worked here for over a decade. Management and culture started out okay but have deteriorated drastically in the time that I have been there. This has become a hostile and borderline unsafe working environment. It's not uncommon at all for assistant terminal managers and above to berate employees when any issue arises rather than talking to them in a private, professional manner.  Currently extremely understaffed."
good,"This was a seasonal job and if that's what you like then this is the job for you.  The job had no benefits and if the workers with seniority came to work, you were told to go home."
good,Management at ups sucks.. They don't care about the workers...They will work you to death...The pay is not worth what you have to do or deal with.....
good,"The week training was very stressful. Three people were let go on their first day. Threats of ""you'll never make it unless..."" Scared to death. Put on a route in towns I didnt even know existed. They did put me with a veteran driver after a while. The schedule and speed is harsh. Each full time driver, though well paid, should earn twice as much. Insanely gruelling job."
good,"Wanneer je zakelijk ingesteld bent, is dit je bedrijf. Weinig complimenten ontvangen, veel kritiek krijgen. Vooral als chauffeur wordt er veel van je verwacht. Veel nemen en weinig geven is een mooie slogan."
good,"I worked hear for the so called ""busy season"" in a warehouse. They promised that we would be able to work 10 or 12 hour days with overtime and they would be busy and orders would be flowing in constantly. Nope. None of that happened once. My first day, my FIRST DAY, the majority of us got sent home at lunch because they didn't have any more work. Day 2, we left at 1st BREAK!!! In my first 2 weeks, I only had 3 days that were even 8 hours. This was a waste of time. The employees are terrible to work with. Management seemed just as confused as the new workers. The equipment constantly malfunctioned. Just dont even bother. Seriously."
good,The UPS I worked at was a franchise and it was a pretty chill place. The manager was alright but isn’t understanding of life happening. He did take a chance on me which I appreciate.
good,This is hard work for below average pay.  Training needs structure and employees are generally unsatisfied but stay for the benefits and work elsewhere for compensation.  I am hoping to find a better fit within the organization currently.
good,"The job is physically and mentally demanding, time sensitive and memory demanding, military like experience, supervisors doesn't make it any easier at all."
good,"My time working at UPS was very all over the place. The management is good when it want's to be I guess. They don't really care too much about you as an individual. Other than that the people there were fun to work with, it's very hot its a non-climax decontrolled environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is having off on the weekends. You aren't expected to work overtime, but if you'd like the extra cash you can."
good,UPS needs to improve their management system. New trainees are constantly being laid off and called back whenever the company needs. Company is unorganized. Certain routes are purposely made for trainees to fail.
good,Well first I have been switch three times from Sunday shift to Friday shift which mean I cant go to the doctors without requesting a day which is not paid till 6 months after your orientation and you get 15 min for a break doesn't even have a leway for if u have to walk a mile to get to your work station.
good,"advanced quickly to my position, was advised by coworkers to wait longer to  get a better understanding of the environment and to stay protected by the union but i needed the income"
good,It was not that great. Didn’t get paid as much as we should have... did not get enough hours. They did not have enough to pay for more employees. No benefits
good,The culture was fast paced worked on an assembly line processing packages with UPS Mail Innovations. Typical worked consisted processing 500 packages per hour. I also trained new hires. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,"Don’t be a seasonal driver, they don’t care if you get hours and there will be times they will send you home without pay. Management is horrible and treat you horrible, since you’re a seasonal worker. The pay is really good but I would not trust what they tell you."
good,This is an honest job. You will put in an honest day's work and the compensation is fair for the level of responsibility expected from their employees.
good,It was seasonal...not good if you are female and over 55.  Wasn't really given much of an opportunity for full time or transferring to another position.
good,I really didn't  have any complaints about UPS other than the fact that I was working in the middle of the summer. It was a fast paced job that required a major workout.
good,"Since I've been employed at UPS it hasn't been what I thought it would be. They're holding me back from making the real money. I give my job 100 percent in any area that I'm working in and they even acknowledge me. When I need help at the job my supervisors goes bare minimum, but my supervisors will go above to fire me."
good,"This job is a very laid back environment, where sometimes there is stress only due to the management and lack of workers. The UPS Store is not affiliated with UPS corporate so there is no room for advancement, better pay or benefits. The Management over the store is very nice and caring, however the management in the store is lack there of."
good,Ok but need new challenge daily administration jobs preparing reports for colleaguesworkplace bad atmosphere hours harder part most enjoyable colleagues day from 07-00 to 12-00
good,They hire helpers for drivers and extra loaders for the warehouse during the holidays. The pay is pretty good. The drivers are usually nice guys. The warehouse can get cold though.
good,The pay wasn't nearly enough for the amount of work. No raise if you move up a position. Say the jobs full time with over time but won't let you get passed 39hours per week. No over time. They are only good for being flexible with days off.
good,its ok i guess i wouldn't work there again its too hot in the summer & too cold in the winter i got sick multiple times ok idk like its poor management
good,"I learned a lot pertaining to customer service, computers/printers/faxing, and a lot about mail/parcels!"
good,"Very fast paced work, and the management always tries to get you to move faster. They say to move fast, but blame you if you get injured. Never given enough time to get it done right, often understaffed. The place is a meat grinder."
good,"It seems to be a descent company to work for, however management was very poor. It's a pretty layed back, fast-paste work environment. Work is very easy to do, although there is a lot of very heavy lifting involved that is not always agreeable for women to lift."
good,"Work flow is fast; untrained workers lose time searching for functioning equipment, and fall behind while attempting to develop techniques and attempting to learn job requirements."
good,UPS is an archaic and hide bound organization.  It is slow to respond to changes in the market place.  Changes can take months to years to implement.  The current management culture is anachronistic.  It is very resistant to change.
good,Great for a part time position but it would take years to become full time. They offer assistance with college tuition which is great! The job is very physical! Cold in the winter and hot in the summer!! My supervisor was very hateful and unprofessional!
good,"management does not care about you"
good,"The current department is not work friendly. There is no family oriented interaction between employees and managers."
good,managers are not on the same pace. They do not give raises do to your performance. They keep you a stand still pace. They bring people into work place making more money than you and you have been doing the job for months. They do not have good communication skills.
good,"At UPS you are no longer paid for how you work and what you put into it. Work days are long and stressful for division level managers and down. We manage by conference calls all day and night long and we talk about how we are going to manage the business when we spend too much time talking about what we are going to do. There isn't enough time in the day to actually do what is expected of us to do our jobs. You can expect conference calls all day and evening. Management is very inexperienced. The culture of UPS used to be strong but it has been weakened from the top down with hiring of outside board members. Management is overworked and understaffed. Benefits have been lessened, retirements cut for new management, retirement pensions frozen after 2022 for those that have it, 401k match cut out for a couple years and lessened match when reinstated, and vacation days prorated. The work/life balance is horrible. I will get a minimum of 50 calls and over 200 text messages a day 7 days a week. The pay is ok and the stock bonus is ok too. They pay you just enough to keep coming back and putting up with the job."
good,"Most people get hired for part time positions. Most of the time they are capped at 27.5 hours a week. Although the hourly rate is good, it is not practical as a primary job. Some offices favor young people and seem to favor males. There is not always a level of professionalism. I do think other parts of the company probably offer a better environment."
good,typical work day was stressful the management bad. Work enviorment is terrible. management will not listen to probably areas  the staffing is terrible as wel
good,ups paid good but was not the right job for me the people who worked there was not very eay to work with or even get along with I prefer not to work there
good,"when I was sick, they would guilt trip me or else just not let me have time off; even with a 103 degree fever, until I had to have a doctors not stating I was to be on bedrest for 3 days. i was not at all impressed with the attitude of management nor the daily disrespect."
good,"Everyday is a long day but we start with pre morning communication with safety concerns. Then according to your seniority you can take or negotiate routes with bid or swing drivers. Once you’ve acquired a route you’re able to navigate and make delivery points, on call demand orders, pickups, next day air specials, business saver specials, business and residential stops in the allotted time window. You’re good to go. You’re also to follow all safety methods and rules whilst keeping yourself safe and the company truck safe also."
good,"Too late to actually have a life outside of work, Managers didn't make it anymore more fun. Couldn't live with this job and go to school at the same time."
good,"The job duties and responsibilities were very easy but this lead to boredom and lack of fulfilling work.  Each day was the same and there were never new or exciting challenges to keep me engaged.  I did learn some interesting things about shipping cargo, especially internationally. "
good,"Poor manegnent. Hurry up and move faster mentality. Coworkers were great and fun to be around. But the management on the other hand was I’ll eqipped to Maintain a stable, professional work environment."
good,I love the weekly pay but it’s too hot and not enough pay. Also i didn’t get enough hours because there was so many people working there. My manager was also a mean guy
good,"a very fast pace work place.always on the go.start off clock in ,then go,help as many customers as possible.And don't get anything wrong.Must check and recheck each order."
good,"A typical day was a little slow but picked up when cargo landed. I learn different types of cargo planes, Management was okay but a little bit disorganized. Work culture was good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the disorganization. The easiest part of the job was working with some of the employees"
good,"Very busy Many tasks to be done by certain times.  Not enough staff to cover breaks and lunches were not easy to sched or take."
good,"No lunch breaks, only would. Recommend. If you just want to get paid, its a nice weekly check that can last you for another week.?? Until your next l pay check hit."
good,It's an awesome place to work if you want to gain muscle and loose weight. Great for parents who just want a part-time job with full-time benefits. You'll be a union member!
good,"New people, constant changes, favoritism, No respect from management no confidential in the work place. It has  become a place where professionalism is no longer required."
good,I would have really enjoyed working here longer had I gotten more hours and if the management or supervisors were more responsible and more professional. The overall attitude from the supervisors were unacceptable and everyone complained about it
good,job not worth the time... pay not worth the time. travel and distance not worth the time. barely get any hours sometimes you get sent home with no work.
good,it hot in there every day the supervisor don't care about you the full time supervisor talk to the employees and part time supervisor any kind of way and everything is out dated
good,"This should show as The UPS Store (not UPS)."
good,"Started around 10-10:30am Monday through Friday.  Worked until final package delivered.  Usually finished after 4pm but as we got closer to Christmas, worked later.  A regular UPS driver would drop off the deliveries for the day.  I split the community between myself and another UPS driver.  We had golf carts with small trailers hooked up to golf carts.  Organized route with the closest deliveries first and work back.  Those packages we couldn't fit on carts, left in a locked trailer.  Some of the stuff was heavy so I took what I could fit on the planned route."
good,"An average day at ups is very rough. Most of the days at ups were harsh because of the depressing environment and the extreme weather."
good,No comment i was just treated unfairly as were other employees they made us clock out when there was more work to do if we had to go to the clinic and were supposed to be paid while there they tried to make us clock out and the supervisors overworked us even if we needed to stop
good,"Nice atmosphere, answer high volume calls,  resolve customer's"
good,"Designed and executed small and large format print jobs, packed and shipped vast array of customers’ items and provided exemplary customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment after printing a large format job and seeing a customer's face light up once delivered to them. The hardest part of the job was moving from store to store (we had 4 franchises under our owners) and seeing the lack of communication and deliberate carelessness of what is actually shipped through the parcel service. Our UPS Stores did not have the ability to ship out alcohol, yet managerial staff kind of ""brushed it under the rug"" and pretended that it did not happen."
good,I do not see any pros in the temporay position that I held it was seasonal so I really can not rate positive or negitive. Speaking with the drivers it seems it is a good company to work for
good,"The pay is too little, for the strain placed on your body, especially for peopls working 3+years. Benefits are pretty good. Management can be good when it wants to be, but typically prioritizes its bottom line."
good,"When I was working there BOB offered a few of us free pizza if we had worked overtime we did pretty good"
good,"I was a part time employee that only worked for 18-20 hours per week, 3rd shift 11am - 4am. I was paid well, however union is mandatory and their fee's are high for those who just started. No benefits are offered for the first year of employment. Career or job advancement is nearly non-existent unless you have seniority AND a degree or similar job qualifications. They do not train, they just hire someone that has shown to be able to do the job."
good,"This is a very physics; place to work. You must be able to lift heavy weights repeatedly in a fast pace environment. Must have a ""thick skin."" All hourly employment is required to join the local Union."
good,"I only worked their while I was going to college. The management had poor people skills and created a lot of conflict with the employees. By the end of my time there I was happy to leave, I will never work them again. I ended up filling a complaint against management, because of how the floor supervisors treated employees."
good,"no room for advancement, management wasn't easy to work with. physically demanding job.very fast paced. very hard to get things done with management saying one thing and employees needing something else"
good,This job sucked unless you want to be a brown truck driver then which is also a bad job then don't even bother working they don't care about there employees at all
good,"My job was to sort mail, and put the mail on the line. I also had to scan barcodes . I had to make sure the mail was being places into the correct boxes ."
good,"In 2012 I had to find a second job, for extra income. "
good,"Just like with most jobs this one is more about who you know instead of what you know. If you prove that you can do the job more effectively that is great but your manager wont be looking at that. He/She will mainly look at your numbers and go off of how they feel about you. You can be bad at your job, but if you're buddy-buddy with your boss then you will be fine."
good,"UPS in Horsham is very unorganized , though I did learn some very valuable things about using conveir belts, loadingand unloading merchandise. They manangment was very unprofessional , they did not have any respect for me or my personal life. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay professional even though everyone else on the job wasn't. The most enjoyable part about working with UPS were the great benefits they had offer."
good,UPS CACH is simply too far to travel for work if you in the city of Chicago. Even if you're hired with the company they won't transfer you to a location closer to you unless you give them a dying reason like 4 hours to and from work every day isn't enough.
good,"I was only to put food in my stomach, I did not enjoyed working at UPS Inc. they use me like a salve, after worked when I go home: I am not able to eat or take my bath"
good,"Targets, targets, targets dat is wat telt aan t einde van de dag ...."
good,I only had one problem. When the driver I was assigned to had me lift a box as big as I was and carry it down a long drive. It was fun driving around with the doors open.
good,"Work you to death as a seasonal helper. Not willing to adjust, be flexible at all no matter what. I never do reviews but this experience sucked. Don't trust a word the management says unless you get it in writing. Pi%#& me off still thinking about it.  Nepotism will never thrive for good."
good,Good work gets looked over and too many office politicians. Good benefits and compensation for the work. Work force is ok but alot of people dont want to work there for too long.
good,"Very Stressful. Fast paced, which I did mind at all. No real break or lunch. No real communication or good organized management.  Always bounced me from one work area to another."
good,Your day can start as early as midnight during the busy season or as late as 5am during the regular season. Part timers will average about 20-25hrs per week. Learned how to stack boxes in a UPS truck or Semi trailer. Management is tolerable. At my facility they love you over stack the unloading and sorting areas of the facility. If you work out of the semi area they will take your co-worker until for the first 1-2hrs of the shift then ask you why you dont have more work done when they finally do let you got and help that person or that area. As long as you call in late and not show up they will not write you up especially if you are buddies with the manager. What i enjoy most is that I am off of work in time to go to school
good,"learned a lot of things, glad to be working."
good,I choose to work for United Parcel Service to gain work experience and an adequate income I understood it was to be limited in hours performed and a low pay scale but it was around the Christmas Season and I was concerned about money. The tasks required of this job was helping the driver deliver packages to residential and sometimes business locations. It was only difficult if the weather was severe.
good,Did not find a lot of opportunities for advancement. Job became very stagnant. Management not hands on enough to make sure assignment were done correctly the first time.  Teamwork was essential to complete assignments.
good,the job is alright itself. honestly felt like the pay wasn't enough for everything we do. and working night shift is a pain. the supervisors don't do nothing because I guess they're not suppose to. which I don't think is fair to everyone else. especially since they were always shorthanded.
good,"Loved my coworkers, were understanding of personal problem but did get injured and they were seeking for reasons as to how it was my fault even though their equipment wasn't safe"
good,"Managers dont just always manage people.  Some managers mange things like IT need to be specialized.  this was not UPS's feelings.  Ups moved you around regardless what you were promised, even out of your field of IT.  Highly do not Recommend."
good,This job was very stressful at times. work conditions in hot weather in trailers can get very stuffy. at times your trailer can get overloaded with parcels and that can potentially cause a backup in which little to help is provided. hard work has never been a problem for me but i felt as if i was a dog getting whipped on a leash more than i felt like an employee.
good,"The entry level position is just that. Expect low pay, long hours, little respect, and not much guidance. The pay IS fair for the work. Not much brain power is required to move boxes to/from."
good,"I would start my day setting up al my trucks for the day. I would make sure they had everything on the right truck. I had to input all the information into the computer. When the trucks would leave, the driver would sign his papers and I would send the truck on the road through the computer for the next facility to receive their mail in."
good,They have old broken equipment for us to use that breaks all the time.  Most of the management have no interest or care about an employee.  Its really hot in summer months and very cold in the winter months.
good,Sort packages. Label packages. Scan packages. Break jams on belts. Sort multiple packages into one bag. Use factory equipment according to regulation. Follow guidelines. Being awake early everyday.
good,The typical work day as a Ups Driver's Helper begins with getting a phone call from management setting a time and location with your driver. Later you meet you driver where your day takes a bleak and terrible turn. after you met your driver you begin your route and honestly they should change the title from driver's helper to driver's slave because that's what you are. For the most part the driver is just a chauffeur the hand you most of the packages. also the packages are never labeled with the right weight it may say 2 pounds and weigh 50.
good,Good for students who are looking for a little spending money. the majority of the work is done at night.  Advancement is based on who you know not what you know.
good,If you are in-search of a Part Time Job that has Benefits this is a good place. I try to build a strong team with high moral and a fun work environment.
good,I live in New York & travel everyday 5 days a week to New Jersey which is hard. The benefits are good but the hours & pay are not I’m just want more out of life.
good,"Very frustrating work environment. The company says one this in their code of ethics but does another. Management structure is very confusing."
good,"slow and hot a typical day "
good,"To be honest, if your not into physical labor this is not for you! I was loading four trucks and couldn't keep up and a lot of the times the supervisor would watch me struggle. The shift time, hours and pay weren't worth it."
good,"It is a great privilege for anyone to work in a reputed company, coming to Management , work place is good but little stressful day at work. Working on designing and developing reports and scorecards using SSRS tool. Developing SSIS packages as per the client requirement for the business."
good,The culture at UPS is not the typical corporate culture. If you like being in the dark with no training this is the place for you. They attempt to do the right thing but they are so far behind times in technology it creates a lot of wasted time.
good,"long, enduring and stressful must be athletic if you are thinking about being a supervisor. Job requirements are delegated by hirearchy of management."
good,Its always hot people smell sups are very disrepectful people be stealing they hire anybody they dont care just dont hurt yourself trying to do to much
good,It was a good part time that offered over time which allowed to make some extra money but the hours where eregular. Other than that it was a fine place to work if you where one of the few to climb the lattar
good,It's ok. for those who are going to school. That's good for those for education  and not to live on.It's a good starting ground for those who need education.
good,I was assigned 2 drivers and both of them were extremely professional and very polite to me. They even bought food and drinks for me. When i needed help they helped. If you are not sure what to do or a customer asks a question always let the driver know they will handle it. The weather was very cold so a lot of layers is recommended if it feels to hot then remove some is better to have more than less just in case. You will need to call the office everyday early in the morning i would get a rude lady from their office that will get mad when you could not make it a day she said that we are scheduled 6 days a week but in orientation they told us that they never make us work for more than 5 days they were extremely unorganized in the office the orientation was a mess. And be careful with dogs there is some rude people that don't care if their violent dogs come at you so be cautious. Overall the drivers were great people who deserves more recognition for their hard work sometimes we would get some exaggerated overweight items that in my opinion ups drivers should not handle its ridiculous. The job is minimum wage the ups i worked for did not gave any benefits or bonuses at all which was a shame.
good,Needs more work on management. They are always on you throughout the whole shift. They give issues with personal or sick time call outs. Company needs more work but wouldn't want to work for them again.
good,"Peak season is fast pace and long hours I was hired in as a peak driver so this is all the experience I have with UPS I do know if you are called back, you will be put in the warehouse only making 10 to 11 an hr. at 5 hrs a day. This will last anywhere from a few months to a year"
good,"Hardest thing there isn't enough time to get those packages off. Be back in building at 7 with car empty. If you can't make a stop, you will be questioned. Do the right thing. Big Brother is watching."
good,"Poorly managed company.  Tremendous disconnect between Upper Level and Mid-Managers and below."
good,"Rather not respond. Physical issues never addressed between new employees and real workers, not enough training before throwing in a new young employee.  Too much turnover."
good,I worked at UPS for the last 6 months and it was horrible. Waking up everyday at 3am to commute to work for 2 hour just to work until 8:30am. And when I asked to switch to a day shift when public transportation is open they said I would lose my job after the holidays. So I stayed on the super early morning shift until I could no longer make it there on time. If I uber'd to work it would cost more than I make for the day. I don't see any of the nice people I worked alongside going anywhere with their lives except working forever at UPS..
good,"The manager was very unprofessional, always late ,never gave proper instructions , and always had a attitude. She was a good person but took most of her anger and frustration on her employees"
good,It is a nice place to work when it is not during the holiday season.  During the peak season it is very stressful and they have there part time supervisors work anywhere from 40-50 hours a week 6 days a week.  They don't give you a heads up about working weekends until the day before and your allowed no time off during October-January.
good,"I am currently an employee and my only gripes are the lack of employee recognition, managers treat us like we're machines rather than people, low pay."
good,"Management/Supervision isn't exactly efficient and it shows in the day to day work hours making things difficult for no reason. Benefits are good, but the wage could see some improvement. The only real slap to the face is that I was expecting to do something involving more thought process since I have plenty of experience in the admin side of logistics through the military and other means, but instead its all about moving boxes...that's it. The lack of individual thought causes many people to fall into a trap where the ability to move up in the company is there, but there's no career progression or training to advance yourself because nothing you actually do is noteworthy. Sadly advancement in there eyes is just moving to a more desirably shift. Basically, if you have hobbies, a life, or a family I wouldn't recommend because I haven't had a day off in two months, but if you're young with a lot of time on your hands and looking to make decent money through OT then have at it."
good,"Working at ups is a fast paced experience where heavy lifting as well as other physically demanding actions.  Break time was no longer than five minutes which isn't enough time to go to the bathroom and come back in most instances.  Even if you are on the floor of the hub, if you are not at a station you are considered not working and therefore are not being paid for that time even though you are at work."
good,I felt that management does not explain your work task in detail which limits you in completing your work effectively.  You have to rely on others in your position to explain your day to day task.
good,sign in go to your area climb in your truck wait in packages scam them and stack them in the truck never really seen management like that work place was not much traffic hardest part was weather conditions inside the truck
good,"it seemed to be all fun and be a nice place to work, but it turned into a stressful environment fairly quickly.  People think you get the same benifits and pay as the drivers but when you work for a franchise store you do not get anything but hourly rates."
good,Ups is a good place to work if you want to work really! Hard because that's what I did but never did receive my raise from my promotion was supposed to be getting promoted again but took forever never mind the run around but another If you are not ready for hard work and a very short break I mean very! Then that's the place for you 😂.
good,"Great place for personal growth.  Was amazing for assisting with school.  But the company i believe needs to take better consideration of its employees, specifically non union in respects to work life balance and benefits recently."
good,no work life balance. you can earn a good salary but you will miss out on most of the family gatherings . steady 11 plus hour wok day and six days a week from november to december
good,"We had 30 minutes for lunch, which included the walk to the break room and back. Office was operated like a sweat shop. Would not recommend this location; however, overall, I believe UPS is a good employer to work for."
good,"Keep in mind that I am the manager - and a new one at that."
good,Tough place to work that requires you to be able to constantly change direction.  You must be able to adapt to constantly  change and be able to run productively at all times.
good,"Okay work for driver helper "
good,"United Parcel Service is a good place to get a part time job.  The part time job is busy and has many different shifts to work. During the summer months, hours decrease substantially.  During November and December, the hours double for a part time job.  This makes it difficult to have a second job."
good,Need to have more flexibility with work life balance. Management is not informed very well on proper job descriptions.  Need to be more competitive with other companies on benefits.
good,"you know some people out there that go to the gym for a certain amount of hours everyday for 5 or 7 days week, taking a very little breaks?"
good,"I went through proper channels to become the manager of The UPS Store.  Unfortunately the owners that hired me sold the business and that is why I left.  I enjoyed working here very much but the new owner and I didn't see eye to eye on some issues.  This problem could not be resolved and I new it would be in my best interest to give my two week notice."
good,"My typical day is somewhat stressfull, must rely on my work force to work at a certain pace in order to get the job done in time. I learned how to be a team player and avoid distractions to be able to get the job done. I also learned how to be a leader not only to my employees but also my fellow supervisors. I feel management can do a better job holding other supervisors and employees accountable for mistakes. Hardest part of the job is being frustrated and having to get though each night with obstacles thrown at you. As a supervisor we are held to somewhat strick standards, such as being clean shaved, having shirt tucked in, and wearing a uniform. Id say my coworkers are the most enjoyable part of the job, they make it a little less stressfull on a daily basis."
good,Extremely demanding job in a fast paced environment. Offers little compensation for duties carried out. Very little recognition is ever handed out. Not much of chance for promotions of any kind.
good,UPS offers great benefits for part timers but the job is very hard and very stressful. The management does not appreciate the hard work employees put in that makes the company what it is and are always expecting more! Thank goodness we are union otherwise there would be no one working there because they always want to find ways to get rid of anyone that has been there for a while and is making any amount of money and keep new hires in there to keep their payroll low! The company concentrates on numbers only not customer satisfaction or employee satisfaction!!
good,You're working in extreme temperature and there's lots of freight being move up and down a conveyor belt why you ask to keep up with a high Pace volume
good,"Good place to work, very straightforward with how everything is to be run. You learn how to properly pack and box items for shipping as well as gives you a fair amount of customer experience."
good,"This job was a great learning experience overall. I was able to obtain many skills and knowledge that will help me in the future. However, it also taught me what not to do in a business environment. The overall atmosphere was very stressful and anxiety ridden due to management. Many complaints of unhappiness from fellow employees."
good,"Loading packages onto trailer for delivery to ensure that they are there on time and accurately packed. When there is a wrong package on your line, you remove it set it off to the side and then take it to its designated trailer."
good,"This is a good company to work as a drivers helper. I wouldnt recommend working inside the warehouse. Overall good company, not very good hours but the pay is decent."
good,I enjoyed UPS because you always stayed busy. its a very fast paced business so time goes quickly while you work. What I didn't like was the half shifts and no place for advancement no matter how well you did a job.
good,"If your looking for a part time side job as a young college student, this is the perfect company, other than that. RUN. There management advancement system is terrible."
good,When beginning the shift I would always ask what to expect. We were always left in the store alone to run it. Management would constantly be in and out for personal reasons. It was a great job in the work sense. But when your Management lacks the whole team fails.
good,There was not enough communication between managers and the employees. The typical day was pretty easy I enjoyed the fact that we could take breaks whenever. The only bad and most inportant part was that nobody knew when their last day would be.
good,"Great compensation and benefits, but all great things come with a high price tag. when working in the corporate office the culture is complete different than operation"
good,the work it self is easy. essentially your just helping the driver finish his route faster. the diver are paid well and i don't know about the warehouse worker but the temporary driver assistants are used and thrown out
good,Lot of work and very little compensation or appreciation.  Management was very aloof and detached. This is a job that is OK for the short term but not the long term.
good,It's was ok to work for ups but not eoungh hours I was a loader so that means I was loading the truck it was a easy job but the pay didn't match the work
good,"UPS is a trap. they bate you in with rapid advancement and a great benefits package, but its all lies. you will only ever get to the part time supervisor position and never be able to move up there are no upper management positions available and if they are there filled by non qualified people from other buildings or areas. ups is for highschool students for a summer to put on your resume thats all. Terrible company to work for."
good,okay place to work if you like talking to people you don't no. very strict routine at UPS but its okay because everything gets done when it needs too.
good,Not exactly a great place to work for. There was a serious lack of respect and very mismanaged. the main reason for leaving was my immediate supervisor for our loading line was instigating a fist fight with a fellow co-worker and didn't feel safe working in that atmosphere.
good,"Its tough work place, and it's a good job to start off with, but not to stick with for a long period of time. It's hard on the body, but it tests the wil to work."
good,"A typical day is coming in and taking in drop off return packages for Amazon.com, or shipping packages for customers across the country and sometimes out of the country. If the customer did not provide a box for shipment, i would measure ad weigh the product and find the proper box. When the trucks would come in the evening to pick up everything I would help load the boxes on the truck. When the mail came in the afternoon, I would sort and notify the mailbox holders that they had mail."
good,"this job was account management job with leads and cold calling."
good,"It's an incredibly hectic place to work, the only real positives to it are the awesome benefits and a 50¢ raise each year.............................."
good,As my time here over the past 4yrs there is only so far you can advance within the company. I have worked 4 yrs and have not top over 50 cents for my annual evaluation since being promoted.
good,"The UPS package design and test lab is a great place to intern. The lab itself has a plethora of testing equipment (Lab is ISTA certified). Interns and employees are given adequate experience with both ASTM and ISTA testing procedures. This whole experience is hindered by horrible management in both the direct manager and the lab manager. I'd definitely recommend this as a place to intern, but wouldn't consider working here full time."
good,Great team members. Upper management had no clue on what was really going on. Supervisor was always willing to train you so that you would know how each department functioned. The pay was horrible for such a large company. No wonder they can't keep clerks!
good,I am over worked and over stressed. Upper management is not trust worthy while my immediate  management team cares. this job is a grind and not for the faint of heart
good,This is one company where I had the chance to meet and deal directly to the Managing Directors/Purchase head of various MNC Companies and also deal with high end distributors and dealers and how to close the deals and get the deals.
good,"Answered phones, data entry, scanned documents, helped in dispatch, etc. Worked part time but full time hours with little benefits. Lots of yelling and arguing, customers weren't happy bc deliveries were getting there late."
good,Great place to work but totally ruined by management and there bully boy tactics. Work/life balance is non existent and warehouse staff are totally understand appreciated
good,"I have learned that when your create a space of organization and as much routine as possible in this fast pace industry, the work day is smoother and the flow will continue with a  team thats on board. "
good,"This job was ok , I wouldn't recommend this job ONLY because you don't have guaranteed hours . You only work for like 4 hours a day . The management is unorganized"
good,the workplace in which I worked was a decent workplace. The only problems that may be for some employees is that the work can get very strenuous and the breaks at not long enough.
good,It was ok. Management and chain of command couldve been better. I learned to focus on the task at hand dont try to fix situations that affect teamwork. Hardest part of work was trying to be humble about factors that caused less production.Micromanagement failed at assessing problems with solutions.
good,"a typical day at UPS is 10 to 12 hours, long days and nights, however those long day give you endless knowledge of the transportation industry as you grow as a manager your experience will be fulfilling,The workplace culture is different jobs at UPS, it wouldn't be fair to rate the whole company just based on one division or job function, Hardest part of the job is the hours, not seeing your family and trying to keep yourself healthy, Most enjoyable part of the job with out a doubt is the people, you will develop friends that last a lifetime at UPS, You will spend 75% on your time with them so finding someone to connect  with makes it enjoyable"
good,"If you can work at a fast pace, lift 80 lbs. on your own, and pay close attention to detail then this is the job for you.  This is a warehouse job so don't expect the conditions to be squeaky clean.  Also, whatever the weather conditions are outside, then they are the same inside the warehouse.  Be sure to properly dress for the job, and adhere to all safety constraints to avoid injury and accident."
good,"A typical day at UPS was busy with nonstop working. I learned how to effectively manage my time and work productively and safely in my environment. The management was fair, they were very interactive with the staff. My co-workers as well were very helpful and friendly they made the workplace better. Ultimately, the work hours were unreasonable which made the job very hard. However, I enjoyed meeting new people and learning new skills and that made the job better."
good,"Overall, very extreme work and hard labor. I learned to get an education so that I wouldn't have to be a material handler for 30 + years. Management wasn't working with my school schedule. Hours were not flexible and mainly short. The hardest part of job was keeping the conveyer belt free of boxes and most enjoyable part was leaving work."
good,Its ok just not organize do understand you at times.I learned how to do different things It was a job not for a career can't speak for everybody.
good,"Working hours are short, but work is every weekday (barring national holidays). "
good,I would not work there again. The management adopted an archaic view on training and personal man to man management with which I was not accustomed nor found conducive to an effective working environment.
good,"The work always comes first before your life balance. Once you fill a position they do not let you advance until they find a replacement which could take a very long time. I notice those who make errors get promotions. The union comes first and they are highly paid drivers and full time hub workers. As for management be a specialist or a full time supervisor. Otherwise you become a manager and your really their work slave with a little more money. I wonder how they expect people to fill PT supervisor positions positions with so little pay. Most of all they tell you what you wanna hear and lie to you so that you stay at the company. Leadership is a total joke. If your in any type of PT supervisor, specialist, or admin position, and try to join the union just forget it its very hard to go drive to  make the real money. They place so much work on you with little pay in management. If you were management in the 90s and are still there then your good. Otherwise management careers are a joke unless you move high up."
good,"The work is demanding, the people were friendly, and the job was not safe. The will give you classes on how to effectively do your job and you are paid for taking the class."
good,"I walked in the door and automatically had things to do. Whether it be to package boxes and ship them out, or printing projects on the computers. The graphic designer is an absolutely amazing person and became one of my best friends."
good,Het wordt niet altijd feedback gegeven over goeimogelijkheiden waaroor het kan dat jij lang stil staat.
good,"If you work for an airline and do not take advantage of the travel benefits, it is a total waste of your time and energy. Traveled to all continents with the exceptions of Australia, Africa and Antarctica. Very flexible.. Heard its even better now that it is Delta and non union"
good,"Great company to work for "
good,My typical day is waiting on customers who want to ship items all over the world. I love my other co workers. The hardest part of the job is having to work in a building when the air is broke.
good,I really enjoy communicating with customers by providing great customer service and leaving them with a great impression
good,"I have been at UPS for 10 years and have been in management for eight. A typical day is very intense and can be a lot of fun. But there can also be a lot of negativity. Overall I have learned a ton about how to manage people, how to be a great operator, and about the high demands of the shipping industry. The people I work with are great and I have made a lot of friends over the years. The hardest part of my job is when I come in on a hot summer day and we have a ton of work to do. It gets a lot harder to motivate your employees to get the job done...but we still get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my day is at the end of the day when we have accomplished our goals and the building has hit its production plan"
good,"while I was there it was a fun place and had nice customers, but it just wasn't the place for me, I had some bad experience with one of the workers bullying me but I paid no attention"
good,"A typical day working at UPS.....unorganize and irritating; Management was awful overall but there are some good men and women is management there; co-workers was respectable; the hardest part about working at UPS was the little hours they provide, overworking during those hours and picking up your speed because another working isnt as fast or simply dont want to work and the most enjoyable part of the job was vacation time"
good,"This company is so money oriented they do not really care about their customers nor their employees. They will approve anything without thinking about the cost in the long run. They will go out of business if they do not take their customer and employees into consideration. They do not allow for overtime for my position and they expect you to be available when they want you there. Typical work days are ok, but the management team can sometimes be demanding without courtesy. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the attitudes of drivers, customers, and customer reps."
good,"Order pulling, shipping & receiving. Truck loading & unloading. Inventory cycle counts & adjustments. Trained temporary employees hired for the peak season. Worked long hours & sometimes seven days."
good,Unloading semi trailers for about 4-5 hours a day. The supervisors and management do not really care about the employees. All they want is the the job done as quick as possible as they micro manage you and watch every move basically.
good,"Work days are too long"
good,"Metro college is only successful for the highly organized, extremely driven college students.  It was very hard to work third shift and attend college full-time.  Many of my peers who had been at UPS a lot longer than I had already dropped out of college because they were unable to be successful."
good,Working at 2am was bad. I didn't like waking up to unload a 60' trailer by myself while you have three other managers watching you and screaming at you. Worse job I ever had and I would never do it again. To be a package handler your whole life there's really no future. I wanted to grow with the company but I didn't see no future.
good,Moved and scanned items during Christmas season.  Worked with a team who helped complete tasks.  Required to complete tasks in a timely manner
good,"I think if they had more trainers, and the trainers spent more time with each new hire, they would keep more employees for a longer period of time."
good,"Making sure trucks arrive back on time and packages are not left behind. Fix all time cards on a daily basis for payroll and load the truck and make sure it get to the airport on time every evening before the plane leaves.  "
good,It is a good place to gain good health care benefits. The insurance was wonderful to have towards raising a family. The learning experience was good too.
good,"It was a good experiance, Decent compensation, expection for managment, however end users and external clients was a blast to work with"
good,i enjoyed my 5 years stay in the company specially the community service they have. helping those less fortunate and able to meet other ups employee.
good,rahat bütün sorumluluk çalışanda olduğu için iyiydi.bir aile ortamında gibi oluyor.
good,"Load packages on conveyer belts and on delivery trucks,Pack and seal products and materials. Assist with unloading trucks, and stack materials in accordance to instructions."
good,"• Unload packages on conveyor belts and on delivery trucks"
good,"A typical day would consist of a steady work flow, you get a ten minute break and then work until the flow is over. You must ensure that all paper-work is done at the end of the sort, observe all employees to ensure that they are working safe and following the belt to car methods in order for them to load the packages properly into the cars."
good,"reports"
good,"Daily customer contact helping customers with packaging"
good,"After my 8 months in 2011 the company wasnt stable, it closed the warehouse i was working in laying off hundreds of workers."
good,a typical day at work great customers which makes a huge difference because the owner is very personal leaves you  with all the work while she takes care personal business.Otherwise my co workers are o.k. we help each other alot the hardest part of the job is customers who dont want to pay for their large heavy items to get shipped cross seas.The most enjoyable part of the day is when every regular comes to pick up and their package arrived.
good,"A typical day working at UPS was simple. The hours were short and very fast paced. Maintaining a high level of safety was always the first priority. Efficiency and working as a team with your loading partner are essential skills needed to complete tasks. Often, I was given the chance to train associates new to the job. Your loading partner and other associates on your dock made the job competitive, often encouraged by management. By management fueling the competitive attitude, this made them slightly more approachable. The most difficult part of the job was working short hours and given few opportunity to advance in the company. The most enjoyable part of the work experience at UPS was thriving in a competitive environment and training new employees."
good,"What can you say, it's a temp job. There is a long list of drivers trying to secure a full time spot."
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting guests with their shipping and receiving needs. If they need a computer they would rent one from us and print their documents in black and white or color. I would assist them with the correct printer. Once their documents are printed normally they'd like to scan and email or fax their documents,i would then preform those jobs for them. Many guest come in needing business cards , if they have their PDF file then I would create their business cards. I can also laminate and bind. On my down time at work I would organize all of our supplies."
good,The days are unnecessarily long. I did learn a great deal about leadership and productivity. As with any company there are stronger and weaker managers. The hardest part is dealing with upper management indecisiveness. The most enjoyable part is...
good,Could be a great place to work if people did not have ego issues. Typical work day was long and sometimes very stressful. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn how to deal with people and hold them accountable for their actions. I love dealing with customers and vendors learning when people were trying to scam you and how to deal with them without  degrading them but giving them the opportunity to do the right thing. It was really rewarding watching customers and vendors change while allowing them to maintain their dignity. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upper management  that had no clue as to what was going on or how thing were suppose to function in order to accomplish company objectives.
good,have to know someone to get in here if you don't know someone you will never get anything but seasonal and you'd be lucky to get more than one season
good,"The job consisted of lifting, sometimes heavy, packages and building walls with them from the front of the trailer to the back. The boxes have a bar code with a zip code on them that you need to scan so the system knows where it's going. You need to pay attention that the zip code is the one assigned to that trailer. The job was a workout so I enjoyed that. The hardest part was dealing with the temperature regulation in the trailers; for instance if it was hot outside it would be hotter in the trailer, and if it was cold it would be colder."
good,Was really fun i enjoyed my coworkers and even my boss. It was oko
good,"I worked as a temporary hire for the holiday season. The long and short of it is that management and H.R. are absolutely honest when they say that the work is physically challenging through your entire shift. Preloading is a tough position that many people can't stay doing because of the demands."
good,"Very micomanaged company, not a great place to work! Good decent people!"
good,I have no comment on this work position other than it wasn't for me
good,"Managers were very unprofessional, communication was limited and was treated as a underage employee. As a casual driver it should have been there responsibility to communicate with more accuracy and details rather than call at last minute before travel expenses were not paid....many out of pocket expenses."
good,This is a great job for people who want free health insurance.
good,I worked for UPS as a temporary employer. I was treated as if I didn't belong. I worked hard and was even offered a supervisor position by my immediate supervisor but was shut down by management because I came in as a Temp
good,"I love the work that i do, however the management is horrible. To many favorites in the company and the only way for advancement is if you are friends with the management."
good,I enjoyed working with thiscompany only down fall was there weren't enough woman well I was the only woman ..other than that over all I just didn't get enough work that's all
good,worked for UPS for 15 years.  Typical work days were busy and interactive with upper management to oversee incentive contracts.  Assigning teams to projects was key in development of new and existing procedures.  Always a challenge to keep up with technology to have the most accurate information available.
good,"A place to learn with good knowledge sharing."
good,"Upper management doesn't care about your work-life balance. It is all a farce. A typical day is 12-14 hours min. All thought you can learn a lot working for UPS, they do train people well. They also focus more on the negative then positive. Daily conference calls are a must, otherwise known as the daily beatings. The most enjoyable part of the job, your coworkers and all so the worst. The culture is no longer what it used to be, since it went IPO and they hire board-members from outside of the company who only look at the bottom line. If your looking for long term here, don't. You might make it to retirement as a union-member if you don't injure yourself.But as management, good luck! sincerely ! good luck!"
good,"For abou 5 and a half hours, just running to doors dropping off packages."
good,Culture moves slow here.  Constant battle to get information to do your job minimally.                                                                                         
good,A typical day at work can be from relaxing to stressful.  The co workers were very helpful to each other and the company.  Management worked to be efficient on their own but not together. 
good,"En realidad ups para mi fue una escuela alli aprendi mucho y le agradesco por darme la oportunidad de estar alli , y me retire ya que me ofrecieron mejor salario del que tenia en ups , mis compañeros como en todos lados normal amigos si tengo aun alli y mi trabajo me encantaba"
good,"Great place to work, great opportunity for first time supervusors to learn the business of 3PL industry!"
good,I was only called 2 or 3 days. I wanted more work. I wanted to work all of the month of Dec and make some money.
good,"Fuel, wash and clean UPS vehicles. Secure all packages within service building. Learned UPS process and to drive UPS package vehicles while on property. Co workers are good at resolving issues within our work group without much need for management intervention. Management is tolerant of union presence and activities. Hardest part of the job is knowing I am exposed to potential life altering substances within the building both knows and unknown. I enjoy the working relationships with my fellow union employees. I have a good relationship with most management level employees at UPS."
good,"A typical day would be busy at times and slow the next minute, I learned alot from this job.. I learned to distribute mail and how to ship, pack and estimate on non-packaged items.. Hardest is trying to give an estimate on things that are not boxed or packed correctly and enjoyable part is working with the owner and my co-workers."
good,"UPS overall was a good company to work for, unfortunately I was recently married and needed to spend more time with my wife, that's why I decided to change career paths in to a more manageable work enviroment that will allow me to balance my work life with my family time."
good,"was a good place to work during peak times but not so good off season times,safety enforcement by management was ignored alot"
good,It was a good stepping stone into the shipping business. Helping customers make good shipping choices. Co-workers were good to work with. Hardest part of the job is trying to up-sell to a customer who does not want overnight shipping.
good,Working for Ups was great. I enjoyed working there the work was not difficult. i enjoyed my co-workers and managers.
good,"I looked foward to coming to work, because I was able to meet new people. I loved learning new things. The owners trusted me to open their store in the mornings, which allowed me to obtain management skills."
good,Some of the values and policies put into place by the company are not followed through by people in positions of power in management.
good,no advancement alot of work with not enough emoployees... to much work and not enough pay
good,I work from 3:30 am to about 6-7am i inter packages into a computer
good,This position required lots more training that the company didnt have very much support in giving us. You will need to be able to teach yourself as well as use the materials to enhance your job responsibilities.
good,I enjoy my position because most days it keeps me on my toes and busy so that I won't become bored or restless. I've learned to try to have a organized and constructive work goal everyday to stay on top of things.
good,"A job that keeps you busy all day long. I am a little hurt after seasonal I was kept a little longer and was let go. I was told I was a shoe in to get another job within the company once something opened up. They gave me the old "" I'll let you know within 2 weeks, next week, 2 days, etc etc... After 2 months I was left with nothing but false hope"
good,"I worked very hard here built business from when we first opened doors for five years. Built alot of friendships with customers. I only had two co workers and those were my daughters. Hardest part of the job was really trying to please the owner. He is the type of person that you could never do enough to please him. Most enjoyable was my regular customers, knowing what they neeeded before they even asked."
good,This operation was under contract with an internet based company. They dropped the ball and laid off 433 people.UPS should have had another account lined up when the company decided to quit outsourcing and fill their own orders. I will not work for UPS SCS or UPS again.
good,At only 8 dollars an hour you will feel as if you're deserving of more based on the work being asked of you. Management could at times would treat the workers as if they were nothing.
good,"Although the UPS culture is slowly transitioning to meet the minimal needs of the current workforce, the traditional ideas and expectations of managers that ""grew"" up in the company continue to prevail. Unfortunately,  they will continue to negatively impact the newcomers, their new ideas and fresh perspectives"
good,Just work hard and come to work on time. Make sure u know your hours because will try to cut hours off your check and if u don’t know your times they will not give you your money
good,"I supervise 50 to 80 drivers daily. I handle incoming customer concerns and issues. I do payroll, and all aspects of office duties. I am a great multitasker."
good,"UPS Stores are a franchise so working skills vary. Good place for first a time job. Repetitive. A little room for growth. Each store is privately owned so it's up to the owner if they provide benefits such as vacation pay or paid time off, etc."
good,"Majority of the time it was a relaxing environment as the people that would often go there were regulars. However, there were times especially around the holidays where it got hectic and chaotic. The scheduling would be managed accordingly, but there were issues concerning who could work certain days. The hardest part of the job was when there were objects being shipped out that were beyond our capability to pack."
good,"For this position, it was only a seasonal job. I left 3 works to dedicate to this but it only last 3 weeks. I only worked 18 days. I worked really hard to try to continue.. And now, it finished and I'm without work... I bet everything on that job and now I'm unemployed. "
good,"Great pay. Horrible hours. "
good,"UPS is one of the worst companies to work at. The environment is nothing but screaming and belittling the hourly employees. During the busy season, it isn't uncommon to see packages getting smashed and breaking"
good,"Everyday offered experiences that made you look at each one from different points of view. Some of which people agreed with, others they did not, but we had to find the most efficient solution."
good,people working at ups were lazy. my bosses werent the greatest. i always would finish the job i was assigned early and would need to help other people because they didnt want to work.
good,"Some issues with lower management, but upper management will work with you.  True to their open door policy.  advancement opportunities available, but benefits are rather expensive"
good,"This job requires muscle and mental focus. The hours are not flexible and can change slightly depending on seasons. Managers are helpful, but coworkers may not be so. There is some chance of advancement after much time put into the job. The company is inclusive and efficient at paperwork. It is not an easy job, but can be learned."
good,"Only way to look at it is that you get paid to work out. If you are good on the dock, the supervisor will not help you advance in the company. They assign you double the work tasks than other workers because they are lazy."
good,A flex supervisor covers off shift hours and has to push the loading of trucks on a tight schedule. There is a division of labor due to union rules and managers are discouraged from helping the loaders.
good,it’s hard work takes a toll on your body physically and mentally but a great way of being outside enjoying the weather as well as getting to know different people and businesses and getting along with your coworkers.
good,"the only good thing about this company is the benifits if can stick around to get them, all they care about is numbers not the people you are under paid slaves there"
good,Management at good ole UPS is all about kissing your higher up persons butt. You have to work extremely long hours and they don't take family or life into consideration.
good,The job itself is not bad. Its ok. Im only upset that they promised me $17 an hour and without letting me know they dropped it back down to $14. They owe me money from 3 checks and Ive complained to them and they have done nothing to help me out. Im over it. Need a new job.
good,Only certain people advance within UPS and if you don’t fit the ever changing mold opportunities are limited. Culture is improving slowly but from a poor base
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Worked there for a few months before I broke my foot "
good,"As a seasonal helper, don't expect much communication from management/supervisor. You wait for someone to call if you are needed. If you are not needed, nobody notifies you. They tell you that you must be available from 10 am - 7 pm.  Basically, you need to have a good work relationship with the driver you are assisting.  They will be communicating with you about work. There isn't any time to take a lunch break nor a restroom break. The seat that the helper sits in, on the truck, is unsafe and not ergonomically correct to sit in for 8 + hours. "
good,not as bad as people say it is but it was decent. Really depends on if your supervisor is cool or not because you will spend a lot of time with them if you are sorting but other than that it’s a decent job now that the pay is 13 a hour
good,"UPS pays its seasonal tractor-trailer drivers (aka feeder drivers), very well, but it's A LOT OF WORK. You will work anywhere from 12-14 hours DAILY...5 days a week. Sometimes 6 days. Kiss your social life goodbye."
good,Good work environment. I enjoy the people I converse with. Work isn’t really hard. There is opportunities to advance. Everyone seems to have goals they want to accomplish. I enjoy it but will like to have more
good,"It was a great experience, but they need to practice safety more.  Because while was doing the sorting assignment, I had to stop several times, as people were constantly passing back and forth."
good,Work life balance is out the window with this company. Politics play a major role on your promotion. Pay is good but it end at that. Thus me looking for another job.
good,"Great place to work for seasoning job. I enjoyed doing the job and feel its a great way to stay in shape. unfortunately in my experience, there was incompetent management."
good,"Driving a lot of different places, make sure packages are delivered to the correct address.  Learn the different areas of town. Need to work together as a team."
good,"A lot of people know of someone with horror stories from UPS, but I'll point out the positives. Some people in management truly do care about their employees and want them to succeed. These people are quickly stifled by corporate's inability to treat people as people. But ninety percent of the year, when the corporate goons arent breathing down everyone's necks, the employees and management  just do their best to push through the ridiculous expectations set by people who dont understand what it takes to put up the numbers"
good,Management needs to learn how to treat employees and part time supervisors better.  Not enough training learn as you go way too understaffed but they say they are overstaffed but nobody shows up.
good,I was very fast paced and great customer service but no help honestly . The people were very nice as far as the customers and I love helping others ..
good,"I had just moved to Dallas so i was in need of a job quickly. I got the job pretty fast but the job as a whole is pretty poor. Management is not good at, salary is a joke, and work environment is overall poor. If you need a job for the moment i guess it won’t be bad."
good,None. I have no comment. Not at this time. I would not like to put any company in a situation that would cause the company to look bad or none approachable.
good,Great place if you are in college or in between jobs. The culture is nothing like they appear in news headlines. People work against each other and dont help others get ahead
good,Worked as a sorter and package loader at a distribution warehouse.  Worked on multiple jobs dependent on what they needed.  Worked the early morning shift.
good,Sometimes they don’t pay you what you need and don’t give u the hours that your looking for so I would talk to the manager about the paying and time able to work
good,"Management at the Lafayette Facility of UPS is terrible. The Operations Full-time Supervisor is great and consistantly works with everyone on his team. The Facility Manager, however, is old, crusty, and ready to retire. He's always right, or else he's always right. He will undo all attempts to improve the facility, and then complain about the issues that WERE PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED and continue to ask Supervisors why they haven't solved the issue. Definitely 1/10 for the ToddFather."
good,"Fast paced and physically demanding for both loaders and drivers.  Critical thinking is not a requirement for management, and problems are often left to union employees to figure out.  Drivers wages are excellent but will work long hours."
good,"Most of the managers micro-manage, so there is always someone behind you about tasks.  Managers worry a lot about their positions.  Advancement does not come easy, it depends on your network."
good,U loved the people that i worked with that trained me real good and also helped me out if i needed it . it was a fast paced environment. You had to be able to work fast and also be able yo work in yhe cold weather.
good,"The job itself is interesting and I learned a great deal about shipping. Unfortunately, the environment was toxic and management did not always follow the very rules they set. Worst of all, we were held accountable for things out of our control and this impacted how much of a raise we got."
good,The New Smart Hub in Atlanta is poorly ran especially the Twilight sort. The room for advancement is all about favorites. If you are young please do not become complacent and stuck there.
good,Its a ok work area to work in and make good money.. and I like the pay every week and over time is good too.. I would like to work there for the winter season
good,"The work is repetitive and consistent. The work isn't hard. Management is only about work getting done, they are not concerned about employees. The pay is decent for the work."
good,The job was a good job to do didn't have any difficult work just had to be fast and quick paced. I like the experience at UPS turned out to be a good job in the end
good,"The Seattle UPS hub is completely dysfunctional, from upper management on down to the hourly workers. It's a crab bucket with no opportunities for advancement, despite what they say or promise. It's definitely a job if you need one."
good,This job was fast paced. Data entry was sometimes hard to do. It was a hard place to work with all the forklift drivers and little space. Too cold to work in the winter.
good,My coworkers were more helpful than the supervisor I was judged  from the supervisor and disliked from the beginning he would always threaten to replace you.
good,Great if they kept me. They said I could remain at UPS which is unheard of after seasonal. I was last helper to stay on until mid Feb helping drivers and jumping for them. But when I went to find the person I needed to to speak too that said I could remain as employee but needed to start in warehouse was no where to be found when my job as jumper ended he went on vacation and I needed a job that day so I found another job. Maybe I will try again this year and get my foot in door again. I know it takes forever to be a driver but that's the job I will eventually get.
good,They treat their employees better than their frontline supervisors. They limit your hours and expect you to stay after your time is up and help finish up off the clock as a frontline supervisor.
good,Great benefits package. Hourly wage poor. Asks for more than you can give.  Hypocritical.  Unethical. Poor communication between departments. Unrealistic goals.
good,"The workplace morale is terrible, stemming from upper management. There are a few fulltime supervisors that truly care about their employees but the rest only care to please the managers. For every positive, management will point out 5 negatives. Managers doesn't  develop their supervisors at all!!"
good,During my time at UPS I worked as a part time supervisor however there was little room for advancement. I have a Bachelor degree in Business but I was not afforded to compete for the corporate positions.
good,Horrible management they have no training they do not know how to talk to there workers I complained and nothing was ever done. Starting from HR down to the rest of the company they just ignore your complaints.
good,"fast paced, heavy lifting, high turnover, hardest part heavy lifting, enjoyable part short hours. Even though it was seasonal, more hours would be better."
good,Ups Freight was a great place to work other than the massive amount of turn over within staffing. New managers every 6 months it felt like. The company does not give you enough compensation for what they have you do during the day.
good,"The hardest part of the jobs was management micro-manage, the loading of each person loading trucks. one person to load four truck of 1500 packages of all sizes, from 1 LBS to 500 LBS onto theses truck in under three house just cant happen."
good,I really think that if I got more hours at this job then I wouldn't be looking for another one. We just really don't getpiad enough as inside workers because we don't get enough time
good,Not a job to live off.  It should be your 2nd. Not your primary. People stay cause of the benefits. Nothing else. An if your going to school. UPS benefits students
good,Working with very little supplies. Some employees are rude insubordinate. No surprise there is an extremely high turnover rate.  Management is a joke here!
good,A lot of work during peak season which I was hired for.  After peak season was laid off and told I would have a job within a few eeks  never materialized and I was strung along for months
good,"Working late everyday, after dark to deliver packages  to houses is dangerous. Example: dogs, walking up to customers door after dark, etc. The pay is not enough for the amount of work you do on a daily basis."
good,What was once an awesome job became an incredibly stressful and physically demanding source of mental and physical misery. 32 years was enough. I had to get out
good,A decent part-time workplace. Duties are straight-forward but may get complicated due to time frame required to finishing such assignments. Management needs improvement.
good,The environment is very hostile. You are micro managed on every aspect from uniform to how far you back your truck. Telematics is all seeing. Company doesn’t fallow the contract and you constantly have to get payroll corrections. Once your on route it is a great job.
good,They gave part time supervisors like myself full benefits.  And we were guaranteed 27.5 hrs a week.  They were extremely strict on OT and would make you report 27.5 hrs even if you worked more.  Advencement was very tough and your overall job responsibilities were not reflected in your review.  which was only .25 cent to .50 cent raise
good,"This is a franchise job so YMMV, both stores on Commercal Street are owned by the same folks. Great day helping people, mad customers do exist but the area was mostly nice people. Manager needs to delegate more, and empower the employees. Pay is pretty poor, and benefits don't exist. No PTO or insurance."
good,"Everyday is a different day with different loads, management could use improvement in some aspects, very physical but overall provides education assistance to those who want to purse their education"
good,the whole job was great honestly i actually enjoyed working it but my boss was so unbearable on 2 occasions did he refer to a customer in an inappropriate way and he also cussed me out once even for me saying what he was doing wasn't right and that i refuse to do it if the boss was even slightly better i would've stayed for years
good,It was a seasonal position it did not pay well I was in need of a job so I took it. I was working in Long island so the site in Brooklyn shuttled us every day.
good,Company seems to be driven by profit with no regard to employee morale and no work life balance to speak of. Employee recognition is unheard of and upper management always wants more even when goals are met.
good,"I would hope there is increased transparency and better communication from all levels of management, along with placing serious value on strengths and attributes to help me succeed long term with UPS. My credibility should be based on my sincerity and truthfulness in preforming daily tasks. Accurate and complete reporting of information should be consistently provided. Allowing us to voice genuine concerns that may lead to overall improvement within operations should be a priority as a HR Representative. I continue to take responsibility for my own actions, dedicating myself to continue improvement. Positive feedback from management should be improved. The team as a whole is undervalued. I am certain that my strengths are underutilized and I am fearful that I am often positioned for failure. Treating co-workers, customers and stakeholders with dignity and respect should be improved, while exhibiting a sincere interest in the well-being of other UPSers."
good,"I do enjoy my job here at UPS but a lot of the downsides here is that  there is no room for advancement, hours do not work with my school hours, and customers can be very insensitive about you and your job. My experience working here was mostly positive when I first started but it has turned into something that I no longer enjoy. I dread coming in most days, the gist of it all is that we are basically an Amazon drop off location and nothing else. We get more drops offs then we do actual shipments and that is what i dread the most. There is no excitement and no interest when interacting with most customers and you are always blamed for a problem that they are too lazy to fix or just something that is not in your control or fault. I hope most of you do not feel like this, but after being here for a little more over a year, I can honestly say I regret this job and wish I went in another direction. Management is amazing but it is the atmosphere of the store that just seems sour and negative."
good,"Its quick paced, everyone who works the graveyard shift is only there to get paid and get out. Good place to start off. I would be more firm about hourly wages. 10.50 isn't that great for graveyard shift plus the hours aren't stable. sometimes 12 hours sometimes barely 3."
good,"Great job if you like to work hard, have no family commitments, or a re a student who needs their days free.  The hours can range from 3 to 12 a day.  Start  time also is different every day based on package volume.  Supervisors spend most of the time yelling and looking at their phones, and for the most part you get a unfriendly answer if you ask a legitimate question.  So if you like to work as hard as you possibly can, while being yelled at to work harder, not paid much, no set hours, minimal breaks, this job is for you!!"
good,People need to leave to be able to make it to a second job or so there spouse can sleep due to them working a F/T job then told to choose job or wife.
good,UPS is a great national company but one position inside the location is stressful is package handler. This position pays only $10.50 per hour and they overwork you.
good,Operations is lacking...work setting very difficult to grow....computer data and information is very poor or no help...very out dated...too many holes in operations to move in a positive manner
good,"working at ups is challenging and stressful at times it require u to move at a fast pace in such a short period of time, also there lack of hours and management skill is quite poor"
good,I worked for UPS in the Industrial Engineering department for a very short time and it was a great experience right out of college.  I was able to learn from some senior engineers and get great knowledge of how such a large operation worked.
good,Try it for yourself and find out if it works for you.  If it works out then this job is for you.  Make sure you can handle the stress and fast pace especially if you are part of management.
good,I worked the graveyard shift and it was tiring all of the time. being able to lift heavy objects like tires was difficult but the other people working with me were fun and nice.
good,I did not get as many hours as I wanted while working here. The managers were very rude and did not help like I wished they would. The coworkers were nice.
good,This is a very physically demanding occupation that will take all of your time away from your family. There’s is no regard about your family life from managers but you are compensated very well. The benefits are great and the retirement plan is good as well.
good,"I was working there during the Peak season. It was a lot of work and OT offered during that time but after that, UPS starts to laid off the seasonal workers that don't do a lot or have poor attendance record. Also its hard to make it to Union, I have heard that you have to work really really hard and at a very fast paced to keep up of the work flow."
good,"Ups is a big company so it’s hard to move up in the promotion aspect. I love working here, but it’s time for a change. I want to be apart of a company where I can be more valuable and move up the ladder."
good,"Driver helpers are tasked with helping to load and unload equipment onto vehicles. In some jobs, they may accompany the driver to various job sites to assist with lifting, pulling out from driveways and parking lots, and watching traffic at intersections."
good,Its a job to fill tome of you need the extra money. If you are looking to apply go with the truck driver route. they get much better benefits than instore employees.
good,"My current job is very challenging, it satisfies my fulfillment as a dedicated employee.  However, the job work and life balance is really hard to manage because of the workloads assigned to me."
good,One time I was not paid when I worked. The work environment is stressful and you must be able to keep up at a certain pace for many minutes at a time with packages that sometimes are consistently heavy.
good,"Tough to get promoted. Hours are hard to come by. Employees treated unfairly. If you want to get into management, you start out as a part time supervisor and barely get any hours each week."
good,"For a billion dollar company UPS is cheap and frugal. The company pays minimum wage to Union employees and treats them poorly. Full time supervisory positions, let alone just full time positions, are not abundant. They are tough to come by and depends on who you know versus how you perform or how deserving you are for a promotion."
good,Company continues to cut cost by taking from management.  Middle management is salary so they are expected to work longer hours to ensure hourly management employees dont get overtime.
good,"First, the big pro is pay. After that is goes steadily downhill. From being contacted outside of work hours about work business that can take 15 min to 1 hour to deal with, to upper level management treating you as garbage/dispensible, the feel of the company is they don't care about YOU and YOUR TIME. They only care about their bottom line. I know this is true for most companies, but others try to hide it. UPS blantantly comes out and has a ""screw you"" attitude about it. Full time jobs are very very rare."
good,"enjoyed the job. too much insecurity. never knew when, if, or where you would be working, day to day. but I did enjoy the camaraderie with co-workers and being able to navigate my own routes."
good,You have to be ready to work going into ups. It is very tiresome. Its like working out times 10 . you have to stay hydrated and energized and well rested .
good,"Had the same driver every day, driver was awesome, we had the Valley Mall area so it was very busy. UPS itself is very unorganized. Management seemed to be marginal at best. They couldn't even find my last check. Never called to let us know they didn't need us anymore so I drove to meet my driver, never showed up as I later found out we weren't needed anymore. As a huge company that is also union they didn't seem very streamlined at all. I learned what a UPS driver usually goes thru on a daily routine though and with all the experience I have and learning the job the first day it can be hectic, especially if an overnight truck is late arriving at the hub.Over all I would give the experience and the driver a 10 but the UPS hub itself a 6."
good,"It is a fast-paced job with little room for error. You have to learn quickly and work fast. It is very demanding on your body, but the trick is learning a routine that works for yourself."
good,"To many leadership issues nobody wanted to lead properly. Work environment was like a slaveship, and the pay is terrible. Worked you to death and didnt compensate nearly enough."
good,"I loaded and unloaded trucks for ups inside the warehouse. The job wasn’t too hard although some packages could be quite heavy. You must begin working inside the warehouse for $9 per hour and wait until a driver either retires, quits or is laid off in order to become a driver yourself (when I was at UPS the estimated wait to become a driver was 3 years). Drivers make very good money and they can get off work anywhere between 6 to 11 pm depending on how quickly the deliver their packages and can get off as early as 5 if they decided to skip lunch. Drivers begin delivering at 9 am, Monday through Friday. Warehouse (part-time) workers begin at 5 pm and work until around 11 or midnight Monday through Friday as well."
good,separating boxes for delivery memorizing building addresses in area very simple but fast paced and exhausting hardest part would be lifting the boxes and using hand truck properly most enjoyable is the hour lunch break
good,"I liked the work except that it was exhausting. As a driver helper, would go from 9 am until whenever the truck was empty. Could be 2pm or 9pm. The overtime was nice after the 8 hour mark each day. But don't bother if you can't keep active for a full day of hard work"
good,drove around the county delivering packages during the holidays was easy laid back sometimes had to shovel out the truck driver i was paired with was awsome
good,"You have zero chance of becoming a full-time employee regardless of performance. For this reason, I recommend that you DO NOT pay union dues if you're a temporary employee. You are nothing more than an inexpensive way to get them out of a bind. Take the money, but have something in the works for December 26th..."
good,the pay is very low at ups. it would be a lot better if we had more hours during the week. It can be very easy at times but the risk of being hurt on a daily is very high no matter how small or big.
good,"UPS asks a lot of its employees. As it is a time constrained delivery service, this creates and environment where stress levels can become escalated very quickly and sometimes severely. The time spent at work, as in number of hours on the clock, is in exchange for the great benefits provided by the company. Pay rates are high and many employees are protected by the union. Expect to spend many hours away from family events and other things while you earn the previous two."
good,"It was very military like and I did not feel they appreciate me."
good,"Working as a seasonal driver's helper is a high stress, extremely physical job. The current UPS pay rate is less than Fed Ex and most other seasonal positions (it will go up to $13/ hr in 2019) and you will also be required to join the union even though they admittedly do nothing for you; it's $200 to join and about $25 week (it will be 10-20% of what you make)! Make sure you keep track of your own hours, they will short you every chance they get! They give you impossible loads!"
good,"Typical day at work was pretty much unloading/ loading fleet trucks"
good,"this job is to dangerous, unsafe, and to hot for the amount u get paid. The pay is not worth it unless you want to have career with them in management or driving the trucks. that being said the pay may not be that good but there are some really great benefits like health insurance and discounts on all sorts of things but it takes a year to get most these benefits and most people quit before then because the work is to hard for them. they even tell you when you get hired you will not like this job at first."
good,"fast pace stacking boxes loading and unloading trailers. "
good,"Driver and delivery of packages, Lifting/movement of items, Active passing of Department of Transportation Physical and Drug Test , Loading, unloading, preparing, inspecting of delivery packages, Knowledge of all DOT regulations and safety standards"
good,Not a good family to work for. Bad attitudes. Pay very little expects to much. Mom n daughter operations. Hard headed stubborn and not willing to take advice to make progress. Daughters are lazy and do minimal. Moms always out of the country.
good,"It was a good job , the pay was good it was a good environment the ups workers would make it go by pretty fast they were nice and respectful. It was very laid back. The management was very horrible."
good,"sum training provided initially."
good,Working here as management is all about who you know. Once people were able to move up into new positions without a bachelor's degree. It is now strongly encouraged to have your degree or be working on your degree or you will be passed over for positions or new roles.
good,"There are no benefits when you are working for a franchise.  No dental, medical, or vision.  This is perfect ""starting out"" position but not a place to create a career"
good,If you like learning this is a nice job. There are many thing you'll be expected to learn. Relaxed at times but overall keeps you busy. Not a job to take seriously in the long run.
good,The work was fast-paced and started early in the day usually 4AM or earlier.  Management usually took an off handed approach to work issues and the supervisors had a wide range of abilities and competence.
good,Low wage for immense physical labor. Management worries only for management. You’re set up to fail at the start with poor training and minimal help from other workers.
good,"This job is a very stressful and hard job. It’s not even well explained in the job information section either. They have crazy goals you have to meet, you only get 20 minutes of break after a hard paced workout"
good,The company has changed considerably.  It is no longer the company that values it's long term employee.  On call and work swing shifts through November and December.
good,"My job is to fix the morning dispatch so we don't annoy and lose more customers and more drivers. Since I'm not allowed to work full-time, I come in the middle of the day and stay until everything is stable again. "
good,"I typically just jumped the belt of the trucks, which is when you start unloading one truck, but don't finish fully and then start on the next truck until someone catches up."
good,"There's a lot of confusion between management & supervisors."
good,High demand for following policies since it is a Union based job and there is always an issue with balancing what you can do and not do each day. Hiring has been a struggle with finding people who actually want to work.
good,Fast paced supervisors are young inexperienced most of them. Lot of them are to bossy like to shout at you. Makes you want to just leave.  You get treated like slaves for minimum wage.  That’s wrong
good,I got treated poorly and the union/management didn't want to help me at all. I got harassed and picked on more then everyone else which created an even more negative work environment. They preach about safety but i was always tripping over boxes on the floor.
good,I spent more time in training than I actually did doing my job.  They assured us that everyone who went to training would be guaranteed a job and that we would have sufficient warning before we had a shift; I was given twenty minutes warning before my only shift - a few days before Christmas.  By this point I had given up on them calling me and didn't expect any work from them.  If someone hadn't called in sick I wouldn't have gotten any work at all.
good,"The management there felt poor, no one knew how to answer my questions i had. Try to force workers to work pass the amount of time they are given. Also being mean towards workers."
good,"it's ok, and they do reward you if UPS is truly your career path. pretty good place, awesome co-workers too. the managers are great also, unfortunately the pay and the compensation for the hard stressful work you do do not align."
good,"Sucked, under employed, over worked, more sweat than money on the work week. very stressful, not enough to feed your family or pay any bills. i worked"
good,The place has horrible management. You can't move up unless you go into management too. You will only get 20 to 25 hours week unless peak time. You will constantly get told to work faster to make the numbers for managment. The only good thing about the company is benifits and that's it.
good,"Handled packages, helped customers package and ship packages to destination, scanned packages when customers would come to pick them up, sorted packages"
good,"Is too hard, because you never stop, 5 hours continue. If you go to restroom or similar you dont finish."
good,Ups was a great company but not goving much hkurs 4 hours a day cannot maintain a stable living. No job advancedment meeting deadlines amd not beimg recognized for
good,"The Hourly employees are all Union and have all the benefits. Each year the amount of management decreases and the amount of expected hours management works increases until it is not sustainable at 13-15 per day, day in day out all year long. Although UPS pays management well, you don't have a life outside, and once you put your actual hours to the calculator, the hourly employees you supervise make more money and work much less hours."
good,This job was a great job until they lost a lot of the management and just started throwing people in spots and not knowing what they were doing. I got injured and they sent me to the doctor and i couldn't move my arm but they gave me aspirin and asked me to come in the next day
good,"I was attending college and working third shift at UPS, because they offered to pay for schooling, this was nice but trying to work forty hours a week while being a full time student was somewhat difficult to manage."
good,"UPS is a fast pace environment and very time sensitive. A typical day at work starts out at 1 o'clock in the morning and package handlers start the loading process. Day consists of making new plans for the next day, printing and working on excel files. Attending at least three meetings/conference calls. Toughest part about the job is the long excruciating hours while being looked down upon no matter how hard you work. A lot of negativity and hardly any credit when things go right."
good,I liked this job jus expect how they would take advantage of you because your the new guy lol but besides that I was pretty cool just the part where you have to walk blocks is annoying
good,"longs hours...ok pay. good people to work with, you get a lot of long breaks, so it makes the time go by slow. plus you don't know how long you work that day, you work till the jobs done."
good,"Other than the fact I will recommend this company to others, I currently have no review of UPS. The company obviously have a long standing reputation and I don't have anything bad to say about it."
good,UPS is a great place to work is you are wearing a brown uniform and drive a truck. The warehouse crew and management staff are over worked and underpaid.
good,this was just a part time job. working for seasonal work. so it was maybe 3 months. I was helping the driver deliver packages to business and residential houses.
good,"UPS is a great job if you are looking for a good workout, it gets intense most of the time. And The longer you stay the more benifits you will receive."
good,I kind of enjoyed working here.  I ended up quitting because I had work from 3:00 a.m. until 7:00 a.m. and then I had school from 7:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  The manager would not let me trade shifts either despite openings being available.
good,Working graveyard killed all social life. Didn't pay that much for all the hard work you were doing. One manager in particular was a real jerk.  Basically worked with tired grumpy old guys loading trucks while a young dude bossed everyone around.
good,I have worked here for four years and have my degree and can not get promoted to full time status.  higher levels of management are disconnected from day to day operations
good,Great opportunity if you are needing to pay for school. Besides that it isn't a very good job for someone looking to spend time with their families. You miss out on a lot. The job isn't too bad but is tough work.
good,Management needs to communicate better. Co-workers were mainly pretty good to work with. Work life balance could be better. Forced overtime with some employees.
good,It was hard to work part-time with the demands of a double major. It was especially hard during peak season when we were working 10+ hours a night. I found it hard to focus during the day do to the third shift sleeping schedule.
good,UPS is a good company but the management is not on top of things and they harass and there's a lot of racism and UPS management that's why I think UPS needs to get new management and retrain a lot of the management I feel UPS can't be better but you did must clean house on management cuz there are so racist I think management needs to realize it's all about your employees know about yourself
good,Being a manager in a union shop has its challenges to say the least. Overall work experience was not bad but felt management and employees sometimes inhibited smooth work flow
good,"easy to balance life..."
good,"UPS is a great opportunity for people who just getting into the workforce, looking for something part time with some potential to grow in the company depending on your needs."
good,"The job itself is alright. The supervisors and managers never seemed to fully understand what was going on at any particular time. We were routinely told that the official table for sorting packages was wrong, and that what they told us was right. Except, that only seemed to be some of the time."
good,I was a seasonal helper and my driver was cool. But the work was annoying to work in the snow being paid 11 bucks an hour. It was an easy job though for the most part
good,The management at UPS didn't really do much besides watch over you. Feel like you were getting micromanaged the whole time.  Workers very competitive so things got heated once in awhile.
good,"good hourly pay but don't be surprise when you only work a couple of hours here and there!!!! especially in the smaller towns , some days didn't work at all,the longest day was about 5 hrs and thats it!!   we where told at orientation we need to turn uniforms in by january 19,2018 but went to pick my check up on january 5th and was told i needed to turn my uniform in before i could receive my check!!  First of all I live 45mins from this place and 2nd thats not what we were told in orientation!!  plus I wastold we would be working probably until the 2nd week of january atleast(that didn't happen)  The drivers are good guys to work with but managment needs work."
good,Management don't care about safety as they say. You are trained when you come in to be very careful not to fall not to hurt yourself but the way they run you so fast trying to meet quota you going to hurt yourself someone's going to be killed and I wouldn't have several times of someone hurting themselves on the bags rushing trying to move too fast to meet quota
good,"A typical day its stressful, hard work involved"
good,great benefits and pay but the management is horrible. when starting they might work you one day every 2 weeks. who can survive off that without other work? then even if you tell them about your other job they dont take it into consideration when they want you to work and want you to come in when they know youre at the other job.
good,Work was not bad in the call center environment. Typical calls were people getting tracking updates on their packages or calling to schedule pick ups in the package centers form the info notice. But you would get the typical customer who would complain that the drivers didn't ring the door bell or leave the package. They would demand things that could not be done. This was typically the case when the package contained a cell phone. Management was non engaging and would rather write you up rather than show you what you did was wrong and coach you to fix the issue. Weekends off was nice and so was weekly pay. Benefits package was the cheapest per check I have ever had in my working life.
good,fast paced and busy just poor pay and no benefits for a year. Was told when started that it would be Monday-Friday and ended up being Tuesday- Saturday.
good,"Not a bad place to work, working w/ people daily i loved but there was little to no room to grow and they also didn't offer paid days off or insurace."
good,"It was a really good job just wasn't enough hours for the pay that I was getting every week. I couldn't pay any bills with the job, the pay rate was good but the hours wasn't."
good,It just wasn’t for me I️ just felt I️ can do better for myself as far as a job I️ felt like the company overworked their laborers and underpaid them is all
good,I didn't like how the management acted when it was time to give out paychecks it was a mess in there on any day after 7 sheesh everything is on overload
good,"I can't lie and tell you this is a good place to work, that would be wrong. I will just tell you that after working here I am more organized and can fit boxes correctly anywhere at anytime because of the repetitiveness. This is a first job, not a forever job unless you want health insurance and crazy beautiful benefits."
good,"The UPS Store is a franchised company, locally owned and operated, packaging and shipping store. Duties include excellent customer service skills, ability to learn the different processes to package and ship various items in an effective manner."
good,"Monitor cost control and expenses"
good,They don’t pay you enough to work as hard as they expect you too. They tel you to hurry up. Even tho when they train you they tell you to work on your own pace.
good,Working hard for nothing in return. Decent place to use for tuition. Many may find it not worth it.  For the 2 years I worked at ups I've never encountered any problems with my employers.
good,"This is an extremely stressful environment. It's a warehouse job that only offers part time and doesn't pay as much as they should. It's great if you need help with college pay, because they pay for your school, but it's difficult to move up in the company and gain full time work."
good,Good experience amd very fast paced.earned how to work under pressure and get things where they need to be at the right place and right time. Had fun delivering packages.
good,"UPS is an OK part time job. It is an extremely demanding job, dealing with packages ranging from 35-70 pounds. It has job openings for all times of the day so thats a plus."
good,I left because I felt that UPS was not a place where a person without a degree could reach their full potential. There is little oversitght when it comes to yearly feedback about those who manage p/t supervisors which results in false reporting.
good,I worked at a UPS Store which is a little different than the greater UPS Company. The stores are independently owned and have their own set of guild lines as far as advancement in the workplace. After being there for almost 10 years it was time for me to find better pay and benefits.
good,"Very, very fast paced and very physical work.  Lots of time oriented goals and very much micro management.  Daily production goals and reviewed daily.  High accountability."
good,Work life balance is tough.  Work environment challenging with union vs. management.  Hours long with stressful work challenges and goals that seem unobtainable.
good,"Its a fast paced job, get a good workout from it and also competitive with your co-workers to see who can build better wall, Finnish the job faster and ex."
good,Did not like the culture environment you always had to watch your back. Upper management I felt was not very concerned about employees needs and development.
good,"The job is fast paced, stressful. You are underpaid for the amount of work you actually do. Extremely hard to advance in the company.  Its a hostile work environment."
good,Great first job for high school students. Allows employees to build upon their customer service skills and multitasking skills. Allows employees to pick and choose hours/days worked.
good,"this review is only about Critical Unit at UPS, very poorly managed, not relax environment, managers, high-ends look down on people no fair treatment."
good,"There is no set time to leave and you may stay 5 hours or 8-9 hours."
good,UPS is a very productive fast-paced working environment that requires you to be on your toes at all times being able to lift packages and have them placed correctly on the delivery truck so that the delivery driver can find them easier when delivering a package to a household
good,"safety oriented when visitors arrive ( dog and pony show) , try to convince union employees to work faster so they can be gotten off the clock. the longer your there the better it gets if your an hourly employee."
good,"the job is hard enough in its self, its even harder when supervisors belittle you and curse at you anytime they get angry. There is no communication between management and employees, let alone amongst themselves."
good,UPS Freight cares more about the bottom line than they do about getting the freight to their customers when expected.  Managment would rather point fingers at other terminals rather than communicate and get to the root cause of why they are not meeting their numbers.
good,"Promotions are based on how friendly you are with management more than skill. I have seen people, including myself, who are more than qualified to get promotions but the jobs always seem to go to ""friends"" of management."
good,"As a package handler, you will start off with a trainer and get put into a truck.  The job is very fast paced and strenuous on the body.  The weather conditions play a huge role in the job. When it's hot outside, you will be hot. When it is cold outside, you will be cold as well."
good,"There is one goal in the end, get the packages delivered at any cost.  Safety is a second thought here in Dallas, it was a priority in the Mid-Atlantic."
good,"Job wasn't bad at all, actually enjoyed loading and unloading packages. My day went by pretty fast. But considering it is UPS I expected to be paid at least 9.00 where I was paid only 7.50"
good,UPS was a good place to work.  Very face paced and ideal for individuals that grow in competition.  Only draw back that I remember was dealing with the union.
good,They will Pay you to go to school but the hours aren't many so Not enough money and you have to work there for a year before your benefits kick in other than that it is a good company to work for
good,"Overall not bad. expect long hours and heavy lifting. to move to driving you need to start preloading trucks, peak season is hard and long but pay is good."
good,I did not like working for this company. The benefits and pay were good. The work days were long but if you were able to make your pickups and deliveries without having to drive all over the place then it wasn't to bad.
good,no love for the employees high fire rate and also the pay suck bad if you want better employees then they need to pay more and if thats oo much to ask
good,"If you are a manager on salary, you will be worked harder and paid less than the hourly employees and supervisors. UPS is a great job for an hourly employee."
good,"Being a woman who worked at a ups warehouse, there were perverts everywhere. Everyone starts off part-time and it takes years to become full time, about 5+. Because of new contracts, it is not worth working here for the rest of your life. There are only 50¢ raises every year, if you can get through the back breaking work. You will most likely start off as a loader who loads air containers or trailers, an unloader who unloads the trailers and containers, or if you're lucky, get sent to small sort  where you rarely have to lift a box or move around. Many supervisors like to play favorites so unfairness is common in the workplace. There are also many awesome people to work with and who will help you out when you need it. Everyone there knows how stressful and overburdened someone can get so, in most cases, your co-workers will come help you out. And if you go and help out your co-workers who need it, that sends a good message to them so they will help you out in return."
good,Okay Place To work not a lot of hours fast Pace to work will work there again only at Christmas time when really busy need to pay more for all the work you do ..
good,If management took more time to pay better attention to those of less seniority then maybe UPS would have less turnover than it does now. Even the employees themselves under management notice this.
good,Clocking in for the day as well as making sure my employees hours are correct. Attend Meetings. Relay to my employees what their assignment will be. Speaking to the Air Hub to get our next destination on property. Using hand gesture's to direct my employees on where they should go when they are driving heavy machinery.
good,Tough to advance through hard work.  Overall good people but the top down structure needs reworked.  There is much repetition that takes away from the core responsibilities of the job.
good,"very stressful, as soon as u came in start automatically. a lot of peoples job and work days depended on what u accomplished before they come in. stressful enough a lot of duties and responsibilities. but every moment i loved it. everyday was a new experience."
good,UPS is a great opportunity for young people who are without the responsibility of children. I say this because of the hours required being in the middle of the night.
good,Package handling requires a lot of hard work physically. Unloading trucks can be very tiring even for part timers. If you enjoy a great work out and getting your education then this is a good gig.
good,"A typical day of a UPS Supervisor or Manager begins at 6:30 am and goes to 7:30 pm.  Frontline management employees are responsible for all operations, training, service, and productions plans to be executed.  "
good,"UPS is demanding physically and mentally wise due to the fact it is manual labor every day. The package handler is required to lift packages from one pound to possibly even two hundred pounds into the trucks, which we load three to 5 at a time. It is a warehouse environment, meaning you work through the seasons, hot or cold, rain, snow or shine."
good,Great union job. Long term benefits are good. Keep track of hours as they will try to cheat you here and there. Don't show your full worth as management will exploit you for your strengths. Rewards for the dumb and punishment for the string.
good,"Seasonal job, delivering packages to homes and businesses,"
good,Working wit ups can be hard. From working nights to getting overloads from trucks.  No cellphones allowed in the building at all. Steal toe boots at all times. Practice safety issues a lot.
good,"ups is not the place to work if you have a family. meaning a typical day at ups is about 13 hours. under no circumstances shall you miss work due to your car being broke down,kids sick, kids school programmer yourself being sick. there was no air in the trucks and the heat can be hard to handle .. we were always on a time schedule rush rush..I did learn if you want it then fight for it.. nothing is easy at ups. weekly test. the best part was my paycheck and benefits.."
good,Basic duties were unloading packages from trailers. worked around 5 or 6 hours straight with one 10-minute break throughout the entire shift. management was poorly handled but was an easy job.
good,"The entry level position at UPS is a good fit for the right person in the right situation. It's a job with three different shifts allowing the employee the opportunity to go to school full time or work another job on the side, while still providing full health care benefits. Those were the reasons I chose to work there. There are a couple downsides however: the hours and work conditions are quite grueling, the part-time pay is low and the hours few, and the waitlists to promote are very long due to seniority."
good,If you like constantly getting your head kicked in and working at least twenty hours for free a week then this is the job for you.  Terrible work life balance.  The running joke is that every veteran management has a either a gambling/drinking/smoking problem or a divorce.  I cannot tell you how incredibly true that is though.
good,"Don't go into supervision. They trap you into thinking that you are able to advance, but then they just move people around who didn't even apply for the jobs."
good,"All managing is done by intimidation and threats. Drivers are treated very poorly. Shows little to no respect for more senior drivers,  the ones that have made the company what it is."
good,A very fast-paced environment loading and unloading semi tractor trailers with small and big packages very very from 5 lb to 75 lb morning off to 1500 packages for 4 hour shifts
good,No room for advancement pay raise is a joke the management there is judgemental there is a divider between temp and hired employees alot of drama if u need a job its a job and u get paid but not a good long term job
good,"It's a very high paced job. Warehouse gets ridiculously hot and trucks are even hotter. If there is not enough work you will be sent home, no matter if you just walked into work. I wouldnt suggest this be your only job because the hours are not guaranteed."
good,"worked 50-60+ hours a week, rarely got time off for dr appointments, when needed time off was denied. was doing a managers job and not getting a pay raise for it. when talked to them about needing time off they say one thing and do another... hence no time off"
good,"this job is not for the faint of heart. they expect you to work 10+ hours a day without compensation. 95% of the jobs will be night jobs. work life balance is not valued. it is a good old boy job of sorts, its who you know and get along with that will get you moving in the company. it is physical and draining. they bank on the benefits as the reason people stay. otherwise the turnover would be much higher. Don't expect any praise for your work. it will always be viewed as expected,"
good,"It was hard working for UPS, you had to keep your numbers to a certain standard.  I injured my shoulder and was unable to keep my numbers up and was laid off."
good,"You will need thick skin to work here. Managers talk down to you a lot. The shifts are evening shifts only. They only allow 10 min breaks. Everyone starts part time, approx. 3hrs pay day."
good,"Ansich ist die Arbeit nix besonderes ."
good,"The first time I worked for UPS was in Tulsa, Okla., as a courier and enjoyed my work delivering packages.  I tried to get employed again as a courier and it didn't work out. In seeking employment here in Dallas at that time no openings as a courier, so I accepted a position as a yard dog, moving trailers around to the docks to be loaded and unloaded.  I was good enough to be on the graveyard shift and would like to do it again for better pay."
good,Lots of people telling others to move faster to boost production. Moving 1-50 lbs boxes for 4-5 hours can be taxing on the body after so many years. Management is not very concerned with employees well being other than safety. The only want to see results.
good,it is very physical and demanding place to work at. Most of the supervisors do not practice what they preach. The workers and everyone there are very friendly but do not look happy working there but they have not choice. Peak season is the best time to work there for part timers because you can make a lot of money.
good,"I feel like the client I work for was very misleading on opportunity for advancement. The orientation consisted of a lot of talk about moving up and these advancements only happening from within, but come to find out, they actually hire temps or contract out the majority of any advanced positions."
good,started off stretching and warming up. we gave reports of what the day before was like and what the day was expected to give us for daily work. worked as a team and unit.
good,10 Hrs work days work most holidays 24-7 operations support not available during peak season to customers who look for pick up and delivery flexibility. Culture doesnt promote relationships between operations and sales/customers
good,"Very demanding workplace environment in the hub, both physically and mentally.  Each night was a challenge to meet shipping deadlines, but was a fair place to work while in college."
good,I you are looking for a better income this might not be the best choice but if you wish to further you Education or a job to hang on to then this is a good option.
good,I enjoy my job and my responsibilities but I believe management should be required to take additional training regarding interaction with subordinates. Respect should be required on all levels.
good,I worked at UPS as a loader for close to 6 months. Previous employees in my position quit much sooner because management is always looking over your shoulder and telling you what you're doing wrong and writing you up when you lift a package the wrong way. The work is very fast paced and it gets on your nerves very quickly.
good,"The hub I worked at had a terrible culture and a losing attitude. Management had a different ""flavor of the month"" they would pursue with little to no consistency. In my first year on the management team, I had 4 different managers working above me which allowed for no upward mobility. By the time you were able to make an impression on somebody they would be booted out the door."
good,I was getting back in the workforce after my time home with my daughter. UPS is a good place to work. I learned a lot. It is a face paced environment.
good,"Set schedule, available hours make it worth coming to work. The hardest part about the job was stress management and working 7 days a week during peak season."
good,It's a good place to start with employment. It has great benefits when you are hired a permanent position. Great people and  very clean environment. My overall experience was good and the people are so nice an kind and everyone gets alone with each other.
good,"I didn't have much complaints about the workplace except the racial slurs... that's when things got a little uncomfortable for me. Eventually I was let go for reasons I am still unsure of, but there's nothing I can do about it according to management."
good,"I have worked at UPS as a Package Handler for the past few months.  It is a very physically demanding position, and I typically enjoy physical work, but I need something that will challenge me mentally as well."
good,Management Sucks at UPS they do not promote the correct people. Its a Joke. If you are incompetent and Lazy you should apply at UPS because you will most likely be promoted faster then anyone else...
good,"UPS is a fast paced environment."
good,"I liked working at UPS. I enjoyed the fast pace work environment. The employees and supervisors were a pleasure to work with, both times I had my seasonal jobs."
good,"Lack of communication with clients, failure to up-hold employee contracts. Promises mileage payments in contract, however, UPS put of close to 10,000 miles on my vehicle and denied mileage payments as contract stated. Avacend failed to hold UPS accountable for payments out of fear of losing a client."
good,"I would never recommend this job to anyone. The working environment is just pure filth. Nothing is ever cleaned. I've learned absolutely nothing but how to stack boxes. The hardest part of the job is deciding to either go or not go. And you only get about 3 to 4 hours on average and if your lucky you may get 5, very rare."
good,Time for a change where hard work and dedication is appreciated need a place where good work is noticed have put in over 20 plus yrs for a company that could care less
good,"The job isn't bad, but management makes sure it is. Call you when you're off, very stressful work environment, constantly being asked to work over your shift or cover others. Every year seems to bring more work with very little opportunity for advancement, takes years to get out of part time and into full time. However, they will work you more than your contracted hours as needed with no warning."
good,"UPS in Louisville, KY is okay. The position I held was only seasonal, so I can't say much. The work place is fine. The people are nice. Easy job to work."
good,UPS has a decent work environment. I worked with the company for 4 years and did not have any complaints until they began to switch management.  The new management did not have a good relationship with the employees and caused several individuals to quit because the job was not worth the stress.  The best thing about the job is that they offer full benefits for part-time work.
good,"This Job has a great benefits package.  My biggest gripe is, that this company refuses to pay part-time management employees for work done over 27 hours a week.  Even though job duties often necessitates working over that allotted time. Especially during peak season, or after disasters.  Also because it is a Union company, as part of management,  you will be expected to uphold your employee's to standards that you can not enforce.   The majority of discipline issued is negotiated away.  This often causes insubordination problems."
good,Typical day  is pretty slow but the co-workers around you make the time go pass. Everybody who work there is experienced and always reaching out to help someone. Always good vibes.
good,"A good place for a stepping stone and physically demanding. Franchised owned, no benefits, low pay rate, and very hands on. Little room for advancement."
good,No concept of work life balance jobs are micro managed to the company's detriment.   Company is disorganized and service can be lacking causing difficult sales.
good,"They did not put a whole lot of trust in employees, patting you down as you left for breaks, lunch or leaving for the day. No air conditioning or heat."
good,"not the best job, again this is ups store franchises . depends on owners and management, my experience wasnt bad. always got my requested time off"
good,"Co workers were usually nice, as well as supervisors. they always wanted everyone there on time no later, which was never an problem for me because I always arrived before start time. The hours where 3am- 830 am during peak it could be as early as midnight that you will start. the pay was ok for someone who doesn't have any responsibilities when first starting out but I've heard if you stay with the company for a while yo will gain more money for those hours."
good,"This Job is very different from any job I've ever had! In my opinion and personal experience, the management team is just that, managers! If your looking for leadership, you will not find it here. At least in the area of operations."
good,Most challenging job I have ever had. Too much work and not enough pay. Vacation days not so great here. Will not got back.
good,"Pro's:"
good,"I learned to work in a fast pace work environment. There is very little training done. There is an off sight manager that we report to if there is any questions or problems.. He was not there very often on the shift I worked, but you could text and he usually responded in a timely manner. The highering is done strictly through a temp agency, so no one is hired full time through UPS. There is a very diverse population of co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different mail classes that each customer had, because they weren't always the same from customer to customer. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was learning to do the mail that required special processing. I enjoy learning new things on a job making it more challenging."

good,"Pretty expected, get you in and get you out. Good people working there  as well as upcoming new people, wish the best of luck to everyone working there and applying"
good,"-pretty straight forward right at day one"
good,It's an easy job. Although it is a small franchise there isn't much potential to grow and the job can be pretty one dimensional at times. Other than that there isn't anything really wrong with working at this place.
good,Rules and more rules. Management treat employees like slaves at times. No trust in workers. Overbearing and sometimes abusive supervisors and managers.
good,"Less growth, cannot enjoy with Family, not a good pay master."
good,UPS is a place that dreams go to die. Most shifts are Tuesday thru Saturday. You must be able to operate a forklift. The dock is an open dock so it is very cold in the winter. UPS Freight has taken away tuition reimbursement and the holiday bonus.
good,"They often screw you over on your check by cutting hours. The best part about working hear is your co-workers. Everyone know their job sucks so we tend to joke around,"
good,Horrible Management treat people like slaves not like humans only expect more from you than expect as detail. all Co-workers had a bad attitude just like working in a prison everyone try to just stab you in the back to get you in trouble.
good,Fairly easy to get seasonal work. The company is a proven success but I wish I had the chance to become a full time employee.
good,A glum work environment with everyday being just like the last. Management is only concerned with the numbers. Co-workers are not incentivized to work hard. Hard workers go unrecognized and most often become fed up and stop caring. The hardest part of the job was getting the motivation to show up for another terrible day. The best part of the job was the ability to listen to music during the shift. Also the great benefits that are offered. In the end it was a non challenging and unappreciative work environment.
good,I've organized computer data and dispatched truck drivers. Co-workers were helpful and fun. The hardest part of the job was to maintain dispatch when nobody else were at their station.
good,"Loved meeting new people and  learning new skills running bad product hardest part,how to make soda cans,met some cool people great supervisory skills seeing my product in stores."
good,Horrible to work for.. No work life balance and employees are treated with no respect. A typical day would consist of micro managing and top down. Your input is never accepted and frowned upon.
good,"The work environment was pleasant, it was the night shift hours that was hard for me and triggered a need for change. There was always work to do."
good,"A typical work day consists of: shipping packages for customers, packaging items to be shipped, electronic fingerprinting, copies, faxing, scanning, emailing, updating in-house accounts, notary, creating and designing prints projects, creating charts and invoices for in-house clients, ordering supplies, cleaning and keeping the store in the best condition for the customers. Our team acts like a family, we work with each other and I believe our customers come first. We go out of our way for our clients and each other. I don't believe there are any parts of my job that I would deem dificult."
good,Fun environment for a franchise. Customer service is number one! Must have patience and can multi task. Pay is low with no benefits.
good,"It is very conservative, but overall everyone is nice.  Good culture and history, but sometimes that acts as a negative when meeting new business/environmental needs."
good,The only thing I really miss about this job is the customers. I enjoyed the days where the regulars came in and I could help them with the things they needed printed or made. The co-workers were helpful and good to work with.
good,This was the perfect part-time job for me to balance school while paying my bills.  The health care benefits with this job are most ideal.  The supervisors do a poor job creating incentives and motivating individuals to perform.  I enjoy working with all my co-workers every day.
good,"Working UPS Sunrise shift you never get use to the hours, their college program is the only reason anybody between the ages of 17-25 should work there because that's the only good part. Their pay is way better now but the supervisors there suck at training other upcoming supervisors. Everything is a rush job there so there's no time to really learn. You do what you're told and you keep doing it until you get it right. If you have any friends who like to hang out during the weekdays and sometimes even the weekend you can kiss all of that goodbye because unless you work in training or load quality (or somewhere you have an office) you'll be stressed out, tired, and just ready to give it all up. Some outbounds are better than others and if you decide to work there I pray you get a good outbound... and stick to loading. You'll feel better about it in the end. Nothing and absolutely NOTHING is what it seems at UPS"
good,"Good my feet wet here. Always interesting working in management in a Union environement. Not saying I had the same struggles as other supervisors, but I saw a lot of tension. Work environment was extremely political, less productive, and toxic. Again, learned a lot of what not to do working here."
good,My day consist of moving boxes from the end of a flow chute into various sized containers. I have learned from this company to stay proud of my work and the presentation it gives off about me. Management hasn't always agreed with the way I achieve things and hasn't offered me any advancement within the company or in my wing. The hardest part of my job would be maintaining the professionalism and guidelines that are set forth for me. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with my other coworkers and helping them achieve their work along beside me.
good,"Prefer Not to  Comment."
good,"The experience has been a valuable learning tool, but not a career that I could see myself in long term as at the retail level there is little Human Resource work for me, because the majority of that role is done by the owner."
good,"type up excel sheet, pull docs, image, check docs with info on computer, input information of the shipments going out, sign in drivers and update paperwork"
good,I would start by scanning and loading feeder trailers.  After break I would then work outside on the ramp.  I would unload aircraft and also bring containers into the building.  My co-workers were pretty good except for the slackers who would call in sick every week.  I learned never to trust anybody in management.  The hardest part of the job was the labor.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits.
good,"Despite catching them up on backlog and going beyond their expectations of you, after promises of being hired on after your temp contact has expired, they do not hire you. They just have you train a new temp then let you go. That's how it was then at least, not sure if it's changed but then it was not a temp to hire friendly environment. Although most of the people there were helpful, welcoming, appreciative of the help and friendly, one was not... Tenure does not always equal entitlement. Especially when you act like a child and throw tantrums to get your way. Just saying."
good,"had to make deliveries of packages to many location. i had a good time with my driver a good guy, work was fun. enjoy my time with UPS. it was only seasonal."
good,I was worked hard within the little hours I recieved. I did very hard work with little compensation. I also had unpaid overtime when I left the company and and have yet to be compensated.
good,"Last minute always. Every project was pressing in time as that is the nature of the business. They're never were priority on what need to be completed...which was the most pressing. Everything was always handed last minute. Never could schedule time away or off, as they would always ask for you to work through your scheduled vacation."
good,I worked in a hub that was very busy with package handling and harsh working environments. Management was good but the pay was horrible.
good,Its not that really hard working as a driver helper.beacause the only thing you have to do is deliver packages and sometimes lift heavy boxes.i have learned a lot as a helper.ive learned how to use their DIAD board and learn how to communicate with people.plus all the driver that i met is all cool..the most exciting part is im riding with the  huge UPS truck..
good,"-Good place to meet new people"
good,"Ein toller Beruf der aber leider mit Familie und Kindern nicht zu vereinbaren ist. "
good,When I worked there a truck would come in with broken and leaking packages every night and would stop the flow of unloading because we would need to wait for someone to come make sure it is safe and if not to clean it up. Every night this would happen and every time the management would not communicate with other UPS facilities to get them to load properly.
good,"Management makes sure you don't have enough time for lunch by scheduling to many stops per day. The people on your route make the day great. everyone is excited to see the UPS guy. UPS is a Union company so it doesn't matter how hard you work, the only thing that matters is you Seniority date."
good,"The hours suck."
good,excellent benefits free health and dental with overtime pay after your scheduled shift. Long term disability and 65% company match 401k and TUITION REINMBURSEMENT!!!!
good,"It was a very fast paced company to work for.  My co-workers were fine to work with. We all had one thing in mind, do your job and do it well. We were a team.  Management was fair. The hardest part was having to lift heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part was leaving everyday knowing I did a very good job."
good,worked in shipping & receiving with school supplies to be packed& shipped.
good,a typical day was very fast paced and required a great deal of time management. This job taught me a great deal about efficiency and management of time as well as prioritizing tasks throughout the day. My Customer service skills were also refined as they were put to the test daily.
good,My only concern is the hours. Which is the number one reason why Im applying for other jobs. A typical day is not always busy. The most busy time in around Thanksgiving to Christmas and that is it. The hardest part is dealing with some of the people. I can handle the fast pace environment in which I feel that I work eight hours a day instead of four because my job demand so much out of employees for not that many hours to provide a good living financial stability.
good,"Always challenging, fast paced environment. Great warehouse,"
good,Its a good place to work but it can be very fast paced at times. You have to be a quick learner to earn a permanent spot. No room for advancement at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people of the community.
good,"If your looking for only benefits, this is a good place to work, will provide benefits for part time employees. Career opportunities are there but you will have to wait years."
good,"A normal day at The UPS Store would include helping customers, packaging packages, making copies, sending faxes, and restocking/doing inventory for the store. "
good,it was fun working at ups. the people were nice and the job itself was enjoyable. but the pay was a little slim. the company took money out of my checks without me knowing and the job was also temporary.
good,i had taken two road tests and was told be the driver trainer i should have been put on after the first road test the drivers that they did hired couldn't drive is it my age thats stopping me from getting this job or my color
good,"UPS is a hard job. The climate was harsh and unforgiving. When it was hot you were hot, when it was cold you were cold. But it was great to learn then in's and out's of the shipping business. I learned how all the packages got around the entire warehouse that was incredibly large, and not to mention how physical the job was. It was very hard too keep up during the eight hours straight i worked per shift. It was nonstop moving. It was a great experience non the less. The management left something to be desired with never showing up on time, and leaving early. And benefits were little to none. UPS was a hard job, but it was a chance to learn."
good,I felt management could provide more training for the efficiency they expected.
good,basicalliy stocking and rotating all products. manager very cool and its a easy job. alot of standing and bending
good,enjoyed working with all the staff there. Learned a variety of different types of job duties
good,"The job that I help at the UPS Store has been a very busy job.  I have built on my leadership skills as a manager and enjoyed the employees that work with/for me.  "
good,"UPS is a good company if you are a full time employee but as a seasonal employee, you don't get any benefits and you are not given the hours you were promised."
good,pick orders for shipment. i learned that some people can put on a performance and get what they want including other people in trouble.there was a great lack of management.my co-workers sucked.dealing with my co-workers.quitting time
good,Average work day  is from 4 to 6 hours non peak shifts. I was very privileged early on to become a training manager a long with gain a vast knowledge of supervising work areas.
good,management is terrible ..they don't show there employee respect . it is very fast paced and you meet people from all walks of life
good,"We have five sections: A,B,C,D,E."
good,"load and unload trucks"
good,the lay out simple and easy to follow. Highly demanding as far as keeping the flow of packages moving.
good,"Fast paced.  Little to no training so experience was a must for this job.  Ability to work independently.  Management was professional.  Workers treated one another with respect.  Very helpful.  Upbeat.  Friendly.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the on-going division reorganization changes.  Five division changes took place during my one year assignment.  I learned about the UPS organization including HUBS, Divisions, Feeders, Drivers."
good,VERY hard to advance. Lots of boot licking in order to advance
good,"management ,dont have a family value.i like the place im enjoyed working with a new equipment,i learned a lot specially upgrading new equipment,my co-workers its fair,the hardest part of the job is to make your boss happy..."
good,I worked 50 hours a week and only got paid for 30 of those hours. I worked extremely hard and didn't get paid for the amount of effort that I put into for that job.
good,UPS is a great company when it comes to benefits for part time employees. The flexibilty was the issue for me.
good,A nice organization trying hard to acheive its targets. known for the brand. enjoyed working
good,"The company overall has gone down hill in the past few year.  The compensation has not increased, however the cost of benefits has increased.  There work/life balance is frustrating.  Everyone is expected to do more for less."
good,the job was very unorganized. The driver was never on time or at the right location. No communication.
good,makin sure packages get delivered efficently  and effectively.
good,they let you know right off the bat that the job is physically challenging. good benefits.
good,I had to make sure that the packages were not damage and the conveyer belt is running smoove.
good,"• Delivered packages, in charge of vehicle inspection, and in charge of San Luis, AZ route"
good,I have learned a lot working with UPS about what I like and what I dont like in a company. Having worked there for so many years I have gained valuable experience and skills that will serve well in the future.
good,"Ingresso in uffico alle ore 9.00, organizzazione del lavoro e gestione delle priorità, pausa pranzo dalle 13 alle 14, fatturazione e chiusura carichi giornalieri."
good,Definetly a fly by your seat company to work for. I was employed in my position for 6 months before any formal training. Management is poorly structured and beaten up without any support from upper management. Inaccurate job descriptions. Should have never left the union position.
good,I most enjoyed my customers that I served as being an International Account Specialist. I bonded with my customers and was on a first name basis. I assisted customers with all aspects of thier international shipping business and I do miss assisting my customers as customer service is a priority with me. Everyday was something different which included new challenges which I welcomed.
good,"A typical day at UPS packaging is a non-stop operation for a straight 4-5 hours no break loading/sorting and packing functions. My co-workers and I work together well, as we can because without one another pulling his own wait the job will not get done effectively. As for management I have watched/asked and learned how they run their stations as it relegates to the operation of the belts station. Maintaining a consistent flow of products through prioritization and sorting methods of material."
good,"UPS overall was a good company to work for, unfortunately I was recently married and needed to spend more time with my wife, that's why I decided to change career paths in to a more manageable work enviroment that will allow me to balance my work life with my family time"
good,A quick 3hr day of hard work ..Co workers are friendly .The most enjoyable part is when its y=time to clock out .
good,was interesting due to seeing how they ship the items they were payed to ship.
good,Work was simple all I did was Sort packages by zip code.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of shipping packages across the United States and sometimes other countries. The customer service agent also had to deliver packages to customers, stock and organize packages for future deliveries, and interact with different customers. the co-workers helped to locate and retrieve packages that may have been misplaced due to an error. the hardest part of the job was sometimes having to locate a package that could not be found. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with different customers and learning new information the job, culture.I learned many different job duties that helped build my character. The management had their own problems that they had to deal with, however majority of the time management was their to help deal with issues a worker or co-worker could not handle."
good,A day at work waking up between 1:30am-4am going to work for at the most 4 and half hours. Hearing management yelling at someone as always. I hated that place couldn't last another month. The hardest part of this job was waking up at 2am for a part time job
good,-Sehr schwere arbeit
good,Basically in my primary job as a putaway clerk. I had the ability to learn different jobs at the warehouse when things got slow. During my time there I had 4 different supervisors. Half was fair the other half had personal issues that effected job moral for most of my department.
good,This job is good for college and high school kids but other than that its not worth it.
good,"UPS is a great workplace. sonetimes it's hard unloading trucks, but I did have a lot of friends there, but as well the pay wasn't good enough"
good,Assist with delievery of packages with full time employee. Temp position
good,"typical job, learned alot, met some great co workers, hardest part is seeing people i have worked with for years being laid off, wondering if I am next."
good,The work is not hard bye far but the hours could be more and it takes so long to get benifits and raises. I know you have to get through a probationary period but UPS is alittle wide spread for the manual labor that a person takes each and everyday.
good,Poor management after holidays you will not here from them until the next holiday season. Not a bad job just poor poor management.
good,"Ups is a very cut throat company the Union are in the pocket of the employer. You really don,t have no right in the company."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was the supervision of the employees.
good,"Your a mechanic, you fix everything. It does not matter what you know, it's how hard you will push your body."
good,I inspected quanties and quality of products before they were sent out
good,"Loading trucks, reading and scanning in boxes, being able to lift 70lbs and up, and a general knowledge of hazmat materials."
good,"Working in a very hot warehouse, standing on your feet for 8-to 12 hours a day, with only 2 / 10minute breaks and 30 min. Lunch in wich u have to clock out . Also if the mail trucks are late coming in u have to clock out till they arrive which could be any where from 30 mins. To 2 hours ,just standing around with out pay."
good,Was in the engineering and implementation of the central sort concept used today by UPS. Supervised the loading and unloading of transfer vehicles. Trained personnel and did the payroll for the facility. Audited drivers and routs.
good,"Good pay,but hard working conditions ,from management expectations and the new big brother atmosphere with all the new technology it can be very stressful."
good,A typical work day at ups is you would would start working with boxes. While your management harasses you about doing a job perfectly that can't be done at the speed required. I learn that there are places that are managed horribly and to work with different kinds of people. Most of the employees at ups are tired of working there the only reason to stay is because of the benefits. The hardest part of my job is the constant belittling you take from the supervision from the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it last 4 hours.
good,Fast paced environment with great benifits for parttimers but very hard to get fulltime positions.
good,I say mismanaged not based on production but on how they handle conflicts or employee disputes. My supervisor basically had no clue how to talk to us on a daily basis
good,"Supervisors came in the trailers to help all workers. Workin up there was somewhat fun, but its putting your body thru a nice little workout."
good,Enjoyable for a while but became apparent that the coorporate mentality was too large to be rewarded regardless of the amount of effort put into the job. Good way to create a work ethic that is unmatched by most companies.
good,"Challenging and rewarding work environment with fair compensation and benefits as a manager. However, compensation and benefits for Union employees is fantastic. Difficulties in this job include working with stagnant Union Employees and hours that limit family interaction."
good,Definitely a job that will give you a good workout Monday-Friday.
good,that job position didn't give me the chance to move up throughout the company
good,Very appreciative of the opportunities offered me during my 13 years with Overnite/UPS Freight. Working with our local facility was enjoyable overall. All our associates were proud and happy at one time.
good,"Ups pays well, does have  some egotistical manager and will cut your throat in a heartbeat. But if you are a yes man and dont speak up and willing to stab the next guy in the back. Then uos Is fir you, but if you speak up against what the managers say then you lose"
good,UPS is a very straightforward company with many options for those looking for financial assistance and/or health benefits however entering  at the lower level positions  it can be easy to lose sight of goals
good,"I loved my job , but unfortunately it was seasonal. I was hopping for a full time job after Christmas. But no luck. I have many job skills especially while working with people.."
good,"Boys Club. Reminds me of High School popularity contest. I see good hard working people be rode in the ground be held accountable while people that goof off, scream, cry, make up excuses why they are they way they are.....They hate me, they pick on me.....and they just get away with it because management will give them their way to shut them up. These goof off's make ""friends"" with management just so they can get by with not doing their job. The work itself is easy. You just don't know if your working 4 hours....8 hours or 12 hours day to day."
good,It’s very physical. Not too much downtime you’ll be on and off a truck or lifting and bending consistently.!it can be a lot of wear and tear on your body
good,"if you put in enough time you will move up, but overall they expect you to work a ton of hours on a regular week. Management want you to succeed, but everyone is always looking for someone to blame. Long hours make everyone a bit jaded, they were telling the interns they hate their job."
good,"UPS has amazing benefits and retirements plans if you can stick it out and survive to make it there.  There are many struggles.  Dealing with disgruntled supervisors, customers, and other drivers.  Just do your job and go home"
good,I’m an a young man trying to work as hard as possible to take care my family Nd myself I want to do my best on any job I want to work and hopefully become my own boss
good,"Up pace work environment,  a lot of pressure placed on their workers for production.  Management is has everything come down from above and it has a direct impact on the treatment of their employees."
good,"I am a very small female and the job was a lot more than I was physically able to do. I would get up early for work around 2 am and then I would load 3-4 trucks that have anywhere between 200 and 800 packages. Many times I would find that I could not keep up with what was being asked, not because I was not working or moving slowly, but because the weights of many packages were over 45 lbs and they came very quickly. The solidarity of the staff and management kept me going. It's a job that needs to be completed and we all were just there to do it. It was a messy chaotic job, but I learned how to maintain my calm and patience."
good,"The job was simple and the pay was decent , it’s definitely good if you’re physical person . Shifts just didn’t work with my school schedule anymore . Overall I would work there again."
good,"Starting out it was a fun place to work, there were some good people working with me. Co-worker and management the only problem was the district manager."
good,Ups had its challenges with its management which was the reason I eventually left the facility. It was presented as an easy job but when others slacked off I was expected to pick up the slack and do my job and everyone else’s job instead of management telling their employees to do their job and it caused me wanting to leave.
good,They hire you and tell you that you could be sent some home for a day or two. Turns out they send you home for a month or more. Not worth it at all!!!
good,Poor management from the supervisers. Poor support from co workers. Having to do three things at once with no support. I'm never happy to work here. Just tiring.
good,"You get use to the culture, rapidly changing and constantly different daily.  Be prepared to work and never know what to expect until you are in charge."
good,"You need to walk A LOT.  Easily 16,000 steps a day. They say you only need to lift 40lb or 70lb in the interview, but that is a lie. There are easily stuff that weights over 100lb if it is furniture or even 200lb+ if there are multiple medium size packages.  Yes there is a dolly to put the packages to make it easier, but you still need to be physically strong enough to pull the dolly up the curb of the street or bumps. Also they don't really teach you how to use the DIAD or the cellphone in the videos that well. I had one of the busiest route in the area and it is a poor neighborhood and not really fun since 30% of them have dogs, the other 50% have gates (a lot of time it is locked), and the other 20% is the doorbell being broken or not even installed correctly. They also don't tell you about how in the ghetto area 40% of the time you have to deliver to the back house AND the house doesn't have the number on the house at all. This forces you to do an educational guess or ask the neighbor (most of the time they aren't home either). "
good,Be prepared to work hard with little hope to advance and move forward. Disappointed with the managements lack of leadership and ability to actually do what they say
good,"Big opportunity of advancement in company."
good,Great company to work for! Management questionable! Typical day at work was great and laid back without a manager.... management conspired and unappreciative!
good,"Good place to work at if you like a work out. People for the most part are very respectful. I can honestly say that UPS is the most organised, unorganized company you could work for if that made sence. They say they promote from with in but it feels like the more you want to get promoted the more they string you around and not give the promotion. So if you get a job there just dont get promote to managment."
good,"Hard work doing half the driver’s work for half the pay of driver. Online orientation did not prepare me for job. On the job training; trying to figure system and areas out as you go while annoyed driver expects you already know it. I received the blame for long delivery days when IMO, the driver’s constant backtracking made for delays. Daily morning texts for that days work need made it difficult to plan a life around. Sometimes no response at all."
good,"they take advantage of students and promise opportunities. once you're in for a while you can make good money, but in Columbus it was brutal work and excessive hours on salary."
good,Ok for seasonal driver work after that they give you the boot. Some good people and others had attitudes because it's Union workers.  Hard to get in as a seasonal driver.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UPS and make great connections with wonderful people. However, I believe that I would have more success in a bigger city. The opportunity for advancement at a smaller UPS facility is limited even if someone is more qualified than those who currently hold a position."
good,"The hours are evening hours and part time, location is close to my home and benefits are provided.  The job is quite detailed, with a variety of duties that require constant monitoring."
good,UPS is a great starting point if you are new to IT support. You will learn a great deal. The job can be stressful traveling from place to place but you do get compensated. Heavy wear on your vehicle though.
good,"you pretty much have to figure things out yourself, other drivers are the best source of information. stick with the company and it can turn into a high paying job, takes a little bit of time to become union member"
good,"A great environment to learn the shipping and receiving industry. Aside from shipping and receiving. Printing, design, and custom packing were hide aspects of the position"
good,Tough work and environment but the benefits are great. Will contribute to your education even though you work part time. 401k and pension. Must be able to deal with heat in Summer and cold in Winter.
good,fast past job and very demanding on body. Must keep up on package handling. Not enough hours and facility is run down. Not up to par and not safe. Hard job
good,UPS is a horrible place to work. They want robots not employees with brains and ideas on ow to do better. They over work you and under value you. Apply anywhere else but here.
good,It conflicted with school and school comes first for me. It was actually cool at the beginning then all of sudden the supervisors switched. So I am looking for a new job now.
good,"The management was terrible, didn’t live up to their benefits. I injured myself at work and the basically said they couldn’t use me anymore and couldn’t help me out anymore."
good,"It has a very 'Us versus them' mentality, whether it be management or employees. There is a Union but management doesn't tell you about any policies and HR is no help. If you can't find a Union Steward you might as well give up because no one cares. Even if you find one, chances are nothing will change"
good,Although it's a high volume of work you learn to push yourself to complete the task at hand mostly just being mindful of not over working yourself due to the constant lifting
good,"Finding that management seeks out any wrong doing, picks on one vs all to be the same rules. I feel i am being harassed and micromanaged while others do the same and are not spoken to at all. I love the company and job, but its too hard on me to be bullied upon."
good,Working for this company is challenging and helps to keep you in shape. It's a great place to work if you are an early riser. The coworkers are team players
good,Overall corporate job values and requirements were provided along with computer training that is uniform company wide. Very little training or instruction provided for daily operation for individual facilities
good,"Overall, I like working at UPS. The hours and health benefits are amazing. The cons are pay and morale and not much room for advancement. They are very involved in the community and encourage their employees to do the same."
good,Had a great time working here as a temp during the holidays. The pay was unacceptable but it was what i could find for the month or so between jobs. I hope by now they would of increased the pay for temporary holiday employees.
good,"A good challenge, must be able to think on your feet.  Also you must work in bad weather.  Work is also in the middle of the night.  You must have people skills."
good,long hours. stressful. the culture is not great. everyone is just looked at like a number. production and results trump safety and people. no work life balance.
good,Genel olarak normal ama işçi hakları tamamiyle verilmez
good,High intensity work environment but lacked opportunities for advancement.treated employees unfairly and kept you on a hook to get maximum benefit with little reward
good,This job has good pay and benefits but the disrespect that goes on around the building is ridiculous. Also if you have a family it’s good for the benefits but if you have kids you’ll never get to go to there practices and game because you’ll work till about 730 to 9 every night.
good,I work the early early morning shift.  Work starts at 2-3am and goes til 9am.  It is a very fast paced job with little to no time to sit around except at break.  They keep you busy which is good.  It makes the time go fast.
good,Working for ups umm what do I say not a bad place to work lads are great friendly bunch of blokes but for health and safety goes out window. Happened twice entering trailer on forklift and shunter desides to pull trailer of bay in was left hanging down when ramp just shoots down with me on it I was half a second away from Ending up in ane hurt big time or dead this company needs to buck there ideas up
good,"Your experience working at a UPS store will rely entirely upon when you join and where you join. My boss at this particular store was great and made sure that he always backed up his employees in the face of customers which helped stave off the sense of crushing despair that most retail jobs have. The atmosphere was generally relaxed with the exception of the holiday rush where every day was 8 hours of frenzied shipping and unreasonable customers. I can highly recommend this place as a place to get some experience in the work force but since these are franchised, retail jobs there isn't a lot of room for growth and advancement."
good,The drivers were very helpful in making my job easily managed.The management however over loaded the drivers during the holidays. I was a driver helper over the holidays in order to help a family friend get out of work to see his family.
good,"The job was really stressful actually. "
good,"work life balance: if you enjoy 12 hour days 5 days a week of nonstop physical labor this is for you"
good,"On Road Supervisor typically works a 14-16 hr day 5 days a week. No work life balance, competitive culture not for the person that needs positive reinforcement."
good,The company is good for a stepping stone if you are going to finish school and seek your career else where. Things may change that the company will promote from within with the accomplishments of your degrees.
good,This place continues to give me more and more work even though I can barely manage what I have. The only thing they can think of is how they can get you to do MORE. They don't care if you are two seconds away from a physical or mental break down just do MORE! They treat the long time employees like garbage while they continue to coddle the new employees so they don't leave.
good,"This was real physical labor.  Often came in only to find be sent home based on number or packages.  Waste of sleep, time, money, gas and much more, otherwise great learning experience."
good,Processing medical for the Work Comp claims. I update the OSHA Record keeping. Make sure the absence record reflects an accurate coding. Take calls...
good,"Management will start off fine but quickly become your least favorite people to talk to or interact with. Once you have experience, managers with little to absolutely zero experience will be telling you how to do a job they themselves don’t understand. They will also exploit you at every opportunity they get which you will quickly become aware of because they are less than subtle."
good,I would get there on time then we would start and they would always ask me to go home because didnt have enough volume for me to be there and I only work two instead of five only making 50 buck a week.
good,I Learned a great deal about how to deal with customers wth perfection with my experiences at The ups store. Although dealing with customers was also among one of the most difficult things at he job. I enjoy it altogether.
good,"When I say I work at UPS people always tell me what a great company it is to work for. It isn't anymore. They are going through ""transformation"" right now which means they are ignoring their values and making changes that leave hard workers and talent behind. They are so bad at people development that mid management is frozen and they have to hire from the outside despite a policy to promote from within."
good,A very much male culture.  Management is a bit draconian.  Part time management is mostly a dead end.  You work with union employees who make or make not demand that you follow contract to the letter.  Management expects you to get the job done no matter what.
good,Not a bad place but management could be a little better. More accurate training could also be better was trained for 2 days very light and was supposed to know what I was doing after that.
good,"You'll need to be dedicated to the company to work there, it is really fast paced as in they have a time limit, where things need to be in motion and ready to go. I did the twilight shift, so a usual day started at 2:30 -3 am and ended at around 8 - 8:30 am. It worked well enough for me, because I am also a full time college student. Make sure you apply to a location that is close by your residence, that way you don't have to deal with a long commute on Monday - Friday. Benefits begin after 10 months on the job, so they will get some good use out of you, before you get there, then they will decide whether to keep you or not. I had a good run, but I was really burned out towards the end."
good,"This company has great benefits, but gives employees a false hope of further advancement. Also, plays favoritism, and lacks in organization, communication and efficiency skills."
good,UPS sucked. My boss was always yelling or cursing someone out. The hours were inconsistent. There was always some drama in the building. I hated going to work but needed the pay.
good,"Great company in general to work with, the company does have good benefits and a good way to start an opperunity to learn how to work with adults and learn how to hanlde diffuclt  situations when under pressure."
good,Beside the low hours and and pay wage for a package handler and the amount of labor it’s a all around good job. I would do it again if the pay was better for what job I was doing.
good,"Management Members are EXPECTED to work 14 hour days on average. They claim they're working to improve work life balance but it ends up with more work overall. Only 5 holidays off all year, do not expect to enjoy a Christmas at home with your family. Upper Management are only worried about production numbers and they pass a hard and unencouraging military style management and reprimanding down the chain. Only worked there in management because I needed the healthcare (Union employees don't get healthcare until a year within the company) and to get the experience. NOT WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE OTHER AVENUES"
good,It was hard at first but your body will get used to it the pay is just not worth it tho on a good week my check was probably 250 a week sometimes less
good,Fast paced job with heavy packages. Not everybody is kind. You work in all kinds of weather. The seat in the truck is not comfortable. It's not the best job. It's not the worst job.
good,"They show favoritism to certain employees, many incompetent supervisors that do not care about your safety! Management asked like they care but they only care about themselves."
good,Good company in name. You have to be tough and focus to work at ups. There are frequent ruff patches through out your shift  you are going to encounter
good,Worked part time at UPS and it was a horribly physical and tiring job. They work you like a slave and pay you next to nothing. Horrible position would not recommend this job to anyone!
good,It wasn’t a very exciting job to have. If you enjoy staying indoors and standing around then this is the job for you. I enjoy active jobs with any chance to be outside so this job just wasn’t for me.
good,I could only work 4 to 5 hours a day and it was non stop hard work. I only did it when i got out of scholl. They we're very strict on heavy lifting but the training help you understand how to do everyting right
good,"The Ups store is a dead end, I'm sure working for actually ups is much better.  The Ups store pays just above minimum wage for a pretty heavy work load."
good,My time with UPS was great for my development and overall a pleasant experience. That being said you could see within other groups that the company very much treats employees as expendable. Also there is very little consideration given to work life balance
good,At UPS freight I worked at was not well managed and was very chaotic. They were terribly understaffed and a number of employees were overworked. The training was provided but was not adequate for the pressure put on for the position.
good,"Fast-paced and requires a lot of activity to load and unload trucks. Management is tired and cranky most of the time, but good temporary job. It's difficult to have a life when sleeping during the day."
good,Stressful place with decent pay that expects a lot from their employees . Management is not very competent and they hire supervisors off the street with no clue how to run operations
good,"Fast paced working environment. you will often be cross trained and put into different parts of the warehouse based on necessity. In many areas, teamwork is essential."
good,it is situated in copenhagen Danmark. it was the main warehouse of UPS scandinavian region . the weather was very cold and very harsh working condition.
good,"Day in a life of a Peak seasonal driver helper:"
good,"You never know when your shift ends, by varying between 4 hours or 10 hours. The job is a very fast-paced environment, in which people do not take seriously meanwhile others give their 100%. Breaks are never a guarantee and the management is very unprofessional."
good,There was some lazy workers that liked to milk the clock and the supervisor allowed it and when they didn't finish their work within 5 hours then other employees would have to complete the work they left... Which was unfair.. Men that worked there act like females complaining. The supervisor seemed sexist and racist.
good,"UPS is a good place to work for the mean time, but if your are seeking advancement you are better off with another major organization. Speaking for the Tulsa hub though."
good,"Good physical job, very busy work on a scheduled timeline. The package handlers here are mostly college age kids. Upper Management here were condescending towards lower staff. I wont be back.."
good,"Overall good place to work at . Lots of room for advancement, flexible schedules.Great benefits packages with company shares (401)k match.Would recommend ."
good,"Place was great the first few years then went down hill after new management took over. Descent pay, good benefits, good location, but not much room for growth within the company."
good,"Overall its a good company to work for, its unified and just. I've learned how to become a better leader, because it does deal with a lot of adversity. The workplace culture is comprised of methods and processes that are put in place, so that the business runs accordingly."
good,Expect your managers to be passive aggressive. Expect to be treated as a slave. No breaks. You will learn to hate your job. Benefits are good. Overall not a bad job.
good,If your qualifying for this position be prepared to eat sleep and breathe this job. Obtain a sales lead and make sure to take your hour lunch or you will be disqualified.
good,"Friendly place, and a very comfortable to work. I would recommend this job to anyone willing to work grave yard split shift hours, cause that is what the hours are for this place."
good,I worked only 4 hours and it wasnt that bad. I just needed a second job before Leaving to the military but definitely paid well. I had evening shift so I pad a few bucks more than morning crew.
good,"company has little value of personal concerns, minimum wage hike resulted in pay staying the same and now just at minimum. no incentive to work when you're a skilled machine operator with 8 lisences and making the same amount as someone pouring coffee.  hard work doesn't pay off, I was in a healthcare department working 5 accounts with what was supposed to be with 3 other people. they quit/got fired and in picking up the slack never saw another worker in my area until I finally quit. no pay raise dispite added responsibilities. definatly for afternoon shift. would not recomend"
good,"Each day is fast-paced and hectic, as you are expected to meet a deadline each night so that we make production, and trailers leave on time. It can get pretty intense."
good,esperienza positiva tranne per i contratti molto precari.
good,"It was quite the work out on a daily basis. This job will get you fit. Everything is about urgency.35 minutes to a trailer.If you are not out, they are on you."
good,"fast pace, learned to navigate the city better, some manager are the best people in the world, band of brothers, Finding a simple letter in a  unsorted truck can definitely ruin your day, Delivering at all your stops  and looking an empty truck at the end of your day gives you a greater sense of accomplishment."
good,I felt my overall experience was fair. Very little proper training or direction from management down. love to work hard however I felt at times they put time and money over safety.
good,Due to location not receiving many packages only a small number of shift leaders. Also company is too worried about the work to employee hours ratio. We could be drowning in work but we saved two hours cutting employees early
good,"I would recommend ups as a place to work , to anyone who can stand on their feet all day and lift up to 50 lbs. Hard work and make sure you eat at all times before going to work at ups."
good,"Each store is individualy owned and operated. "
good,"This is a fast paced, short shifts, work until load is unloaded and sorted. Multiple shifts available per sort. Continuously lifting packages up to 70lbs."
good,"A typical day at work meant standing in the same space monotonously moving packages across conveyor belts, the only positive part of the job was being told it was time to go home."
good,"This job is suitable people who like to actively work. It is not easy by any measure. Though i love how active this job is, the pay is not worth the stress."
good,"UPS is a company many young people start at, but few stay at for long.  The company employs mostly part-time workers with good benefits (at least at my facility - CACH), but there is little room for advancement, very few promotions, and almost no full-time jobs, even though the facility boasts up to 8,000 workers!  "
good,Working at UPS was not a bad experience. The pay was not enough. The work was not terribly hard and the other associates were great. The only downfall was the pay.
good,"UPSers typically are very hard workers, the company drives you hard to produce by each and every second. Benefits are good yet your health may not be after the stress and high pace schedule."
good,The job was cool during the holidays but right after you either work the average hours or you get sent home. No real point of working that hard in such a little amount of time with hardly any pay.
good,"I would arrive at eight am, begin making sure the computer were turned on the bank was set at each register and proceed to open the doors to customer and mailbox holder."
good,Terrible supervisors including upper management and recruiters.  Cut-throat overall environment.  Not conducive to grow or move up within the company without playing mind games.
good,"UPS is, in my opinion, a TERRIBLE low paying job. You're not compensated NO where near what you should be for the labor your expected to input. I never understood how labor is not paid well just because it's labor (hard work doesn't deserve good pay? Just college grads deserve high pay?). UPS is ambiguous during hiring and training because they know once you're out there on the floor you'll discover that advancement is unlikely, OT is reserved for the old timers (NOT at all for new hires unless there is some slim pickings left, even then Union members complain if new hires pick up a shift THEY turned down), but they do their best to mitigate the risk of OT the way the shifts are setup). There is probably more part-time workers than anything else and they aren't up front about a lot of things. They promise you a weekly bonus that doesn't even kick in until 3 weeks after your start date and by the time the Christmas holiday is over they let go most of the part-timers just after they finish paying their Union dues. At best, you'd be an employed homeless employee if UPS is your only job. Your sweat is NOT AT ALL worth the pay. If UPS was so good their turnover rate wouldn't be astronomical."
good,"They have own owner operators, but they set them and hire other fleets to haul freight. You set sometime up to 20hours between loads. They do have good fuel discounts."
good,the job is terrible very bad place to work load and unload trailers is the worst job ever to have for anybody and the people are so horrible just like the job
good,"Not every center or hub is the same. Each location has its own managers that make the experience what it is."
good,Not my favourite place to work.  Some managers were bullies and felt they could get away with it.  Training was minimal a figure it out for yourself attitude.
good,"The ability to learn new technology while completing your assigned projects is available.  Working on team building with various groups (i.e. customers, architecture analyst and programming staff) to achieve the project goal is commonplace. The collaboration between the teams to achieve the most efficient  ways to achieve the goal is accomplished thru work sessions."
good,I want to work with mature people but I don’t say nothing but I just don’t like it really . They use favorites in there too and I don’t like it and a lot of people In there are lazy also. I just want to work in a better environment.
good,Overall I liked the job I like to work but the management was not all there they had to do their job for me to do my job and that was not always the case there was lots of times where I had to step in and do the managers job so I could complete my job which put me in an uncomfortable position
good,"UPS is a much different today than it used to be.  Very corporate. You have to put a lot of years in before you can obtain a full time position. "
good,"the only problem I had was the fact that they don't pay you enough for the type of work that you put in, and also how frequent they move you around it was a headache every time they would take me from my workspace to go somewhere else and handle someone else's dirty work"
good,I am a 21year employee with UPS and the upper management is loosing the focus the company was built on in reference to the customers and the employees.  Advancement within the company is still not diverse enough and the competitors will win if they utilize talented people that will get the job done vs the “good ole boys” group...
good,This is a very difficult company to work for.  Freight is 20 years behind in technology even though package leads the industry in this category. Would not recommend a career with this company.
good,"after being taken over, and then the union brought in, the attitude of the entire business changed.  Management went on the attack, looking for reasons to change things andget rid of people."
good,"Typical day at work was spent in a shipping facility. Depending on where management wanted you, you'd be either loading/unloading a trailer, handling hazardous materials, labeling packages/ working conveyors, or transporting packages to where they needed to go via dolly/tote. Management was very speed oriented occasionally to the detriment of their employees. It wasn't uncommon to be shouted at by higher-ups to go faster, only to later be chastised for the inevitable mistakes that entailed. Had to always be on the lookout for dangerous packages/packaging such as, plastic bottles filled with acid, 150+ pound packages, crates of live bees, occasionally explosives, etc."
good,If the right people were hired they would have a great operation wothout many issues. The union workers run the company. There are aloy of indians and not enough chiefs.
good,This job was one of the hardest I have ever accomplished. Not because it is mentally challenging. But because of the pace that you have to maintain for hours. You only get the one real break. Very hard to maintain over an 8+ hour shift.
good,The UPS store provided a way for students to maintain a successful academic career while also providing a secure income. An excellent place to work to start acquiring management skills and other coworker communication skills
good,"pay is good great health benefits nice coworkers .management only cares about number they dont care that you have a family .you know your start times never know finish time now if you are a new driver you work Saturday and Sunday.forget about family life.now it will take you forever to make top pay .union IBT is weak they want to pass contract that was vetoed by drivers, stay away from this company you will regret it"
good,The hours are to short and the pay is to little even for the hours you work. Security is horrible they don’t care about anything. When you have family emergency they will not let you call off.
good,"UPS has many career advancement opportunities and they will help pay for your education, but the advancement opportunities are limited to people who have connections in higher places :/"
good,"While the benefits of the job are excellent, you must work a minimum of 9 months before receiving them as per the union contract for the area. Also all employees are part time except on a first come first serve basis for bids on full time jobs always awarded to longest working employees regardless of skill level. The part time management in the individual areas is excellent and does what they can to run the shift well in the areas based on what they can by union contract rules but the upper management thinks solely of the labor hours and nothing more so will frequently send home employees leaving the ones there to work twice as hard twice as fast to make up for the lack of proper staffing. Also their is no proper air filtration or climate control for the building and as such during the seasonal changes the environment is extremely harsh and the air is filled with dust making it hard to breathe sometimes and masks are not provided to employees they must provide their are own."
good,Basically when you start you start from the ground as a loader of semi truck by hand stacking boxes. Technically they are to be stacked neatly but prior shift just tossed them in and you have to restack them.
good,"- 8 to 10 hours a day"
good,"Package handler tends to be a stressful job if physically unfit, or tend to deal with stressful situations unprofessionally. The job is very high paced and in moderate work space condition."
good,"Being a package handler is demanding both mentally and physically. It is not for everyone. The management at my location was pretty poor which fostered a low morale across the warehouse. They treat people as bodies, not as actual people. They even use the word ""body"" when they talk about staffing (i.e. I need help. Can anyone send me a body?) This culture needs to change is they want to lower the turn-over rate."
good,"Great for the college kid that wants to earn a little cash while going to school and lift heavy boxes for 4 - 5 hours."
good,The company offers good benefits.  The management needs some work. Not very professional and didn't follow through on the proper issues. Enjoyed doing straight data entry.
good,"Needs more hours & higher pay. Hours are tough to work and don’t get paid enough for the mainland labor were forced to do. Insurance is great, but hard to live on $10. For 3-5 hours a day."
good,I really enjoyed the hard labor and job description but the management made it a hostile work environment. Most days we were forced to work thru our lunch break or punished with verbal abused. The best part about the job was when i finished my task and felt like i accomplished my work. to take a step back and look at everything I finished felt good. the hardest part was when management would harass the workers and call us names.
good,I learned when working with UPS that they will push you until you can't breath but the gist of it is don't stop don't even weary about stopping either the main thing I liked about the job is the team work and love my co-workers did for me and I did for them. It's not for everybody I can tell you that for the most part.
good,Ledningen på företaget försökte styra personal enligt de lagar och regler som existerar i USA där personalen till och med blev verbalt hotade om fysiskt våld om man inte gjorde som man blev tillsagd.
good,Being a package handler is ok if you plan on being there part time or seasonal. It's extremely tough if your plan is to start your career at this position to become a driver or something else. Seniority is everything and don't expect any actual seniority unless you stay 8+ years.
good,Ups is fast paced and stressful. They are union and the benefits are great but you have to be there a yr to get them. The pay is not good for the type of work and the environment.
good,"Worked night shift. Good people working with me."
good,"ups is a union so everything sucks but you can't get fired."
good,"I work for a Franchise called The UPS Store.   The Franchise owner has to have someone to take her every frustrations out on and that person is me.   I hate being there.  She talks down to me and I work very hard, always punctual, and perform tasks outside of my duties."
good,"very demanding work that is fast paced and very physical, you are constantly watched and pushed by management. it took 6 years to get a full time position."
good,The job was only a few hours a day.  Not enough to live on.  Chances for advancement were limited.  The warehouse atmosphere made it hard to work.  I was the only one there most of the time.
good,"Fast paced "
good,"Good job  , I would recommend it to anybody. You gotta eat before you go an keep a big jug of water because it be pretty hot inside those trucks. Thank you"
good,Its all what you make it what you can deal with at the time and just where you are in life at the moment. If you work in the warehouse its garbage they don't appreciate their workers and the warehouse is the heart of the company. Treat your employees great they'll do what you need without hesitation guarantee ....
good,Very fast paced get the job done type of job. Not really worried about production just as long as you stay busy. Part-time but willing to give extra hours when needed.
good,"working at LCH was a very judgmental job. it would seem working in a warehouse would be fine, but you were judged upon appearance. they did not provide sufficient training for the specific location I was placed in."
good,"It was a fun job with the right employees.  It was somewhat stressful and didnt think I got paid enough for the work I was required to put in. I got a lot of customer service experience from it though,"
good,Taught me how to organize packages and to get orders organized. You go to the same houses everyday for the most part and have the same route. Enjoyable riding with the door open and getting to know the customers you deliver to.
good,"It is a very difficult place to work for with the lack of benefits and very low pay. The work environment itself is very harsh. When it is cold outside, it is freezing inside, when it is hot outside, it is like you are working inside an oven."
good,Hours vary. 45-55 hours per week. Crazy during Christmas. Micro-management company. Everyday is different. Heavy lifting. Union company that can halt production.
good,"The job I found interesting, especially the shipping. "
good,I learned a lot about courier service procedures that I can apply to my own business one day. The work environment was high paced. The training was on the job training for the most part. The company is a great company. Since it is a Seasonal Job there is not a learning curve or much time to prove yourself. By time you master the skills require to do the job effectively the season is over.
good,"I work in a part-time management person. But I work full time. Trying to get an actual full-time position is very hard, in package operations. But they'll work you full time as they need. The company is structured somewhat like the military and you are expected to live/breather your responsibilities. They pay just enough to keep people working for the company (aside from the Teamster drivers who make very good money), but the raises are pitiful and the company vibe is very oppressive and old fashioned. And I am from that old-fashioned era. It's not good. "
good,"Depending on your shift things may be different but for the preload shift you are charged with loading the UPS panel vans for the drivers to take out for delivery. The management seems oblivious to the real issues and instead focuses on meaningless numbers. Depending on which trucks and routes you load, you can be asked to load anywhere from 700 to 1300 packages in 5 hours. Thats 2 to 5 packages per minute, and yes it is doable but not all packages are the same. So you have to be able to get more than that for small packages cause there will be packages that are impossible to move that fast. Sometimes they will give you more packages than can fit in the truck and you just have to find some way to move them to the side all while keeping pace. There are some good managers but the training is insufficient for peak season when the box line is overwhelmed with the sheer number of packages. Expect to get very little sleep during the time from Thanksgiving to Christmas, with 7 hour days and 6 day work weeks. Overall UPS gives enough benefits that it can be a relatively good job in the long-term. Short-term the benefits are not worth it and the turnover rate is unusually high because of the demanding work and soul-sucking fluorescent lights."
good,"Ich war Sortierer erst in der Twilight dann in der Midnight.In der Twilight herrschte rauer Ton teilweise unmenschlich behandelt worden lag einfach daran das Marokkahner und deutsche Frau die selbstbewusst ist nicht passen, und somit gab es immer heftige Auseinandersetzungen.Letztendlich ging ich in die Abendschicht da war alles gut bis der Chef dort versetzt wurde und ein anderer kam.Mein Vertrag lief nach 2 Jahren aus wo rum ich auch froh bin.Die Arbeit war okay die Bezahlung war super gerade in der Nachtarbeit, die Kollegen waren alle super immer gut drauf."
good,"Most people are nice, you're expected to get in and get out and that's pretty much it. No real culture or uplifting environment... obviously, it's a warehouse. Will also add, the place is HIGHLY ignorant, I mean I guess it makes sense since majority of the workers are from third world countries. Lots of harassment, homophobia and overall lack of respect for other human beings."
good,"Lifting/moving packages (sometimes <50lb) constantly getting in and out of trucks, asking customers for signatures fast paced always on a schedule physically demanding."
good,"It’s a great place to work if you can handle harsh weather conditions and always being dirty. Great benefits, you just have to work to make it to the benefit mark."
good,Ups gave me a chance to experience a fast paste but fun working environment. This job taught me to be quick on my feet and a leader.  It help me to stay focus and get the job done.  I feel more experience as an employer and as a person when it comes to accomplishing my job duties. I am happy to say i was apart of ther team.
good,This should be a temporary job or a second job if your looking for more hours. Very fast paced and labor intensive. Any prior injuries of your back may not be suitable for you.
good,"Great Resume builder. Company mostly promotes from within so there are a plethora of opportunities available. Great benefits, many people who work at my facility do so for the sake of the insurance."
good,Ups was a mental building job. Ups is a job tat weavs out the real working men and women. Ups is a very intense job that requires commitment and dedication
good,work on your feet basically killing yourself for almost your whole life to receive those benefits. Manger’s are bad mouth and just overall disgusting.
good,Not a great place to work. The managers are very rude and you get less than 20 hours a week. They pay good but they don’t give you any hours. They would rather have not enough people and get nothing done then have the right amount of people.
good,"Freedom of the job to manage your time yourself and effectively so that you can improve productivity."
good,Not very safe at all. Feel I work with racist people. Fast paced work environment. Always feel rushed. Sometimes it's workable but really want something else and something better.
good,"What i learned from ups is that the job is fast paced and you have to watch what your doing or you will get hurt no paying attention. Its not a hard job to do,you just have to have the mind set to wanna work there"
good,"If you wish to have a personal life do not work at UPS.  Especially if in Management.  You constantly are asked to put in extra hours, get calls at all times of the day or night, and when you are on vacation."
good,"daily meetings, followed by a walk through of your area , trying to coordinate with superiors about the workflow , and the staffing we are able to use"
good,you will work and management is not your friend. stick with the union do not become a supervisor and get to know the rules and regulations quick. always be on time and never leave utill they say you can go
good,Very fast paced setting with limited break periods. Stressful work environment that is compounded during peak season(Late November -  Early January). Must be able to lift 70 lbs alone and often heavier packages that will require help.
good,A typical day a ups requires varies depending on the role that you are performing during the day. An associate is required to keep a high sense of urgency in order to keep up with products. There are different areas where an associate is needed where work ethic is a plus
good,I have learnt a lot. we worked as a team and respected each other and its a productive company and always looking for ways to make it happen. we also listen to each other
good,"No fue muy bueno, no dure mucho tiempo, me daban muy pocas horas trataba de hacer mas o aprender mas cada dia pero no dedicaban ese tiempo, para uno ayudarles y agilizar el trabajo. La manager tenia una mala manera de pedir las cosas. No fue un ambiente para mi."
good,"Really good job for part timers to make money, it’s quick easy & good paste to work. Has to stay hydrated & willing to work hard for a good couple of hours"
good,The UPS Store was a good job. Customer service can always be demanding. Every day is different; you never know what's going to walk through the doors. There will be days spent cleaning mostly the whole day and there will be days where it is so busy that you don't get to clean until after the store is closed.
good,"UPS retail locations are not stimulating in anyway. The area manager was neglectful and inappropriate. However, my store manager was excellent and truly the only reason why I stayed for as long as I did."
good,"The job was a great first job and summer job. starting pay is good for a student, but nothing to live off of. my manager was very flexible and overall was very good. Holiday season is stressful but a great time to make extra money. overall, a great introduction into the world of shipping, but lacks longterm benefits or incentives."
good,long hours and a lot of drive time to get to delivery area. very fast paced loading all parcel on to trucks.  alot of misplaced packages or damaged.they need to update there loading equipment
good,"The store was not continuously busy during all hours, but every other hour customers would rush in to have their items expertly packaged and shipped off to their destination. Having us package their items included with insurance, depending on how expensive the item(s) were, the customers were able to leave our store with the ease of mind knowing that their package would arrive to its destination safely and in a timely manner. Working as a team helped expedite the entire process; one employee would take care of the customer showing them different prices for different arrival times and dates, while the other employee would securely package the items they were sending and put them in the most economically sized and priced box. The most difficult part of the job was explaining to customers how and why certain packages could not be shipped, especially shipments that were going overseas. There are many factors involved as to why certain packages cannot be shipped (tobacco, certain medication, insects, trees/plants), but being able to give the customer alternatives and explanations helped make them aware of what to do, or not do, the next time they shipped a package. My favorite part of the job was being able to talk to and getting to know customers, especially those who came in on a daily basis. Also, building rapport and trust between myself and the customer helped exponentially when they were planning on shipping high-valued items. Having customers ask specifically for me to help them made the difficult times worth everything."
good,This is the type of job that you get when you just need money for the bills and nothing else. If you have drive and ambition to be something I doubt it would be a box handler for UPS.
good,"Its a good place to work if you know how to work, and it was part time and nights, never could get used to that and I was young it was a good starter job."
good,UPS makes it hard for you to further a career and that's why not everyone is a driver. They don't hire anybody throughout the year but only hire during the holiday season where im located. Then once peak is over then the trucks will be taken away and the volume of packages will decrease exponentially. So if you want to work for the co. go for it but just be prepared to go through some things to get the cream of the crop!
good,Good place just lack of benefits and advancement opportunity. Holliday's can get a bit rough and if you meet the customers that were there forever it gets pretty dicey if your new
good,"Busy work days, fast-paced. Learn how to unload and load trucks, learn about safety work ethics. Understanding on how to use a forklift, enjoy the outdoors working."
good,"It wasnt bad untill one day i show up ready to work as usual n i get it n there was nobody there n outta no where i get laid off, with is bs after all the hard work i did for then"
good,"They made us believe that we would be called at anytime (Monday-Friday 6 am-10 am) and we had to be available to receive our assignments. During the 4 week period with 20 open opportunities to work, I was called and placed with a driver 1 time. You read that correctly...1 time. With orientation being a paid one and me working 1 day, I made a whopping $130...and they still managed to get that wrong. The center that I was assigned to never answered the phone. I had to go through another center just to reach them. HR was extremely unhelpful. Since direct deposit was not an option for seasonal helpers, I had to make the 30 minute trek to the warehouse and half the time, they weren't there (even though they said they would be.)"
good,"Based on my review below you would think I would never recommend or work for UPS again, but overall it was an OK job and I would consider working for them again, but only if I didn't have another alternative."
good,the pay scale for part time preloaders is very little for the work demanded.  next to no incentive for working overnights as part time employee. Holiday hours are nice because you will make a lot of overtime hours (any shift past 5 hours)
good,"If you have ever known anyone who worked here, you know pretty much what to expect. Fast paced warehouse, with a focus on time-managed logistics. Watch out for the training (or lack thereof) and the focus (lol) on safety."
good,Ups is a good place to work if you are hard working a fast learner and a active listener they have flexible schedules and it is a good place to start a career
good,"I'd recommend this job if you're either a student or approaching retirement. My department is about 96% of baby boomers generation than youths. Management makes you work hard but very low pay. I started as part-time while attending college full-time, then moved to a full-time position for extra hours. Sometimes management is understanding with your work/life balance situations but too greedy to reach their numbers. Limited career advancement for recent graduates. Someone has to retire for another person to take over their position."
good,"Ups is a nice job the workers are really friendly, but the hours is the only thing they don't work with you, they are not as organized with the hours."
good,"Hard place to work for, very stressful! Things can get out of control very quickly.  Your regularly scheduled things collide with things that happen daily."
good,"Honestly, it was an amazing job when I was a single woman. Once I had a baby though it became increasingly hard to balance work and life. I was a single mom and it was impossible to balance at the end so I had to make a decision for my daughter. They paid me well and took care of my financial needs but the politics and abuse in terms of expectations became too much"
good,"At the United Parcel Service I was a package handler. I unloaded boxes onto a conveyor belt and I had also loaded boxes onto trailers to be shipped out. This job is very hard on your body, you are constantly moving."
good,I had a great experience I couldn’t balance my sleep schedule correctly my manager was working with then things just took a turn for the worse I do recon working during a holiday or if you are guaranteed ready to work
good,"Loading, sorting, and unloading packages from trucks. Used forklift and manual strength. Part-time work for little pay. Career advancement available if you can manage working for low pay for at least a yr."
good,"Within my 5 weeks of working as a driver helper, I learned a lot via an employee whom has been with UPS for over 30 years.  From their perspective, they've ""never seen it this bad"".  Though, if available, I would absolutely consider a building position (HR, supervise)"
good,UPS delivered packages well. Management is overworked and underappreciated. Safety policies could be better enforced and equipment needs servicing more often.
good,Yet and still I just need for my resume to be updated at this very point and time. Most likely when I get a little extra spare time on my hands ill finish my review how its suppose to be.
good,It was a very stressful place that made you want to grow and move up in the ranks. Managers often did not care about the quality of your health or quality of work.
good,The packages Would travel down the conveyor belt where we would sort them into their proper destination bins. I learned the mail industry. Management was for the experienced. I liked the feeling I got after a well done job.
good,"So, so, so stressful but the schedule works so well for life in general. Just make sure to have a thick skin and be ready to sweat. I was only there for the tuition reimbursement. Really helped me out."
good,I have no statement of this company since I was a Temp employee just seasonal work around Christmas. I was doing mail when it comes in and also helping shipping the mail out to the customers on time.
good,"Not a job to expect a lot of money in. You're essentially being paid to work out for a few hours a day. Management was great and made sure you were being looked after. For the amount of physical labor you're doing, didn't feel like the pay was adequate."
good,"A typical day of work is never set...an Unloader may be working almost anywhere in the building, except for loading a package car or a trailer. There isn't too much to learn at UPS, short of a zip code. Management isn't all that approachable in the upper echelon; the lower echelon is very approachable; they work hard as the people they employ. The workplace culture is different than what is advertised and advancement is slow, at best. The hardest part of the job is recovering from the night before, and the enjoyable part of the job is when you're not on the clock."
good,"Its hard work few hours low pay. atmosphere is not too bad, It is really a part time gig. u get paid less that deleivery drivers by about 100 percent and sweat more than them"
good,Working at UPS in the winter was something. It was pretty tough but you had to keep moving and keep the same pace all day everyday. It is a very physical job.
good,"Interne Arbeitsabläufe sehr leicht zu lernen."
good,This was only a seasonal job. Unloading and loading trucks for shipping packages across the world. For the job itself it made the hours long and overall not much money was to be made.
good,Great job security but corporate is quick to take away from the front line supervisors in order to save costs. In order to advance you must the company's needs before all.
good,A fast paced job requiring the employee to be alert and cautious at all times while the conveyor belt in running with packages especially heavy packages and hazmat's.
good,My time with UPS was when I was in Automotive school I worked UPS part time on twilight shift from 5pm to 10pm  I would leave from school and go to UPS. My workday consisted of loading trailers of wood pallets and loading trailers of UPS freight by operating a propane forklift.
good,This job had all the benefits and everything but I don't know if it's just where I live but they do not care for their employees. They cease to go by the handbook to do things.
good,"You are paid well with time off. You will have a hard time balancing work and family life. You are not treated with much respect or value, just a number to be replaced if needed."
good,"Hardest part of the job is that there are no true mentors in the company because every one is most likely over worked."
good,"Based on experience i have with TNT it was the same work load. Driving and delivering packages safely, Lifting and carrying light and heavy packages, servicing and interacting with customers during pickups and deliveries. Similar responsibilities and i felt comfortable doing the work. Very organized but they dd not really need me soon after hiring."
good,"Very fast paced and goal oriented workplace. Management did not work very well with secondary management, which caused a lot of tension. Seemed that production over safety was a daily battle."
good,"you definitely have to work hard, but most of the time no one will acknowledge your hard work or effort. it will interfere with your personal life especially during peak season."
good,Being a package handler for UPS is a very stressful job. You are constantly running around and trying to make sure things get done on time. This job is not for everyone.
good,you are expected to due twice the work in half of the time. Management puts all of the blame on the drivers. you will do about 50 hours a week. You will have no family life.
good,"Normal day unloading and scanning/loading packages on the trucks, bulk lifting sometimes needed. Work went pretty quick, got along well with my co-workers working side by side."
good,"I missed out on so much of my kids growing up.  Games, teachers' conferences, it's demanding and not a lot of room for accommodation for work/life balance."
good,"Long days, not expected to use a sat nav but you do get used to it! Very thorough safety training which is important but I felt more training should go into showing you how to do the job. All about health and safety which is understandable."
good,N/A I don't have any reviews id like to put in this section. Ups was a temp job and the assignment ended due to the closed that department down and moved to a new facility.
good,The Management and worker relationship is not great. They say they are about safety but all they care about is their numbers. Dont care about you as a person at all.
good,"It's not a bad job, nor the best job. If everyone or the majority of the employees followed the safety rules throughout the place, both inside and outside of the building, then it would be a safer place to work.  If some of the employees, mostly the younger generation, would stop playing around and stop acting everything is a joke, then maybe it would be a better place, and if management would enforce all of the particular and the basic rules of operation, and how things are supposed to be done correctly and properly, maybe it would be a safer, and a better place to work.Long story short, poor work ethic"
good,the union and management friction created a less that desirable work environment. the atmosphere was intense and personalities often clashed. rarely an easy day.
good,"Get to work around 4-430am, Many people are still tired and not too friendly. Be ready to work, if your lazy it will not be a job for you. They provide good benefits and chances to advance, but you will work hard."
good,"Enjoyed working directly with customers and getting to know them. Shipped out packages daily and made custom boxes at times. Did notaries thru job, would have enjoyed still doing it."
good,More training needed for management and overall staff. Could be a better place to work if communication was better. Benefits have changed drastically and need reviewing.
good,UPS Freight is not interested in promoting hard working knowledgeable employees.  Management is very closed off and difficult to break into the salary ranges.  Benefits are not competitive with the rest of the company under the freight umbrella.
good,Requires a calm demeanor. Highly unorganized at times. Management needs to be more involved and attentive. Need more employees to lighten work load. More attention needs to be paid to cleanliness of facility and vehicles.
good,"The best thing about working at UPS is the co-workers. The people are smart and work very hard. There is a bit of a good ol boy mentality within upper management. And not enough clear leadership. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement, but plenty of chances for lateral moves within the company."
good,"Pretty easy job. I used a golf cart to make seasonal deliveries during the Christmas season. I enjoyed it and working without direct supervision was really nice. Had a good trainer who took time to show the ends and outs of job. I would load golf cart with packages delivered to a storage unit. Would sort packages by area and load cart for delivery then, drive cart through the neighborhood making deliveries. Only thing surprising to me was the lack of care or concern for the safe handling of packages. It was pretty shocking. I had to deliver packages that were soaked from rainfall. Very low pay for such labor intensive work. Not really worth it all things considered."
good,"UPS is not as bad as people say it it . As long as yoiu go by the rules and stay safe you'll be just fine. You must stay hydrated with water and a snack during your shift . The job is not super easy . Working at ups may cause soreness , tiredness . You are only allowed a 10 minute break during your shift , but you get paid weekly which is the best part"
good,"Would be a great job with different management culture. Employees and lower level management are not treated with respect. Hostility and threats are a daily occurrence. Nice hours for working around other commitments, pay is not livable on it's own."
good,"4 yıla yakın sürede çalıştım "
good,"On a typical day you would come in, go to your load set, and if you are there early enough you can sit in one of your three trunks (This is if you worked on a straight belt line). Once you see how many pieces you have to load, with is mostly around 700-800 on a good day, you think to yourself, ""Holy mother of God, how do they expect me to do this by myself?"" After around 3 hours you get a 10min break which feels like 2 mins, then it's back to work. Once the drivers get there depending on who's driving your trucks, you hear a bunch of whining men who expect you to do their job for them. ""this goes like this, this goes like that, when im out there they only give me a certain amount of time to do this and that!"""
good,"They ""let employees go"" to easily, terrible management, etc. Not responsible franchise owner. Decent pay, some nice co-workers, some decent management"
good,"My boss was horrible. He never gave us pay raises and was very difficult to work with. He wanted to do everything himself whenever he came to the office, it was like he didn't trust his employees to do it themselves."
good,"-A work day was stressful "
good,Ups  Is a good company to work for just lot of hard work and dedication  great money but the management treat you terrible but work hard and you can go up the company ladder
good,"Fun people to work around "
good,UPS is a good company to work for but I do not see any advancement in this company. It is based on who you know and who you can be like. I go there and do my job and improve my team but never get recognition for it. I build up my area then I get taken out of the area once the group is built. Once I get taken out then the area falls apart. I have seen this happen too many times but yet never get credit for the good work I do.
good,"Working at ups can be a wonderful experience, or it could be a nightmare, it's all about how you look at things, it's a pretty easy, repetitive job, depending on which department your working in, my favorite position is ramp agent, at the air hub facilities."
good,The UPS Store is not UPS Corporate so it is not a union job which means no affordable benefits and minimum wage. It's easy work but inadequate training and poor management with zero accountability create an environment that is hard to work in. There is also no room for advancement.
good,Didn't like the work it was hard and not a good work area it was dirty and the management didn't treat their employees with respect or very fairly also the labor was hard and unfair it was too much work for one person
good,"A seasonal position , okay for quick money, Pay should be more..Facilities should be updated with modern day equipment. All safety issues need more attention. Management could be more welcoming and friendly. Invite a more diverse workforce of individuals.Less clicks and favorites. Truly reward and appreciate hard workers and leaders."
good,Fast paced environment. Manual handling of goods. Health and safety awareness. Good team work. Friendly environment. With PPE. Have to be physically fit.
good,"UPS is the worlds largest transportation company. The days are very long, the work is very fast paced and the job is very stressful. UPS does not seem poised to handle the ever changing online marketplace. UPS still depends on industrial companies to traditionally ship their products to customers."
good,Not enough hours or pay i was responsible for processing mail on a line and using a scanner and lable machine for the mail to be processed. The supervisor were very ignorant and unorganized
good,"Developed and mentored PT Supervisors on daily management tasks including working with their assigned staff, ensuring safety regulations were followed, and meeting/maintaining production standards. Worked with Human Resources, Plant Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Operations Excellence daily to identify volume predictions, staffing levels needed, and production standards to maintain a desired profit per package. I learned how to work with and develop relationships with every employee in order to achieve a desired result. I found that when solving any work issue it is imperative to involve the employees involved when determining a solution. Making the employee feel like they are a part of the outcome does not only solve most issues but also establishes a partial ownership by the employee. The work place was extremely high pressured with unrealistic expectations. It demanded your full and complete attention which did not leave much time for your personal life. However, I enjoyed the diversity of the job and the necessary ability to adapt and overcome all odds."
good,"I like UPS, has a lot of benefits. But management is disrespectful. I've been doing supervisor work with lead pay, & training supervisors on lead pay."
good,Commission based and fast paced environment. Unstable salary and often demanding of additional duties. Holidays off and short weekend hours were a plus.
good,They mean what they say when you're told part time is full time and full time is all the time.  As a member of management it is understood that you are at the company's disposal 24/7.
good,Arrive between 4:15 and 4:30. sign-in and get to work some will help you. some will not. Very unreasonable management and unfair. More organization within shifts.
good,"As part of offering many services to customers, a day at work at the UPS Store is full of surprises. Working for a franchise owner is sometimes challenging, as budgets are tight leaving no room for employee benefit packages, etc."
good,"If you want a part time job , this one is ok , Not good for full time unless your a driver .its only part time in the main hub. only full time is drivers"
good,"Package Handlers play a crucial role in the success of UPS, whether they're sorting packages, loading trucks or unloading trucks. No matter your role, you'll work closely with your team to ensure all the work behind the scenes is done safely and successfully. As a result, you're ensuring customers receive their packages on time, directly impacting the bottom line on a global scale."
good,"If you're looking for a part time job early in the morning, this job is perfect. You can make $150-200 per week. But management is extremely relaxed. You can show up whenever you want, miss days sometimes etc."
good,Good pay for management not so much for the union employees. UPS does pay for everyone's college even management employees. Very easy to move up in the company if you really wanted to.
good,"Every day is a challenge, its all about trying to do things faster with less people. As volume grows there is never enough staffing so I've learned patience and how to adapt to changing conditions all the time."
good,Overall this is okay job. Not too much hard work. Only con is being outside in the cold weather. Also there is not much room for employees to advance and grow within the company.
good,"Lack of communication between management. "
good,"I learned a lot while I was there, but the work/life balance was way on the work side and my life got out of balance, and it has taken years to get back."
good,Not open to new ideas and processes.  Culture is uninspired.  Career advancement is rare.  Metrics are valued over employees.  Work life balance could be better.
good,"not a terrible job, its a good work out and you can have a good laugh with some of the other workers however theres always some sort of drama going on and its not very safe"
good,"Great company with great benefits, I hear.  It's very hard to get hired, because the employees hardly quit.  This may be only in my area, however, I would love a permanent position"
good,"Even though the company says there is room for advancement, not many opportunities are available. I have found that of the positions i cover, not much training is put into making sure that managers are successful. You have to figure it out as you go."
good,"I  wouldn't suggest working here. Supervisors are kind of harsh and everything is fast pace. Harassed me with threats and phone calls to turn in a uniform that i already handed in weeks prior to the letters and phone calls i received. If you like a heavy enforcement and a face paced environment then by all means, maybe UPS is the place for you after all."
good,"I liked working here because the people we good people and it was always good vibes . But one thing I didn't like is that we didn't get no breaks even tho we were moving boxes for hours . And I started to get back pains after a while I didn't like that at all , also the pay wasn't that good because we barely got hours ."
good,"Nothing wrong a little hard work. I've had many jobs in life and this was definitely one of the more intense of them. High pace, high energy, high focus. It builds character."
good,"work hard to compensate for slackers"
good,Work day is varies day to day depending on position.I typically come in before and after school which is nice. But it is also stressful at times due to the difference in day to day work. For example I can be behind a desk one day and the next I will be on the roof.
good,The hours a day is not enough to supplement a family.They want more demand for less pay I learned that you literally have to have no life to work there. work and family balance is not honored. for example a co worker mother passed away during the holiday and was originally granted then was denied after plane ticket was purchased and stressed her out. I do enjoy the people but not so much the supervisors.they abuse the position and can talk to you like a child .at times feels like we as a department is not appreciated.
good,Its quick pace and you have to watch your time for getting shipments out on time to there area. They need better management because on some days I get sent back home because of to many workers. You need to have a set time to start and get off. They tell you when you should be here via text. Its not stable for a person who has a family or has to rely on public transportation.
good,"Every day was very much like the previous. Sorted mail and shipped packages. The staff I worked with made the job fun. Management was inexperienced and took things very personal. Not the ideal person for the position but he was a friend of the family. I would not go back to that UPS store, simply because the lack of growth and the lack of compensation of their employees."
good,so id come into work im not doing much loading trucks but long hours not payed enough for all that labor i had to do there it is a flexible job and it helps but if you can find anything else do it most people quit in the first 3 years and the longer your there the more power you have so when you come in starting your not gonna be able to change postision for a long time becuase managment have worked 5 plus not a very lucrutive company
good,"It is an easy place to work at. the only typical difficulties are if the supervision core is unorganized. there was not many health break food options, and beverage machines were not always operable."
good,"The management team at the call center are not helpful. They do not help build their team for company growth and upward movement."
good,"4:00AM upload shift. Cold early mornings Management supervises a safety first fast-paced work environment. The hardest part of the job is not being safe. The most enjoyable part of my job was, being able to challenge myself to be a perfectionist on time with uploading my cargo. I learned to always work safety first."
good,"The place is hot and sticky. The staff are friendly and easy to get along with. Overall, I enjoyed working with the staff at UPS. They are easy t get along with and passionate about their work."
good,"Using both hands while working consistently, makes the time go by fast. Working at UPS everyone get to break together so you get to meet new people and your employees are, for the most welcoming."
good,If you are staying local for school its a no brainer. You get compensated for your entire semester as a full time student and community colleges. Add the health benefits and potential to go d UPS is a good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work is scanning drop off and making labels."
good,"I loved this job a lot, but the hours were not guaranteed. When the work slows people start to get laid off and it happens too often."
good,"If you like to work over night than this job might be right up your alley. It is part time, so they have you cram 8 hours of work into the 4-5 hours that they ALLOW you to stay. You cant go over the set hours of work they allow you to work. I would say work here in the holiday season so you can get the bonuses, and extra hours to get a good paid check that will actually feed you and your family. But most of the staff is pretty awesome and some of the employees there, if you love sarcastic humored elder guys you'll run into that a lot and it will keep you energized when you feel like falling asleep on the job. Advancement in this company will take a couple of years."
good,"Too much micro managing and middle management took advantage of good hard and productive workers. "
good,Work days are always different. Learned to be more productive and managed time differently. Enjoyed meeting new people and helping them send memorable packages.
good,The franchise I had worked at in the chain was ran by a man who would be ready to fire you at the drop of a pen almost. It made it a very difficult environment to be in and I was constantly in fear for my job.
good,"Travail extrêmement physique, le responsable est très désagréable et fonctionne pas au boulot mais a la tête de la personne."
good,"Somehow it all seems fair if you want to compare it to other warehouse jobs, especially FedEx Ground, who are far more strict. The fact that you are part of Teamsters Union means they can yell at you to do your job, but you can yell back at them as long as you're doing the work safely. That's the environment here. Lots of lifting and yelling. If you ever work here, take it easy and go at your own pace. Because the harder you work, the harder they'll make you work, and that's my issue with the the safety aspect of it."
good,My advice to people who want to work there is to stick to yourself through your work and don't trust none the employees or supervisors
good,its ok if you can put work before your life.  most people worry more about what you are doing than what they need to be doing.  supervision is all new and have very little clue whats going on
good,It's hard to get full time after being seasonal driver. I have done it for 5 years and not even being looked at for full time position. Most of the other drivers are very helpful and friendly to each other
good,"It was a good job for when I needed it, but with problems between staff and being moved around all the time to do jobs that aren't what I was hired for, nor would I get the same wage as the other person."
good,I unloaded tractor trailers in a timely manner. Loading package car to send to customers. management was always used my skill in different areas of production.I also did some sorting of mail and packages
good,Work is very hard be ready to work he ready to lift very heavy boxes.Benefits are good but you have to be there for a year to move on.Overtime is very rare only during very busy time.Breaks are very short and rare when working almost three hours straight.
good,Working at UPS has been an up and down experience for me. The pay is good and my coworkers are what is keeping me around to continue working there. I don't really have anything else to say about the job.
good,It was a positive experience but the warehouse always seemed to be too hot or too cold. I met some wonderful people. I do wish they had a uniform training program.
good,"work was good but not enough hours, it was part time.it was fine doing the unloading and getting the truck to delivery what was on the truck.the other works were good to work with"
good,"A typical day consists of organizing packages, driving to appropriate destinations, and ensuring on time arrival of packages sent through UPS.  I enjoy interacting with customers."
good,they yell in your face which I didnt like. I was a package handler for less then a month. Managers attitude was unprofessional and the way he talked to his employees are awlful
good,I enjoy working in a place that I can keep busy because I am a very energetic person and love being on the go. the hardest part about the job was lifting very heavy things or dealing with spills that occurred in the work place. the drivers at UPS were very nice and easy to get along with.
good,Management was always behind doors and did not care about employees opinions. The hardest part of working there was always being notified of changes late.
good,"Being that I have been inside the Windfield warehouse , to back doors of public stores, to air port, plus other Locations."
good,"UPS is a fast paced job with aggressive management.  The bottom line is how their numbers look on paper, and not so much how they actually perform.   A commonly used phrase among employees is ""Safety first until it interferes with production.""  The management staff is comprised of good apples and bad apples, just like everywhere else in the world.  The majority of my co-workers are hard working and do their jobs well once they have received proper training.  However, management does not always properly train their employees.  The hardest part about the job is watching members of our management team ignore problems that occur on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of the day."
good,Managers are bad professional and should try to do half the work us front lines works do ..To mutch stress and back stabbing high rate of illegal firing job bad !!!!
good,My UPS career has been one of great strength for me as well as a detriment to me and my family. At this point I am near the end of this career and am looking forward to moving on.
good,"A typical day would be me taking care of claims from damaged or missing packages. Dealing with the mail center and packing packages up properly. Customer service is a must always smiling and interacting with customers whether they are irate or pleasant. "
good,"Hr was friendly and inviting. Typical day was a hard one lots of hard work, it was a workout loading and unloading heavy boxes. Management wasn't hands on didn't get to know employees, coworkers were tired."
good,"Worked at the Sherman,TX. AS UPS. The most demanding job I ever had. Management always hollering at you. I watched people come and go and I was 42yrs.old at the time. Was Army Ranger,had reason to be hollered at. But shouldn't have to go to work and expect to be hollered at one reason they cannot keep people. I looked at it as a work out every morning. That's what kept me there. If u have ahard time still after one week chances are you want make it very much longer."
good,Co-workers are usually okay mostly grumpy due to showing up to work at 3 am. Otherwise it is a great working environment and a great place to learn new set of skills.
good,Your coworkers are great but there are no benefits or upward mobility. The pay is okay. This good for a part time job. I recommend it as a part time job
good,"I was worked as a service provider Bur Dubai, it was a busy and hectic work schedule. But I have learned it fast as I was directly from hotel industry."
good,Working for UPS is a challenging experience with great benefits. The pay for the hours and the hostility of an environment is the hardest part of the job.
good,"its a office job, its out of the operation. there's a lot of stress of the planning and operational aspect. There's a lot of responsibility's in regards to time card systems and reports."
good,same day to day routine. I did enjoy when they randomly hosted barbeques for safety achievements but those were every so often.
good,"Great place to work for extra holiday money. 3rd shift took so time to get adjusted to but overall i was satisfied."
good,je suis sous traitant de cette société depuis 7ans société très sérieuse au niveau travail mais très mauvais management et communication.
good,"I liked to work there just because I stayed busy the whole time, When im not busy the day drags on. The people there were ok, But the supervisors there seemed to only care about themselves."
good,"I felt like I was always trained well.  Attended during college, great benefits.  After graduation gave them 3 months but nothing within my degree"
good,"Fast paced organization that is results driven, great opportunity to get into management if you are in college. Big organization that looks good on resume, Union and Management have big differences in operations methods."
good,"Everyday was different and would require frequent problem solving skills.  There was never the opportunity to get bored as everything was always changing.  "
good,"I actually work for Swissport at the UPS account right at the airport. The job is simple, physical, you need to be careful to avoid accidents and pay attention to details."
good,"The Work was Pretty Easy i worked Second Shift That was 4 Pm to 4 Am but Most days we ran out of work around 2 Am.A Normal Work day for was was Cleaning phones, Scanning Phones to a Box and or location with an Rf Scan Gun, My only problem was the Bosses and leads were very Difficult to work with they never Showed Respect to there Employees."
good,ups is a fast pace work environment place everything is about time with ups just dont get alot of hours out i just need more hour to
good,company is non union witch makes it very hard to ever make plans hard on the childred and family life for fun benefits are very good good health insurance though
good,A typical day at work included moving heavy boxes at a fast work load usually in a very cold environment but I had awesome coworkers so it made work bearable.
good,I go in and route the bill accounts and then qc the small parcel and the LTL parcel and qc the replenish  inventory for the shelves answered questions helped train
good,It was a difficult place to work.  All of the packages having to be sorted at the rate of ten per sixty seconds. I worked in the last series of conveyer belts and we would get the miss sorts from the other groups .
good,Help driver delieved packages to people before christmas. Work threw the snow and cold.  Everyday I worked I met someone new.
good,"In Canada they are operating with Canada cartage they don't hire directly ... Canada cartage is a family run company so their are less"
good,"It wasn't bad but could have been better, they did offer school for employees, which was good but after being there 7 years it was just time for a change."
good,"Manager is disorganized, work environment is slow paced and there is no room for promotions. Decent amount of employees, and mostly easy to get along with."
good,Worked 10 hours a day. Learned how to drive a commercial truck. Management were more business oriented than personal. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was the summer time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being off during the holidays.
good,Opportunities to cross train and move up. Low starting pay. Fast paced environment. Must pay union dues. Extremely heavy packages. Back brace recommended.
good,"A place i do not recommend that anyone go to unless it is their only option for a job/paying for school.  Balancing life, a job in the 3rd shift, and school is close to impossible."
good,Scanner and a processor and you'd have to scan at least 475 an hour. You deal with Barnes and Noble QVC which is medicine and also other mail. You work at least 9 hours a day and you get one 30 minute break. Pretty unorganized leads and management but the days went by pretty smooth.
good,flexible  hours . fun staff and co-workers. fast learning environment. Comfortable work atmosphere. well trained management .
good,"Very fun place to work but needs better managment people in charge"
good,I just handle shipping and packing with heavy customer service duties. I also deal with some paper work filing and input. Management is barely present as of late and the store seems to be under supplied.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of packaging boxes for customers and helping out with any daily tasks they had such as getting their mail, faxing papers,and copying documents. I learned to use these products as well as make business cards and packaging products. Management did their job fairly and my co-worker was a great teacher. The hardest part of my job was not to being able to answer all of the customers questions. The most enjoyable was providing a great service and forming a customer relationship to earn more business."
good,"Projects and job related expectations are high, but the training structure is minimal and often disorganized. It was not uncommon to be provided with outdated training material with the expectation you would be able to perform you job related duties which would be  years newer than your training materials."
good,I start off with next day air shipments that have to be processed by 7:30 along with orders that will be picked throughout the day. I receive help from co-workers if it gets too busy. The hardest part about my job is when it gets really busy and i don't have any help because my co-workers are also busy.
good,"Hardest part of the job is to remain healthy. You must maintain  good physical condition, due to the fact that they work you like no other. No down period except but 15 min break and then back to work. Career opportunities are bleak due to the new contract with the union which makes your window to become full time nil. But, you will have full time benefit for part time work. Management is management you reach impossible goals and management wants more from you."
good,"Working as a supervisor in the hub is pointless. If upper management likes you, you may have the potential to move up but I wouldnt count on it."
good,"On a typical day at work, i would be required to fill 50 foot trailers with packages up to 200 lbs at a pace of at least 350 packages an hour. The management was sub-par to be nice. The hardest part of the job was just simply the extreme pace."
good,"Only Seasonal Work Helping Driver Delivering Packages For Just Above Minimum Wage. Very Fast Pace Majority Of Time, And Manual Labor Carrying and Lifting Boxes."
good,"I learned how to operate the rabbit , turret, and order picker.They need a smarter management teams in various buildings but besides that I loved my time there. Well for my co-workers in my building nobody got along we were not a team at all."
good,Overall a good company. You have to be motivated and work hard in order to move up in rank. Once you become a PT supervisor it is hard to move from this position.
good,"12 hour work days from 7am to 7pm. standing and walking all day along a conveying system. Ranging between 10:00-11:50 hr."
good,Learned how to pack a truck and make deliveries and pickups to and from customers.  Management was very understanding and reliable.  Co-workers are enjoyable and knowledgeable.  Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy packages in extreme weather. I enjoyed traveling throughout the County.
good,Working at UPS was very fun. You get to connect with regular customers and the staff is great. I learned more skills than I thought I would. There is so much to learn about the world of logistics.
good,"I love that UPS provides good money and benefits, but if you have a family and want to see them, you're out of luck. They are very un-family oriented. If you need a good paying job and don't mind working your self to pain and exhaustion, then yes, UPS is a pick for you. If you love your kids and cherish spending Christmas and ball games and school events with them, then UPS is not a job for you."
good,"I would like to start by saying that you will not find a better place to learn the ropes of management. That being said, they are untrustworthy to people are approaching retirement."
good,A typical day at UPS Automotive could of started off in the Omaha location and ended as far as 500 miles away without any notice. The problems that occurred that day. Very difficult work life balance.
good,"You do not make 170 a DAY as a Package Handler with 3-4 HRS a day."
good,"Delivered all packages securely and in a timely manner"
good,I dealt with good peopleat ups they were helpful and informative too
good,"Everyday was filled with sorting over 300 packages or more. I was only there seasonal however, I learned the importance of team work. The hardest part of the job was getting to work for 4am. The most enjoyable was loading your area in a timely manner without mistakes."
good,"It was a job I obtained to make extra money. It was a fast pace job near the 4th of July but was only seasonal.  I enjoyed helping the customers and working with my co-workers.  Since this was my first job I've ever had, the hardest part about this job would of been putting in 14 to 16 hours a day for two straight weeks."
good,"> A typical day at work starts between 8:15 am and 8:45 am and the day ends when work volume is completed."
good,"Typical day at work is non-stop manual labor until all of the work is in the trailers.  If you plan on working at UPS, use correct safety methods because it takes a physical toll on you.  Part-time management are given near-impossible tasks to accomplish but they accomplish the job anyway.  Upper management are on the floor directing part-time management.  The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself focused for the entire shift and the most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie."
good,"I was responsible for several employees. when I was supervising on the front line. Keeping workers safe was my responsibility. I was eventually moved to trainer, because I was good with people. The reason why I let is because no advancement, and it was only part time, work."
good,"UPS was an excellent company.  Upper management was excellent. Lower level supervisors  needed training on how to talk to employees,  Hours were less than 10 per week sometimes but seemed to be picking up for the holidays. "
good,"Come in the morning punch in, step on the loading dock and you have a train wreck inside of your truck. Packages are not being loaded right, if the truck moves at all everything is going to be on the floor. You can't walk down the middle of the truck. You have packages that weigh 1lbs to 150lbs. And it's you who will fix this mess and make sure everything gets where it goes, or else. So you have 600 plus packages, 150 stops and 12 hours to do it, but management wants it in 8 or less. The days are hectic, always racing against the clock."
good,"The work wasnt worth the rewards at the end of the day, benefits were okay being a union and all"
good,"Large company, but we are just a small entity in this company. Co-workers are great to work with for an all women staff. No part of this job is very hard or takes a lot of concentration. The best part is working with the public and meeting new people everyday."
good,i didnt know who my supervisor was and i never had the same driver so i was really confused who my upper was
good,"A typical day at work was coming early to the ups warehouse and doing my daily assignments at the job. I learned to scan packages and envelopes, I learned how to work the machines and learn the safety rules. The managers at UPS was helpful and very professional. My co-workers were always nice to me and so respectful. The hardest part of my job was the time schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was working and interacting with my co-workers."
good,"Fast paced, Hard labor. Learned many things in safety and they put a lot of time into training me."
good,"typical day for me was to greet associates as they came into the parking deck between 630-9am. 9-2pm I worked in the loading dock, taking packages and signing in venders to have access to the building"
good,"Day at work is great this start off with what must be done. Wait on the team you work with. Manager give the team a time when everything must be done and other important information. I learn how to write the info on the paperwork, drive the tug at fedex, and look up information on fedex computer. Manager show me or made sure I was traning properly. Co-workers worked as a team. I enjoy the people and manager I worked with. Manager understand and work with his team."
good,friendly people. My supervisor Laura  was great. Like the mid shift that I worked.
good,RNI trucking gave me a great opportunity with them. Although i was making very good money the benefits were poor and i was never home to share time with my family and friends
good,"- Lavoro su vari turni (serali 19.30-22.30, notturni(4.00-7.00);"
good,"I work in Business Development where we function as the sales team to acquire new business for UPS. We don't wear browns, we don't deliver packages, and we definitely do not drive a brown truck. ACCEPT FOR PEAK. During Christmas season the company sets aside all titles and departments and force you to wear browns, get DOT certified, and officially become their slave (especially if you are a salary employee). Here's the good part, if you choose not to because this isn't part of your job description, or because you have a medical condition, you are looked at and treated differently for not being a 'team player'. Take that for culture shock."
good,"there was no set schedule and you had to work til finish, it was fun but at times they got very strict"
good,"There is very little understanding of the balance between criticism and positive reinforcement within management and it leads to a very dissatisfied, cynical, and jaded workforce. The work hours and pay are fair, but the work is difficult."
good,"it was a very fast paced physically demanding job, not too bad, weekends off, the pay wasn't bad either."
good,"It is a RESULTS driven environment, great numbers when it comes to servicing packages. A typical day at work, i will start by assigning equipment and giving my staff their job duties for the night."
good,Atmosphere that challenges you to be creative and motivate others.
good,"Very paternal, less flexible.  Promote from within mentality which can be less diverse."
good,its tiring and not worth the pay they over work the workers and management dont care about their staff there are no bonuses
good,"I wouldn't use this platform to dissuade anyone from applying at UPS as it is a great company to work for.  The past few years, however, have been especially hard for members of management, particularly those who are part-time.  More and more paperwork is being piled up on those managers with very little time to get it all done.  Most of your day is spent breaking jams on belts and dealing with the children that work for you.  Throw some extra frivolous paperwork in the mix, and you've got a disaster.  Employee training has fallen way behind.  As a member of management, you have to make a decision to either falsify your paperwork (we call it a paper job) or try to do it right and know that you won't get done.  And if you don't get it done, you're in the manager's office explaining why.  I worked at one of the larger automated hubs, so my experience probably won't apply to the smaller extended centers.  There are only two reasons you should go into management:  if you're in school, they provide tuition reimbursement or if your dream is to be a top manager.  Other than that, you should stay as a union employee.  You have access to better benefits and better opportunities as a union employee, regardless of whether you're a union member."
good,"muy poco se habla .se mantiene una jornada fuerte de trabajo."
good,"Hard work, slow communication, with employees, great education benifits."
good,"Bij dit bedrijf moest ik even wennen aan de huisregels,"
good,not a bad place to work.  part time hours are lame. have i typed enough yet.
good,"Bonne société, qui fait évoluer son personnel."
good,"PROS: FREE medical/dental/vision/life insurance for you after 12 months, and for your family after 18 months. Raises are inevitably $1 every 6 to 12 months. I liked the work hours (overnight). Weekends off. Holidays off. Paid vacation/personal/sick time after 12 months. Good way to keep in shape. Can wear regular, casual clothing to work. Can bring and play own music.     "
good,"Its pretty much a fast pace work environment  because you have to have the trucks in the packages at a certain time. I felt as though the job could give their employees more breaks, this job is very demanding physically so if u cannot lift or load heavy packages sometimes 40+ lbs this job would not be for you."
good,I worked early in the morning while I was in college. I had difficulty balancing my life between working this job and going to school.
good,"Typical Large Company strengths:"
good,Alors nous arrivions à 08h00 au depot de fleurus nous chargions nos camionette jusque 10h30 de la nous fesions nos itineraire et on partait avec80-90 clients par jour plus enlevements a faire pendant la tournee. On pouvait devenir independant ou au fil des temps etre bien augmente. >Le plus dure etait les conditions climatiques et le nombre de client a faire par jour mais le regard et le sourire des gens en leur apportant le colis etait la plus belle des choses
good,The driver would tell me to meet him in an area close to the route. I learned how to safely handle packages and promptly deliver them. This was a seasonal job so i did not have much interaction with the management team. My co workers were all very good people from different walks of life.. The hardest part was completing larger workloads some days we would have to stay extra hours to complete the load. The most enjoyable part was having somewhat of a set schedule
good,"You work long hours"
good,good benefits but the hours vary way too much to be able to live a good work life balance.
good,Not enough work hours. Enjoyed Packing/Unpacking Boxes. Work was very easy. I wish I was hired fulltime.
good,"There's very little organization to getting new employees situated. Training is not their strong suit. You will be given tasks and told when you do something wrong. Training by errors. The people are great. The job is terrible. Clients always upset, shipments always delayed and management is concerned about the numbers on reports and not service."
good,The work day is fast during seasonal demand. You must have accuracy when analyzing important cargo.
good,"I manage  packages coming in the location, and load packages in a timely manner with accurate location on where the packages was going."
good,"My typical work day was trying to get the packages delivered.Try to get stuff done by a certain time. I have learned that you need to be nice to packages and work hard, walk in fast pace.My co-worker was not the nicest person because i couldn't go to the bathroom when needed too. The hardest part of the job was went it was slippery and you had to the packages up to the house"
good,"This was a physical, fast pace, outdoor work that involved continual lifting, lowering and carrying packages that typically weigh 25-70 pounds. "
good,This is a great job if you are single and don't ever plan on meeting anyone. You will be put out alone with at least ten hours of work. You will lose weight and get in better shape due to the physical aspect of the job but coming home at 7-11pm will get tiring.
good,typical day consisted of meeting regular driver at predetermined location and then riding with the driver for the day assisting in delivering packages during the high volume holiday season.
good,"If you have no problem with extreme heat, fast paced work and alot of overtime this is the place. I had very few complaints about the location except they say they will hire you from temp working after 90. I talked with a fellow temp worker there an he was still working as a temp after 6 months and thats why I looked elsewhere for more stable work."
good,Non stop rigorous work qith a short break. I did learn how to properly move objects of various sizes. The hardest part of the job knowing you are being under compensated for a brutal hard day's work.
good,Unloaded nightly trucks. Learned where packages were going and speedy destination deliveries. Management was friendly and understanding. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job was unloading drop trucks with heavy packages 75 lbs or more. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing the job on time.
good,"A typical day was proficiently and accurately enter information from the COD slips."
good,Arrive at work get trailer order and make sure correct packages are in the correct trailers before loading them
good,During my time at UPS i was an unloader for 53ft semi trucks. The job was basically take packages off the truck and place them onto a belt to get sorted out by zip code. During the duration of the 4 hour shifts you would get rated on your flow rate which is how many packages you unload per hour. Packages ranged on the trailer from 1 to 150 pounds which you would have to unload at a constant rate of 1500 packages per hour. You had very little interaction with other co workers unless our section fell behind in trailers. Over all its a good job but i was looking for a job with management opportunities and better hours
good,"Its like your getting paid to workout. Your constantly lifting light to heavy packages at a face pace. Lifting for 3 straight hours, with a 10 minute break, and back to work. "
good,A typical day would consist of being insulted and rushed. You would hear people cursing at you and demanding you to hurry up. It's a great job if you're looking for part time with minuscule benefits. Overall I dreaded showing up though.
good,"Union and management attitudes, disrespect from both ends."
good,Arrivé le matin à 4 heures.Mise en route du tapis roulant.Arrivé du camion à décharger et déchargement de celui-ci avec scanne des colis puis dans la foulé rangement de paquets dans le camions UPS. Fin de la journée à 9 heures.
good,If you are looking for a workout then this is the job for you. You learn how to be organized in a reasonable pace. The manager works with you in ease. The hardest time of the day would be the overtime gap if u work evening shift like i did due to the commute but everyone has commute problems now and then.
good,"It was like when ever you have a problem, it was like nobody was there for you. It also felt like this job was very High stressed. Their seemed to be a lot of work that had to be done at a certain amount of time, and there was a lot of times it couldn't be done."
good,21 year old kids with no experience instructing 40 year olds how to work
good,wasnt a enjoyable work experience.
good,A typical day at Ups was to look at all outstanding balances on your trial balance broken up by letter ranges. I had three letter ranges therefore time to contact your highest dollar outstanding over thirty days.
good,This place is very hard to work for. The company is more woried about production then its employee's. The nice part of the job is that they pay well and when your out on the road all day its nice.s
good,My typical work day is never typical and can constantly change depending on staffing and volume. I've learned how to adapt and overcome many obstacles including adding a route or taken one away with an ever changing environment with drivers and package shifting. Keeping calm and allowing myself to think through the plan and implement the best decision is extremely important to our operation. This is what and why I believe keeps me successful at my current position. The hardest part or most difficult part of the job is reaching the next level of management as it pertains to corporate in deciding when positions will be open for availability and need to be filled. The most enjoyable part of my job is my employees and how hard they work for me.
good,"You will work your butt off in this job. Some helpers were lazy but I was non stop with my driver. We would work 10 hours without a lunch break. By choice of course. We wanted to get our work done and go home. The pay seems nice at first (10.50) but after you have done what I did you wont see it that way after a couple weeks. You will work in all weather, no matter how cold or wet and the trucks are not very warm so always check the weather before going out. Hours are very unstable. One day I might work 11 hours or more, the next only 5. Keep in mind, you can work slower to drag out the day, but its just more time you're eating up. I wanted to get my work done so I worked as fast as possible. What could have taken other drivers and helpers 10, we could get done in 8. I suggest you work hard and fast that way your boss can at least give you a good recommendation on your next job and can't talk bad about you."
good,i went to work ready to work.The job was fun and exciting.I learn alot with the company
good,Fast paced intense work environment. Worked hard for not that great of pay. Long hours and employees were lazy
good,"Hier wordt zeer veel beloofd, alleen ze komen hun afspraken niet na!"
good,"Fast paced environment, heavy work load.Customers are great.Pay could be better."
good,"You pick a package up, then you put it down. I learned that it is a wonder anything makes it out of there without being damaged. Stressful work environment which I witnessed to lead to altercations."
good,Not a bad job field and had great benefits. Advancement was not hard to get and work paced was very fast which made the day go by a lot faster.
good,moving at the speed of business which is just short of light speed.
good,"A typical day involves physical activity, paperwork, and managing people."
good,"Starting the day unloading trailers that early arrived and some that were held over from the previous day. Then I end up loading trailers as full as I can. I've learned how to manage my own tasks and to make weight requirements safely. As tools of this trade, we all work together by helping when needed or slow and bringing new ideas into everyday work. The hardest part of this job is getting used to repeating the same tasks everyday. Interacting with my co-workers has to be the better part of each day. Running ideas through each other to make the job go by easier makes the day a lot better."
good,"I was the shift Supervisor , I handled all the inventory, stocking shelves as needed, packaged all kinds of thing you wouldn't beleive, it was a fun experience those. I enjoyed working there, that's why I stayed there for 4 years. I was actually ask to move from one location from NorthEast Minneapolis to the City Center in Downtown Minneapolis to help the new ower get his store up and running and that's when he decided to promote me as as Shift Supervisor. Witch I enjoyed a lot. It gave me the responsibilities that I need for my other position. I don't think I wouldn't of gotten as far as I have with Supervisor/Management experience under my belt if I had got offered that position. It was a lot. Doing inventory, purchasing, scheduling shifts, opening and closing the business on a daily basis, I work 6 days a week 3 weeks out of the month, because we had a lot of College student that needed weekends off to study so the owner and I switched off but I got stuck with the extra weekend witch I was totally fine with."
good,UPS is a stable company. Many employees have long term careers. Advancement options are limited.
good,"Need better pay, managers, and society. Co workers are lazy and managers or supervisors let them get away with lots of things. Most enjoyable i have a job, day to day go in know what to do to get the job done."
good,"Ups is a stable and innovative company. The drive for results has led to a daily combative environment. Management against management, management against employees, employees against employees. Excessive work hours and high stress marks this industry leader."
good,A typical day began with setting up and cleaning your work area from previous agents using your desk and taking UPS related calls . Management staff monitored the floor daily when not in meeting etc. My coworker were all engaged in they call flow and trying to achieve high quality goal monitored by QA. The hardest part of the job was a schedule that rotated weekly and a 30 minute lunch and having supervisors that stress do to high quality goals that were not always obtainable. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in sales and as a coach which provided me the opportunity to utilize my selling skills which provided revenue for UPS.
good,"My typical work day consist of helping customers with their quotes or processing packages, handing mail via usps."
good,loading packages on to the truck
good,distribute boxes to the proper crate
good,"You stand in a truck and build wall after wall out of boxes. Not too bad, really. But trucks are always dusty and dirty (and the dust has nowhere to go but up your nose), the managers are often more suited to loading packages than actually managing people. The best part of the job is the reliability and the benefits. It's a long day and hard work, but you should expect that coming in."
good,"Interior/exterior cleaning of motor vehicles. 2pm-10p, A very busy day."
good,Great co-workers..most had team attitudes. Thrown into management positions.. learned as you went. I managed a good set of employees. Easy to work with. Biggest lesson I take away from this company is that the employees are that ... employees.
good,"This is a wonderful company to build relationships, learn, and grow if you're motivated. Management teams vary from each department, but overall very focused on putting best foot and employees forward."
good,"Ups is the 3rd largest employer in the world. Every employees day is measured to the 100/th of an hour. Their tracking technology is cutting edge, and their attention to quality is superb."
good,Efficiently sort a minimum of 1000 packages of up to 70 pounds to 22 different conveyor belts per hour based on their zip codes or country of destination. Management couldn't care less about your advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is hoping you can make it to be a driver.
good,It's an ok job for someone just trying to make a little extra money
good,Teamster union. Great benefits to have.. The labor was intense.
good,"They would call me every morning,to tell me the same thing,what place to meet driver,and then said I would work 3 or 4 hours a day It always turned out to be longer hours witch I didn't mind,It was them calling me every morning."
good,It started out as a decent job but quickly changed. I was working for a new account and it was understandable but things really didn't get better.
good,"it was good experience for me as a first time job seeker and work was hard, but it good for the body and mind. Really it's more for first timers and people looking for more money"
good,"Was hired in August 2011, in January of 2012 all accountants were told the accounting jobs were being moved to Dallas, TX. Good news was they were bringing in new jobs, however they were not accounting jobs."
good,"the job position taught me to be professional at all times. The store was in the city where customers were more needy and demanding. So, I was able to answer customers inquiries and help them with anything they needed while they might've allready entered the store frustrated. It taught me to have the right attitude."
good,"UPS is a great employer to work for, but the labor and the compensation conflict fell short of my expectations."
good,"Work at UPS Supply Chain Solution was a fast pace work environment   but the employees were a lot of fun to work with, however, safety was taken very seriously by the workers and management, whereby every month gift cards were awarded to employees for good safe work practice and for increased productivity,"
good,"It’s a tough position and culture, but the skillset that you gain and the time management skills that are obtained are unrivaled in any other industries."
good,There is not much fun to look for or do. Most of it is work-focused. Be sure to be ready to spend over 50h a week to work and to work on weekends too.
good,UPS isn’t the best job to have. I feel like i do too much at my job to be getting paid only $14/hr. and the bonus they say they will give you? that’ll go away within a month of working there so don’t count on it.
good,The pay is horrible the hours are horrible no support they do not value your friendship or your help I was working as hard as I can and I want to always continue to work as hard as I can to do what I have to do to benefit myself and my son
good,Hard work in an extremely fast paced environment. Definitely a young man's game. If you're in your late 30's early 40's like me you will struggle. Best bet is to get your CDL & at least a year of experience and try to get into Feeders.
good,good for entry level positions.their benefits are good but working there long term is beneficial. especially if you want to become a driver but the process takes 10 years
good,Een olietanker krijg je nog makkelijker van zijn plek dan iets proberen te bewerkstelligen in deze organisatie
good,"The workers were nice and social, the work was hard but doable, the customers weren't as rude as I would suspect; but there is a reason that the store that I worked at had 2.1 stars. The boss was very rude to workers and customers."
good,"Take the job for what it is worth, the culture at UPS has been the same for over 100 years. The company cannot operate without chaos. I would equate the company to functioning like the government, where no one really has a clue what to do. Promotions are based on who you know or who you screw. If it was not for the benefits, I would just find another viable alternative."
good,Everything is based off seniority so work ethic doesn't count for much past a certain point. Every department is connected and dependent on each other but because managers are chosen based on seniority and not skill there is a lot of tension between the competent and incompetent. The pay is good and the benefits are great. Just remember it is just a job and don't focus on the drama.
good,"There is a clear ceiling for those who do not have a ""sponsor"" I know of others who checks all the boxes but for whatever reason or the reason that they don't have a superior pushing for them they get stagnant in their career"
good,"Clock in and get slammed with packages from start to finish, when sorting workers sometimes can't even grab a drink of water due to the on coming flow"
good,"The job is straight forward, down side is the schedule and hours as a preloader, life change due to hours you work, no job security, fast paced work.."
good,"Cant Trust Management. Lack of knowledge at the managerial Level. "
good,"A billion dollar company that doesn’t value their employees ...well at least for our location ...no holiday parties, no appreciation of hard work, no sympathy, no understanding of personal life. Just show up to work"
good,Great pay and benefits if you can survive the very demanding daily grind of 10.5 hours work days . Manager will constantly harass you if you are not performing up to standards which are ridiculous like making 18 deliveries per hour which includes bulk stops and four story apartments without elevators .
good,"Promised a certain rate per hour but received much lower pay. Do not trust what they advertise!"
good,Workforce competition has created shortage of quality and talented employees with responsible work ethic.  Cost reduction have significantly effect management compensation and benefits.
good,It is nice working at UPS. Salary structure needs to be in an appropriate way. Floor maintenance can be better. Management need to look at the market situation and need to make changes as per market.
good,"This job isn't for everyone and the main thing is, that when its peak you can get as many hours as you want. when its the off season the hours vary from time to time depending on the demands of the need. Great company to work for, you just have to get past some of the people that are not real people persons and the job is all they have."
good,well a typical day at work would be me showing up on time and getting my scanner and setting up my area and getting right to work doing anything my supervisor ask's of me
good,Great job great for anybody looking for steady employment right away there is lots of opportunity to move up in the company and you can go to school through ups and they will pay for it but it is backbreaking labor
good,Working at ups is challenging not only sometimes you are cold when it's peak season thing's can get dangerous. The overtime is beautiful also. Ups provides you with benefits very helpful company.
good,the worst best paying job there is. great benefits and wages. Managment seems to never know what is going on or at least they are unwilling to tell you.
good,Poor management and scheduling problems sitting around waiting for a call losing money Christmas around the corner this year these guys are not doing very well as far as scheduling as far as being able to contact someone
good,You will be worked like a mule for very little pay. Even with lifting properly be careful not to hurt yourself because the amount of packages during the holidays are overwhelming. Your 10-15 minute break will be spent catching up before the conveyor belts start again.
good,There are several ways you can go with your employment. You just have to be persistent with getting there with Hope's that your manager wont stop your growth in another department
good,Seasonal work was extremely fast paced and I enjoyed the people I worked with. Managers were cool and offered assistance when I needed it and were flexible since I was a student.
good,The benefits of working at ups are great but the management is horrible as well as the work enviroment................................................
good,"The supervisors are outgoing and helpful and at times.  The UPS atmosphere is a tough job and at times, and motivation kicks in and then progress develops.  Overall, it's a tough job that makes you sweat and more productive."
good,"I worked the package handler job for a week and then I was told I was not needed the next week. I had problems with some shift supervisors. Some, not all, but some shift supervisors are abusive and mistreat employees. I spoke up about it to the hiring manager, when it happened the first time. One of the supervisors got upset with me, wondering why I would tell on another supervisor. That supervisor asked me for my personal cell number and promised he would tell me when they needed me. This was close to peak season for the holidays. I received no text or call after that. I was lied to about getting more work. I had a terrible experience. Some employees were actually nice. They gave me advice. One of them even gave me working gloves and water. The hiring manager over hires. He promised great things would happen if you worked hard and stayed with the company. I spoke up when I was being mistreated by one supervisor and I never got a call back. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Long hours & depending on location some may work even longer. Based on years of service determines length of time off, however due to the long daily hours of over 12 hours a day the time off isn't as attractive."
good,.il est important de donner la chance au employer qui vienne d'arriver
good,Good jod just hard to deal with hour's due to a new single family parent with two kids. That just went threw a device and received kids in the process.
good,"Good:"
good,"Always busy."
good,I only was there for a short tenure. It was mainly part time work. The pay was horrible and traveling with mass transit sucked. I went to work if they called me to come in.
good,an easy job once you're body becomes accustomed to the type of work you're doing then its just a little boring and management or the lack there of is horribly.
good,"I love my position, however, the upper management preaches be safe but when it really comes down to it it only matters when they want it to.  People who do not know how to do your job trying to tell you how to do it make if very difficult for you to do your job correctly.  Or if they don't really have your back they throw you to the wolves every chance they get, it makes it very difficult to stay loyal or have respect for that person."
good,"beaucoup de travail, coupure de poste, beaucoup de démission et tres peu de nouveau employer"
good,Great company that is holding itself back. Upper management needs to learn to be flexible and enrich their people. There are more ways to save money and run an efficient operation than running a lean (staffing) as possible. No work life balance. Limited ability for promotion even with a degree.  Hard work is rewarded with more work.
good,"As someone who worked for UPS for 12 years, I can say its a great company, there are a lot of good, hard working people, your co-workers become like family, as you probably see them more than you see your family at home. I was able to see nearly every aspect of the operation in my time at UPS. When I first started I was young and hungry for money. I worked my way up the ladder quick with lots of dedication and hard work. The last couple years weren't too great though; the hours became more than I could handle and balance with my personal life. The job was unable to grow with me and I became burned out. I decided to leave to find something that has a little better balance and understanding of taking time off for doctor's visits, family functions, etc...Keep in mind after the first few years of working for Brown, I ceased to participate in any sort of holiday functions with my family/extended family. This is a positive for some people, as it was for me when I was a young; but as family became more important later in life, it really became a burden. Great job for a young person to get their foot in the door with very little to no education after high school and make some very good money. Beware how much of your life you give this company, as they will always ask for a little more every time. Real talk. I do not regret any of my time spent at UPS, I met some great people, and had a ton of fun in the process, just know well before you decide to pursue a career with UPS that it is a VERY demanding job, and you will earn every cent you make."
good,"There are some great people you work with, but you have to be in the right circle to get promoted. The jobs are fairly easy but its hard to get the tools you need to get the job done."
good,"Needs more Care for customer packages, & employee's health & saftey"
good,"If you wanna make alot of money go for it, if you have a family and need family time this isnt the place to work. Benefits are amazing but you almost never know when you will be off."
good,"very labor intensive"
good,My days at UPS are very long and there is little to no work life balance. I am on call 24/7 and I an always responding to work. The culture is also bad because the engineers are getting blamed for things that are beyond our control.
good,UPS has potential to be a great company but there’s a lot of old school habits that need to change. Great benefits though. Work long hours and not the best work life balance.
good,I would come in and get everything set up and make sure its ready go i will make sure my employees are good and ready too go i will keep track on the packages they load per hour i will make sure their scanning the right packages if not bring it all the way out of the trailer i will make sure their working safe. I will also make sure they stay hydrated and i. Will update trailers create seals for trailers make sure the trailers are up to date and start wraping up before and after work
good,"Needs lots of improvement, no team work , no room for growth , 2-5 yrs for management, needs to be more organized, more training needed , more management"
good,Not the best place to be if you want to climb the ladder. Few positions come open and they will only promote if they like you. It is a great place to start but don’t get comfortable.
good,I loved my manager so I enjoyed my experience for the most part. Kind of boring most days but it was nice if you need to get homework finished. Not great pay but better than nothing!
good,"Ups or (under paid slaves) as all package handlers would call each other jokingly, is a good company with beneficial longterm assistance but the integrity of the business was always conflicting "
good,Not all it's hacked up to be Union is a joke. Would consider elsewhere to work at before this place. Things get very repetitive along with the management structure that sucks. Doesn't even respect the union contract it's in and the union does NOTHING about it.
good,"UPS is a good company to work for, their benefits are average. Eyecare is poor. UPS is large and is now very corporate. They do 3rd party logistics but they are losing several large clients over the past year or two."
good,This is not a bad company but probly one of the worst unions to work under and management on both sides is no good. Would have stuck it out if it wasn't like working with 13 year old kids.
good,"UPS is a great company but ever location operates differently. In Commerce City, CO, there is a very contentious culture and everyone is trying to save their job or cover their selves."
good,"not a bad place to work if you wanna be part of union and don't mind a physical, fast paced work environment. Management is not consistent at all so if you can look past the poor management then its a solid gig."
good,No comments conceptually is good but practically is corrupted at least this  HUB. Management  only cares about supervisors and you only see the benefits after 9 months working there
good,Its very fast paced we didnt take any breaks but it was my choice upside I lost 20 lbs in a month first few days were rough but I got used to it dont know if I would do it again but never say never
good,The job was challenging but stressful at the same time somewhat long especially during the holidays granted you get to meet a lot of people but like I said before it was very challenging
good,"During my time at UPS, I would say it was a good part-time job to have in order to gain experience for my career. However, my stay here was short due to the hours not fitting my college schedule"
good,"The environment is very stressful and competitive, everything is about politics when you are looking to move up the latter. Either one must be best friends with their manager or network and be known to move up. There are a lot of backhanded decisions going on. And just because you know that a position is available it might not be open to you because they promote from with in. You have to be okay with this type of environment if you want to make a career at UPS, and make the system work in your favor."
good,"Like most warehouse jobs, the pre-loader position at UPS will push you to your limit.  You are expected to work at a constant pace, having to get multiple packages from the conveyor belt into the truck in only a few seconds.  They are also a seniority first work environment.  If they don't have many packages coming in they will send they new employees home in favor of senior employees even if you only have a few minutes officially punched.  I've had a work week where I had less than 5 hours in 7 days."
good,Management from my experience tends to allow personal relationships to intervene with the direction of projects. There have been clear examples of leadership delegated to unqualified personnel based solely on acquaintanceship.  The most enjoyable part of the job is there are in fact some really good employees that do work for the company and due to personal collaboration efforts it is possible to learn a great deal.
good,The pay and benefits are hard to beat. Hours are long. The job is hard on your body. The customers make the job worth it. The management stinks. Spying on employees is a regular past time.
good,"While I was working there everyone, no matter the location, wanted to be lazy and barely lift anything and send things down belts they wernt ment to. I was moved around more than need to be, and the managers always acted like I was a hinderence when I asked for help"
good,"We took a lot of pride in working in our department, I had fun working with my co-workers. Truly Some Managers were okay, but most of the Management likes to yell, and scream st you to go faster......all the time. After seeing a person work, you would think that they would know how fast someone works. Some of the truck systems are automated, and some of them are still the old style systems, if your lucky you can work in an area with the new equipment. If you get shifted to another area, people automatically think you got injured at your position."
good,I learned a lot from working there. Some of your coworker will just watch you struggle with some of the work load as they play on their phone. Some will ask you  would like some help and help you when you need it.
good,"hard work, stressful , wear and tear, have to have a strong mind. you can make good money if you work hard. i dont have much more to say about this company"
good,Every day was a typical day of loading packages into a trailer in a the best way you can. I was assigned my on locations of trainers to load in with very little help. work area was very stressful.
good,UPS provides opportunities to learn a lot about the company and how to interact with a variety of different people. UPS has been a valuable experience overall to learn and grow while going to school.
good,It is tough to get a promotion at UPS and takes time to put yourself in a position to be promoted as management shows favoritism to people they like and hang out with outside of work however the growth possiblity is there
good,"Clock in, get assigned a trailer to work, work it till its full or emtpy. Get assigned another trailer. 5pm-9pm M-F. Learned safety procedures for lifting. Hardest part is the heavy items. Most enjoyable is the workout."
good,"If  your single and don't have a family. Come make some money. Definitely not a 9-5 job. Start times vary with the volume. And you are done when the route is done, well unless your neighbor needs help. You never truly know when you will be getting off. Could have an idea of what time and then BAM! They tell you to go find another diver. Impossible to plan homelife during the week. Your spouse will have to be strong and willing to sacrifice hours of not knowing how long you will be working.  Want to be there for your kids games during the week? Forget it.  There is a constant battle between employees and management. Management is no more than puppets of greedy corporate bullies. not all their fault though. Depends on the situation. Basically they are given a strategic recipe for success,  but with only half of the ingredients. You know because ups cant afford any more Haha. Overall it's not a bad job. Great pay/benefits. What job is out there that you have the opportunity to make 6 figures without a degree? It's hard at times. During November and December your friends and family wont even know you exist.  But if you can take all of that without a pat on the back the join brotherhood."
good,Long hours with stress related. Never know the time you will be home. Good job for young single person. Good benefits and pay. Not the best management.
good,The coworkers are energetic and fun. Management isn't too bad but it gets worse as you go higher up. They expect a lot from you in a short amount of time with very little pay.
good,"Originally when i started it was okay. Everyone had their stations i worked for nestle, but honestly the office was just too much competiton, too much gossip, who does this and that ... Not my style. I like to avoid that."
good,It’s cool if you’re a driver or in management. But all others are worked like slaves. Low hours little money. Contact workers are paid better . Package handler is cool for students they have excellent benefits and overnight shifts
good,"Great company,very hard work..Only part time but will leave you exhaausted at the end...No heat or AC so  must be ready for that.....Its a night job also"
good,"I learned a lot during my time at the ups store. I had amazing customers at my location, some I am still friends with. I wish nothing but the best of luck to the owners of the location."
good,"When all is said and done, UPS is not an easy or very forgiving job. It is however, a good place to go for their benefits. "
good,Overall good company but low at salary. Depends on process but nice. Many things to learn specially time management. For fresher growth opportunities are more.
good,A quick-paced environment that gives everyone the same opportunity to get promoted. Also everyone works as a team to get the job done and to meet the required quota.
good,It is hard work for little pay and poor hours. It takes a full year to get on to their excellent benefits package. Not worth it unless you plan on working there for 10 years.
good,Management plays favoritism and race card. They don't care about your personal life. Overworked and not treated fairly. If you don't do things like they want you will not get promoted. Managers don't appreciate the hard work supervisors do.
good,"This company truly does promote within and there are opportunities for advancement. The company culture is work-first, everything else second. Would not suggest for parents."
good,unorganized lack of employees and rive to even do the work properly very physically demanding depending on job location that day no space for personal items
good,It would have been a good job if they paid me for all of the time I worked but they didn’t they also were trying to over work me when other people were not doing there job correctly
good,"Lots of favoritism in advancement provesses, but it is possible. Culture has changed alot and makes it difficult to want to go to work every day. Pay is well for most positions starting part time and up"
good,Fast Paced work environment. Part time position's really don't get enough hours to stay long-term. It's a very time oriented position. Great team concept among peers.
good,"I had light interaction with most people. My job was routine and kept me busy. The workplace was basically quiet during the late night hours, but I enjoyed what I did."
good,The day goes by quick and you feel like you have gotten a lot done. The managers are all nice and friendly but everyone at ups knows work needs to be done. Everyone moves at a very fast paced and at first it’s pretty overwhelming
good,From from start to finish I remember being asked by management to do more than one thing which I cant stand. I like to finish one job before I start another thats just the kind of worker I am. I'd remember my manager was constantly no where to be found when I needed assistance.
good,They expect too much from their employees as far as the pay its too physically demanding for what they're giving. The health benefits are good but basically all they're doing is covering the damage they're causing to your body.
good,"I was in a different environment working at UPS SCS, the management team it seem not been coordinating with other management departments to get production onetime. hourly rate is too low."
good,A typical day at UPS starts with everyone yelling because one of the chutes are jammed. I have learned to work with my coworkers and supervisors. The hardest part of my job is working in the building because there is no air conditioning or heat so you are either dripping in sweat or getting pretty close to frost bite. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 10 minute lunch break.
good,"Hard work , lots of silly rules , great work mates , great place to work but management can be back stabbers, good pay and pension and lots of overtime, good job but always watch your back...."
good,"the workplace culture was very relaxed and management was not very serious, however, when higher management would come to visit we oftentimes had to be more professional which was a weird feeling."
good,"I was in college just looking for a job to do for the season, but I didn't really learn much or gain anything from helping the driver deliver mail. It was fun while it lasted but I wouldn't recommend anyone to do it."
good,I was a seasonal driver helper. I had to text the manager daily to see if I had to work because there was no schedule. They always complained about misloads when weren’t any. They tried to send everyone home instead of trying to give people hours. They also didn’t tell you when the season was up and lied about hiring anyone for full time.
good,The management and lack of communication are one of the biggest headaches. You bust your tail doing all of their manual labor and you don't not receive a fair pay. Your personal business spreads like wildfire. Employees are seen as slaves and not human beings.
good,If ever there was a company that could take an employee from loving their job to loathing it in less than 6 months it would be UPS. I would never work for UPS again.
good,"Basically the company is a good place to work, however I was unhappy with the supervisor I had. I feel that I was unfairly cheated out of my job due to favoritism and the fact that I'm a woman."
good,"Working at UPS is a very fasted paced job. It's not easy to do the jobs inside the warehouse.  I learned how to dell with stress at work and not show that I am stressed.  The hardest part of the job is, loading the trucks and taking the packages of the belt."
good,"The job is not production but the management team treats it as such. The threaten you daily about your job, if you don't rush rush rush. We get paid by the but they act like we get paid by the package. One supervisor told me I drive to slow, however; I did drive the speed or up to 10-15 miles over. I walk to slow, run or pick up the pace. Walk at a brisk pace, don't run is what the 5 keys state. Management is going to be the death of the company. Not all management personal are like that but the majority are."
good,"Typical day at work. "
good,"Great opportunity for current students, but that’s about it.I was this order at UPS, and it was very hard work. A lot of it is heavy lifting in the hours are inconsistent since you never know when the trucks will finally be unloaded. I will say the benefits for school made up for it, the metropolitan program pays for your classes so long as you’re employed at UPS. It’s worth it for the school, but the pay is very lackluster"
good,"job isn't half bad if your above a certain package scan rate but if your below it can and would be troublesome. And ""peak"" season is a nightmare 10-12 hr shifts. Which usually starts at 1-2 am or 11-12 pm and usually ends at 7-9 am, just a mess and like i said before if your not above a certain package scan rate peak season would be he nail in the coffin."
good,"The typical day as a Manager is 10-12 hours and you will never be caught up with the massive workload thrown at you. Time management and the ability to prioritize is key to maintaining your sanity and frustrations on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the ""do more with less"" stance that the company has adopted and trying to still achieve the results the company demands. The best part of the job is the people you work with, they are going through the same thing as you and you band together to ""get it done""."
good,"Other than the management treating us like inmates & horrible working conditions it was an ok place to work & after,at least,10 years you could make enough to live a decent life"
good,"Make sure you arrive on time and on time being EARLY"
good,"I liked UPS when I had a cooperative team to work with."
good,"Hard work and guaranteed hours after April, peak season (November to December) is very busy, very hectic and physically demanding but provides more then 40 hours plus choice of Sunday's during this time. Management unorganized and doesn't communicate with different departments management. Be told to do one task, then get yelled at for slowing production when trying to do task. NEVER TAKE INITIATIVE, only do tasks assigned by superior or be yelled at. Start time changes daily."
good,"Took the 100 dollar bonus away after peak and lowered hours. You work roughly around 13 hours a week, and start off at 10.45. This should be a job you look for as a second job."
good,"Very fast paced environment"
good,"I enjoyed working at UPS and enjoyed those I worked with.  I believe they helped tremendously with advancing me in my career.  Though I believe they need an actual training method, a regiment of sorts."
good,"I was a seasonal employee and I witnessed one of the bosses at he League City bully an employee and publicly humiliate them. Besides that, the day to day work was extremely busy for an hour and then we had nothing to do for an hour"
good,"There is no room for advancement all stores are independently owned and therefore you are stuck as an associate, was an easy job but it felt tedious because at the end of the day you knew it was going nowhere."
good,"Unloading trucks.  Heavy physical demand with large irregular shaped heavy objects. Hot in summer, cold in winter. Part time job with no opportunity to increase hours.  Pay and benefits were fairly good, but hours were part time only."
good,Physically demanding hard on the body job. Great pay and benefits   I love meeting the customers but the hours could be much better and more consistent. Management can be good and bad to work with depends on how many people called in that day.
good,"A typical day at work would be average just like with any other job; there are good and bad days."
good,UPS was a well paying job and benefits were very good. Pressure was extreme every   day. (Time sensitive). Our center manager was pretty mean. Didn't care about are well being. People got hurt frequently. I had to leave UPS because of my sons illness.
good,"Managers don't work with you to develop you if you're not their favorite. I had one manager that was great. He used to check in on me and develop my skills, and my history of the company, he would read the legacy book with me and ask me what I thought about certain sections and trained me on what it meant. Now that he's gone it's been all down hill. I ask managers and supervisors for guidance and I just get blown off. I tend to try and prepare myself day by day as best as I can but when something doesn't get done I get disciplined, when I mentioned mistakes happened because I haven't been trained it's my fault still. I know what the ultimate goal's are because I've been here for years, however when it comes to goals in my function I'm left in the wayside. oh and by the way I was told recently if issues happen I have to tell my family sorry but daddy has to go to work. even though I'm not even an on call employee. the management team figures since I'm closer to the building my home life can wait, even though these types of issues is what they actually get paid for."
good,"good benefits, good job to acquire  plenty of forklift experience, the job can be difficult as you are always on call an not aware of whether you are going to work until 2 hours before the shift, they don't ever tell you if you are not going to work, only when you are needed so at times you wait for a call and don't get notified if you are not scheduled"
good,"I hire in P/T thinking once I show them I am a good employee, that I would get a full time job...not the case someone has to quit to move to a full time position, so in three years I haven't had any vacation time...They work you full time, but you are considered PT"
good,"Loading two trailers per day with merchandise such as tires, electronics, jewelry, shoes and clothes. A belt will bring the boxes inside the trailer and all I had to do was to fill up the trailers until there is not enough space and we will use the other trailer which is empty."
good,you get paid well for seasonal but the work hours are terrible. there always hiring for seasonal jobs so thats a positive. negative is there not very organized/
good,"Stressful, keep expecting more and more from a part time person.  Do not relay as to how you are to fit int all in in a pt shift.   As usual...expect more with same amount of time to do it all in.  I have one 2 page list with 65 items on it to complete each night, then a second sheet where there are 20-23 trucks to check, as well as other reports and paperwork not on any lists."
good,"Although paid well, this job is very physically demanding. Requiring you to lift and lower boxes ranging anywhere from 1-100 lbs at a constant pace throughout your shift. Shifts for this position usually only lasted around five hours with a ten minute break around mid-way through the shift. Only allowing you to catch your breath, chug some water, and get right back into the work. This position leaves no time for sitting around doing nothing. So if you are looking for a job that will keep you busy and work up a good sweat while doing so, this is the one for you."
good,The hardest part of the job in my opinion is how quickly new employees are just thrown into the high paced environment. The job was very physical to the point that I would have almost no energy for the rest of my day
good,"Fast paced-low seasonal pay, would have been much better if I was a full time employee with benefits. I liked the driver that I was placed with for the holiday season"
good,"Will break your back. The work is hard and non-stop. If you stay for a number of years seniority kicks in and an individual can bid for better jobs. The pay, benefits and pension are outstanding. This job is a serious grind though- don't expect to go home happy."
good,"it was fast paced, hard work. You get to meet a lot of people.With only a few exceptions people are glad to see the UPS guy.Steep driveways are awful and hard to read addresses"
good,"UPS is an okay quick job to grasp. They offer great benefits but not until you've worked there for a year or more. You have to be pretty fit and be able to lift various amount of weight. The managers there are also all overworked which makes them want to push their workers even harder, past even the limit of the individual that day, there isn't very much time for rest. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I did it seasonally; I was with the UPS truck driver and my duties were to help in delivering packages to businesses and homes."
good,I would not recommend this work environment for anyone who is not ready to commit 100% of the task. Compensation is fair per hour would not per day overtime is paid daily after 4 hours.
good,Full-time positions under management are almost always asked to travel for work as far as I can see and observe and its very hard on ones family life.
good,"The probationary period was to long, i wasn't making enough money to cover my weekly fuel costs. And i wasn't receiving any benefits because i was on probationary period."
good,"UPS is ok to work for, there are a lot of questionable hirings and promotions as of late, and a lot of negative changes to people retiring's benefits."
good,Great colleagues but not enough salary. Company was helpful and understandable.  Security was very tight and clean management were great. Hardest part of the job was lifting very heavy items but had some great colleagues on hand to help. The most enjoyable part of the work was having such a great team to get all the jobs done on time.
good,Less than ideal training to prepare for work. Very busy atmosphere. High levels of stress among employees. The time that is needed to recover from and prepare for each shift cannot be ignored.
good,"Low wages, around the clock hours, terrible management are the reasons few people stay. If you are a truck driver it is a good place to work. If you are clerical it is not good."
good,Ups was a good job at the time....good benefits if anything and the pay isnt so bad itself I would definitely tell anyone to apply...the best route is to apply to be a driver
good,I enjoy it but most likely would not want to make a career out of it! The hours are a bit overkill sometimes but the pay has been worth it to this point.
good,Very tough environment. The union atmosphere makes it hourlys verses management. Production is never good enough. The company doesnt really care about its management employees. They are expected to drop anything and everything to do what they want. Call you at 8am Aland tell you they are sending you someplace at noon hundreds of miles away
good,It all depends on what hub you work at none are the exact same so try working at 2-3 at your own risk some may like it others may not all I know is that the old saying the third times the charm but today I got fired.
good,great opportunity. great salary. i was a cover driver for the holidays. the supervisors didnt seem to have it together. it was never a smooth morning. some days i got sent home because they didnt have a route for me
good,"Retail store, one stop shop for any customer who needs a print job, fax, scanning service, graphic design work, packaging and shipping services. Its definitely a hands on job working with customers to understand their specific needs coming into the store."
good,"UPS is one of the most recognized and biggest companies in the world. Employees bear the cost of this growth and recognition in a ever higher demanding culture.  High-stress, high-demand, high-pressure position with unrealistic goals making commissions unreachable. Company favors promotions within, resulting in mediocre leadership."
good,poor manager and do not good to communciate for deaf and heard of hearing. also short break time and get back to work. it was great team help each other is good but manager nope...
good,"Great co-workers, Low chances for advancement. Management is good. Hardest part of the job is  in customer service field. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you work out in the field and not in a office"
good,The work is great. Employees are amazing but the management could be updated. The style of management is a conflict with the job and the atmosphere of the work place.
good,It takes 4 years to get to full pay .You get benefits after you get in the union general 45 days .The pay and benefits are Great . Stress levels are very high for city drivers not so much for road.  Upper  management  truly needs to agree to work with the union to develop work rules that both sides can use . It would really make for a much better working environment
good,"UPS had one of the worst work environments I've been in, management was poor but it stemmed from their bosses. They don't pay you enough to work their for those long hours and they need more employees on the dock."
good,"Low pay, good benefits, 2 weeks paid vacation after one year, supervisors are generally easy to get along with, good tuition reimbursement, Opportunities for advancement because they promote within."
good,"The UPS Store is not bad place to work. Working with customers in shipping, packaging, and renting out mailbox services are what a typical day at work is like."
good,If you're looking for a job that introduces you to the fast paced corporate world then this is a good starting point for you. You will learn skills to help with later jobs you'll have in life but unless you want to own or manage your own store there is a roof you'll hit a year into this job.
good,UPS offers great benefits and ample vacation and sick days. However your body is going to pay a heavy price. They will work you into the ground and treat you like garbage.
good,"Overall, I had an ok experience. I thought training could have been better, and manegement was ok. Had to leave because of school.  Supervisors changed constantly which made it hard to know them. Another problem was I never knew when I was going to go home during the shift as there was no set end time which made it hard to have a decent sleep schedule."
good,I didn’t like the style of work and training provided . Very fast paced and unsafe you make one wrong decision and you could be hit in the head unloading the boxes
good,"Employees worked well together, much camaraderie amongst the drivers, recruitment effort for seasonal workers needs to start sooner than October, increase the referral bonus."
good,"UPS is unmatched when it comes to college and insurance benefits. 100% paid tuition and a plethora of bonuses for attending college. However, the work load and unreasonable mood swings of management leave employees with a rebellious and defeated feeling every night. The employees have a general attitude of entitlement and very rarely do good work unless being baby sat  by their supervisors."
good,Seniority runs the company. The longer you been there the more you get away with. Management bow down to staff when they should be the ones running the shift.
good,"Pay sucks,benefits are great. Supervisors/management are trash. Advancement is based seniority, low hours, the coworkers are good......................"
good,"On call during the week, then go to meet the driver that I was helping and go to the particular area to make deliveries. Some days were slow, in the beginning, but it increased a lot near mid December. The hours dropped off after the New Year. Be prepared for various weather conditions. It was pretty cold and snowy. Some of the driver's were very nice, and a couple were kinda crazy. Hardest part: Going in and out of the truck many times a day and the cold weather. Best part: Some of the driver's and meeting some nice people/customers!"
good,they demand a lot of you especially when working in the morning when loading the trucks. you need to make sure that you load the trucks properly for the drivers.
good,Working at UPS was a lot of hard work and physical labor. It was a nice job to have if you were going to college and still lived at home. You could only work three hours a day which I didn't mind but I wish I could have worked more hours because the pay wasn't suffice for the amount of work I put in. UPS is a good first job to have because it teaches you the value of a dollar.
good,"I was a belt tender, basically, remove packages that do not belong on the belt that could wreak the machine that sorts the packages, like nuts and bolts, a paper slips or a chair leg sticking out of the box. Not much interaction with others since I work about everybody. Management trains well and does check-ups, some not so much. Be good at hearing the radio for orders despite the ear-piercing sounds of gears and belts, (I suggest earplugs, just to hear the radio but not the rest of the building.) The most enjoyable part of the job is to sit down or go to the restroom on the only ""small"" break."
good,It was a great job but some thing were okay. The hours were okay at times. There were some things I had questions about. Mist of the things said were lies or what people think.I loved running the area ans seeing the results. My full-time was great and showed me a lot. Seems like to get a promotion you had to know someone higher up.
good,"You can get a workout, a tan, and a paycheck. I wouldn’t recommend applying for the tarmac if you have asthma because of the airplanes. Most of the workers are friendly here."
good,"Very stressful at times to meet deadlines "
good,Too much favoritism allowed.  Too see relatives of managers hired and to be promoted to full time within 6 months of service after you have worked and proven your abilities for many years was very disappointing.  Management was poor and sometimes without much knowledge.   If you weren't apart of the click or wasn't related to someone it was becoming difficult to advance.  After 21 years of service I realized I should have went after other career opportunities with other companies.
good,Busy and unorganized department and overall management. Need to make a new way of personal communication with employees. No stabilization or security.
good,"The job itself isn't terrible once you get it down. But note, you will be extremely hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. There is such and emphasis on speed, breaks are often not taken. "
good,It was a very stressful environment they always push you which is goof for some people but in the summer time temperatures were well over 100 degrees in the truck and unloading with just a a fan blowing hot air on you was tough work.
good,"Delegating tasks to those employees best-equipped to handle them. Proper delegation streamlines a project, ensuring efficiency and maximizing profitability."
good,"Winter is a stressful time due to Christmas and New years. Otherwise, every job role is relatively nice. My job was a seasonal Part time deal, however, the hours were still long enough to make it worth the time."
good,Turnover rate of employees is high. compensation is contractual so the hard workers get paid same as slackers with no recourse. Union in my area was more concerned with getting re-elected to positions than helping members
good,My overall experience at ups was not the best but I didn’t mind the work. It was very straight forward what your task were but the trick is being able to uphold the constant manual labor for a long period of time. it’s very energy depleading but the pay makes up for it.
good,"Benefits / pay are at best on par with other companies, I expected them to be better. Everything at UPS is treated like a crisis. The quality of your work is the last consideration when it comes to promotions/ transfers."
good,UPS only cares about UPS and their numbers... they will reward you if you don’t mind being a rat and snitch on your fellow co workers and no loyalty.. management only cares about numbers and their numbers for their group and center and want you to not report injuries and when you get hurt and HAZMAT whole another subject
good,"I worked with them for a while, it is a productive company, with many opportunities to grow, but the culture needs a lot of help. Its a constant war with the Union and Management. Instead of working together, they work against each other. With that said, this facility will always have on going issues on relative matters."
good,Its a good job to start with and while you're going to college but I was told repeatedly that they wanted to promote me to be a trainer and then to a supervisor but after a year of hearing that it never happened and there was a lot of miscommunication. Eventually left because of that and I needed a full-time position that paid more.
good,"I think the title of this review says it all. If you're money hungry, single (no partner, no kids), and like to work a ton of hours and have body aches, this is the job for you. If that is not you or even close to you, keep looking elsewhere."
good,"If you would like to drive the brown delivery trucks or the big rigs, then this is the place for you to work. You'll make up to, or over, 100k a year, but you will be forced to work 60+ hour weeks. Another man will raise your kids and bed your wife."
good,"The working conditions were terrible, management was awful. The culture is nice though, there is a lot of activities throughout the week. food trucks during peak season etc. never got a break though."
good,Fast pace during holiday seasons and in certain city areas. Learn many different shipping options. Customer service is the main focus. Depending on management you can work your way up the ladder.
good,Drivers helper is real fun and fast pace . Lots of exercise and the Drivers are usually friendly . Great seasonal work and hours but it is only for 3 months. Packaging is fun with many hours durring the same months
good,"The pay is not great and you are only offered part time, about 20 hours. It is difficult to advance and you are required to work holidays and weekends. The work is very physically demanding and stressful."
good,"the short 5hr days were the best part."
good,You work constantly until you can't anymore. It's at least 5 hours of consistent manual labor. They don't really give you a chance to take a break. Everything is on a time schedule and they want you working for literally as long as you possibly can. Honestly it was worth the money when my bonus was giving me 15$ an hour. But then myself and a lot of my coworkers weren't getting our bonuses which didn't make it worth it anymore. The bonus was based on showing up on time and every day you were scheduled. Which we all did and they just kept coming up with excuses as to why we were not receiving it. This went on for about 3 weeks before I finally quit.
good,"De nombreuses délocalisations de postes. Manque de transparence dans le process de promotions en interne. Pas de remplacement lorsque des employés quittent la société, ce qui limite les opportunités de développement."
good,mooi bedrijf maar je bent wel een nummer in het geheel.
good,"Basically, all you do is load packages. Some heavy, some not. You typically work for less than 5 hours a day with one 10 minute break. It's not the worst but it is not hard to find a better place to work."
good,"Worked during the Holidays. Some days there was a heavy load. The jobs was cool and I wish it was a year round position. I don't agree with their holiday policy though, just leaving packages outside isn't cool."
good,"UPS was has provided me with great benefits from health care to education assistance to a well paying job that helps me provide a better life for my family. However, it is now time to move on. What good is providing a better life for my family if I never get to see them. When you regret getting up every morning for work and then can wait to leave once you get there then it is definitely time to leave. The management style is toxic and threatening rather than motivating and encouraging. Every one at UPS seeks to be understood rather than to understand."
good,"There is certainly a lot to learn working here. However in terms of career advancement and schedules they need to restructure some things. I worked here for years and still cannot get a full time position. Part time positions are very limited hours, not enough to sustain a life. The full time positions are ridiculously difficult to obtain, and when you do get one it seems that you work 14 hours a day. There is no middle ground."
good,"Best part was the benefits. Work was rushed, management was poorly chosen. Building was almost always in chaos. Most likely just the building I was in."
good,Unprofessional management. Work was fast paced and pay was fair. Co workers were friendly but management staff for morning preload was ridiculous. She had no respect for the older workers there and was unprofessional in her job by flirting and hanging on the male employees. Very inappropriate! When I informed the higher management of what was going on they seemed to not be bothered by her actions.
good,"Typical day at work starts with clocking in and doing your assigned task. You have to check the emails for resumes, print jobs, and mailbox applications. Beginning  of the week is usually the busiest. Holiday season the lines are out the door and work never ends. I've learned patients. I've also learned to work with a printer, copier, and fax machine. I'm a licensed notary public. Everyones pretty laid back and chill as long as everyone does their job. Hardest part of the job is getting micro managed and everyone playing fair. Also doing field print finger printing. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and the down time."
good,The job was fine until they had us working in heat most of the shift and the shift was at night. They only let us go on break when it was slow and management was okay but not very good
good,"I enjoy working at UPS. However, the work is hard, the hours are brutal and management (upper) can give you a headache. I would recommend a friend only if they have a good work ethic."
good,Had to fight to be fairly compensated and looked at for my work. Job description as service provider comes as second nature. Its the professionalism that is sub par at the branch I was apart of .
good,the job is job like anywhere else. its old traditions make it trash just like most older companies. the net 4 billion dollars last year by taking away great benefits from the employees and managers. if you try to work over time they nearly take your money but still want the work done but other than that if you get a cool manager like myself you could enjoy it a little i guess.
good,A good company with good benefits with a face pace environment. Management need to improve. I believe that there is some room for advancement but limited.
good,"Long hours, union environment, must be customer oriented & flexible.  no advancement for salary people.  Have to deal with multiple personalities and time sensitive issues"
good,Forced to work four to about six straight hours with little to no rest. A lot of heavy lifting and a very fast paced job. Slight chance of minor to even major injuries if not careful. Having to come in to work as early as four o’clock (sometimes earlier) in the morning loading trucks.
good,"Would prefer to not work here in the future, the relationship between the union and UPS is not ideal. Strong company though. There will always be work at UPS."
good,Environment most times get very busy and fun to work but not interesting when the flow of work from the lines are slow because staff may be ask to round up.
good,"Worked on a timed schedule, very fast paced, delivering at locations that were new to me, working with pleasant coworkers, the hardest part was learning the new locations."
good,"•	Managed daily branch functions in a 250 car branch with concentration in the 4 core areas of business "
good,I enjoyed the work and my supervisor but the pay was very poor.  Was no opportunity for advancement.  The annual raise was 25 cents and was paid less then 13 dollars an hour.
good,I enjoyed working here. Working from the ground trying to make my way up I could tell that this company ran its business with integrity and respect. The management treated you with respect and all they wanted was respect for the job and people.
good,If you don't mind working 50 to 75 hours a week then this place may be for you.  Management strives for more after you give it all you can.  Just because the pay is decent doesn't mean that people want to work that many hours
good,"Working at UPS isn't particularly a dreadful job but is a physically demanding job. As hard as the job is, I'd be more inclined to stay if I were able to get more hours. The hours we get arent enough to cover basic costs of living and bills. My direct supervisors are understanding and respectful and the work environment stresses safety. The best part about the job is my shift of 10am-5pm, but the worst; as i stated before, is the lack of hours."
good,"Pay was excellent.Everybody you worked with where all very good people,including management.Walked about 10 to 15 miles a day.You never know when you will get home.Package car drivers have the hardest job in the whole entire company."
good,"Not a bad place to work, at Great hours, was a lot of learning involves it that was difficult. Hardest part of the job to sending things every overseas because if you mess up the customer pay for it your very and get angry or they mess up and blame you"
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting with top executives of 'start-up' companies and being a part of their growth and success; I was able to learn the ins and outs of starting your own business.
good,"This was not a job i wanted to work long term. It was fast paced, hired help seemed to be from any walk of life. I was made feel as though I didn't belong there by other workers. I worked hard, did what was assigned to do and would help in other areas that would back up"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of working practically alone, not much communication was required. No set hours, work was based on the daily work available. I learned a new set of skills and a new work environment to learn from. The most enjoyable part of my job was the self management we where given as freedom, not constantly having someone over our shoulders."
good,i don't wanna say anything. i worked there long time ago. There is no advancement in work. Please do not work there. Poor management. Only Part time positions.
good,"everyone always says it’s great to work at UPS but that’s only if you’re a driver. if you’re a package handler or part time supervisor you get treated so badly and not paid nearly enough for the conditions and amount of work you have to do. once you’re in the union your job is protected but if you’re non-union it’s not worth it at all. wages are way too low. insurance is okay but not the best either. for the amount of money UPS brings in, they do not care about the warehouse employees at all"
good,"I left UPS because I realized that it wasn't for me. I may have been built for loading trucks in hot days but I wasn't mentally for it like I thought I was. Back then they were paying package handlers 10.20 an hour now its 15 an hour. Back then I they would tell me to load the back of the truck for five hours straight every day, and I was energetic about it at first but over time it gotten really tiresome for me and realized it didn't want to come home really sweaty every night but that's just me. The management for the most part were great they made sure to check on you every now and then,"
good,"the very laborious job, very time detail oriented. everything you need to learn for the job is taught on-site in paid training. management is strict so get in there and do your job."
good,I don’t advised nobody to work here this job sucks they don’t treat all workers the same it’s like we’re slaves don’t get paid enough. Having to work these hours and get treated poorly.
good,"I am a 32 year package driver  it's a fast paced work environment! My pay and benefits are the best in the industry. A seasoned driver with 4 years of service can make $36.21 an hour  my  wage compensation  for 2017 was $106,758.00. It's a great place to work and help people with their deliveries. The downside is the lack of supervision that has no clue how to do their job!"
good,"Working at UPS for me, was a job that tested your work ethic everytime you were supposed to work. This company gave good part time benefits and other resources after a year of working"
good,"A good solid company which has very high expectations from all areas of the business. Very challenging at times, due to the hours and work load but rewarding at the same time, extremely good pay with many benefits. Overall a good company who I would recommend working for."
good,Only a parttime job(less than 5 hours a day) no benefits Only good for student but had to work somewhere to make ends meat. no benefits but you can join Local Union
good,"The place of employment is a UPS store not UPS, these are franchise owned.  Each store is ran and owned by a different individual.  I love the customers I deal with for the most part and my staff is fantastic."
good,The original culture of partnership was very rewarding but has changed in negative ways over the last 10 years.  Good benefits and pay but the pay doesn’t match the responsibility or expectations.
good,"Morning meeting, Vehicle safety checks, regular daily route, mandatory overtime especially during holidays. Promised full time employment but company did not follow-through once busy season ended."
good,very very very stressful you make nothing but go hard for hours with boxes coming from everywhere it be hot nobody helps and i thibk its just unbeliavable man
good,Can be stressful and tedious at times I gues it has its benefits once you move up in the ranks but until then be prepared to take a whole of nonsense could be better organized
good,"Once you start working here, you might think like oh okay the pay and hours is good. But in the long run you start to think like, man this Lil 10.20 isn’t worth it. I really think that is not enough because the things you are doing there isn’t worth the pay. You can get up to 20 hours maybe more if you at work each and everyday, but they try to get you off th clock extra fast. They don’t be trying to give you the hours and they barely even wanna pay you."
good,High expectations and long hours. I worked during the holiday season approximately 55-60 hours a week as expected. Seasonal employees make about 1/2 as much as regular drivers.
good,"UPS Supply Chain Solutions is the logistics arm of UPS Inc.  As such the management is bound by the restrictions of the UPS delivery arm of the company, which is unionized.  Communications with corporate are robotic, with messages being dictated from carefully crafted scripts from corporate."
good,management is not good at times and treat part timers like bottom of the barrel employees. but treat full timers like royalty. although you are part of a union though.
good,"Its a good hardworking job.the place is a little dirty,people are nice. But they do cjeat lots of people out of bonuses,especially those who have been there a while."
good,Assisting ups driver along his designated route during the holiday season. This is done in an efficient and safe manor. This involves pushing hand carts and walking packages to destination.
good,"I worked at UPS for all 4 years in college, I proticipated in the Metro College program. I received a B.S. in Marketing. I was in the Customer Service department, they refused to help me advance within the company. I have nothing nice to say about the program. You would think if you worked their for all 4 years when earning you degree, they would want you to advance within the company but I guess not. Good luck finding applicants when you won't even promote within."
good,I was an unloader my position required lots of lifting you should be physically fit to do the job or you will have a tough time completing the task at hand.
good,This was a very physically and mentally demanding job not for the faint of heart. I myself had many days where I was physically distraught by the end of my shift.
good,The job is not bad if you don't mind hard physical labor.  The paces rises and falls.  Some days are slow and some are hectic fast.  Usually its in between.
good,I wanted to get more hours but my driver didn't need that much help. I think it depends on the driver that you get. I worked out of a depot that was out of my assigned area and I don't think it was worth the extra drive.
good,Typical day: Prepare for operations. Run inbound operations. Wrap up operations and provide reports-end of day. 
good,"A typical day way very high energy and very busy , very busy time of season and lots of packages to deliver , very competitive and days goes by very fast"
good,They have you come in just to send you home but may work you on your days off. Then they expect you to keep coming everyday even though your only taking home 50-100 dollars
good,"Fast-paced, and demanding were what was expected from each employee and being able to read and sort all UPS mail from a drop box and label city to city. I soon learned how to lead on a line and became a floor supervisor leading the whole floor covering the afternoon operation for the evening."
good,"a typical day at ups is dealing with the packages and placing them on the line, i make the best of it!  I learned how the packages get to each zip code. The hardest sometimes is the one break you get all day which is lunch!"
good,"UPS offers a Metropolitan College(MC) benefit to students who work for a part-time, third-shift job in the Next Day Air Operation. The MC benefit is great because it pays 100% of tuition, includes book reimbursement and bonuses. "
good,"Great benefits after a year. Room for growth for employees but be ready for hard work and constantly change conditions. Everyday is different, some hard, some easy but you have to be ready for the unexpected."
good,It was the best experience to see how hardworking to be able to go on and of the truck every minute or two minutes. I love a challenging job and this was the most challenging job I had so far and I love every bit of to be able to see residents get they packages they been waiting for and now they happy . Is the best part of the job to me.
good,"It's impossible to advance in this company especially if you work in management. You can't even easily transfer to become a driver, they basically force you to be stuck in one position till you quit."
good,"As a pre-loader, you get a great work out. the job can be very stressful and demanding. You are constantly being watched for mistakes, how fast you can be and whether you are going to make it work the next day."
good,"Work days were long.  Worked from 8:00 - 8:00, 5 days per week.  Physically demanding.  Unappreciated by Management.  Best part of job is interacting and providing great customer service."
good,"The work at UPS is not bad. A typical day consists of a very early start (during holiday season, between 9pm and 1 am) moving boxes, setting up and tearing down rollers, lifting a lowering heavy boxes (sometimes upwards of 70lbs), scanning boxes, loading trucks. Essentially, I felt I was required to do all the jobs in the warehouse regardless of my training on those particular jobs. DO NOT be a holiday worker at UPS unless you absolutely need cash. You will regularly work 12-14 hours shifts and be back at work within 10-12 hours. As a temporary worker you get as little benefits as possible (which is still a lot, but none of the good stuff that the regular workers do). It is a physical job so you may get into better shape but your sleep cycles will be all messed up and you'll always be tired. Being a regular worker at UPS would not be too bad but Seasonal positions are terrible."
good,It was pretty good. I started on 12/ 05/16 and worked  Monday through Friday up until 12/ 27/16 even though they had me on the books up until 01/06/17. The driver for UPS eventually picked me up at my house after one week instead of meeting him at a designated location and some times paid for my lunch which were one hour long(not bad) and we would finished up work about 7-8 pm at night.
good,UPS is a great first time job but I would not recommend it to someone that wants a job that is going to pay for hard work. It pays very little for extremely labor intensive work.
good,"i enjoyed the competitive part of the job and that it was fast paced but "
good,You start off the day with rode call. Then you find your truck and try to organize it as much as you can before u start your day. The management is as good as it can be i guess. They really make or break the day for you. With this Job you have to have patience because it can get crazy trying to deliver about 300+ packages and some by a certain time. The pay is good but all u can be is a delivery driver. No room to grow.
good,"I  loved my job working at a UPS Store. The only issue was bad communication from Corporate on some issues and the store owner for Camp Pendleton is a horrible, horrible person. I am pretty flexible and can stick through poor management, but this owner was on another level. He constantly created issues with customers then threw them on us and we had to deal with them being upset. His customer service skills are HORRENDOUS. He would also cry if confronted about anything. Overall a very unstable person. If the store has a good owner, it is a wonderful job. If not - good luck. There are also no benefits offered."
good,The work and certain managers were difficult but for the health benefits it would be worth it. Also it’s pretty hard to get fired unless you just never show up or call the supervisor.
good,"Super conservative company. Not progressive because they do not have to be. Preach diversity and inclusion but you can tell by their actions its lip service. Facial hair rule is ridiculous(males have to have clean face instead of neatly trimmed).  This company ask for more and gives less every year. Most millennials are only looking to gain experience here then leave for a company more progressive in culture."
good,"Wouldn't choose to work here unless I really needed the money. Benefits are okay but payment is horrible. The environment is not great. Extremely dirty, stuffy and depressing. The fellow employees are sometimes cool."
good,Hardest place I’ve ever worked by far. They are slave drivers. They use you up and spit you out.  Don’t work there if you are not in good shape you won’t make it . However the benefits are amazing! 4 hours of work for fulll Time coverage!!!
good,"Fast paced work. Could pay better, management is a little scattered, the bonus compensation was very unclear and seemed lewss clear as o implementing the policy"
good,"Way too ""stab you in the back"" mentality going on there.  Lot of judgmental people. They promote most of the workers from within the company.  So loaders become drivers.  I got hired after one interview and I think that made some people upset."
good,"Was only driver helper, it was quick hard work, that lasted a month, needed more pay though, Driver was good, trucks were good, went from 1100 to 2200 every night"
good,"My position as a seasonal driver helper was pretty unorganized. In order to do this job you cannot have any other daytime job, because you get called during different hrs of the the day from monday-friday. what they dont tell you is that they only want you to work a total of 2-3 hrs a day for $10 a hr. so if you show up 5 days straight without a call out your recieve a sucky $75 bonus. Not the best seasonal job."
good,Working more than 12 hours a day. Two shift at a time. From 3:00 in the morning to 8:00 or 8:30 in the evening. To get in the next day at the 3:00 in the morning again. Six days a week.
good,Pleased with my driver and communication on behalf of management. Pay was okay for the amount of work asked. Maintaining safety was always number one. And pay is weekly.
good,"Working at the UPS Store is a great part time job. If you're trying to advance your career in a UPS store it is not beneficial. Being an Assistant manager at this high volume fast pace store has its pro's and cons. The pay isn't as great when you factor in all we do at this store. What separates us from the other stores is: we offer fingerprinting, Notary services, fax services, key copying, mailbox services, Packing services. Now a lot of Ups stores don't have the fingerprinting or Notary Services. That's a big part of our day including taking care of customers who want to ship packages. The hardest part about this job is getting away to eat lunch. It's not possible when you constantly have a line of people and are short staffed."
good,Being s Seasonal job i knew that it wasn't going to last long. i was hoping to keep the job at the ups store but the store was not productive enough. it was fun thought.
good,"i really enjoyed my time at UPS, and i recommend it to any one whos willing to work there, the people ther where nice and friendly very often.not alot of training so if you dont learn properly you wil have a hard time."
good,Not paying correctly. Cutting two to three hours a week from paycheck. Just an unscrupulous thing to do. Obviously not in it for the pay but will never forget that negative aspect of the job.
good,"basically I get paid less then a McDonalds worker but I work around a multi million dollar aircraft. I enjoy the job I even enjoy the crazy hours but its not for everyone, I do feel they are paying about $5-$7 less then they should be"
good,U.P.S had a lot of benefits to offer and they also assisted you in your education. Whenever you needed any assistance there was always an employee willing to help you and ensure that the job got done safely. They also offered overtime diluting peak seasons.
good,A very fast paced job. Supervised many employees on the over night shift.  Outside work in any weather so always be prepared for anything and act quickly.
good,Advancement is very hard in the Aiken Location. Many opportunities are not open and with supervisors doing interview for developing roles. Many times positions are already set in place
good,It was fast paced work with everyone looking out for one another when it came to jammed belts and falling boxes. the tension was high amongst the supervisors which was transferred to the employees causing some mistakes and lack of focus.
good,"-Help customers by fulfilling all of their packing and shipping needs"
good,Its ok i just dont like the work and the pay you'll get at the end of the week we work hard in trailers and a 10 min break whicih is not enough and you almost overworked
good,"I worked at the UPS Store not the UPS Company "
good,Un des pires emploi que j'ai eu. faire 130stop dans une journée vous permettra non seulement de finir votre journée a 9h le soir mais aussi de ne pas pouvoir prendre de pause pour manger ou relaxer sinon vous finirai votre journée a10h. vous ete sur appel en commencent et vous ete traiter comme un numero.
good,Constant judgement horrible pay for whatyou deal with.really bad hours.and the management was un greatful and love to harase everyone. But you did get a rise very year
good,"Unwritten expectations of 12+ hour days - good if you are hourly, not so if salaried. High stress. Work-life balance is not there. Good for young, single straight from college for entry level management, but you may burn out fast."
good,UPS Freight is a very boring place to work. Very much feels like a high school.  There is a very high turnover and advancement is almost entirely based on where your friends are.  Management wastes money on overseeing their office workers while ignoring the fact that all operation systems are fatally flawed.
good,Friendly helpful team work ally hard work to make it easy job manager helpful when needed like working there had other issues had to leave death in the family
good,Şu anki işim  ile aldigim  ücret orantılı değil bu yüzden başka bir iş arıyorum uzun süre çalışabileceğim bir iş olması benim için onemli
good,"As a previous  employee of UPS who did not experience the best of times when it came to management, I cannot fault the nuts and bolts of what truly makes UPS what it is, and that's the customers, the Services Prividers and the office and admin staff at each depot, throughout the globe."
good,"In general, UPS is an alright place to work. The only real drawback is the fact that I usually get around 20 hours a week. and as someone trying to move out of their parent's house, this just simply isn't enough. "
good,"The culture of UPS is always ""management vs employees"".  Due to the fact that the union employess can not be fired (or that it is quite diffucult to do so, unless you do not show up to work).  They are perpetually demeaning employees until many burst with anger or frustation.  Plus, the pay is not very good, in particular to the part time employees.  However, the benefits are quite good and the union always has your back."
good,"A typical day consists of me waiting to see if they need me to do anything for the day. If someone calls out or if they are short handed, then they may use me. Otherwise, I get sent home 2 to 3 times a week. I've still yet to find something enjoyable about this job."
good,UPS is not a safe job to work at. You have people throwing packages and weights into the trailers or out the trailers and people get hit with them. You get a 10 minute break but bot time you sit down its 5min left literally .
good,the driver were jerks and needed people to worship them. career advancement was projected slow. friendly management and good communication to employees.
good,"Long unnecessary hours"
good,"This isn't a very desirable job. Especially at management level. starting wages are terrible and the work culture is negative. Saying that, this is one of the few part time jobs that provide a decent benefits package after 90 working days. once you reach top rate you can make ok money. They take on more than they can handle as a company."
good,"Hard, fast paced manual labor. The work was non stop from the time you punched in, until you punched out (Other than your 10 minute lunch). You will break a sweat. It absolutely helps to be in good physical condition."
good,ups is cool i learn alot i learn hot to handler large amount of packages also learn how to keep a job for long time my most enjoy time at ups was weeknds no work
good,Very good job just not enough hours great hourly pay rate great insurance good  environment with great people that are hard workers and management could use a hand or two.
good,you should work your full hours most days you don't some days you don't work at all they treat part time workers as if they are expendable.works not bad hardest part of the job is building up the speed to work at the pace they expect you too
good,I've worked there for 12 years and i felt live there was no advancements for me so i decided to leave. also it was part time and i wanted a full time position.
good,"If you want to try and become a driver or get a management  position at UPS then this is one way in otherwise for the amount of work you have to do this job is not worth it.  You will work a maximum of 20 hours a week. Anything over 5 hours is considered overtime and if you work OT they will send you home the next day. Also they change the shift times. When I started it was 4AM then it changed to 2:30AM. Also, they give you one 10 minute break and you don't receive any benefits until one year of service."
good,"fast paced, hard working environment with overtime opportunities, very cold in the winter and exhausting in the summer, expect to sweat whether hot or cold."
good,I monitored truck loading to ensure product was handled with care. I also inspected trucks for quality control and to make sure packages were going to the right destination. I also helped load trucks when needed.
good,"The UPS Store should not be confused with UPS Shipping. It is an independently run franchise. As with any franchise, turnover is usually high and management changes every few years. The experience can be wonderful, and the most difficult customers are those who confuse the Franchise with the Shipping Company. Work centers around printing and shipping (with the balance different for each store), and you will often find yourself in high-stress environments with tight deadlines. Time management is the hardest part of this job, and it is often difficult to meet the time requirements set by the customers. However, successfully completing the work on time and on quality is very rewarding."
good,Gave me a lot of skills that lead to my future successes at another company but was very demanding.  Long hours and zero work life balance.  Burns a lot of people out early in their career.
good,"a day at UPS is like being in Jail, loud noise coming from all over,sum people talking sum yelling, staying busy. management is fair BUT cant speak for all,Hard work but sum what fun. fun part about the UPS is Holidays."
good,Please go somewhere else. Expected to meet numbers when staff is always short. My management was great but their bosses expected the impossible out of them.
good,You could work part time and still get a decent check. It was a great place to work. I was a stay at home mom for a long time and need the extra money and the hours worked out so I didn't have to pay for daycare because my husband worked days. And I could work nights.
good,"Not a pleasant job, it is very hard to get use to such a rough schedule and then having to work around your regular life to do a job that no one would ever want to do."
good,"A typical day at work was extremely stressful. They wanted us to give a perfect work performance everyday. If you didn't give a perfect work performance everyday then your job was on the line everyday. Management wasn't that great. They were unprofessional, and picked favorites. The work culture is diverse. There are plenty of people from different backgrounds working there. This job taught me how to be a leader. It also taught me how to deal with people. It gave me many situations to learn how to be professional. The hardest part of my job was forcing people to work although they are tired and their backs hurt. The most enjoyable part of my job was receiving holidays off and working over nights."
good,They asked way to much out of certain people who were getting paid the same amount as people not doing any work all night. People never really rotate jobs making it so you are stuck doing the same hard work every night.
good,nice side job if your looking for a little supplemental income or in college. If your looking for full time it takes years which is not practical if your already settled with a family.
good,"Used to be a better place to work. As they continue to crunch the business, to attempt to return better for stock holders; front line managers are the ones that suffer. Relations with the union are strained because of this as well."
good,"Again and again unsafe and the managers don't care if you get hurt or not, they just want to make themselves look good. I got injured and they told me it was my fault for not working properly. Which was untrue because we were understaffed and remain to be, so I was just doing the job to my best ability and was injured for it and out of work with no compensation once so ever."
good,"coming at night shift position 2am-8am "
good,The overall experience was ok.They have plenty of hours to work because UPS is understaffed.I feel people that work there can hurt themselves because of the amount of packages and weight  carried in a short period of time.
good,"The first 3 years out of my 9 years there were great. I had a great supervisor and she made sure she showed her team appreciation. Kudos to Scarlet on pre load, she was the reason I tried to stay and  fight my way to the top!"
good,"I only worked there for three months, but the use of time did not allow me to stay there for a long time. There is also the lack of good management that I did not appreciate. Health and safety principles were not respected."
good,Unfortunately i was in a very small facility with no flow. working at the West Carrollton you have to be working at 110% efficiency the whole time. if i was in Columbus they would be willing to hire anyone who showed up every day cause they get bombarded with flow.
good,I've worked at two diffrent UPS locations and at both I've had rougly the same experience. It's a very fast paced and physical job that usually last anywhere from 3 to 5 hours a day. Best suited for college students or people just looking for a part-time job that provides excellent insurance.
good,"A typical day loading and unloading trucks/driving also.  Constant stress ups versus union employees..part time treated unfairly,no benefits have no guaranteed hours per week..seniority is a must..all about numbers"
good,"UPS started out as an amazing privately held company.It went down hill when it became public, This company does not understand work life balance. Th cut all perks in the last 5 years."
good,"A typical day at the UPS store, begins with assisting multiple customers as soon as you clock in. Dealing with warm and sometimes not so great customers. Packaging and wrapping whatever the customer needs shipped no matter how oddly shaped or size it may be, handling the shipping process to make sure their package gets shipped properly, doing multiple faxes, and taking numerous phone calls. "
good,Ups is an ok place to work if your looking for part time work and don't want many hours. The benifit you get after a year are really good but the work you do is very physical.q
good,"Big world wide, international company. Secure long term position, but unfortunately loads of administration problem which leads incorrect"
good,I do not work for ups. I work for a ups store.Things were business as usual and there isn't anything out of the ordinary I have to say about it. All store are individually owned.
good,"A typical work day as a operations supervisor at UPS consists of approximately 12 hours of stressful, fast-paced tasks that include many responsibilities. An operations supervisor must wear many hats during the day to manage all of the business needs. The culture of UPS is to meet all of the needs for our customers and shareholders. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with union employees and meeting the high standards set by upper management simultaneously. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build and, of course, your vacation time."
good,"Packing and organizing outgoing packages in confined spaces, management is understanding but demanding and employee well being is of the utmost importance."
good,"UPS was an awesome place to work when I first started. They cared about the employee, worked with you on schedules if you needed different hours, they didn't mind if you worked overtime and management was quite nice to us. Then in 2006 something changed and management started treating all of us horribly, then they had layoffs and after that UPS was not the same place anymore."
good,"A productive and fun work  environment. It's a fast pace job also. There's always room for advancement. The best thing that I like about this job is that I only work par time, so I can find another job to fit around UPS."
good,Bosses would belittle you and call you names if you didn't work as fast as they wanted you to. Everyone there was always yelling and cussing at you no matter what you did.
good,I worked as driver helper it was cold weather they were pretty good about looking out for you made sure you knew right from wrong made sure you was settled and prepared painless
good,"Not the bastion of fair work that it used to be.  A brutal and demanding job, that is also thankless and exhausting.  Benefits are still above and beyond the normal workplace, so for those with multiple doctor visits in their future, still the place to be at."
good,"It is what it is  Tough work all day  everyday, but none the less you can meet great people, and stay for the company,  Ever wanted to lift weights and get paid?  Here You Are"
good,"Typical work day was keeping your employees that worked under you in a rush mode all of the time. I learned that I would never be involved in another management position, unless it was my own company. Poor workplace culture and employee morale. The hardest part of the job was that there were different start times, according to the predicted amount of packages that would come into the center for that day. There really was not anything enjoyable about this job."
good,Really fast paced working environment but it has it's downfalls for example most workplaces give you lunch breaks of 25-30 minutes long UPS gives the whole place a 10 minute lunch break so they force you to eat all the food you have in 10 minutes which sucks.
good,On a typical day of working at UPS its very fast pasted or you have to be physically fit for working at UPS. You really don't learn nothing but to pay attention to the things you do while being very careful. Management at UPS is good. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with loading because there are a lot of boxes and things to sort through but also being physically fit to pick up very heavy boxes and load them into the truck by yourself.
good,"i haven't  worked there in a long time to give it a accurate review  "
good,You have the opportunity to know the logistics of a huge delivery company but you need to work many hours and have the flexibility to work at all the time in different locations.
good,This job was a great experience and being promoted a such an early age. Supervising  people that were my fathers age at 20 years old.Learning time management and attending all of the management class and training.This had to be the best job out there to train someone how to manage the rest of there career.
good,"Has good salary and benefits, but has bad work conditions. Management is very hard on workers and there's not much room for growth. Not the ideal long term employment."
good,"Tough job but rewarding, great benefits, management needs to work on communication. Tough working conditions, very hot in summer and very cold in winter"
good,Empresa gigante porém com poucas oportunidades de crescimento e benefícios abaixo do mercado.
good,"Great place to work through college, start career and work your way up to management. Limited locations for advancement but management is close and you will be apart of a winning team."
good,"Was an all around experience, lights of work load, very high volume. I enjoyed the job but it just wasnt a good fit for me. Im more into face to face customer interaction"
good,Working as a night sort loader (10 p.m.- 4 a.m.)isn't a tough job. Although the work is repetitive and simple it's the exhaustion and lack of sleep that make it difficult.
good,They have good benefits but the chance for advance and the hours worked made it hard to stay. You have to work two shifts for full time and to do anything you have to be there for over 5 years
good,Typical day at work great place to be. Work may not be for everyone but it's a very difficult place to work if your capable of lifting over 75 lbs it's for!
good,"Going into the company was a lot of politics at this one store, management had no control of the females working there so they talked there way out of closing the store.Always sat in the back instead of the front counter helping with the hordes of people. Management would take fridays- monday off most weekends and see this even taking photos from the security cameras and not acting on it because shortage of competent applicants. Management would remove you from the whole weeks schedule after asking what day you needed 2 weeks in advance, playing a vicious mind game to keep you attracted and reeled in. the store would have issues only they could handle. theres a lot of stress because of the employees that work didn't work and never closed did what they wanted longer breaks on busy hours wouldn't help and very confrontational if questioned. For 11$ an hour alone in a store flooding with inpatient customers with same pay employees helping. It almost resembles a boat load on a one persons shoulders solo with 4 people working there that are lazy rude and made it horrible to work with.This a job for someone out of high school. no room for advancement and or pay 11 dollars an hr is stressful enough. "
good,"overall good place of employment, for the short amount of time that I was employed here. But then again, although it is impressionable, one location doesn't speak for all locations of any given company or corporation..."
good,"You are there to work and that's it. No incentive, no fun, no happiness... Just work! You are always watched like a slave. and criticized for the smallest problem. All depends on your direct manager. Mines is terrible."
good,"It's an alright place to work while you're in school or trying to accomplish other things. I wouldn't recommend long term its not worth it. The culture is very one sided and not very diverse, also too much stress to deal with and not enough compensation"
good,On a typical day you will only work about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. The few hours that you work feels more like 12 hours.its fast paced and very stressful. All the equipment is outdated which makes the working conditions very harsh and unsafe. The work is jammed down your throat and your left to fend for your self. Its always understaffed which means that you are always overworked.
good,"I had a lot of hours which was good but no sick leave, hardly could take a few days off no paid time off and its a franchise so no health care only benefit was my pay check worked for 3 years and called out twice because of having to always be there"
good,Working at the UPS Hub was a very open minding experience I learned a out things and experience a lot things in the work shop. One hardest things working in UPS HUB is it safety hazard everywhere but you have watch a lot videos  and safety guidelines. But one most enjoyable learning how to sort the packages from belt and unjamming the belt when get stuck.
good,The UPS Store is a good starting job. It allows one to learn many diverse skills needed in plenty of jobs or careers. This job will boost confidence and social skills with a large range of customers.
good,"Ups may be for you if you are young with no family, no children and if you don't require a lot of free time. You can't beat the pay and benefits, however everything comes with a cost even if it's not monetary."
good,"Deliver freight to business and homes. Hardest part was some things were extremely heavy, no help to get those things off the truck,  Most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers.  Friendly"
good,"not a bad job if you like lifting boxes all day, and getting yelled at by managers all night. you will have no life working here because they require drivers to work 5 days a week every year 9am-9pm. If you don't mind this then this is the job for you"
good,A lot is required of you but there is not a lot of training or support from the corporate world. As an Operations Manager your day consists of logistics and then Safety and training.
good,"UPS is unionized for a reason; Management will treat you like garbage. If you show up ~5 minute late, that's potentially a write up. If you show up 15 minutes early to help, you'll be denied that 15 minutes because you technically don't start that early. They'll intentionally over work you, intentionally send misloads down so they can write you up. Most full-timers are pieces of ****. Do your best to befriend your part-time supervisor and you'll be alright."
good,It was a very difficult and dangerous job. Not very good water supply. Also very rude supervisor. Never really made over $150 a week for my back breaking job also.
good,Very good company to work for. Good benefits and nice pay.  Long hours and very intense work day.  Managers will work you as hard as they can.  Overall review is good.
good,"Hard Job! "
good,"Good workplace, the coworkers were all good to work with day in and day out, but hardest part about the job was the job itself. This kind of job is not for everyone a lot of physical labor."
good,"Fairly typical corporate environment.  IT area cramped and dark.  Certain managers are great.  Others micro-manage and quick to criticize, etc.  Can't really say I miss it."
good,"Preloading is great job for part-time work. Early mornings mean more time throughout the day, but peak seasons are hard with early start times. Very fast paced, a lot of accurate mind work involved with sorting and packing. Managers are great to work with, as long as they're happy with your work."
good,"Great job if started at a young age, difficult to build or advance with a late start. Must work for company minimum of 5 years to be a driver. Hierarchy is core tactic."
good,"Very strenuous work days, very little pay for the work that  is asked to be done y those who are employed.  Very hard to advance in th company unless you create a buddy system, you will not b acknowledged for your results"
good,"We worked hard to properly pack customers personal belonging so they would arrive to their destination in one piece. We also would fax, print, laminate, organize mail, scan items, ect."
good,"Well let me start don't go mangment unless you will finish  school it is a dog eat dog world if you are corporate, i don't like it  they blame on the next guy and not very enjoyable. but if you are a union employee it is GREAT"
good,"You load trucks for 10 bucks an hour, but you only work 4 hours a day, so you don't make much money at UPS. The reason to have this job is at least when i worked there, you got free insurance, and they would pay for some of your college."
good,Very fast paced. learned how to handle customers merchandise without having to damage them. management had their moments. catching two buses to work was a killer. enjoyed losing weight and getting paid.
good,Daily work was very physically demanding.  Union environment made the cultural separation between hourly and management.  Very difficult to want to come to work with so many demands.  Work seemed like we could never get caught up.
good,I manage about 4 different programs all day monitoring all delivery drivers and maintaining customer service. Communicate with management to make sure we all have a successful day.
good,Long hours but not enough pay for me to travel back & forward. I love in Gary Indiana and it's a little to far and to much wear and tear on my car. My car broke down now because of the miles back & forth 5 days a week.
good,"Experience with shipping and receiving packages domestically and internationally. Assist customers with faxing, copying, and all inquiries regarding UPS services. Manage and train all new associates."
good,The work that UPS needs to be done in the hubs that they have isn't easy. I enjoy the active working environment but the speed that was asked to work at wasn't safe on the back.
good,"lack of leadership and not really care for the employees, its a good job just the most workers and management is friends and do not want to see the good workers that are not there friends advance and move up the ladder"
good,decent part time job good benefits . management is ok just depending on what production belt your on. The employees are decent people.
good,When i arrive at work i first check what trucks i have to work on. Then we have a small group meeting and after that my day begins.The hardest part is trying to fit everything in the trucks and organized at a fast rate.
good,"Rough job, short breaks, supervisors suck, there union is a  corrupt system "
good,"Although safety is highly enforced, they don't pay nearly enough for the type of work that you do. Also they only offer part time work unless you can pick up shifts during the holiday busy season. Its a good job for a student possibly that only can work part time, however as an adult trying to pay bills, it was rough."
good,UPS is a great job if you need insurance. but people take advantage and think because it is a union job that they do not have to work. a lot of management are easy going but know when to be boss others are sometimes to boss like and intimidate you. a lot of micro-management. hardest part of the job is dealing with picking up other employees slack. you leave with a sore back most nights depending on your job title.
good,job was OK as a first job for young adults. Harsh winters and butaul summers being in a warehouse setting. Fast pace labor work to get in and get out while getting a small workout
good,"shift supervisors are rude and disrespectful, amount of work that was being given the pay does not add up to it. not enough hours and it could be a more work friendly environment."
good,"manager of 3 employees shipping and receiving shipments"
good,It was Hot and you start to throw up because big the heat and they dont really care and the people running the whole thing could be anybody
good,"I worked at ups seasonally so I thought this would be a good temporary job but it was alot worse than I could've ever imagined. The hours were pretty short and the condtions you had to work were abysmal. "
good,Its hard to say i really enjoyed working for UPS. They didnt work me enough hours and it was hard to get in touch with management. I cant say that for the overall company but the location that i worked for was not an easy place to work.
good,"Good place to work, fast pase environment it has its ups and downs but overall they are caring about your outside life and will help you achieve whatever goal"
good,"It's a learn as you go company. There is no official training, no manual, no mentorship. Often, it is only through error that something becomes known."
good,Fast pace work. work fast or get sent home but work safely or get hurt and get sent home. learned they will use you and get rid of you. management unorganized at times.
good,"It was a cool job while it lasted. You will get lots of exercise though. In my opinion, if you want to get in this company, you may have to go to a bigger UPS location like your major airport in your local county."
good,"A typical day would include assisting customers. Such as, shipping items, notary services, fingerprint services, and packaging orders. I was able to move up the ladder by becoming a Notary and Livescan Technician. I had an amazing manager who was helpful in every situation. Most enjoyable part was the customers and supportive manager,"
good,"The work is what you would expect, handling a wide variety of packages and shipping needs.  Specific store has no seats for customers or employees, take that as you will.  I made an effort to be nice to customers, and it was noticed."
good,"I was only a temp, however they were very nice and made me feel welcome.  I would have stayed if offered a position. The nicest thing about it was that I got to work with many different people a vendors on a daily basis."
good,"You get hurt their be ready for a fight for life. Safety is really bad, yes they teach bending but box's falling over 18ft high onto your head not much for being safe. I've worked there a long time but make no mistake i had many injuries as well. I loved the people just be carful."
good,"It was a experience, I had more fun working at UPS,  because I meet a new driver ever other day, the only thing I like about Banana Republic was I get to work females"
good,"The job is ok I like the atmosphere. You have to have the ability to multi task which fortunately I'm able to. The best part about the job is my co workers, they are nice and down to earth"
good,"Its standard for warehouse work, Hot when its hot and cold when its cold.  Always dirty and dusty.   Worked there while in college as they said they were friendly to college schedule and offered college money.  It helped me a lot but some management frowned upon making things easy for college schedules."
good,"working at Ups, you will learn self motivation, and how to be consistent. Ups is also a perfect place for promotions, as long as you stay consistent and work hard, and also show others that you can be leader."
good,the job is outside and doesn't have full time work so looking for something more stable and better benefits so I want and need full time work
good,You have to know the esta and Vista packet in the same order back to front you have to sleep and breath that packet or they will fire you as a supervisor. A lot if people smile in your face but talk about you behind your back.
good,"•	Load packages unto proper truck, coded by number in order from least number to highest, also must properly secure all packages with labels facing out.."
good,"Enjoyable position, not much training given and expected to learn everything on your own or through speech or pictures."
good,"its a good work enviroment and people are helpful there. some days you will have 140,000 and others only 40,000. You just have to be a hard worker."
good,its about what one would expect from a factory job. low pay unexpected overtime hard labor and injury prone situations. they did provide equipment for use to use to make our jobs eaiser and great benifits
good,This was a very physical job. If the person did not work as fast as was expected they were chastised and moved to different departments or fired. They discouraged employees who were injured to seek medical attention or to report injuries.
good,"I enjoyed it while I was young. I was in college, the benefits were great.  I just couldn't handle third shift and maintaining a school schedule.  Working outside in all conditions makes you crazy, and management was making some changes.  I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,Ok place to work. gets really hot and many non-english speaking coworkers. not much room for advancements. I have not been working here long enough to give too much more of a review. The drive to get to this company is too far for me but I guess the most enjoyable part of my day is that I have flexible hours and can make appointments during the week.
good,part time job only 4 hour work days due to the fact that the work involved is so strenuous.Lots of repetitive heavy lifting can be hard after a while.Constant micro managing. I was not being let out on time to make it to class.
good,The UPS Store has a friendly easy going environment. There are very friendly co-workers and the management really cares about  you. There is a lot to learn but it is not a hard job.
good,"During the four years I worked here, I learned a great deal of useful information. All of the experience with Microsoft Office Publisher, I learned from this location. I would say the most difficult part of this job was packing boxes. The most enjoyable part of this job was designing print projects. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers."
good,"the work was easy, mgmt kept breaking promises, and giving excuses. trucks looked new, didn't always like new. seats were very uncomfortable."
good,"Has great time working for one of the largest shipping bussines in the world,would not have left but needed more working ."
good,"It feels like an accomplishment to get through a shift, when you go back to work the next day, it's the same battle.  Never feels like you've accomplished anything."
good,"There truly is no typical day at work at UPS. Every single day is almost a completely different battle in the raging war to make customer service on time. Every day presents new challenges, new obstacles to over come, new problems that arise, new people to encounter, and new methods to practice or implement. It is a constant learning experience where individuals truly have to make million dollar decisions on a nightly basis, and these decisions are made by all UPS employees, not just the management team. Employees are given the training and skill set, plus are encouraged to by the management team, to make huge decisions that could greatly effect the company every single day. This type of environment makes it crucial for individuals to develop relationship building skills, learning powers of team work, and communicating and working together with other groups or areas to achieve a common goal. The nights are so fast paced that safety is always a concern that needs to be monitored and emphasized to the work group masses on a daily basis. One person will literally interact with, work with, and talk to dozens if not hundreds of other individuals on a nightly basis. The massive amount of communication and person to person interaction that goes on at UPS truly builds work place skills that can be priceless to individuals for future endeavors. I am truly thankful for the opportunity I was given because I learned so much valuable information and developed so many workplace communication skills that I know will benefit me the rest of my life. I went from struggling with public speaking"
good,Job not that bad just don't like the fact we have to call a hour before our shifts don't like the idea of not having a set schedule for the most part.
good,I work nights and do overtime in the evening. The hardest part of the jobs is the winter mornings. The best bit is that my colleagues and I work well as a team.
good,"The job itself is very straight forward, move the packages off the truck."
good,Not sure of the future of contract. Feel like a number.   Really feel like management does not know what they are doing. Poor 401k Plan and short and long term disability insurance is poor. Do make decent money. No full weekends with my family; family time is limited.
good,"While UPS has been a good source of extensive learning and advancement my technical skills, with an impending transition to overseas monitoring; I can't state that there is job stability and opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical work day would be.       Continuously inspected and maintained work area. Helping employees to maintain optimal product flow as needed  · Transporting goods between receiving, staging, storage and shipping areas"
good,"Not a healthy work environment to at all.  Horrible work / Life balance.  As a matter of fact, there is ""0"" Work / Life balance.  Great paycheck, but that is about it"
good,I would unload the trucks and sort packages to be distributed to the ups trucks for delivery. I learned to keep calm in very hectic situations and how to work as a team.
good,"The UPS Store is a great place to work in the start of your career. You learn many skills that can help you along in your career goals. Is it somewhere you want to work for the rest of your life? Not particularly, unless you wind up becoming a franchise owner. Every owner, manager and store is different. It's a great place to network and meet various types of people. The hardest part of the job is moving up. There is little room for advancement. Take what you can get in the time you need to get it."
good,"Long hours, very much what have you done lately, production based company that tracks absolutely everything. UPS worries more now about the numbers than it's people"
good,Did a local p&d route daily. Learned to make most of time by limiting time at each stop.Enjoyed co workers.Some seasons led to long daily hours and little home time.
good,"Do what you're told and you'll be fine. "
good,"Be prepared to embark on a career that expects you to be married to the institution. The managers and supervisors are ran into the ground. For hourly union employees life is pretty good. They are protected by the union contract, and wages are great!"
good,"Long gone are the days of UPS being a great place to work. Management is more concerned about profits and their Bonuses than they are with actually ensuring that the workers are taken care of. Cover your backsside is the name of the game. If anything goes wrong it is a race to see who else it can be blamed on, Deflect and protect your bonus."
good,The company had outstanding products that lead the industry and helped millions of people. If you were willing to travel there was room to grow. Most of the supervisors were hired outside of the company and not much room to grow if unwilling to travel. They had a high turnover rate of sales and service for different reasons. Great equipment but not a place to have a career at.
good,"A typical day was receiving a large amount of packages down this conveyor and were expected to check, scan, and effectively stack as to be secure in a trailer for transport."
good,"i learned to pick packages up with my knees and not my back. i learned that ups shipp over  million packages a day. an that across a united states well in mexico an Puerto  there is, 4,700 ups stores"
good,"very hard place to work at, the managers are very strict and lazy never help out and were never outside. for the supervisors mistakes we would have to correct them and for our hard work the supervisor and manager would get all the praise."
good,"Overworked, unappreciated and no time for home life. feels like an ""us vs Them"" when it comes to management.Good Luck. Can be enjoyable, but your asked to do to much. Union (at lest in my hub) is a joke"
good,"a typical day at work is you have to be dedicated and working at a quick pase to get all the packages done by a certain time . The hardest part of the job to me was using the handheld computer they give you to scan packages, it was only difficult because it was my first time using it and it was a little tricky but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy. the co-workers at my job were great especially my driver."
good,"old and dirty. desks were falling apart, drawers either didn't"
good,"Work days at UPS were long and hard. We only got a 10 minute brake, and were informed to stay in trucks out entire shift. And once my work was done I was informed to go help other workers who were not as experienced. Managers did not help very much and injuries were a weekly occurrence."
good,I assist supervisors and pre-loaders in loading package carts accurately and efficiently to service customers in a timely manner.
good,"For the time I was at UPS airport, I had good and bad times. Granted I was going to school in the morning, and getting off at UPS usually about 4 hours before my classes at UofL started, I was usually tired for school. At UPS, we would hustle for 4 hours straight carrying heavy mail bags back and forth from the fill up station to the link station non stop. Hard workers only gained more work for the same pay, where as slackers would get less work and not asked to ever help out others. Start times always differed from day to day, and vacation was pretty much non-existent. The only enjoyable part of the job was that they paid for school as long as you kept a 2.5 GPA. We weren't really able to talk with co-workers much, for being busy, so most of the people you got to talk to were strangers from other areas. The best part about that job was that I got at least 2 raises every year."
good,"Overall the work is good. They pay is good if you are an hourly employee. "
good,I could not see myself growing in the company. I had a different vision before joining to work and working there is much different.
good,Very nice experience working for management. Learned a lot about freight and bill of ladings. One of the easiest jobs I have ever had.
good,"emploie assez physique,"
good,"Its a repeating job not much in the way of advancement, but it is work management is a little iffy. The people you work with are the best part of the job."
good,"Little to no notice of work scheduling. Not willing to provide notice of next days work schedule. Otherwise, work environment was friendly."
good,"My position is to manage all business accounts in the Southern Maryland territory who's annual transportation budget is $40,000 a year and above."
good,It's a hot warehouse with everybody yelling and a fast pace job. You have to work at a really fast pace and the pay is good but the treatment of employees is bad.
good,"Loading and sorting freight was easy enough. I did enjoy staying busy, it made the time go by quicker. People were friendly enough and I enjoyed the warehouse atmosphere."
good,Tough business climate with fast paced commitments.Production goals are difficult to obtain due to zero slack in day to day changing business situations.
good,Big place you can get lost in the drama. One minute you are at the top and next your getting the evil eye from accross the room.
good,UPS is the worst and unethical place to work. The management talks about whoever and whatever to anybody. There no benefit to a growing ethical chain of command. Only thing really good there is the benefits. Its easy to get hurt and its very easy to mess up so bad it'll get you fired. There is no motivation to come to work and your not really using your brain as much to make production happen. Overall its just a really bad place to work.
good,"At UPS my typical day starts out by having operational meetings, after the meeting has been completed, I pick up my employees and begin to unload inbound aircraft and load outbound aircraft with very strict deadlines.  Any given day I deal with issues with HR, Payroll, and security.  "
good,"ganztaetig. Ich habe gelernt, mit unterschiedlichen Leuten umzugehen. Das schwierigste an diesem Job ist das Strassenverkehr"
good,"As an admin you spend most of the day standing around waiting for the package handlers to load cans so you can manifest the containers, if thats no happening and there are no hazmats to process you basically stand around and do nothing."
good,UPS is a company that you work hard for and are compensated well. It is a very competitive industry and a very demanding environment.
good,"If you were good at one thing, thats all they wanted you to do. I was there for 4 years and stayed in the same account the whole time i was there, because i was good at my job. bs if you ask me."
good,"The office has a Heavy Workload."
good,"its a fun and challenging department, yet needs to offer incentive educational offers for Publisher and 3D classes. Overall this job is interesting to the mind"
good,"Overworked."
good,"The culture of UPS is one of hardworking men and women who are constantly told to work harder. The management is often combative and unwilling to listen to employee issues. Due to the union, UPS has great benefits and good hourly pay. A typical work day would start at 9 and end at about 8. The hardest part of the job was the unrealistic work load that you would be given from time to time."
good,Tough place to work right now.  The dock operation continues to build routes that are not very good.  Drivers are often driving out of route and making pickups is very difficult.  We are constantly judged by our production numbers but it is hard to be productive when the dock is unable to assist us in any way.  Late loads are also a problem.  Upper management continues to make decisions for our operations that does not set us up for success.
good,"i love the people i work with and keeps me motivated at work , most of the supervisors have no idea what they're doing but we still follow orders , management does not care if the employees get hurt and do not follow safe work methods and wants you to do there jobs and take hours away from you and you only work 3 hours a night. also the benefits are not good anymore and the cafeteria is crazy expensive."
good,Management very pushy and not understanding with job struggles and how everything works. While loading trucks management would be upset and angry if your trucks were not loaded all the way full.
good,"Nation's can be a fun job to have, if you are working with a good work crew. I personally had a lot of friends working with me we were like a family, so that made the job great. I had a lot of duties to perform which was great because I can  multitask ."
good,This a hard working job. The benefits are great for part time workers. The working environment takes time to adjust to. The breaks are short and quick. Some days you don't receive a break.
good,"There are plenty of positives and negative, If you need job security its the perfect place. If you expect mutual respect from management its not the right place. There's hard work and reasonable pay depending on your position."
good,"UPS in itself isn't a facility for everybody. You have to be mentally and physically strong enough to handle the labor, the harsh words, and the ""drama"" that comes with it."
good,There is no room for advancement depending on your location your just stuck in one position. Pretty easy job to have and the people are kind.
good,"enter the warehouse in the AM given 100 to 120 deliveries for the day, head out to make my stops. what I learned would be safe driving, management was tough at times. hardest part of the job would be working from 8am to 8pm mon-fri no breaks or you would finish even later. aside from weekends very little social life."
good,Productive and fast paced environment with business services and solution. This gave me an amazing experience of business environment along with professionalism.
good,"Arbeiten nach Amerikanischen Prinzip schnell Produktiv.Hohe Leistungsanforderung für Management und Belegschaft,"
good,"I work four hours a day loading boxes."
good,"Perform any and all duties as assigned by management, maintain the highest levels of  customer  care while demonstrating a friendly and cooperative attitude, attention to detail and work in  team oriented environment, lift large bundles of mail, supplies, and shipments of paper up to a maximum of 50 pounds and ability to walk or stand for long periods."
good,It seemed to be a decent job for short amount of time that I was able to work there.  People were nice and helpful.  It was a busy job which I enjoyed.
good,"I didn't like that the job was mostly ""on-call"", Schedules were not for part-time workers.  The hardest part of the job would be getting paired up with a driver that you may not enjoy working with."
good,"It can be tiring at work and you feel sore afterwards, but it paid the bills. The hours were crazy, it was to work your 40 hours in 6 days often. Very few paid days off and getting them is like pulling teeth. It's a franchise and the only way you're linked with UPS is that you ship items out using their company. So, no 401k, healthcare or other perks that UPS Corp. has."
good,"Payroll for 300+ employees, Billing, and Admin. Reposting to Warehouse manager responsible for a variety of duties. Recruiting and screening applicants. TSA Compliance."
good,The work environment is not safe and disputes with proper equipment are not resolved. It is a good job if you have a set schedule but if you're a student I do not recommend it. Most openings are for the night shift which is worse than the other shifts. If you apply try to get preload and twilight they have an easier work load. Holidays are not that great and there are safety issues that are brought up but not fixed.
good,The work place is filled with favoritism and management issues even with the union on your side. The only good thing is that it's hard to lose your job here. If you're trying to grow with the company it'll take a while because of the unnecessary hurdles involved with being overlooked.
good,A typical day would start around 6am and end around 7pm and then call at home when needed.  Reported daily on several conference calls on performance issues.  Co-workers work together to get job completed.  The hardest part of the job was balancing family with work.  The most enjoyable part was the compensation package.
good,"Never informed me that the position was temporary at any point during the online application, the orientation, or during the job itself."
good,"I only worked part-time at UPS which is a main factor in me leaving as I need more hours which will enable me to earn more money."
good,I enjoyed the crowd of people I worked with. I did not like the fact we worked long hours without a lunch or break. By that happening it could mess with your health.
good,UPS is an amazing place to work. The people and processes that are used to delivery that many packages per day is just mind blowin. My biggest complaint with UPS was the management structure and the promotion process.
good,Fast pace work environment steady as you go strong unpleasant order of all the different foods being processed .Good co-workers early hours starting at 3A.M.
good,A day of working your butt off from start to finish. Helps build a camaraderie with fellow employees. very easy to get quick raises within first 90 days however nothing until after being in the position a year.
good,"It is very fast paced, and very hard work. You are expected to work in 5th gear the entire time you are there. Management tends to think you are a machine, and work you very, very hard. It might be for some people, but it is not for me."
good,"UPS Freight was created out of the merger of Overnite and Motor Cargo.  UPS acquired these companies 10 years ago so they would have an LTL carrier like FedEx.  I don't think UPS really knew or cared what they were getting into when they bought an LTL carrier."
good,"The payroll department is set up for learn as you go, which in some cases works, but not when you are dealing with people's money.  They promote a team environment but are more focused on who does what wrong versus using the errors as a teaching moment. You find an error, you report it but you don't discuss it. The first half of your week is processing current payroll adjustments and the last half is working on auditing of entitlements and any other side jobs your supervisor or your district that you over see sends out to you. You could contacted by the Labor division, HR, Finance, or any managers in UPS center. You stay busy and the days go pretty fast."
good,"Poor Management and Unorganized.  Would rather tell you what you want to hear in order for them to get what they want out of you.  Do not follow through with what they say they are going to do. Hours are decent, because even though it is during the early morning, you do have your whole day free to yourself."
good,"Hard place to work. They do not treat you with any respect. No timetable for advancement. No equality within the associates ranks. You must know someone high up to get promoted or work part time for a very long extended time.  Learned how to be a supervisor, learned logistics."
good,This is the perfect job for someone who has only a high school diploma and wants to start from the bottom up. A person with education would not enjoy working in this area of the company.
good,Seasonal drivers have to wait for positions to open to become a full-time driver. This goes by seniority because this is a union job. The best people don't always get the job.
good,i respect this job its very hard working job  but its a good job im a very people person so it was nice to help people out
good,"You typically work 10-11 hours a day, Monday through friday, which can be problems if you have children and they are in extracurricular activities. I however do not have children, and do not really mind the extended hours. Your days go by fast, and being a safety committee member, I enjoy working with younger drivers and instilling proper safety methods and procedures. You cannot transfer to another center if you are a full-time employee."
good,"Waking up at 2am to work 3am to 9am is fine, but when you get there sometimes ""your not needed"", so you sent home. They don't call and tell you before hand, you have to drive all to drive all the way there to be sent home at 3am."
good,"Driver helper."
good,"Seasonal work, got plenty of exercise! Fun to plan route, minimum wage."
good,Met with driver and proceeded to help him deliver packages to both businesses and residential homes.
good,"Allowed 4 to 7 hours daily.  Make sure you have water. Prep your working station before starting.  Work at a fast constant rate. Go until the daily quota has been meet.  Management has to try an keep employees at a acceptable rate.  Co-workers are amazing.  Overall, it is a good place to work, but can have a very militant type of atmosphere due to the output needed to get the job done."
good,"Some people make a career out of working at UPS, most can't wait to leave."
good,Its McDonald's but some of the staff are great people that I have worked with.
good,"Very decilplined."
good,"Operated plastic extrusion machinery. Recorded weight and size of  product as it is finished, staging and loading pallets of merchandise,"
good,"Not such a great company to work for.  Staff were great to work with.  I created tariffs, balance budgets, created reports for management."
good,Pretty much with UPS a typical day there is just delivering packages all day and all night theres no stoping till you deliver all the packages. its not a bad job because you pretty much do you. Your in a truck all day by yourself
good,Underpaid for the work we do and it's no advancement within the company
good,Non-stop the whole time you're there.  I learned how to load package trucks and move a lot of packages fairly quickly.  I liked the management.  They were helpful and understanding.  You don't really have time to talk to your co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is getting to work at 3 every morning. Going home is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,UPS is a demanding place to work with millions of packages being processed every day.  It is difficult to achieve the goals set by the company due to continued labor conflicts with the union and a poor communication network.  It is almost impossible to know what packages will arrive every day so planning appropriate staffing to handle the work becomes difficult.  This results in a lot of down time while waiting for work so people are sent home or large influxes of work where there is not enough staffing to handle it making the work area run very unproductive.
good,"Busy it turns more toward holiday season,Newly negotiated contract 5-6 months go so salary raise should be more favorable"
good,L'entreprise offre des opportunités de développement pour les personnes prêtent à partir à l'étranger. Possibilité de changer de poste en interne.
good,"Very hot or cold climates in warehouse,  worked as a team, good management,."
good,"Each day is just about the same depending on the kinds of customers you get each day. Shipping, Mailboxes, Printing, Packaging, and Shipping. I have pretty much been abandoned by the owner due to how many stores he owns. The co-workers for the most part were all pretty amazing. Dealing with customers is the hardest part of this job for sure. The most enjoyable part is that you can meet some amazing people when you least expect it."
good,"The job is good if logistics is you line of work."
good,Hard work fast interment mangers yelling at you to hurry up i woudn't recommend it to anyone but but they do offer health benefits not very good pay at first
good,"Load and unload packages onto trucks for packages to be sent out to other UPS facilities and delivery. . I learned that if you are in college , this company will help pay for schooling."
good,sorting packages scanning them petting them into ther correct bins
good,Not a great place if you are looking to balance work and home.
good,Although Medical Benefits are wonderful and pay rate is good. The extreme amount of stress and inequality makes it absolutely 100% not worth it!!
good,"A typical day I perform several audits to try and lower claims for damaged packages in my building. I have learned a lot of valuable skills from time at UPS including management skills, operations skills, auditing skills, and time management skills. The hardest part of the job is knowing that the audits I do I will not see any real changes right away, it takes time and lots of coaching to final yield results. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with all my coworkers because I am able to learn and help them because I see and work from a different side of the operation then them."
good,good pay and great associates. long hour alot of ot. fast turn around alot of people are there one day then gone the next
good,"Typical day at UPS is loading and unloaded package onto or off a freight truck.I learned the importance of being patient, how to properly  load and unload trucks, also learned an extreme amount about safety.I was part of a safety committee. One of the greatest parts of worker for UPS was having co-workers that helped the day go by. The hardest part of the job was dealing with changing weather conditions. I mostly enjoyed having weekends off, paid vacations, and my co-workers made this job enjoyable."
good,"Poor management. Low pay,  hazardous work elements. Fast position advancement."
good,"The UPS Stores are Franchised, therefore compensation and advancement are limited. I enjoyed the repeat customers and knew hundreds by name. I did large copy and ship jobs for many business and local political figures. I also managed hiring firing, ordering, stocking, etc."
good,"Everyday was not the same, there was always something new to do. Whenever I came into work, I would sort the mail out and place them in mail boxes. Afterwards I would count how much mail was there to distrubute to the mail driver and later count the money in the tilt. Whenever customers came in the store, I asked them where the mail was going to and give them a price quote on the computer. If they were satisfied with the price I would register their mail for departure. I dealt witht the cash register and debit machine daily. When the driver comes, I count the mail and give him a document to sign. I experienced closing the store and ensuring the cash tilt was balanced as well as making sure that the store was secure for closing."
good,"I learned advanced levels of Excel skills that I didn't have previously.  Most co-workers were fun to work with and everyone got along well, worked as a team with each other.  Trusted to handle highly confidential information regarding the approval or denial of shippers using passenger cargo planes, following all of the TSA guidelines. I didn't receive enough training for the position because my supervisor was out of town at least two and a half weeks every month, which was an issue because nobody else working at Mail Innovations besides my boss and myself, handled the national security TSA work.  All computer work was required, so I learned a lot about not only Excel, but all aspects of MS Office."
good,"A normal day would consist of delivering to approx. 100-160 locations/ day.  In addition, each day on-demand service calls as well as approx 15-25 scheduled pick-ups are required for pickup throughout the day in addition to your 100-160+ delivery locations.  Attention to detail for delivery location, constant area awareness, planning ahead and troubleshooting all play a vital role each day.  Finite attention to detail when reviewing package labeling ensuring hazardous materials are separated and proper documentation is filed.  Management of your truck and your day's plan is up to the driver how he/ she may follow trace and is expected to be executed as efficiently as training has demanded."
good,Fast pace work environment. Had to be very precise and be able to mulit-task. Was trained to perform several different jobs duties.
good,"Strong organization but due to slow growth and over 500,000 employees worldwide advancement and career development takes a back seat."
good,"A typical day starts at 4:00 a.M. And ends at 9:30 a.M. Fast paced and constantly on the go.  I have learned alot about osha, warehouse guidelines, road safety and proper safe work methods.  I deal with over 200 emplyees on a daily basis educating them on the rules of safety and wellness.  Testing, certifications, and observation are done on a daily basis.  The hardest part of my job are the hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with so many different personalities."
good,I had to load and unload package cars. What I learned the most from Ups is team work everybody must work together to make that building run. My co-workers were great always helping out and lending a hand if needed. The hardest part of the job was lifting the overweights when they came through. the most enjoyable was some of my co-workers
good,Work was steady people where cool to work with. Management was cool and tried to keep the employees happy.
good,"UPS kargo dünyanın en büyük kargo şirketleri arasında yer alıyor hatta bazı istatiklere göre dünyanın en büyük kargo şirketi. "
good,I worked 3rd shift and enjoyed the work however I needed a full time position and I was moving to Pa
good,"It was a very fast paced job which I liked. It kept me on my toes, literally. There was alot of standing involved, but overall a descent job."
good,A typical day at UPS could be explained as hard work. I learned how to lift with your legs not your back. The management team tried but wasn't the best. But they tried. I enjoyed my coworkers. We worked hard all around the clock. the hardest part of  UPS had to of been the cold nights and the hot summer days under the tin roof. The enjoyable part of the job had to of been when they asked for someone to leave early.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for part-time work to make a little extra money. Physical work but you only work 3-4 hours early in the morning. Take a while to move up in the company in the union and in management but if you stick it out it pays off in the end
good,UPS was a different atmosphere due to constant changes and supervisors coming and going. Everyone had ideas but didnt know how to implement them
good,Management not great at training or communicating. who ever is in charge of hiring is terrible. work here is physically demanding so if you are out of shape or have a lazy attitude this is not the place for you. unfortunately the lazy out of shape people are the ones who get hired and it becomes the job of middle management to try and get the job done.
good,"Everyday is the ""Super Bowl"". The unrelenting pressure to achieve results without the proper tools to do so is very stressful."
good,"One of the large companies that deliver packages, the job was high paced, manual labor and typically took a lot out of a person in the middle of the morning.  High ethics and strong interpersonal relationships made the job worth it."
good,The job get very repetitive  but my coworkers make the day go by fast
good,Load the semi trailers full of boxes. Stayed later to load the 1 & 2 day expedited packages.
good,"a typical day at work incluses constant movement"
good,"A typical day at work would be handling packages to there designated area by zip code. I've learned how to multitask, learn how to be rapidly fast when having to deal with thousands of packages a night. Also use all my safety methods on the job to prevent any injuries."
good,The job is ok but i wouldnt recommend it to someone it was an easy job but a lot of work and can be somewhat dangerous at times
good,"A typical work day was being able to load packages from various states into the right truck load using an electrical scanner. I learned how to work in a high volume hub with mostly men and maintain my position. I also learned how to handle the packages with care and think about the customer who was on the receiving end. Managementt was strict, which I appreciated. My co-workers were professional and tactful. The hardest part of the job was building walls in truck loads for 2-3 hours with no break and lifting boxes sometimes 40 pounds with no assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and finish college."
good,Opportunity to learn numerous subjects and poor advancement opportunities.
good,"Go into work anywhere between 5 to 11 hours. I learned how to work as a team player. It's a lot of work, but good for someone looking to make extra money, while looking for a job. It takes a physical and mentally strong person to lift and sort 5,000 boxes a day minimum."
good,"I would show up about 15 minutes before shift started so that I could pick a smooth driving forklift. Have our meeting, listen to our production goals for the day. After finishing our daily stretch, we receive our breakouts (Trailer number and PO's) and using a sharpie I would write the appropriate door numbers on the movement bills so that the loader for that door knew it was his freight. Using an ink pen I would fill out the manifest writing the damages, shortages, and overages on the trailer and write the time I began and the time I finished. After finishing my trailer I sweep it out and close the door letting supervisors know that it was time to move that empty trailer out and move another full one in. These same procedures were repeated until shift was over. Then  I park my lift and clock out, turning in my manifest before I leave."
good,"If you work with the administrative side at UPS, there is more positve people and nicer work environments. In operations, the building is too small for the amount of packages they process, and the environment is extremely negative/low morale among the workers."
good,It is a typical sorting position with heavy flow and low pay.
good,une expérience profonde  par le contact quotidien avec les autres
good,"A typical day at work would be in front of a computer screen for day contacting potential clients, assisting them in the completion of account paperwork and aiding in customs clearances.  The most enjoyable aspect of this job is that it is a job you can leave at the end of the day.  You will not be expected to work after hours.  The management is generally manageable to work with and the pay is on the lower scale, but the benefits are good.  Excellent coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is the routine tasks day after day and needing to sit in one spot for hours at a time glued to the computer screen."
good,"a typical day at work consists of loading semi-trailers with boxes all while dealing with unorganized supervisors. I've been through proper hazmat classes and learned how to load and unload a truck. The management is often running around trying to figure out what to do. I personally have had to bring my Union down multiple times due to unfair treatment.all my coworkers agree about the management and are also very hard workers. one of the hardest parts of the job is dealing with management, the physical labor is nothing i can't really handle. i like my job mostly because of my other coworkers."
good,"Went to college on the earn and learn program.  threatend to quit and gave me a job as a part time supervisor.  Trained myself in revenue auditing well enough to train new hires.  conducted safety training seminars, weekly safety meetings and job hazard analysis reviews."
good,"job as a ramp agent is fast pace, you work on the ramp around aircraft and in all weather conditions. UPS has a program called Metro college where you work and pay for school"
good,"Een dag bij Ups is nooit saai, elke dag is anders. Je hebt dagelijks te maken met verschillende orders en klanten en je werkt in een gezellige productieve omgeving, waar klant en kwaliteit voorop staan. Ook is Ups een bedrijf waar je veel kan leren, zo heb ik er oa een cursus voor de combi/reachtruck gevolgd."
good,Good company with lots of career path opportunities.  Good people at the company.  hardest part of the job was simply the working environment.  Tough old school management led to poor working conditions.  Most enjoyable part of the job was when the day went well.
good,"A typical day at work entailed arriving and preparing for the workload. On any given day there could be a lot of trucks to be unloaded and sorted, or there could be very few. Usually we had a lot of trucks and it was a repetitive cycle day in and day out. Learned how to tell which boxes and packages went to which destination by codes on the labels. Management wasn't very understanding or friendly. At this time during my employment I was on Military orders and due to my orders I could not come to work on certain days, gave them a copy of those same orders and they could care less. Not understanding or supportive at all. My co-workers, some were cool but most were very rude and disrespectful, especially if you were on of the newer people. The hardest part of the job was finding a conveyor belt that actually worked. a lot of packages had to go to certain places but the majority of the belts did not work so you had to carry the heavier (50+ lbs) packages to another belt and then you ended up getting backed up on your line. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we got to go home."
good,Processed invoice’s for packages that were being shipped internationally.  Entered and processed invoices using the Mainframe computer program.  Sorted and shipped both international air and ground packages.
good,"The job that I had was as a seasonal package handler during the holidays, you meet your driver somewhere and you ride with them to help make deliveries. It's a good first step into UPS and gives you a first hand look at how things work there. If you're short on money during the holiday's this job can help."
good,I learned how to keep my composure in stressful situations.  I learned about product ordering and keeping inventory.  The most employable part of my job was the way it was like a family.  Everyone was friendly and new each other pretty well.  I learned how to delegate and lead a group of young talent.
good,Meet with supervisor and get assignments for the day. Unload freight from the truck unto the belt for processing. I didn't learn any new skills at this job and the management team lacked in communication. My co-workers were ok and the hardest part about the job was the continual lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours.
good,"Management changed hands during my contract period."
good,"It was a average experience working with this company, management and work culture was not upto the marks but salary and job security was there."
good,A tough job to have you must be fit for the job because it requires a lot of lifting
good,"Empresa bastante dinamico onde a comunicação e a parte fundamental apesar de ser um gigante no seu ramo de atividade."
good,"This job offered a flexible schedule and was in a decent location.  Pay was low -- I started at $10.00/hr and attained two raises ($1.00) each until I was making $12.00 after about 1 1/2 years of employment.  "
good,very intense work place.  Lots of friendly hard working people.
good,"* A typical day at work consisted of continuous heavy-lifting and pushing, a 5-minute break, time-limits which will occur at random, and a limit to how many truck trailers each individual can unload per work day. "
good,"A typical day of work includes being short staffed with unrealistic goals, a small booklet of paperwork to be turned in daily along with a union environment where workers believe they don't have to give an effort if they've been working for more than 4 years."
good,"loading boxes in a truck. i learned what working for a delivery system is like, i did enjoy it. management was cool. co-workers were very great. hardest part was them overloading me with work as a new employee. the best part was clock out time after all that hard work"
good,"Effective interaction with Customers, Vendors and all level of Management"
good,"A typical day at Ups for me consisted of scanning lifting observing. perform a six sided check on every hazardous package, also completing a hazardous acceptance checklist for each. enter all hazardous information along with the shippers contact  info into a daily log. peforme aduits on every hazardous package making sure each package has its correct labels, documents, and standard shipping procedures. work with hazardous shipping HQ to notifying customers of any hazardous package discrepancy."
good,A typical day at work is hard working and hot and cold environment with a low pay rate less hours for the stressful job duties. This job has been sustainable for four years now. I have rise among one of the best workers there with great work ethic. The management run the company with a system to make sure our customers are pleased with service. I have grown to know many of my coworkers and they're great people to work with. The hardest part about this job is loading in hot and cold environments and the work can be depressing and stressful due to the heavy lifting and wear and tear it does to the body. The fact that it takes too long to become full-time and having to work as a part time with low pay can be devastating with the cost of living increasing. The most enjoyable part of working here is the little experience being a driver helper and getting out there to interact with the customers when delivering to the homes of the customers and businesses.
good,"Worked a 40 hr plus work week.  Supervised 20 plus employees handling personnel issues, Customs compliance and quality measurements."
good,"Easy work, however processes and procedures aren't unisom"
good,"I was working as Business Development Associate handling Norther Emirates"
good,"many useful skills obtained from this job such as selling skills, presentation skills and negotiating deals. "
good,The hardest part of the job is working with the customers and management. The place is so busy sometimes I can't even think.
good,"Did facility maintenance the last 7 yrs I worked there. Learned to drive a tractor trailer work on diesel engines,semi-trailers and do general maintenance at the facility. Most of my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was just having to put up with some of the supervisors. The job itself was very rewarding most of the time."
good,Management needs to be looked at thoroughly and better management be put in place.
good,a typical day is about 3 to 4 hours long. not much to learn besides how to organize the trucks. hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the packages that come down the belt. Not much fun.
good,"Original I was hire as a TRO working 2nd shift.  A simple day come in grab laptops that you had diagnosis the day before and repair them.  Then diagnosis stuff for the following day. Unfortunately UPS-SCS lost their business with Toshiba and all who had technician titles were demoted and sent to the warehouse.  Now working 3rd shift doing cycle counts, I enjoy the company of my one co-work, I never really see management, there is not really anything hard about the job, counting parts to make sure the physical inventor matches what is in the program."
good,ups was a good company to work for. The empolyees was nice and always willing to help out. Only issue with that position was the hrs i was getting was not enough to take care of my family.
good,"As a loader at ups a typical day starts with packages coming down a chute and placing them in as neatly into a ""wall"" as possible.  Sometimes there is a lot others not so much, when there is not as much usually you bounce around and try to stay busy.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes co-workers cannot handle their part and if you show you can handle yours, management will take advantage of you.  Being a unionized as ups is also can be tough because co-workers who cannot handle their load don't have and rather than being reprimanded or encouraged to do better management asks the employees who do their part to do a little more.  "
good,"Professionalism,safe work place,profeesional work force and administration"
good,Load 2-75 lbs boxes in a trailer within a certain time frame.
good,Funcionários operacionais não são levados a sério pela gerência.
good,"I loved my job at ups, i was a senior co-oping to go work there. But after awhile it got to be too much. The work load was not worth the pay checks. Beng a college student and working night shift was not the best thing for me because i always had more than one job."
good,A typical day was getting rushed by supervisors because they felt as though you werent moving at a fast enough pace. The night shift was the shift I chose to work but it was because you get away with way more. The co-workers werent all that bad but the part time supervisors treated you as if you were a slave if you let them. They would have me lift packages sometimes that exceed the limit for me to even tamper with. The friends I made there made a big diffrence and made it possible to get through the night. I cant say to much about management in all but one manager stood out amoungst all of them because you can tell he actually was concerned about the employees. I learned from working at UPS that patience is a must when working in any location and even though its hard to maintain a positive attitude working in a place like that in the long run everything actually pays off.
good,"Outstanding dispatchers, pay keeps getting cut combined with rising health care benifits ,not worth being over the road!"
good,"The Phoenix Hub facility is a mess. It's a very old facility that is very cramped. The upper management is ruthless and does not care for employee well being. The only reason the company preaches about safety so much upon your hiring is to cover their own tails. In reality, there is safety violations and OSHA regulations being broken left and right. The compensation for an hourly is pathetic at 8.50 an hour and the pay progression is measly."
good,"A typical day at work, presort meeting, staffing, safety, employee review, randomness, end of night walkout but 80% of a good nights work. i learn to see problem from an employee and management view which help me in my decision make process, how to a team leader and player. your basic manager not to many complaints. have a great co-worker relationship with the other supervisors. The chance to me new people and the night never long."
good,"Arrive about 7:00am - review Email - Plan out the day - dispatch computer technicians - do a walkthrough - follow up on assignments that can not be assigned to others. I shapened my computer technical skills, learned how to assess, discipline, and reward employees. Management is under a lot of stress. My co-workers all have the same goal which is to succeed. The hardest part of the job is there is no work life balance opportunity. To succeed one must neglect their family and other activities. Working with employees and co-workers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and benefits. Normal day is wake up check email and daily load schedule, get to work around noon to set up yard and dock, go in and plan for evening/night, conducts safety meeting, wrap up city dispatch, run dock operations go home around midnight and do payroll for an hour or so....wake up and repeat...."
good,"fast pace, constant walking. Would be nice if it was a full time position, and not seasonal."
good,"My overall experience at The UPS Store was good. However, the owner and managers there were great, and that is not always the case for this type of establishment."
good,"My night would start of a bit slow. Loading and unloading 18 wheelers in the middle of the night can take a toll on your body, but after a while you'll get used to it! I learned how to use some of the computer equipment, they trained me to use a program called 'SPA'.Later on I became a driver helper and helped deliver packages to houses."
good,A typical day at work is organizing the ups truck so customers packaging can be easily delivered. I did learn that a lot of customers love to order online & really enjoyed to have a very fun co worker/manager. The hardest part was dealing with very angry dogs when stepping on there property. The most enjoyable part was seeing how excited customers were when receiving there long awaited packages.
good,"very fast paced, not a fair place to work at all times. People are descent to work with."
good,Heavy boxes falling everywhere. Packages would sometimes act as a wall trapping you inside the trailer.
good,once your hired on its a great place to work but its just so hard to get in heavy lifting and monouvering
good,• Develop consistent and reproducible operating plans designed to exceed business plan targets
good,This is a very demanding job that places a lot of emphasis on meeting numbers based goals. Customer service is important but it doesn't seem like it is the most important. Expectations raise every year like they should but when dealing with union employees these goals can be very difficult to obtain consistently espcecially when they have no motive to succeed other than to gain seniority. Above average performance will not help union workers get anywhere at UPS and that is a long range problem when it comes to getting them to perform at the high level demanded to obtain company goals.
good,UPS is a top notch company with a good solid track record. Being a mature business they have a hit a point where growth potential is limited. It has forced them to refocus on new opportunities and to cut costs.
good,load package in semi trucks clean work are when done co workers were helpful if you needed help
good,"In a company that only promotes from within and with over 300,000 employees it is inevitable that politics impede a lot of great initiatives."
good,"The environment is stressful. I have been working part time at UPS for 4 1/2 years. To only work 25 hours a week is discouraging. The benefits are good but the environment of the work place is very stressful and dreadful. However, the job has taught me a lot in life, like how to become independent and great work ethics."
good,Ok place for 2nd job very sad place to work at times when people are always sick
good,"A ""typical day at work"" is not so ""typical"" anymore."
good,"workers were sometimes forced to unload an 18 wheeler with heavy objects without help at times. The environment was not friendly, and often co-workers spoke negatively about the work place"
good,"job security is high, but very little room for advancement. If you are a college graduate, not a good place to work because career advancement can take 10+ years."
good,I work at a franchise and they do things completely different from a corporation.
good,"I have worked with UPS for 6 plus years. I started out in Peoria, Ill working part time, night hours. In march 2012 i transferred to Galesburg. When I was in Peoria I had to drive 2 hours to and 2 hours home. My kids had to spend four unnecessary hours at childcare but when i was hired UPS management said we would be full-time in a year. Full-time never came. I transferred closer to home, but the new management is completely different and they play alot of games and take alot of pay. Galesburg calls you in for various reasons and then doesn't pay you. They make you leave an hour early or however long you worked, you leave early to absorb that time because they will not pay over your 27.5 hours."
good,Alot of finger pointing and blame no since of pride and loyalty
good,"Working at UPS i learned to always be on my toes, keep my environment clean, and deal with my customers with the utmost respect in-order to get their need done with satisfaction."
good,"A typical day will be like calling the driver or manager if help is needed. You meet and greet with the driver at a designated location. You clock in with the provided device, the DIAD (Delivery Information Acquisition Device), which also scan any package you deliver. You ride with the driver to make deliveries. You assist the driver in unloading the package(s) off the deliery truck. You scan and carry the package(s) to the point of delivery (e.g. a place of residence or a business) with aid of equipment if necessay. You make sure if the recipent is present to receive, and you ask for signature to confirm delivery by using the DIAD. You return to the truck, and continue make deliveries. Other responsibilities may also include, picking up packages for shipping, answering any customer concerns, and returning any delivery package not received back to the delivery truck. The labor is fast-based and physically-demanding. Every package worker is allowed a lunch break for about an hour."
good,"first few years were great here, since then i have come to realize its who you know here that gets you up the corporate ladder not what you do"
good,Great benefits but hard to advance. Management sabotage workers performance to accumulate write ups and try to get rid of the ones who make too much. High turn over.
good,"Don't get started with my work day until almost 9 am. Then there is a 10 hour work day that keeps my from spending quality time at home, which is very important to me.I feel like nothing more than a number there. Management is focused on their own numbers most of the time. They are very rarely interested in their employees personal lives. Management positions are available but not in areas that interest me, such as the driver supervisor. I believe I may like stay with UPS but certainly not in the package delivery side of the company. Virtually no comradery between employees because time on the truck is spent alone. It is difficult to not be able to spend more time with customers because we are forced to move so fast."
good,"unless you are part of the ""good ole"" boys network - you dont advance in certain departments of this company..."
good,I loved it there i would go back any day. Every customer was always satisfied with my work and i had very little problems with customers.
good,"Must keep close ties with immediate boss and ""play the game,"" its a what have you done for me lately atmosphere. Need to have quick response and able to explain your existance, otherwise you'll be an outcast and out-the-door fast. Any movement in management is based on ""who you know,"" not ""what you know."" Union environment is good but not real strong, need to build ties with immediate supervisor if you want to survive."
good,Good Benefits and Pay
good,I would not recommed any position at UPS Supply Chain Solutions.
good,"At UPS, A fair company, put in your hours and do your work as instructed and this will be a good place for you to work."
good,Comprehensive benefits.
good,"I worked for UPS for a few months and It was a good job. I came in at 5:30pm and worked for a solid four hours till 9:30. Perfect timing for me because I have classes in the morning and a busy social life at night. The pay was fair, and the management was nice and professional."
good,"I enjoyed my job at UPS simply because it fit around my schedule, as a college student. One benefit is that I had weekends off always. However, the pay wasn't equal to the amount of work expected and Managers were constantly over shoulder. The most important factor of my departure from UPS was that it would have been years before I could be a truck driver and earn a living wage."
good,"I worked at this job as a helper, and it's fast paced with hardly any downtime. You're literally being worked to the limit on a low salary."
good,Seemingly a bunch of women trying to make each other leave the job. There is alot of messiness. No comraderie at all. No sense of team work or even a united front.
good,"It was great working for UPS since they help pay for college. You can become a supervisor very quickly, but moving beyond that will take forever."
good,"Great place to work if you can advance. Driver jobs pay well and the hours are conducive to a good family life, as well as the possibility to have a second job. Good benefits if you can make enough to be able to afford them."
good,Good job location and friendly customers. Management was very good when I joined which made me a more knowledgeable employee.
good,UPS was a place where you could come to work and gain a workout. If you were in management you were expected to be at work no matter what. There was 4 inches of snow/ice on the roads and they made every supervisor some to work not caring about safety. The management team there was horrible threatening your job every chance they got. Pay was not bad but there were numerous instances where the full-time supervisors would changes times to make sure no overtime was given. Health Benefits were Amazing!
good,"The workload is very busy. Compensation is not up to standards in the industry, but the employee benefits are decent. Having fun at work is frowned upon."
good,"My work week was Sunday day shift (early morning) and Monday through Thursday night shift (3rd shift). Not only did the schedule, for lack of a better word, suck, I had two different managements for each shift. Day shift managers were very uptight, but were stressed as they oversaw multiple package lines. Night shift managers were way more relaxed and got along better with their staff. Work conditions were fine just always hot in the part of the building I was in because there is no heating/cooling in that particular building."
good,Loader and a Handbager moving packages to the Next assembly line and a outside night stocker worked in HD very cooperative team player who maintain a professional attitude at all times & risks well organized in work job habits.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee, covering the ""peak season"" of Christmastime through New Year's.  I wish they would have re-hired me after that peak season."
good,"Didn’t have no problem with my job what so ever, Some Management were just a******s!!!! Other than that the job wasn’t hard & Worst case I’d work there again"
good,"Managment really sucks, but the union is ok and its very difficult to get fired from there. The health benefits and overtime pay are top notch though, especially during the holiday season!!"
good,I got “laid off” daily and wasn’t paid for 3 weeks. I still haven’t received my last check in over 2 weeks and I can’t get ahold of anyone about my check.
good,Need a BIG change i need to get to a career in something i love to do. Video - Photography or something new that i can excel at. Live better than retire.  Need knowledge TRUE knowledge of the  company.
good,The Union has a has firm grip on the Labor force and it's impossible to get on Full time with Benefits.  The Stand By is not the most effective way to get people to work and get the opportunity to stay with an organization for the future but it's hard to understand.
good,Fun place to work at many flaws but it didn’t take long for them to be handled and fixed. Co workers are very friendly people to work with and be around.
good,The tasks and responsibilities you are given are simple and easy. Its a easy job to understand but the management I currently have don’t have backbones. They get walked over while they aren’t fully aware of how to organize their staff.
good,"Working at ups was a fast paced environment. It involved some long days and difficult goals. The skills you learn are good skills to have. I learned a lot with communication,processes and multitasking while working here. with hard work and pushing yourself to achieve goals and more helped with development at ups."
good,Working at UPS was an experience I will never forget. It lasted for what seemed like forever and I will always have memories from my time there with my coworkers.
good,"Its a fast pace environment, easy to maintain and keep up with work flow. They give you a 15 minute break every few hours to rest and relax. This job will give you a workout."
good,I would meet my driver everyday at a cvs and drop off packages. Never went to the actual UPS building while working there and was very out of the loop when it came to changes.
good,It was a good place to work with lots of good people management  were ok but not the best hours we ok but not the best gets really quiet round Christmas time and people get played off
good,"I liked working my seasonal job here. For the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. The only real gripe I have is that the management can sometimes be disorganized."
good,The job is not that bad. Its the environment that not the best for me. management is not that great. They don't listen to the workers. Not all issue are addressed.
good,I got a concussion from a car accident and I wasnt allowed to work by my doctor so ups fired me. I had a doctors note and the doctor Called them but they still fired me
good,"Management was a problem for that specific location, it was somewhat a loose chain in a saw. If one part of the building sections fell out of line, overtime was place into questioning for the part-time employes."
good,The job itself wasn’t the best but it did have its benefits . Working there was pretty tough at times but you had to just stick it through . Very physical
good,"Overall, I appreciated my time as a personal vehicle driver at UPS.  The people make the place great.  However, the management is kind of non-existent.  Not exactly big on communication.  It was a seasonal position and you’re paid well."
good,Seasonal position during the busy shipping holidays. Low pay but the potential to become a full-time employee after completing some seasonal training.
good,"Disclaimer: I worked for UPS as a seasonal employee. "
good,"I enjoyed the manual labor of loading/unloading the trucks.  Each trailer on different days had a variety of items to load/unload, not a boring job. Did not like the intensely cold weather on the dock."
good,Its a very laborious job that requires you to be able to lift 70 lbs or more. It pays ok and there are all kinds of people there a friendly environment.
good,"The drivers I have worked with have been very friendly, polite, and helpful. The work itself can be pretty rigorous and fast-paced, so it's a good idea to have some water and easily removable layers on hand. "
good,"There are 2 types of people that work for this company. #1.people who are willing to work their lives away for the very lucrative wage they earn which in turn keeps them from having any life at all but shackles them to a job that pays like no other. These are mostly the ups drivers. The most essential, yet least nurturing position. The longer they’ve been here the angrier them seem. Money that creates a future and a life that they miss out on because they’re working it’s remarkable the almost resigned to their fare"
good,"it can be a good seasonal job, but as a official employee it can be tiring.  They make you stretch and hydrate which is good, but they can rarely have enough people for the Christmas season.  It can be hot in the summer and cold in the winter so dress appropriately ."
good,Great Job gets cold around winter good extra pocket money for sure but a lot of people had trouble getting a driver I had no trouble with this and was a great environment once I got my driver designated to me.
good,"It's a good place to work for the new graduates to get experience and then move on as the pay scale is not that great."
good,I think ups is a good starting job and it is very fast paced if you like that kind of stuff. Yeah liked that you could work in your own space and there wasn’t anybody interfering
good,"It’s a fast paced environment. Be prepared to work hard. Some supervisors rude and condescending but as long you your job, you wont have an issue. Dress warm for cold temperatures and dress light for the heat."
good,my training teach me everything I know on the job the safety what to do outside on the truck. The hardest part is the weather I was going to the center on 104 and Forster but now I meet my driver
good,"What I did a UPS, I was a package handler I basically loaded packages in a big can and did that all night till the end of my shift the pay was okay but not enough for the work we did 6 days a week and the supervisor never helped with things that needed to be done or never told us everything we had to do until the last minute."
good,wanted to be  a delivery driver but it makes me feel sick. driveing in heat all day. pay is good  but it is not for me. warehouse work fits me better  very repetitive  and they treat workers like animals  often but they pay you well so it is acceptable. Work area has lots of dust in the air you have to breathe daily.
good,Good hardworking experience teach me a lot of how the company works and a lot of good benefits it helps out in different ways and builds up a foundation at ups
good,"My  experience working at UPS ( Vero Road Baltimore, MD) for the past 3 seasons where delightful.  I am hoping they consider me for this holiday season as  well (2019) for the driver helper position.  I really enjoyed the position as driver helper as i utilized my experience and skills gained."
good,"Was hired for the 4am to 9am shift. Immediately after being hired I was given a schedule that listed different start times for each working day. "
good,"3rd day and I’m being overworked because they don’t have people coming to work "
good,"Loved my coworkers dearly. In operations the camaraderie was unreal, we all had a great appreciation for each other as a big family. The business owners and customers you'd get to know on a first name basis was also something I never expected to have developed. I learned how to manage a large team of diverse people. Ages ranged from low 20's to high 50's, some foreign born and some local. "
good,It keeps you busy and your constantly learning as you go throughout your day. The job has great employees and are willing and eager to help you if you need a hand.
good,"-Don’t be scared To speak your mind "
good,I worked washing trucks and if asked to stay after shift to unload semi. The down side is everyone is part time who have seniority  so there is no room to advance.
good,"Dress appropriately for the weather, get used to constant movement. Lunch Breaks are an hour and are required/unavoidable. The weekly pay makes it worth it, don't lift more than you can carry, be cautious getting off and on the truck-- Handrail"
good,"My favorite part about working at the UPS store was sorting the mail. The post office gave us a bucket of mail everyday and one of us had to sort the mail through the right mailboxes for our customers. It was really fun and calming for me. The store was always really slow but when Christmas came around, it became very busy. Some days were stressful around that time but sometimes it was fun."
good,"At work you just ship out orders and maintain inventory. Changes are very slow due to procedures always being held as high priority. Most of the time we do not have freedom to make changes."
good,"Fast paced, Some people have attitudes and cause drama in the terminal. Grown ups acting like Teenagers. 55% of people get along with one another, not really a good environment"
good,"as a driver helper, your job with UPS is easy just scanning packages, dropping them to the door step and ringing the door bell. Some packages can be heavy but a hand truck is always available for assistance/"
good,"I enjoy working here but it is very labor-intensive. I was also not told the position was temporary until after I began working, which was a disappointment."
good,"None of the managers (FT and PT) are ever on the same page at anytime. Makes for a very stressful, and unorganized work environment no matter how slow or busy the day is."
good,"Wasnt able to work the later hours cause of bus transportation hours. Great work environment and people. Provides water, ice, and Gatorade/ Propel drinks."
good,"stressfull, especially during holidays it is very repetive as well as if you want to try an advance an they don't want you to they will perpously make you fail"
good,If you are willing to deal with rude management then the hours definitely pays off. I had a manager who has it out to tear me down any chance she got. Other managers would tell me I was doing great and all she wanted to do was tell me I wasn't going to last at this job and expect to look for another job after my first month.
good,Bad management many of the workers there were not catching up with the work and the supervisors would not help. Overworked most of the time and felt unhappy
good,The job is great they just have to much young supervisors and they cause problems with other employees when your on the floor it's very fast paste and carry a water bottle because your gonna be hot and sweaty but the only thing wrong is you have to make sure your water last till break and break is only 10 minutes
good,The people were much better and humble than XPO. The hardest part of my job was working overnight. The easiest part of the job was interacting with hourly personnel.
good,"ups is a great company for full time,managers,supervisors,package car and feeder drivers, but for part-time workers and part time supervisors get shafted on any kind of advancement. union health benefits are amazing. supervisor health benefits are horrible. you would honestly think they would take car of their management people more but they dont."
good,"he job will get you into shape. Relatively a great part-time job that pays well, as it has a workers union. If you give them a good attendance record, being on time and present for your shift on a regular basis, they will help pay for education if you go to college or university. If you want more hours to work, they will gladly take a trained worker to help out during busy seasons in other departments. Its a very big company, and will soon have a subway at their doorstep."
good,fast paced environment. I learned how to sort and scan packages and unload trucks. The hardest part of the job was getting up early in the morning for the shift.
good,"Typical day at ups, there isn’t a typical day there you come in you work get yelled for moving to slow then you leave and repeat all over again, but there are some very good things ups offered"
good,"you work about 3-5 hours a day, you learned to stack boxes at a constent and face paced motion. management was okay, worplace is a warehouse tempature controlled best of ability. hardest is pacing yourself to keep up with your trailer."
good,La empresa realiza despidos en base a sus creencias en vez de ver la determinación de las autoridades
good,"My current manager is the best manager I have had since UPS purchased us in 2004, she is fair, hard working understands the work life balance that is needed."
good,"This is a tough work environment.  Management is often expected to work 12+ hour days. It is very difficult to advance through the company, especially if you don't have connections to individuals that are higher up."
good,"Fast pace delivery company, high expectation with little hand on training,   the training giving is redundant but could lose job if not pass.  Managment intent is not clear."
good,Ups benefits are good its just the supervisors give you a hard time you just have to stay focused have good work ethic. I just wish it would have worked out here but enough was enough. They really didn't treat us fair at all.
good,"Pay isn't much but the full benefits are great. If your new, you don't have the opportunity to choose your schedule as the senior employees has more power than the newbies"
good,"Military like driven which makes for an uncomfortable workplace and is no conducive to a driver getting on the road "
good,Ups doesn't focus entirely on their mission. Lack of training for success and lack of action of support by hr and upper management is evident. Serious retraining and structure needs to take place. Harassment and unfair treatment is rampant. Hr ignored complaints.
good,"If you’re planning on advancing and you’re of a different religion other than Christian . Be prepared to experience a slow down in the process. Of course they won’t be straight forward , but you’ll notice a lot of red tape ! They are NOT as inclusive as they proclaim when you go for customer contact positions!"
good,"I started with UPS at an entry level position with hopes to climb through the ranks and grow within the company.  Through insane dedication, hard work and countless 18+ hour work days, I was able to advance my career to a manager level.  The higher I climbed within the organization the more I realized how little this company respected my work life balance and personal life.  If you are a family oriented individual who enjoys holidays and time to decompress from work, do not seek employment with this company. Although it is encouraged to address other partners by first name at UPS, I can assure you that you are just a number here."
good,"UPS is an ok job, it would be a lot easier if they had better and more helpful supervisors. They start off at 14 an hour now. I started out at 11 an hour. My pay wasn't good at all for all the hard work."
good,"This job will have you working all seasons. In the winter and in the summer. You can wear what you want when you either load, unload or work in the smalls area."
good,pretty much you are racing an conveyor belt to get the package in the right truck and the right route. You can be given up to 4 truck at one time. It doesn't matter how big or heavy the packages are you need to catch them all.
good,"Very fast paced hard work, paid for a good workout. Mistake switching from union to non union. I don’t suggest it. One 10 minute break even over 6 hours. Management doesn’t get but the one break and no paid lunch. If you go over 8 hours you’ll be spoke with. Unethical but company wants ethical practices upheld from staff."
good,UPS offers  good benefits for hard workers in a fast paced environment but not always appreciated by management. You sometimes get the feeling that management will overload you to force you to quit as a go around from union protection
good,Working at the ups store has taught me everything about being a ups employee. Its taught to never never slack off or you pay the price. Always be on your toes and be ready to move fast when the phone ring. The job is very unpredictable you dont know what will happen today or tomorrow. the reason i said is a one man job is because each employee relies on each other too much and its bring confusion. There was time I ran the whole ups store alone without a problem.
good,UPS is a great place to work at for young up and coming Engineers or Operators who are able to give most of their day to the job. However if you are someone who is starting a family you may find the hours hard to manage. The trade off is that you will be working for a large and stable company that has it sights on only continuing to grow year after year.
good,"You can earn big money here by sacrificing, blood, sweat, tears, and your sanity. High % of Upper management is less qualified than you. Only promote when its convenient for them and they overlook qualified applicants for management roles and hirer brown nosers."
good,Overall it’s good job. The only bad thing is that they require you to work 12 to 16 hours a day. You get written up if you try to leave before then. I moved to Pittsburg so the long commute makes it hard for me to get proper rest to start my day. I’m always exhausted.
good,"With the increasing amount of online shopping, UPS has been slammed during the winter season trying to stay ahead of FedEx and Amazon. Competition is there, but it's backbreaking."
good,"Early morning shifts from times of 3-9 and peak season shifts of 12-10:30. Can get slammed with packages with very little help, tend to misload due to poor management, follow rules of lowering and lifting techniques, Gets questioned by auditors over safety questions while loading trucks."
good,I started out liking the job a lot and the fact that it was like a work out. My first paycheck wasn't as good as expected. Now  they've continued to be not as good as they say. One of the bosses was very disrespectful. Doesn't introduce himself.
good,"Fast paced environment...handling day tasks of inbounding freight processing packages for delivery...dispatching..handling training classes as well as payroll and or insurance issues....daily required paperwork"
good,"First things first, entry level work is all part time. Its hard, stressful and definitely not for everybody. The good news is they are upfront on how difficult it is. However they do leave out how difficult it can really get."
good,It's typical use to be a nice place to work but management doesn't have a clue! Some immediate supervisors are great and then some alot to be desired! They don't fire anyone no matter if they work or play.  I feel like I work in a playground sometimes actually all the time! Raises are tiny and bonuses what a joke maybe $100 every 3 months and that is if you BUST butt!
good,Professional culture is maintained to meet high standards of healthcare product distribution. Mentally challenging on occasion and physically demanding much of the time. Pay is low for the quality of employee needed to succeed in this position.
good,"Yeah this corporation has many different levels of employment. You can choose corporate, logistics or in store for a more personal approach to the consumer."
good,"Great to work for, good people. Easy job, good environment. Would have loved to stay if it wasn’t just holiday work. Look forward to getting back into it."
good,"Job is good because of the benefits that come with the job but pay is a little low for all the work that is being done. Also barley any break time , break is only 10min"
good,It would always be really slow in the morning and pick up throughout the day and get very busy around the time we would leave. Which was very irritating. The best part about it was most definitely the people everyone is very nice and respectful there.
good,Overall I like working with ups just a lot of hours and felt I wasn’t being paid enough for all what they required of Me in all it was good experience
good,"Hard labor, great money. You can advance in management or keep your integrity and respect and make union pay for union work. UPS is tough but you can enjoy it."
good,I didn't have the opportunity to work Very long and it seems difficult to get rehired. However I would love to become a permanent member of the team at UPS given the opportunity.
good,UPS is a fast past environment that focus on making to package are deliver by the end on the shift. It is also a team oriented work place. I enjoyed working there.
good,They have a lot of work to do in terms of organizing their personal vehicle driver program in terms of keeping track of hours and mileage and as well as requirements for vehicle usage for example no vehicle shorter than the height of a minivan or a truck would be a good place to start otherwise it opens up room for injuries .  Also my immediate supervisor was awesome but the facility manager seemed very standoffish with people that he wasn’t comfortable and familiar with .for injuries
good,"Managers were given more responsibilities than they could handle."
good,"UPS gave me an opportunity & I it served us both well. I applied as seasonal part time (XMAS). When the season ended, there was not enough hours to be made for me @ the time."
good,"Very tough, most people drop in the first 2 weeks. the ones that stay are usually pretty solid workers. there is room to move up but you are better off keeping the job as an off hand money maker for third shift until you can get the driver position. that takes about one and a half to two years so be ready. that pay raise is worth it."
good,"The overall experience went very well during my employment there. The company culture was the most appeasing part of the job or else I would have left the company sooner. "
good,"At ups I worked the twilight shift which is only 4 hours, the job was simple but challenging I learned a lot of postcodes and quickly as you had to, to keep up with the products coming down the shoot for you to load, the management in the PD I worked was great we had a good team and kept the place clear most times however a lot of places in the warehouse did not and would get over run so we would have to go help other PD's, the hardest part was loading double decker wagons alone as you would receive parcels quickly and had no time to spare, the most enjoyable part was working with my team to get everything done."
good,This job didnt work out to well because of management at times didnt work well with the employees. At times i felt like an outcast with the other because of they thought i was trying tontake their job.
good,Job pays great but management doesn't hear employees out. They often don't keep their word. They can and often will overwork you. The benefits are amazing though.
good,Overall good company but pay is not that great.not enough hours offered and no overtime. Benefits however are well worth it.they also offer free forklift certs
good,A typical day included planning for the next day both in forecasting and then matching human capital to fit those needs to balance production and efficiency. This company taught me a great deal in my business acumen from logistics to strategic planning and human capital management. The most difficult part of the job was working the extended hours (80-100hrs/wk) during peak operations from Thanksgiving to Christmas and not receiving any compensation for the extra hours as a salaried employee. The most enjoyable part was the cohesiveness of the management team and the dedication and partnership that you had for each other.
good,When you work with UPS it is all about the company. Family isn't a priority and you do have to give your time no matter what. There are some managers that do understand certain emergencies and will be more flexible with that but you can see with the drivers as well that you do have to give your all to UPS. It is still a great beneficial company with the paid time off and the benefits that you do receive. If you are ok with not having much of a family life in the busy season it is a great place to work.
good,"I dealt with long days, mandatory overtime and threats of termination if I didnt complu. That just wasn't working out. I felt it best to part ways. I enjoyed my time working there, my employees and coworkers were great as I worked in management."
good,Management isn’t always great. Union is good but management really doesn’t like it. They are always hiring bc people are always in and out. It’s not an easy job. Be prepared to work hard. The insurance is great the work hours are great and the pay isn’t to bad.
good,"Part Time job 20-25 hours"
good,"It was a fine job because I was younger when I had it, my main concerns with it was the fact that I stood around a lot and did not get paid as much as I would expect to get paid working at a job like UPS."
good,"I’m currently working at ups, they have good benefits for health and more.  Once you work your first year at ups, you will obtain your benefits. Such as paid holidays, vacations weeks, and health insurance."
good,"Management quality varies by location for professional services. I’ve had my experience with two different managers/supervisors. Both management styles are different, on one hand the manger cared about you improving — on the other end they just cared about the work being done and not necessarily what you’d like to do for career advancement or personal advancements."
good,"ups was a very faced paced job, consistent  with the packages. I've learned how to multitask, in a fast paced environment. Staff and management was always helpful."
good,"Working at UPS I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a seasonal employee helping drivers complete delivery routes, I found it engaging and informative to work the handheld scanners, interact with customers and learn about route planning to manage pickups as well as deliveries. Working in the warehouse as a package handler was fast paced and physically demanding, it left me with a sense of satisfaction at the end of the night when I would see the trailers I was responsible for loading full."
good,Needs better managers who communicate with each other! One manager will ask you to do something and then another manager comes and asks you why are you doing that? And instructs you to do something else and then the 1st manager comes back and asks you what’re you doing? Who told you to do that? I feel like going home and telling both of them to do it themselves.
good,"Working for UPS was a fun yet hard job. I learned how to stack boxes correctly, unload boxers and load boxers. It was also a good job working on my communications skills."
good,"Management is terrible, hours were low, good part time job, benefits are there, will do you wrong, didnt seem to fit in there, need better hours, needing a job"
good,This is a job typically for a high-school student. Very fast paced and stressful to meet deadlines. Low pay and difficult to advance. Will force you to have tough-skin because of how upper management will treat its lower level workers.
good,Overhead management was awful. Every day was stressful to meet numbers based on production from the year before. Inside employees have to deal with extreme temperatures from hot in the summer to freezing in the winter
good,Everything is driver error. You’re set up for failure. Individual bargaining  is daily. If you’re on the safety committee you have a six hour dispatch. They start your termination at 20 years of service.
good,"There were some really nice people there and some others who were very cold. My manager gave my position to his son.  It was a temp to hire but, when your dad is the manager. Well. There could have been room for advancement."
good,"I worked late night shifts while loading the trucks in a concise and even manner, but being prompt and to stay ahead of schedule on every single shipment."
good,I think it was my fellow employees and the union that made working at UPS a lot easier. The health conditions were deplorable and some workers are in so much stress due to the management screaming and disrespecting them.
good,"Great pay, long hours, no recognition, upper management only carrying about numbers, a CYA political type of environment, and no accountability for the Union employees."
good,"A typical day I get the lineup, make sure the trucks are setup according to the lineup.  Then assign people to each work area and make sure they have supplies.  "
good,"is a part time who require the energy of a full time job... so in 3,5 hours you are tired as if you work full time... but you get just part time salary."
good,There was a lot of preference among seniority level of other workees. Never could talk to my manager about an issue with out everyone else in the waeehouse already knowing what my subject of discussion was with him.
good,"Fast paced, fun work delivering packages directly to the customer. People are so nice when they finally see their orders shipped to their doorstep. Fulfilling work role for the people person."
good,"The most fast paced job I have ever had. They literally expect you to R-U-N run constantly throughout the day. Pay is good. Most of the time management is unorganized, unprofessional, and will blame you if anything goes wrong AND IT WILL!! even if its not your fault. If you can manage all the craziness/turmoil and hold your own when people are getting in your face this might be the place for you."
good,"The jobs in the factory are quite physical. They advertise it as ‘free gym’. If your an aspiring weight lifter or a young person going college or university this would be good money on the part time night or preload shift. If your over 50 there’s no point applying unless you want a heart attack. It’s hard graft on the manual sort system. Once you get promoted and get sent out of the factory the load gets lighter. It’s less physical but you don’t see much increase in your salary until you go on the mapp management programme or package car driving which is hard to get onto due to everyone wanting to get into it."
good,"You cannot change from part to full time status with UPS unless maybe you quit, recent contract with union still only 1 dollar increase per year, raises slim to none, transfers do not guarantee a job at the other end, most HR do not understand the process for transfers and do not help, you lose seniority if you move locations, almost everywhere else pays more, other places allow for advancement more than once a year i.e. great job if you work there 35 yrs but not so great if just start"
good,"Good place to work. Fast paced,finish today what you start today. Pay is fair and benefits are top notch. The supervisors could definitely use more support from management."
good,"Société qui permet de relever ses propres défis"
good,Washing the trucks used to make deliveries  daily. When the return from their routes I wash and clean out the trucks as well as semi detailing them. Following specifics making sure the gas is filled and the truck is running a peak condition. Check for packages left for return or left behind. Making sure all lights and hazards are working as well as the horn and signals. 7
good,"Its very hard to sum up UPS with words. The hardest part of the job IS the job. This is NOT a job for the weak minded nor the workaholic. You need a unique skill set to become an exceptional UPSer. With that being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you moved over 60, 000 packages in a few hours while the rest of the world turns."
good,"Strenuous physical labor. Your physical and mental skills will be tested daily."
good,co-workers were decent but the job was slow. Hours were good to okay. The job was easy to a fault. Did as they asked & enjoyed my time there while it lasted.
good,Stressful  job and the manager is always pushy..very strict with the hours and if you work slow they send you home early which haooen to many coworkers.
good,"Work was great if you're a college student. management could've been better, i personally didn't like how the hours were set up. overall i would work there again"
good,Being a package handler or is a lot of labor if you aren't prepared for pain everyday this isn't the job for you. I enjoyed my time there but then work became bland and the money wasn't good enough for me.
good,"Since working here I’ve learned being safe is the number one priority to longevity as a driver in UPS . Everyday is a challenge here, you go out some days with a completely full truck of packages it’s like literally finding a needle in a Haystack.  One thing I can say is that you will gain valuable experience working here if you decide to continue with the company. Once you deliver with UPS you can deliver anywhere."
good,When I got on at ups it wasn't a good experience they provided no training just threw me in the factory and I had to figure it out on my own. I just needed money I knew I wouldn't make it a career
good,"It was fun working for UPS but for the holidays out pay should have been better than 10.36 an hour also it was freezing and very cold and icy, thats why i think our pay should have been greater especially for it being the holidays.  The job wasn't to bad otherwise"
good,"At UPS, I have met many wonderful people and have mastered many skillsets. However, management often bends protocol and lacks consistency. As a result, employees lack morale and goals are not met."
good,"Management are not very intelligent and too relaxed. Many people do not do there job, to include management, and yet they still have a job. People are quick to blame others. Drivers get paid amazingbut the loafers and local sort get paid lousy for all the hard work they do. Advancement is based on seniority even if the person sucks at their job. There is a union so there are good benefits. Communication is very poor!!!!!! If employed there, be ready to not work much as a part timer until other people leave. Christmas time is the only time guaranteed to work a lot and to work 5 days a week. Otherwise based on volume"
good,"Honestly don’t recommend it if you want to be happy with your life: certain areas you work in are terrible compared to others, but if you decide to work there pray ypu work on the pd-1/2 best work areas and management ."
good,"work environment is fast paced and can be stressful. Management isn't always the best and pay should certainly be increased. However,  the health insurance is impeccable."
good,I can't even explain how shocked I was by the things they made us do that where not in my job discription I just think peace and love and happiness. Try to stay positive and just look for better
good,"The job was all over the place. Bad management, short break time and dirty workplace. The crew made the time go by while working, but the job was still stressful. The pay is terrible for the amount of work you do."
good,"every things okay but I would like  more hours and better pay, I come in on time and everything and do my job to the fullest and have been there for seven and half years and haven't went beyond 15 dollars."
good,The work pace varied throughout the day from struggling to find something productive to do while customers weren't there to controlling the crowd of customers who wanted to ship large items but did not want to buy the large boxes. Management was great and the workers were always positive.
good,I really don’t have anything to say  I really like the company it was a good place to work at I really enjoyed everything bout it . I learn so much from working there .
good,They take care of your school so long as you maintain C average and give you GREAT healthcare but will flaunt Full Time Management and not consider you when a position opens. Very demanding as well. The job will become your life.
good,Very good job ‘ but supervisors are very disrespectful ‘ good benefits ‘ good pay’ but you of to be in the job for 4years to start making good money..
good,"Working in UPS's IT department is good if you are starting fresh out of college - a starting salary in the $50K+ and annual bonus (stock and cash after a year so). If you have any experience working outside, get in at the highest level you can - once you are in, you will be locked in their HR advancement-promotion hierarchy, so don't take a position for which you are overqualified unless you really need a job and are OK with going through a rather lengthy wait to advance. Granted, there's a wave of retirements coming up, so this may change. It hasn't changed soon enough for me."
good,UPS provided a good working environment.  Very fast paced with good communications between the functions within.  Very professional with all employees.
good,I worked for UPS for almost 3yrs...the environment was alright. The hours where excellent during peak season. The pay is average I jus wish they would give more than a 0.50-0.75 pay increase. The part time hours are great but full time is needed and only available to seniority employees.
good,"Half the time of the work day there is always surprise loads. "
good,Unloading trailers was a very physical job. Its like you get paid to work out. I liked the job very much. Management was really cool. Highly recommend this job for part time employment seekers.
good,"a typical day at ups is stressful and fast paced. though while i was there, my reflexes are sharper from moving so quickly all that time. the management was very understanding until it came time to work, almost ever tip they give you about making it easier, they end up just ignoring it. the hardest part to me was keeping up with the speed sometimes. the most enjoyable part was that i got to work in trailers with other co workers sometimes, so it wasn't too tough all the time."
good,The main reason to work here is because of the benefits and the compensation through tuition reimbursement that was received as a student. Management only focuses on the drivers and never gave the position I worked in any acknowledgment or the basic equipment upgrades that are necessary for completing the tasks daily.
good,Too many hours required for management and hourly employees. All that matters is production numbers and making sure they have done everything possible to make it your fault if you get hurt or in a crash.
good,Work is fine a lot of building in Hebron at Kentucky but some of them bad poor management but I don’t know exactly because rarely we see the manager at ups the place is fine
good,You are always in a hurry to deliver packages as well as driving around in a package truck with no AC.  Supervisor was always making me work overtime because I would finish my route too fast.  She would send me back out on the road.
good,good pay. extremely long hours. no work-life balance. Decent stock options. Above average health/dental/vision insurance.  Unrealistic expectations...
good,"Due to the part time nature of the shifts at UPS,  any employees are only going to benefit from working there if you either work a split shift, or only require a a part time wage as the shifts are only 3 hours long on 2 out of 3 of the available shifts. Not ideal for most."
good,"Great place to work, good pay. Long hours. Need to be organized and focused when working. Must obtain DOT Medical card. Work days very, some days are short others extremely long."
good,They would send me to meet a driver and the driver would never show up. I only met a driver twice. I wouldn't recommend this jib unless its a permanent position.
good,It’s a good company to work for in terms of benefits but working in there is fast paced and not everyone is cut out for it. It’s very good in terms of when you work because you got the rest of the day to do other activities
good,"Working for UPS has been a true experience,  I have learned so much through my co-workers regarding:  management, problem solving, teamsters, timelines, production and many others area's.  While I am currently employed at UPS, the one item to consider moving is no advancement in the company especially in an extended center as I am.  As well,  the pension has been cut for supervisor positions if worked less than 20 years."
good,"Although UPS has many avenues for advancement the culture of the company and its management's attitudes are unsatisfactory. I learned a lot, but the experience was definitely what you made it. Many of the people on the management team are not ones to create a learning or enlightening atmosphere."
good,"I had an awesome time working there, but i did not get treated fairly during the periods of max capacity. Other than, I also feel that i did not get compensated fairly enough for the work that I did"
good,"I work pre load which is the 3am shift. It is very inconsistent when it comes to hours. They give everyone a start time then they once you arrive they start sending employees home if they are fully staffed.  But they send you home based on seniority.  I took the test to become a supervisor and passed it and they have been telling me and four others who are on the bench to promote that its gonna happen next week for the past three months now."
good,If you dont mind being away from your family its a graeat job especially for a single person..The pay is great and the benefits are great but ups owns you..
good,Monotonous job. Good job if you like to break your back or if you know somebody to move up in the company quick. Always something to do and supervisors love to micromanage.
good,"Ok place to work if you can be there long enough to earn seniority.  Very physical place to work, requires being in shape, plenty of lifting of heavy packages.  Stressful at times."
good,"I was a loader at ups and it was no joke, I was loading 3 trailers every afternoon. Everything is fast pace ,have no time to relax and you don't have a set time to get out, there were days that you would work 3 hours and day you work 5."
good,It was a great company to work for at first due tho the holiday season. But after the new year we were lucky to work 5 hours a day for 2 days a week because they dropped the staffing so dramatically. It got to the point where you'd show up to work every day just for them to tell you that they cant use you. Multiple coworkers of mine have quit due to the lack of hours. So ups is a great company to work for when they're actually busy. During the holiday season
good,I worked as a Temp to Hire for 6 Months.. UPS was great 👍. It was The Temp agency that would not be more truthful... for now reseason the told me that my time was expired.
good,It was a fun job at the beginning but I believe it was just because I was a kid looking for a job and i did sustain an injury while working there but it wasn't noticeable until I got checked at a chiropractor.
good,"Long Hours"
good,This job is only beneficial if you need a nice second job and can work short/long hours with great benefits. This is not a job you would want as a primary job being a part time supervisor and have to pay for benefits. You will not see your weekly check while paying these benefits.
good,"slow growth, you get to learn how to use different equipments, most of the time busy, people are friendly, you have to multitask at work like making shipment and fax for someone then print for others etc."
good,"Very fast-paced and, at times, stressful.  Ability to multi-task is a must.  There is great learning potential and training.  I enjoy the fact that there is a wide variety of functions within my job category."
good,"I did not work at UPS! I work at The Ups STORE! They are two different businesses! "
good,"I intended on working at UPS for a long time and they worked me around 47 hours during the holiday week. This was great considering the holiday week was the first week I worked, however, this was the ONLY week I worked. I've been on payroll for nearly 2 months now and I am still NOT on the schedule. I call 2-3 times a night (between 3am-4:30am) just to hear that they don't need me or that there is not enough work for me to come in. Very, very irritating. I walked into UPS thinking I would get consistent hours, but this was not the case."
good,there is was to much favoritism at UPS. it seems no matter how hard you work they will pick someone over you or pay them more money. someone who is a grade under you should not make more money then then you. very unfair.
good,"Fast paste job that requires a lot of physical activity. Very cold winters and very hot summers in the building. Only work about 3 hours a day. The faster you unload your trucks the sooner you get to leave, the less you get paid. You are heavily encouraged to unload trucks as fast as possible, but then you do not get paid as much."
good,"Challenging , a lot of duties tasks, stressful environment sometimes, but over all good work place very busy place. The hardest part of this job are customers sometimes you explain and repeat urself over and over and for some odd reason they get angry and start arguing"
good,"UPS is what you would expect from any low wage factory job. The work is often times grueling, the managers will overlap and outright not communicate with one another, and you'll be wondering if you could do a better job given that role. "
good,"Come in when expected and just straight to packaging boxes into the delivery trucks. You have to be fast-paced, or you will slow others in the process. You have to to get enough sleep, especially if you're working graveyard shifts."
good,Day starts at 7:30am and ends at 11:30pm or later.  You are responsible for the drivers which mean you are there until the last driver comes in. Your salary is good for an 8 hour day or 40 hour work week but a normal work week is 60 to 70 hours a week.
good,It was okay. The management was not great and environment felt kind of toxic. The lady I work with was really nice but everyone complained every day but I guess that's most jobs now in days.
good,The paid training lasted a week and felt like a waste of time. The experience of what we learned on the job was completely different than what we focused on in the training class.
good,"Decent compensation, would frequently mess up paychecks. Work was stressful if you were able to move to their liking which I was and they would try to abuse my speed and skill so I would do and work harder than more than many others"
good,my job was seasonal but they work you to death. you can move up in the company but must be there for a long time to ever see any advancement. part time only
good,"I enjoyed my time at ups. It was a good part time job to have while going to school, and if you work nights you can get you’re college tuition paid for. Management is usually always young so in my experience it’s typically a young supervisor that chills on their phone the majority of your shift unless you filled up your can and it needs to be re-spotted and the admin takes care of 90% of the work. I really only left because I wasn’t getting that many hours and I needed more money. Other than that if you can get into a good area and make a career out of the job then it’s a decent job"
good,"UPS has been around for a very long time. As such, processes and culture are outdated. When charges are made, it is for the bottomline,   and usually has a negative effect on employees. Time to enter the 21 century."
good,The only good thing currently about UPS is the pay and benefits. Work conditions are on the harsh side but if you get used to them. Management doesn't have much training and does not communicate well. Even with high seniority and dedication it is extremely difficult to advance.
good,"sometimes we would get very few packages and it would be a slow 2 hour day, sometimes we would be full and it would be a very quick moving day of 4-6 hours."
good,"Usually the day starts around 2:30 am, learned how to properly load trucks and optimize space and time, making sure all is done accordingly to Driver's schedule. Control belt, avoiding jams, picking packages and double checking delivery area, sorted by the zip code. Managers are mostly supervisors, assisting with technical issues. "
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. It's alot like family here. Obviously, even with family there will be disagreements and arguments. But, as a whole, we try to keep our offices light - hearted and easy going. Its a fast paced environment and you could easily get swallowed by it or overwhelmed. But, treating each other with respect and making work fun is how we get by."
good,Bonne entreprise dans la globalité avec une culture d'entreprise importante
good,"Good job for someone starting out with minimal skills. The work can be difficult, but it is very rewarding. The pay could be better for how difficult the work is, but the benefits kind of make up for the lack of pay."
good,"very demanding, fast paced, long hours, good pay and benefits, not many holidays off, Christmas time extremely long days, teaches you about safety, great way to stay fit"
good,Liked the job and working with customers. Typical office environment with it's ups and downs. Challenging and rewarding type of work. Enjoyed getting to learn news things
good,There oknto work for as long as you’re not loading or unloading a trailer. Heard they just did a pay raise and actually give people hours now so nobody can really complain compared to how it use to be
good,"Management is alright depending on who you talk to"
good,het was een gezellig sfeervol bedrijf in het warehouse
good,This is a job for people who wanna get a work out and don't mind being treated like a dog. First day yesterday and at the end of the shift the manager came in screaming and spitting saying nobody is leaving. Worked eight hours straight and only got a 10 minute break. Pretty sure this is illegal in Florida. Previously worked at Home Depot and after 6 hours you get at least a 30 minute lunch and a 10 minute break.
good,"The problem with UPS is “nobody ever leaves” so to speak. So full time advancement in meaningful regions are slow. Often overall function is chaotic however, and the presssure that causes isn’t for the faint of heart."
good,"Job is very stressful, they are all about the numbers in Rating shipments.....Always want you at work to help get the job done but as soon as you have an emergency it becomes a big deal....some Supervisors run they mouth talking about some of their employees to other employees but always hollering team work...Okay, Pay but not worth the headache.....They tell you to apply for other positions inside the company to advance your career and that position offered better hours and increase rate of pay but hard to get you remain stuck in your current position....Had I known I would have stayed at my previous job"
good,I was an unloader it was a good job too for a workout you have to be prepared for things like that and i am at all times i want to come back if its possible
good,"The Sales Associate position is a pretty good step into retail, this particular store has a lot of different duties to perform but it gets easy to get into the swing of things after a month and if you actually take initiative to do so. "
good,Company with a strong culture and history. It is a fairly challenging environment primarily driven by financial goals. They recently made the work environment a bit more relaxing.
good,"Competitive and fast paced.Make sure you push yourself to work faster so you aren't written up. Also, remember to stay hydrated. Proper hydration is very important."
good,It was okay working with ups they had a nice driver that was teaching me a lot and we where getting the work done on time and we did it as safe as possible even with the weather
good,"Ups is not that bad of a place to work for someone young and in college, the hours are sometimes cut and the work is very fast paced and output driven. unloading 40-foot trucks packed to the gills with boxes weighing up to 6olbs and having to get it done in an hour will take its toll on you after a while. Managers were rude also, but I guess that's because there are so many managers that the buck had to get passed somehow. overall a job is a job."
good,Working at this establishment is good if you like to go to the gym and get paid to do so in fact that was there motto. It was a very competitive environment that keeps your brains and muscles constantly working.
good,"Although UPS have a lot of great opportunities. Patience is key there. The main issue their is management and communication. Effective communication is not there, and lack of respect, which can make the job harder than it has to be."
good,It's a good place to work if you're made for it and if your good at moving at a quick pace and not slowing down but if you work there long enough there are good benefits it depends if you want to do it
good,"UPS compensates very well.  Those working for UPS both in an Hourly and Management position face high demands, and for the compensation that is fair.  One has to be very strong and flexible to work for this company.  A typical day can range from 9 to 13 hours.  The experience that I have gained in my 40 years is priceless.  I have learned how to do almost any aspect of a Management job.  My work experience has given me the opportunity to learn and participate in Human Resources, Automotive, Security, Operations and more.  It has given me the opportunity to gain a very broad aspect and acumen of all aspects of the business.  My relocations; Chicago, South Illinois, Indianapolis, Salt Lake City and New York has given me an opportunity to learn to manage people from different cultures."
good,It’s a good job but very hard on families. It can be a way to retirement if u are willing to play the games they require to get a decent day. It is a overall good job and can provide security for a person
good,"A lot of ego management and workers self afflicted with entitlement because of Teamsters. Workers would do just enough and file complaints on anything they felt like. I didn't quit UPS, I quit the Boss."
good,"It has great benefits as well as good pay , I enjoyed working at ups temporarily. We had 30 minutes for lunch , which was more than enough time, and there was also snack and drink vending machines"
good,Job is good to have for benefits besides that you're going to work extremely hard and its very hard to advance with UPS as an employee. As a supervisor you have more of a chance.
good,this was a very fast paced job and very young co workers which in some seance was ok but yet challenging at times nevertheless was very interesting and self reflecting on some accounts
good,building walls was one of the most tedious things i have done. the flow was to fast and no one at that job could honestly keep up with the conveyor belt.
good,"Working at UPS was fairly good . I could keep up and handle the packages into the trailers threw out the whole shift . The difficulty part is the bigger boxes where heavier to move. "
good,The job isn't difficult the management was a bit difficult to handle and at times they didn't respect your hours or respect if you had other priorities outside of work.
good,"Supervision was inexperienced, the pay was insufficient for the amount of work needed to complete daily duties, they system of sorting wasnt efficient."
good,Good job for those who like to work hard but very unorganized. They did promotions for new hires and like 90% of them were not getting paid correctly. Plus if you work hard in early stages they will push you to the absolute limit and throw you into horrible situations and expect you to clean them up and then get on you about not doing a good enough job. Overall not good enough pay for the work you do and they treat you subpar
good,Normally we would start our day by having a safety meeting in the morning. Review our route before we leave our building. Then deliver packages quickly and  safely.
good,"Been working here almost a month, I personally like and enjoy the job. Although I think the salary needs to be booted up a bit more for the amount of work all the employees do. Co workers are friendly and helpful. Manager is great. Looking to move up a position or receive a promotion hopefully. The holidays that we do have off we are not paid for them which is a bit of a problem and the holidays we do work overtime is not provided."
good,"You have to be on time everyday, can not miss more than three days and you have to be very quick while working or the manager will approach you about the numbers of books you have not scan."
good,Everyday delivering items to the collect places of businesses are residential homes. You to meet different people and visit places you never been. Sometimes if you drive in an truck that doesn't have air conditioning at times it could get frustrating but you learn to get use to it.
good,"Lots of full time supervisors telling you different stories ."
good,"I work for UPS-SCS however I am on-site at Bombardier transportation. "
good,I began putting boxes on a flat loading belt work my way up as I monitored the belt in kept putting more package on there had to make sure the machines never jammed
good,"There are many job opportunities at UPS ranging from loaders, baggers, sorters. Most employees will have the chance to offload as well as load a tractor trailer teamwork is a definite to get the job done."
good,"We go through maybe 3 people every week and only hire about 4 a week, and of those 4 only 2 usually stay. The production numbers are too high to hit with the constant stream of new hires, and even if you start to hit it they just raise it to make you look bad again."
good,Work can often times be challenging. The repetive day to day grind can be soul crushing. Mamagement is hit or miss Overall the benefits are the main factor for working there.
good,Ups is a good place to work part time but cannot be your only job if you have your own place and other bills to pay. If you choose to work here you will be happy
good,"Good job experience for your resume, but too stressful to handle. Our building specifically is too small to handle our volume so every night was a constant fight to meet the minimum production goals."
good,Not much room for growth in the company doing seasonal work. Not much communication with the management team. You can meet good people working for this company.
good,Very demanding and restrictive.  Pay and benefits are good.  This is a job that the company always makes you feel like you're about to be fired for anything you do wrong.  There's no grace for beginners if you have an accident.
good,"One can learn about the world and as to how things need to be executed in regards to problem solving and  logistics and take away a lot from this type of a company and the culture that comes with it while under pressure. It all depends upon ones attitude."
good,Very fast paced.  Little room for error.  Must be good at quickly fitting boxes like a puzzle from floor of truck to ceiling. No air conditioning and trucks get very hot sitting all day in parking lot.
good,"If you don't mind working hard ,with tight deadlines and long hours this is the job for you. Pays well, decent benefits and pension. "
good,"This job was a lot of hard work, dedication, and patience. i was a seasonal worker working during the Christmas holidays, so i was busy busy busy, but truthfully i really did enjoy it. i enoyed seeing the smiles on people faces when they seen me coming towards thier door. who doesnt get excited for a package?!"
good,however it feels outside it is worse once you step inside.  When it is a heat wave going on you are bound to get sick to your stomach and it makes it difficult to work
good,Overall a good place to work. It can be difficult o advance if you are in a smaller location and not able to relocate. The people support one another and the atmosphere is typically fast paced but cooperative.
good,Overall the place isn't terrible to work at. The work isn't difficult but it's not lazy work either. The full time managers aren't the greatest but there's been a recent change in that chain so hopefully it improves.
good,They work you hard and expect nothing but the best. Make You earn your wage and benefits. They micromanage and your route varies daily by the amount of stops they expect you to deliver. One good thing is co workers become like family to you.
good,I would go in everyday and work as hard as I could but was never recognized. Pushed hard to make sure thinks were done correctly and efficiently as for five months they lingered the motive of promoting me to management. Once time came that they promised promotion I was told I was not getting the promotion. Now that we have more employees and it is not longer understaffed I am forgotten by all of my management and not even talked to anymore.
good,"Hard work , Non-stop movement carrying boxes over 50-70 lbs not the easiest JOB recommend if its you're only option. Heavy Lifting and poor communication skills"
good,"I worked 5 hours a day for 5 days straight. No time off, no breaks but water and bathroom but they were short. My Package Sorting Average Was 900 Packages A Hour."
good,What keeps me motivated to work at UPS are the health benefits. I believe their health benefits are one of the best I have had with a company. The company also offer awesome discounts for various of things.
good,"Getting use to the work load is easy, but the environment can become negative through bad management. The benefits are great, and you don't have to pay for them, but the waged need to be raised for the work that you do."
good,"Ups wasn’t really a good place to work at. The pay wasn’t worth staying there and working there. The management was bad and they didn’t really care about the workers, the supervisors would make us work much more than we needed and they would keep us late and pick up for the next workers to come"
good,"At UPS in College Station Texas, Usually understaffed for work load. Supervisors were great, upper management was oblivious to issues and did not enforce rules well. Only got around 16 hours a week but that is the nature of part time at UPS. Other employees who had been at the same position for 5 or 6+ years had issues moving up in the company due to the terrible scheduling and lack of effort put in by upper management. Supervisors were good at acknowledging hard working individuals though they did not have many means to reward those individuals. Environment was relaxed, safety was a big part of the focus every week. If working part time, UPS alone is not really enough to comfortably live. Unless you can live on roughly $800.00 a month."
good,You're either working in unload or loading the trucks. Unload is 100% physical no brains needed. Very tiring. Loading is 90% brains depending on the set you're assigned. Managers are not allowed to help load and they will stare at you when you're completely stacked out.
good,i was the only mechanic and manager would ask to move you around all the time but it was a good job if you like working nights or the swing shift. pay is good every friday and they will work you 10-14 hrs between thanksgiving and xmas.
good,"As a salaried employee, your day is never over.  Whether you are being contacted regarding customer questions and concerns, operational needs, employee needs or concerns, or a number of other issues, you must always remain available."
good,It's not the best job however it's a job until I can find a better one. The location I work at is horrible. No room for real advancement. Good benifits but the job is not something I wanna do forever
good,Management has gone down hill. They basically do what they want and don't always follow procedures.  It's a great job to have during peak season from the week before Thanksgiving to the week after Christmas. Hourly are able to work as many hours as desired. Summertime work is unbearable the work conditions are harsh in the warehouse. Ups keep employees mainly because of their benefits.
good,Paid for my tuition and kept me from starving. I definitely am glad that I had UPS in my life. The culture and environment is rough. Being a warehouse job it is not that bad.
good,Very fast paced push push push not for everyone benefits are good everything is timed and tracked by diad  tool for metrics. physical job really a young mans job but appears to be a good company no nonsense management very short and abrasive at times. told you need to have tough skin to last.
good,"Start off by reviewing reports from previous day and evaluate those reports with the management team and discuss that days dispatch plans. Then talk with drivers about certain exceptions from previous day and try to recognize someone who may have did a  nice job from the day before. Time did not always provide opportunity to recognize those who should have been recognized. After, Would have to get on car with diver's to either complete annual safety training or complete performance or training rides and then upon return back to facility would have to complete paperwork. The culture is very driven by how the employees respect or do not respect their management team. Management teams who have a good standing with their employees would reflect in the results those drivers gave back. Those management teams with poor results usually revolved around center teams that lost the respect of those whom they manage. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the long hours and low sense of appreciation of a job well done. Never was recognized for a job well done even when my center team was # 1 and # 2 on the balance score cards 2 years running. Most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships made along the way and the sense of accomplishment when those I trained over the years took on more challenging roles either amongst their driver peers or supervisors whom took on roles of upper management."
good,"Bait & switch. "
good,If your physically fit the job is fine and able to lift every second you are on the clock than you are capable of working for ups but in my opinion and from my experience working there its just not worth it the amount of work you put in there and what your pay check comes out to be just doesn't add up  and  that 15 minutes break feels like 5 minutes
good,Very hard to get promoted if you are not on anyone radar. Flexible work hours and nice people to work with. UPS try to be competitive with the pay for the new hires.
good,A very fast paced place to work. Takes a lot of grind and it’s hot in the summer in the warehouse and very cold in the winter. Good benefits after 1 year of being employed
good,I would load the back of a truck and stack boxes into it.  The job was physically demanding and at times unsafe and the compensation was barely worth it.  But there was opportunity to advance/ get paid more.
good,"I would check in and I had one of the heavier doors. I had to move packages build walls air tight in the truck trailers. I would have to be moving fast, and ofter the rate of boxes that come is too fast. We would be moving for two hours straight usually  and take a 15 min break then we keep going until we get everything."
good,"This was a seasonal position which is very physical in nature, I was actually offered a Supervisory Position but it would have been limited to a seasonal role."
good,It’s a great job for someone out of high school but if you don’t want to be a driver or anything for the company. Then it’s hard to grow and they won’t help you get more any quick. You have to wait for positions to open and then apply for them in a list of experience. Which for anyone new is hard to grow and anything outside of a basic preloader you don’t have the union anymore.
good,If you can’t move heavy things do not apply here. We receive packages anywhere from 2 pounds up to 200. It is very fast paced work so if you don’t like doing something at all times then this job is not for you.
good,After doing told I did a great job during the Holiday season was interviewed for a permanent job and was told I got this job.  Then never heard from them again.
good,"management can be hit or miss, one day they are on top of their game the next its like they are not even there. But if you are willing to work hard and stick it out, you could become a driver and make some serious money."
good,"Keep delivering until your truck is empty and fill it up with your pick ups.  There are no fans in the truck in the summer.  The cargo area of the truck gets to be over 140 degrees. The days are long, hot and exhausting.  You have deadlines all day long."
good,"UPS is a stressful and very hard environment to work in, the management is not really helpful to the supervision staff, and there are unlikely to be any changes in the way that they handle situations."
good,"Good to do for educational assistance.  Has become a company of numbers vs. Service. Not a bad place to work for as a union member, would not recommend management"
good,During the little hrs you worked there. They made you do the twice the work in half the time. They worked you way too hard. After a year of working there I couldn't do it anymore
good,"Checking and following up on emails. "
good,"I worked for UPS for many years and believed I would retire a UPSer. The long hours and management by exception mentality takes it toll on all employees. Many are unhappy and would be more productive if it was truly a ""family"" or ""people first"" attitude as the founder had always desired."
good,UPS was a difficult environment to work in. It was very face paced and lacked care for employees and packages. The benefits they offered were the best you could find however.
good,honestly it wasnt really worth working at this specific location. the only thing that keeps the employees is the benefits and the long term career advancement that comes with seniority
good,"Working twilight shift which is from 5-10 pm, Monday through Friday, I realized that this gives little to no time for anything outside of work. After going to school all day it is straight from one to the other. This would be okay if I would work more than a max of 25 hours a week but thats just not possible at UPS unless you become a supervisor"
good,"Worked at the Worldport in Louisville, KY.  It's fast pace.  You never worked at the same station or building on a day-to-day basis.  constantly getting pulled to help someone else from another section that was too slow."
good,"Hard work. Staff is at a minimum so overtime is plenty. 60 hours a week is the maximum you can work by law and they will use all of these hours if you are a new driver."
good,"this is a labor intense job . the atmosphere is terrible . you must be constantly moving . no one is ever in a good mood unless its time to clock out ,"
good,"Nice workers but management rushes you treats you bad. They didnt let me use the restroom untill am hour after break, right after they fed me white castle."
good,High paced controlled place of employment.  Positively embraces the rules that DOT enforces on a daily basis. Benefits are extremely great.  Long hours.
good,"The job helped me to gain experience in customer service and satisfaction. The pay was fair considering it was only a seasonal position, and the management at the time was very easygoing and reasonable.;"
good,"As a starting unloader, I would arrive to my station and clock in. I would then stretch and find out what door I will be unloading first. Once you have started, you must unload as many packages onto the unloading belt as quick as possible, while still maintaining a safe work area. Once you finish the door you were on, you move onto another door."
good,Was told there were so many opportunities for advancement but in my 3 + years I have only seen one Part-Time supervisor be promoted. Total pay increase of .75 cents since becoming PT Supervisor over 3 years ago. From my understanding you have to do Part-Time Management before you can become Full-Time Management. The company wants you to scratch their back but hardly returns the favor. Any other position is decent.
good,The work-life hours are completely insane and unacceptable. This is supposed to be  I worked anywhere from 3-4 hours every day. Also i was responsible for ensuring that our customers' packages are handled safely and efficiently so they can arrive at their destination on time. There are a variety of shifts available to accommodate your
good,hired as part time package handler. hours were said to be 5 am to 9 am. But it was peak season when they hired me so the hours were crazy come to find out when i started. 1 am to 9 am one day then 10 pm to 9 am the next all ovr the place hours. i stuck it out as long as i could. wasnt for me
good,"Okay job, I didn't expect to much out of it. The owner was great he was understanding and honest. Management needed work, and my coworkers were lazy sometimes."
good,Worked for UPS for 29yrs. I started at an entry level position and worked my way up the ranks. Enjoyed my years with the company bt due to no work life balances I chose to move on and take care of my family. I worked a minimum of 12 to 15hrs days and most holidays.
good,managing your assigned queue. working daily reports to collect outstanding invoices. working to correct billing errors. Casual attire. Independent work.
good,"Incentives are pretty much given to newer hires. You can work the same hours but they may receive a monetary bonus in their check. Not quite fair."
good,A lot of people left because of the pay and found jobs else where for same work better benefits and pay. People were overall fun but seriously lacked motivation to go the extra mile
good,I have worked with United parcel service for 27 years.I was hired as a part time loader.I then was given an opportunity to deliver overnight packages on foot and eventually receive a driving position.
good,The typical work day included just about everything from the start of the morning until the very end of the day.  No two days were alike.  I miss my job here and would love to have it again.
good,each day would bring new challenges to the work place. a new thing to be shipped a new box to be built. a new menu to design. being in a mail center was a sometimes fun and challenging place to work.
good,"This company is divided against itself, union drivers verses non-union management. Don't join management!! you get no job security and benefits don't make up for it anymore. FedEx and Amazon and upstarts will eat this company alive. The union jobs are pretty good, but bloated payrolls of long term employees are bankrupting it and new employees get little. Stay away."
good,"Working inside the hub is very intensive labor extremely hot during the summer very cold during the winter. Parking is horrible, but it is a union job."
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,low pay as a seasonal/low hours makes it not worth the time.   call in 5days a week.  work 2 days.   Back breaking work should pay at least $20 per hour to start.
good,"Be thick skinned and don't take the atmosphere personal, no true business structure, racial challenges, high regard for the buddy system, have an appreciation for employment to stay focused ( my opinion is not for all centers/hubs/etc..speaking on my place of employment)"
good,"The work environment was very stressful.  Every employee was out for himself.  Management was not supportive"
good,The culture at this location is somewhat cultish. Constant propaganda by management. Call center. Hardest part of job is ignoring the propaganda. Staying motivated while being hovered over by managers. Upward mobility is possible if willing to relocate or if you are friends with the supervisors and managers.
good,"Great pay, but not a great job for someone who likes to see their family. Long hours and strenuous work. You will definitely be sore everyday and not have much energy to want to do anything."
good,We would have be at work starting a 4am we only worked 4hrs a day because it was so much strain on your body the pay suck those 4hrs of hard fast pace work is very stressful unloading for semi trucks filled within 30 mins
good,"Working at UPS brings out your potential to be constantly active and attentive to your work with the utmost care for your health and surroundings with others and communication. The hardest part of the job would be unloading trailers in a fast pace especially when there is an overload of heavy packages. In spite of that, the hardest part can actually be the easy and enjoyable part of the job once you get into the habit of unloading after 1-3 days performing and follow the procedures correctly."
good,"Loading trailers is a stressful job, a lot of labor work fast pace and slight teamwork. They expect you to load 53"" trailers to the top the packages can weigh up to 80+lbs i am usually in a trailer by myself and have to load 2-3 trucks a night."
good,"help out customers in shipping an item"
good,"Good place to work at for the young people with strong backs, dont recommend for older middle age people, its hard work but they pay your it. "
good,Shifts less than 5 hours. Responsible for 8-12 people at time. Responsible for processing packages that needed to be sorted to correct destination and paperwork
good,"Very cold warehouse no heating. Busy atmosphere, always on your toes . Adequate breaks, microwaves to warm food and vending machines . Some work colleagues are nice to work with."
good,"The job was real fast paste. Keeping up with the packages coming down the conveyor belt, especially coming down at top speed. Teamwork was always a fact."
good,Way to stressful.  There is a lot more put on you than seems likely that you can get done in one day.  A lot of things happen that's out of your control but you still have to be responsible for.
good,This  job will not for everybody. High demands on managers . I learn to manage with a iron heart. rapid deadlines with larger volumes can cause stress.
good,"It's mostly fun, it's really fast paced, everyone helps each other, somewhat decent hours. The workers are easy to talk to and very understanding and management is decent aswell"
good,"Lack of opportunities for career advancement. Benefits are not as good as used to be. Diversity is promoted thru Business Resources Groups, but few minorities on high level management."
good,I received what I thought was fair treatment by everyone at the company especially management.  Unfortunately their was very little opportunity for advancement.
good,Atypical day at UPS can be very productive. You are not guaranteed to do the job that was assigned to you. Most of the time you are required to stay over the time allowed without pay because of management running loads from the next shift or having to clean up the mess left by the previous shift. But the employees are so respectful and are willing to do their jobs to keep the problems down as well as get out of there and back to their families.
good,its great pay  very stressful cutthroat and and if they're not in your circle don't want to get rid of him but the guys you work with a real good you like to drivers but the bosses suck
good,"Generally easy job"
good,started as overnite. loved it but with ups you are a number.a very soulless company worried only about their image. forced overtime and no time to spend with your family.They throw money at you but you earn every penny.
good,"this is a great way into your first job. there are many advancement opportunities. Management are understanding and lenient. its a fast paced environment, you'll  always be moving"
good,Very fast paced which makes the day go by quickly however the work can be tiring and stressful on your body if your not used to that type of work. Most positions are union which give great benefits and job security. Management is not part of the union. Management does not clash well with the union employees. Most people are expecred to stand and move quickly for the majority of their shift. Many other employees lack incentive to work probably due to low pay therefore leaving most of the work being completed by a small number of employees.
good,"Ok, but could not get permanent position due to the fact I was seasonal help. I tried to apply for full time or part time, not hiring permanent employees"
good,"i like ups it’s just very far from where i live , the staff are nice but the work conditions are cold & tiring  , i like how we get paid weekly & the checks are nice"
good,"Understaffed and alot of cross training involved. Although a great team involved and friendly. "
good,sometimes getting your employees to work or come to work is the hardest part of the job. As a supervisor you are not allowed to work but are expected to when thing get backed up or a heavy flow day.
good,"I started working for UPS only for the benefits, as they are second to none.  As I moved up within the company, the benefits only got better and better!"
good,An otj injury was not supported. The attitude of management was dismissive and injury protocol was not followed. My return after the injury was difficult and criticized.
good,"No set hours it changes weekly, work environment was not great and it was back breaking for 10 dollars an hour. when you work in a cold place it suck, hands and body are frozen the whole time you are working."
good,"It is a good company to work if you do not have a family, as a full time driver you spend on the road an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, the other thing about UPS is that is 100% physical, with that you can have a negative impact on your body."
good,"I liked working at UPS, the only reason for me not being there now is because i had moved and the job was for the peak season. Overall the job was fun and i wound up learnin new experiences such as how to work certain tools on the workfield."
good,"This is my first time working for a union, it has its up and downs. Having protection is great, good benefits once you are fully invested in the union."
good,"I load packages from the chutes to the trailers. Any misplaced packages that were not intended to be loaded into the proper trailer, were gathered and bought to the load belt for re-entry."
good,"The workplace s very fast paced, the management is not the best. They put more workload on some employees and let others coast by with very little effort."
good,Fun fast paced environment will keep alert and physically fit although there is al lack of communication among management and most positions start part time only with an unknown time frame to be full time. Contract workers receive no benefits but permanent employees have excellent benefits including pension for union workers.
good,Your education is irrelevant. The longer you survive at UPS the better chance you have in advancing to full-time but it will take years. So if you decide to take a job with the company be prepared to live on a limited budget. Job is best for young people recently out of high school.
good,Typical day included riding along with driver to assist in delivering packages during the Christmas rush. I learned about how to schedule deliveries and select the best route for deliver. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the extreme cold in Vermont.The most enjoyable was the opportunity to be on the road..
good,not the best management but a good seasonal or part-time job overall. good job to have if you are a college student. immediate college assistance is available upon hire.
good,"Generally speaking, the culture at UPS is toxic. Employee safety is an afterthought. The hiring process has become less competitive. The management style is given to harassment and threats."
good,Training is very minimal for all managers. Sink or Swim. Great experience for any entry level manager that is looking to see all degrees and angles of what it takes to become a successful manager . Never Good enough for Upper Management. Stressful and lack of work/life balance. Fast paced and demanding hours that take its tole. Opens your eyes and makes one realize the importance of training and spending quality time with your Family!
good,"I did like the company, however the management was very rude and condescending. After being hurt on the job, the job became stressful and the management complained about every little thing I did wrong to ultimately fire me. I felt discrimination."
good,As a driver it's a well paid stressful job. You leave the building with a truck literally packed to the gills with parcels and some how have to make it back to the building in time to drop off your express packages in order for them to reach the airport in time. All the while having no where to go to the toilet. Say goodbye to your social life!
good,"NO type of respect from management!! You are just an employee number, you can be replaced with another one. You do your job safely and productive to get home to your family at a descent time and all they do is put more wore on you the next day."
good,"Process information on invoices to be sent to CBP programs"
good,"A typical day at UPS is fast paced and high stress. Multi tasking is part of the job. "
good,"It was a very stressful job. You would rush to get things done at a specific time, on top of doing what's expected of you. You must be able to multi task x's five. Not a job for the lazy"
good,"Started   working as picker  for specific branch,work load  became slow and hours were  not available. .transferred  to several different campus locations which was un  organized   ..no leadership. .and unexpected  heavier  items. ."
good,The experience was. Good just not enough hours love working in fast paced love workin with others an explore new work place an I enjoyed the pay an trying to advance at my job
good,"Responsible for accepting packages and objects for shipment"
good,Very top down culture. Decisions are made at the top management levels. Management hours are very long. Healthcare benefits and post career benefits are great.
good,A great work place for someone looking to gain experience working in a fast paced team environment that provides great benefits once you gain entry to the Teamsters Union.
good,My review ratings may not have been expected due to my current living situation at the time. Was fresh out of high school had another job as well as full time school work and still living on my own independently.
good,The supervisors try but the management is harsh and insensitive. Long Hours and the work is hard but rewarding. They have healthcare and tuition assistance.
good,"A very cut throat job that overtakes ones personal life. A extremely competitive job that demands a lot of mental fortitude. I loved the way corporate treated its employees, It is the local management that needs of dire attention."
good,"Its not a terrible place to work, especially for the health benefits. Fast demanding pace under very hot conditions in the summer and cold in the winter."
good,Extra tall structure with dysfunctional aged management organization.  Trying to maintain 100 year old business rules within today's business culture.
good,"On your feet for more than 8 hours. Very fast paced environment. Poor management, very unorganized, 30 minute break when you work 6 hours. Inconsiderable, man I can go on for hours"
good,Lots of work on the body for minimal pay. The people are good to you but the job is not worth the overall stress. Takes too long to get a driver job which is the real gold mine.
good,"They don't pay quite what I think the labor is worth, and they keep most employees at part time that way you won't get benefits until you've been there a year. Very hard to get extra hours (Overtime)."
good,They took ages paying my wages so therefore I had to leave my position here just to get paid I think it was because I was young they took advantage and I couldn’t stand back and be taken around the corner
good,This job was really time consuming. I could really balance the 5 days a week because I got to school. I would usually go home not being able to wake up for class.
good,In the past few years changes were made up and didn't feel comfortable with it try to make changes but denied it. Got hert outside of ups and after getting recovery  put back on the same heavy lifting I was working before the engendy
good,It Was A Good First Job For Me Because It Was Basic And Comman Sense .Its was a seasonal job so there was little hours and I barely had to work but the checks were decnt.
good,"The work environment was good, but although we were told we were permanent employees, we wound up closing our location and being laid off. Our job was to clear out that location."
good,"UPS would be a great company to build a future and career in if you don't have much education or job experience. But unfortunately I worked under next to terrible management, so I decided it wasn't the path for me.  If you are fortunate enough to get a good management team the company could really change your life if you let it."
good,"typical day was making sure facilities are clean that the necessary materials were stocked and ready for the day. Making sure all printers fax machines were up and running.  Reading emails ensuring they were answered in a timely fashion.  learned many things with this job such as addresses shipping packages international vs domestic, also how to pack boxes correctly and ship them."
good,"probably wouldn't be as good as it is without the union.  extremely fast paced environment.  good benefits, that is one of the best thing about working there, even as a part timer."
good,"The work environment in the PSC Customer Service department at UPS was very quick-paced and meticulous work. This job helped me improve my organizational skills, memory retention, and my ability to be a contributing member of a team. It required extreme attention to detail, time management skills, and teamwork. However, the management did not provide us with the appropriate materials or assistance to complete our job at times."
good,"A typical day includes working with employees to help process the packages, transport the package, and get them delivered on time! "
good,"Working at UPS was mostly effective in the sense that it helped me gain the real-world experience that I need in terms of software development. However, there is not enough room to grow within certain teams, and management at times does not seem to fairly treat their experience, nor do developer roles seem to be as coding roles, but rather analyst roles."
good,working with ups is ok but they could do better at pay we work harder than most and with only a few hours which is like part time and full time you see good pay when peek session comes around
good,most full time Managers are demeaning. hire anyone with hands even if they  cant physically do required abilities. such as lift 70 pounds alone.  everyone yells at everybody. dont feel comfortable going to management when there is a problem.
good,I was responsible for unloading inbound trucks onto the conveyor belt to be sorted appropriately. Once boxes were unloaded and sorted they had to be scanned into the correct outbound trailers and efficiently stacked. As drivers returned we also would help them unload their days haul as well.
good,"Fast-paced and busy. "
good,the 8 years of working for ups I enjoyed it and learned a lot. only bad thing was the owners/management. low pay and unfair.i was happy to atleast have a job and learn the new things I knoe now.
good,Working at ups was hard and stressful but I didn't mind it because it was like you were getting paid to work out. I made some buddy's there that made it a good time working there. Now I'm looking for another job because I had to drive so far in a day.
good,"Working for UPS loading trucks isn't terrible, but if you're low on the totem pole you won't get hours.  Try and be a driver or a manager if you can, those are the guys UPS really takes care of.  The benefits only kick in after working for a year so be real careful of your knees and back beforehand."
good,This job is just not for me. It's extremely boring and lonely. You cant have co-workers cover shifts and you have to come in everyday or just call out.
good,"Working for UPS is great for entry level employees. However, the work life balance is non-existent and advancement is limited if you aren't willing to dedicate 60+ hours a week to the company."
good,"I was a contractor, not an employee."
good,The job is mentally very easy. You load or unload or pick boxes all day. Physically it is extremely demanding. You are expected to work in frigid cold and extreme heat depending on the season. You are always sweating if you are doing your job. The equipment in the facility I worked at was all outdated. Of course management constantly breathes down your neck to work faster and do more. But the benefits and school money make it worth enduring for people that can handle it. Management sucks. They put young adults into management roles and many of them simply are incapable of handling these types of roles. The higher ups are just mean to everyone unless you are working fast and not making mistakes. I enjoyed my co-workers a lot though. I'd recommend it to someone who wants to go to school and wants help paying for it. Its also a great way to stay in shape.
good,"Long hours. Lack of communication. Priorities change without notice. Fear of losing your job on a regular basis. Seems as if few people look out for the business as a whole, rather just their own numbers"
good,"I was going initially for college, until I figured out that my fafsa would pay for everything, but great benifits. Not a lot of hours tho, so the paychecks that you got every week I might add, were rather small."
good,"everyday was the same thing, unload or load trailers for as fast as possible. there was not a ton of variation or conversation between employees because most the time we were alone in our own trailer."
good,"The ups store is a franchise, so the owner may change with the location. This location relied on its associates to think quick on their feet and deal with any situation placed in front of them."
good,Working condition could use some improvements but other than that the management team very encouraging and the crew work very hard in completing the task at hand.
good,Fast work constant long hours okay pay not to bad of a place to work but there is a lot of jobs around paying to do what it is they do if 12 hours is something you have not done then you should look elsewhere
good,"UPS gave me some good opportunities to gain experience in management pt while going to school. However it is not a job for everyone by any means. There are not a lot of chances for advancement and everyone is out for everyone else jobs. Employees get treated as if they are all criminals. If the benefits weren't so good, and if the pay increases weren't part of the contract no one would work for UPS."
good,Was a seasonal employee at a the local UPS. It was what I signed up for but was very hard and not my cup of tea. Huge kudos to those who work there full time. Very good pay and benefits if you are a full time driver
good,"Management had almost no control over the workers, overall was a good TEMP. job for seasonal work. Dress to be comfortable working with the outdoor climate."
good,"I'm so grateful for this job it's an amazing place to work if you enjoy coworker interaction. I just can't handle the hours anymore, third shift is not for everyone."
good,UPS needed me to work 3rd shift and I could not do it and they did not have any other positions available so I had to let UPS go as well. I would recommend this job to others.
good,Rarely any hours always temp unfortnately the hours are extremely skim to none no stability or job security. Should try to figure the hours out and help people out more
good,You need a strong backbone to work here. Woman in management are not treated the same as men or paid the same. Very old school mentality. They do pay very well but you have no work life balance in management. The new board of directors are all about the money. Customer Service is no longer a priority. Very sad.
good,"It was an opportunity to work along side of some that daily, gave their best and showed excellent work and team ethics without any cultural  barriers."
good,UPS as a whole isn't a bad company but their Inside Sales Rep position is very challenging. You sit through 6 weeks of training to get trained on an AE role but not the actual role you're taking. If you're one of the unfortunate ones that takes over a territory where you're not trained by the previous ISR you're screwed. It's sink or swim. They say it take 6 mos to a year to fully understand the job. The job doesn't have to be as difficult as they make it. There shouldn't be any reason it takes someone that long to figure it out. They have way too many products and services for one person to sell. They'd be more productive if they divided sales up into a few products and services instead of being mediocre in all of them. And do not tell them you want to be anything other than a an AE or you will not get help to advance on.
good,The warehouse is a very dirty place and management primarily cares about accomplishing loading trucks in timely manner. The trailers are unsanitary. Management does not know about proper structure.
good,Had to be there by 3am and it was obvious that no one wanted to be. They were all very negative and hated the job that they were working. Management didn't care at all about he new comers only the vets that had been there for a while. We were a dime a dozen to them.
good,"I dreaded to come to work, but whenever I needed money it was there. We worked non stop for about two hours, have a 10 minute break, and then work for 3 hours constantly."
good,"I worked as a driver helper during the Christmas season. The actual work was fine and i enjoyed the drivers i met and work i did. The problem i had was with getting assigned to drivers each day. My area was divided into north and south sectors, myself being placed in the north. Not once did get placed with a driver from north, every day i called they said they did not need me. I was able to pick up work with the south when their helpers did not show up or couldnt make it. Therefore i did not work or earn as much as i would have liked."
good,The pre-loaders hours are insane. (start at around 4 A.M. and go to about 9:15) But it is quite rewarded. They pay every week and at a good rate of about $11 an hour which for a college student like myself is more than enough.
good,"Truck after truck will be stopping seemingly endlessly and you certainly will be working on blue belt  as the new hire (the hardest spot to work at in the building)."
good,I work as a Sorter/DA Clerk I learned a lot working for this company such as having the boxes shipped out to customers on time. The hardest part of the job is working in the heat and standing.
good,"Seniority is king, the long you have worked here the more you get away with. Lazy workers all over. If you manage to stay long enough the union takes care of you and provides you with a good job"
good,"Worked here for about 9 years. Good job stability and everyday was very routine. Makes it easier to get the hang of things. Learned a lot about how UPS prices packages. Became a ""Packing Expert"" while working here. Built a great relationship with mostly all the customers who came in on a regular basis. I still talk to many of them today!"
good,"My experience in Ups innovations was not as I thought it would be. the pay didn't match the work I would put out, and the managers there were rude and sometimes unprofessional."
good,"UPS offers great benefits, even for part time employees. A lot of this has to do with the union membership. But other than that, the environment is not welcoming and management just views you as another number. They do not genuinely care about your experience."
good,I was the assistant UPS driver where I would help assist the driver deliver packages during the Christmas season. We would deliver them everyday from Thanksgiving to Christmas along the same route. It was definitely a job that humbled me that I had such an appreciation for thinking back on it.
good,It was an okay job nothing i recommend unless you really need quick money. This postion is demanding and difficult but if you love working hard like I do you'll push through it.
good,UPS is a very hard job to do if you are doing the unload side. HR is not very helpful. They are very hard to work with. There are no standard phone numbers to call into if you are not going to come in that day. The pay in the SSF branch is $3.00 less than the San Francisco branch. They are only 10 miles a part.
good,"The company itself is good to work for, so long as you continue to move up. The management at the Waldorf, MD location at this time is fairly poor, with the exception of the Building Manager. Package Handlers are not treated or paid well and have a heavy, fast-paced work load for around 4-5 hours per day. The only major advantages are the ability to move up from within and being a union member with the union benefits package."
good,UPS is a good company to work for. The benefits are comparable to other companies in the same industry. Work hours and times of work are difficult as most of the jobs are performed in the evening and morning hours.
good,not worth all the stress.  always want more out of you when you thought you gave it your all. if you're looking to settle for a good paying job and don't have much to do outside of ups then apply.
good,"If you want to get anywhere within the company, prepare to get your own name out there to be noticed/promoted. If you wait on your direct supervisor/manager, you will be stuck in the same position forever."
good,Needs a drastic culture change. Underpaid part-time supervisors. Needs a change immediately. Very few career advancement opportunities. Good for the experience.
good,"Working part time at UPS you get 2 days off and the hours are decent. The pay could be better. Holidays are usually the big pay day. Know that the job is physical and the environment is dog eat dog. So make friends where you can, but know you might have to watch you back. If you are the type that can handle both low pay,  fast pace, and a borderline toxic environment I would say it's worth trying. Be warned the job will test you at every turn."
good,No chance to get promoted so starting from the bottom is where you stay. The place that I work is not run like it should be and the management should be a lot more on point
good,1)Always wear proper PPE 2) always lift with a straight back and make sure your hands are in the proper position . 3) show up ready to work 4) always size up your load before you lift it.5) and make sure you work safe
good,Not bad place to work as long as you like the long and unsociable hours that are included .. the problem is that we don't actually get ups wages where as we should
good,life at UPS is not easy it will tire you out easily. You must be willing to do hard labor and push yourself to your limits if you need to keep a job at UPS.
good,"You have to be very patient, healthy and tough to work here...and you also have to be very careful you don't hurt yourself...it's a pretty dangerous place...particular the Unload. Its also a filthy place...you will come home filthy and have black snot. There is no drugs test so a lot of people on drugs get into the building. There is no belief here of slow and steady wins the race...you will not find that here. You will find Greed, Denial and Unhappiness at this company. stay in your lane and get a check."
good,"Communications very critical. The job was very basic but attention to detail and working with safety in mind was key.The culture was come in do the job you were hired for,don't ask questions. the best part as a driver was not being stuck inside all day."
good,The best thing about this job are the people that you work with everyday. I normally scan packages and sort boxes. The hardest part of the job is production you have to maintain daily.
good,"Hard work,pay should be a little more, Union is good and so are benefits. Hard work can pay off. Not east but ot for the lazy also. ok shifts. Ok team"
good,"Greeted customers and helped with packaging and shipping needs. Filed UPS claims, technical support with computer related issues. Ran printers, Stocked shelves."
good,"This place is ran nicely. Everybody has a job to do and is doing it. Nobody looks lost at or unsure about what to do.......................,.........."
good,Its just a typical package handling job with great benefits. Moving up isn't to bad but managers like to act like semi-drill sergeants but never really help out themselves. Some do though and those are the managers to work with.
good,Pressure filled environment. If you have a family or want a family you should probably work elsewhere. Opportunities to advance are there for the right people. Benefits are great also.
good,"management is cool, work sucks. low pay for new hires. good place to work at if you start young and put in time, not if you need to make that money right away."
good,"I really liked this job. It was crazy warehouse work. The amount of product we had to deal with on a nightly schedule was really high."
good,Great Company.  Poor Management.  Very unorganized... too much business for management to handle. The work is very strenuous. You're always on the go.  Very face paced work.
good,"i applied for part time and ended up working full time hours. they just gave me a schedule after i got the job. a lot of it comes down to who you get paired with for a driver. my driver wasn't that great i wish i could have been paired with a different one. always moving and constantly doing something. dont be surprised if you're the only one running packages while the driver is only driving and sorting packages in the back the whole time. my driver barely left the truck and it said that the work was to be distributed evenly. but hey whatever its not that bad. my driver did however stop to talk to one of his buddies for a good half hour at the end of the day because that was the last stop but than he said "" Im docking 30 minutes of your pay for the day because we weren't working for the last half hour just sitting talking"" i was really angry because if i had known that i would have said lets go stop talking and bring me back to my car. the job itself itsnt terrible but some people are better to work with than others and you cant choose obviously."
good,OVER WORKED and UNDERPAID! Not enough hours considering its a part time job! Management doesn't care about employees only packages and getting them out before their deadline.
good,"The UPS store is a very productive workplace. You get to work and right away you are doing what needs to be done until you are off or on break. I learned that to be successful in business you must stay true to your word and always thoroughly communicate with the customers to ensure that you do everything to their standards. The management of the store is lacking in many aspects. They are unorganized and it is hard to follow what actually needs to be done in the day. For the few of us that work at the UPS store we are very cultural people. The owners are Muslim, and the manager is Mormon. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand exactly what the owners and manager are asking for in a day. Many times they ask me to do three things at once and I find that very difficult to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly environment."
good,I have worked at UPS  for over a decade. In that time there has been room for little advancement and it is mostly part time positions that are available unless you work there for a long time. The job is physically strenuous and takes a toll on your back and joints. The pace is very fast and requires lots of heavy lifting.
good,"UPS is an old and strong organization. They have made advances in the world of transportation and distribution. I feel much more needs to be done, however, in streamlining their operations and adapting culturally to a new and changed work force."
good,A reasonable introduction to a faster-paced warehouse-style work environment. Pay was at an expected level and there was never a dull moment. I would've stayed longer if the hours were more consistent. Getting any information out of management or HR is like a wild goose chase. Do not work here if you plan to commute via bus during the winter season.
good,"This was a physical position, but definitely not a mentally stressful position. The work hours were fine, and the management really tried their best to work with you if you needed time off. I felt as though they din't really reward the hard workers, but actually just made them work harder and stay later, while not caring about the the last employees."
good,A typical day at work consists of a lot of hours and a lot of headache. Doing the right thing doesn't always pay off.I learned that money doesn't pave the way to happiness - there needs to be a more work-life balance. The current culture is strained and morale has worsened. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone. The most enjoyable to molding others into successful employees and building relationships with them.
good,"Worked here part time whilst looking for more permanent work. Straightforward job, staff easy to get along with. Can be long days especially around christmas time. Overall generally an ok place to work"
good,"Cut Throat Environment, benefits and pay are good. Dusty, dirty in the hubs and handling packages. Great work out if part time. Morning hours are really early. Packages can be very heavy and in a very fast pace."
good,Ups is a great place to work but you have a young family it can be challenging. great benefits and advancement. develop multiple skills that can be used in various fields of employment.
good,"Earn to learn program is a motivator, fast promotions and weekly pay. I would recommend UPS to anyone looking for help with paying for college. I would also recommend UPS to anyone looking for a management career."
good,"I liked working for the company. Just didn't get paid much and my supervisor wasn't a very nice guy at all. So that made the job not as enjoyable. Overall though, a good company to work for."
good,Good enviroment loved my customers. Would have like the owner my boss to build a better realtionship with all employees.   It would have been nice to get the credit of hard work other than assuming one person did all of the task at hand.
good,I was a preloader and it was the worst job they have available there. It wears your body down and has me too tired during my days off because it is overnight.
good,As a supervisor and package handler this job was emotionally and physically taxing. I started when I was 19 and at first I was just thankful for a job. over time though it got old really fast and the desire to move on increased by the day.
good,"A typical day at work required a 6 to 7 hour day which included writing and logging metrics of information on outbound shipping and destination arrivals of packaging trailers. I began learning to multitask as a quick rate as well as time management, as the day was short for the amount of work that was required to be completed. Although after time, routines and systems began to become easy and conventional. The most difficult thing to get past in working for UPS was the lack of some forms of structures. Many things were meant to be adapted by oneself to know how to treat certain situations with care and respect such as interpersonal communications. Although UPS had its challenges though, learning to create my own systems of perfecting the supervisor role in my own way was one of the most rewarding benefits to a job I've had to this day."
good,supervise employees unloading and loading trailers. I worked in the next day air building for 11 years and moved to the outbound areas. I also control the tower where i control the movement of the belts.
good,"Typical transportation company, the place was customer orientated driven, the package had to get delivered on time as promised.  The managers were in a love hate relationship with the preloaders (union employees).  Both sides played games with each other.  "
good,Unorganized and very poor management skills constant confusion. Often take advantage of hard working people and reward the lazy ones. Your start times change everyday making it difficult to remember when your suppose to be there.
good,"I didn't like working in the environment I was in because, the managers treat their employees as if their expendable, giving a person no self assurance about their job security."
good,Great company with great culture. Although they wanted an entrepreneurial mindset the employees are limited in what they can actually do. Ideas shut down without any opposition or feed back. Felt like a dead end.
good,Great place to earn a second income very stressful and please have thick skin if you want to work there because you will get sworn at on a regular basis
good,"Its a alright job if you get good management unlike where i work at. Pay was $11 part time. If ylu dont like lifting heavy things and have to multi task, UPS isnt for you."
good,Working for ups is a very hard job it's basically a work about because of the bending and reaching. I started out a seasonal package handler but I did so good I got called back in March to work part-time permanently. I had to scan all package to make sure they get to where they're going. I had to make sure the hazard boxes was put and the back if packages are open you find your supervisor and let her no the package is open.
good,"The job would require me to input data of all the shipments we sent out and arrive all the shipments into the facility.  I had to maintain the proper workload for the employees to carryout and make sure the freight was delivered on time.  Marking any deficiencies on the products as it was brought to my attention.  As a supervisor I took personal initiative to speak to the dock workers and see how they were doing and how life was going.  Favorite part of the job was the fast paced and the learning of the operational side of the company worked, least favorite would have to be just the hours and the lack of career progression."
good,The moral in my final days of working at UPS Freight was very poor. There was very little done to quell the feeling of dread and doom. There were multiple retirements of upper management and no explanations given. Looks like they are downsizing the home office in Richmond. Management could have handled things better to make people feel valued. the hardest part of the job was that I was the only one qualified to do what i did and the workload was too great initially. I also had to train my replacement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. They were like a second family.
good,the employees are working for 12 hour night shifts as a part time employee while working under salary. I learned that at times you can only trust yourself.
good,"delivering over 50 drops a day "
good,"Fast paced delivery, fair weight and number of packages are good for keeping in shape. Friendly coworkers. Unfortunately odd hours per day."
good,"Very competitive, management is very sneaky and changes goals every month, union makes sure nothing is fixed. Very lousy work life balance. The pay and benefits are good though."
good,Ups wasn't for me. It was good money but very hard to do at times. Having to stay moving and stay focused. If I got behind it messed everyone on my line up. It was seasonal so did have to work there too long.
good,"Excellent place to work great benefits, I was part of the international helpdesk and was directly involved with production and package movements, however; management was a bit rude and did not follow company policy absolutely."
good,"Everyone stayed to them selves and didn't like to communicate much often. And the person in charge of my area didn't know what we was doing, (Was New) and make us to extra work that we wouldn't have needed to done if he didn't stop the machine, this would lead to us staying 30 min to 1 hour overtime"
good,"Good company, room for advancement is available. Sometimes difficult to accomplish everything required due to unrealistic goals. Alot of moving pieces make for a fast paced environment."
good,"Been there for 2 years worked at 3 different centre s  know 2 routs well been a spare driver for a few weeks ."
good,"The job overall is pretty good if you have a very flexible schedule and if you have a car or live close by. Tough environment to work at, you need to have good stamina for the job and be tough, if you're too soft this job isn't for you. Breaks are too short for the work you do."
good,"UPS is company that I can no longer see growth in for myself. The company's management team should work on its growth together to then apply such growth to the daily operations in order to see desired results however, this is hard, due to the lack of collective cooperation."
good,"Typical days included riding in delivery truck passenger seats, delivering parcel packages in a safe and efficient manner, getting signatures for certain deliveries, practicing safe movements such as boarding the truck and walking in safe areas during delivery."
good,Just need to have patients and pay attention a lot and lobe your job and you be fine at this job I like it it was only seasonal but loved making that easy money I think I go back permitted if I happy again
good,"I dealt with just about everything you can imagine in an office setting and enjoyed the people i dealt with, as well as coworkers, but there was no further advancement from where i was at."
good,There was just way to much pressure In the hub form supervisors and you u work so hard for so little pay it's just not worth it and also they had and attendance problem
good,Typical day at UPS is intense work. Very hard on your body if you're the one unloading trucks. You must go as fast as you can and cannot slow down. Have protein bars and drinks on hand because you will need it.
good,"The SA inside sales position has shifted more toward new college graduates. The environment is very rule driven (no eating at your desk, no cellphones, only spill-proof cups, etc) and management focuses on any wrong doings before successes. However, it's a good place to get training for various outside sales position mostly located in other states. They don't want employees to spend much time in the building and the pay isn't very good."
good,i worked my butt off for thos company for years only to be unappreciated and depleted of all morale.They give you a high pay grade so no other company will hire you and then give you less than part time hours for a part time job.I thought my promotion would produce more money for me and it has not .
good,Working at UPS was very physically demanding but not mentally challenging. The pay was okay. During the holiday season the hours were good. I was working up to 50 hours a week . After the new year they let me go due to production slowing down.
good,great job to learn the ins and outs of logistics. Nice people fun work environment. Understanding and flexible with work schedule.
good,Great team to work with assisting customer with issues and concerns as well as working with drivers to ensure they were dispatched to the correct location to deliver or pick up packages.
good,The work is really not that bad when it is not the holiday season. Once the holidays come around tempers are short and you're expected to work massive amounts of overtime in order to meet goals. The over all atmosphere of the company is dated (slowly coming into new age technology) and slightly unorganized with each department avoiding talking to any other department.
good,Ups is a good job for college students who still live at home. Part time is a maximum of 5 and a half hours a day starting at $10.10/hr. Not enough compensation for someone who has to pay bills/rent. Especially for the amount of vigorous labor you will have to do.
good,"Worked as Package Handle for two months, very hard work, it gets easier, it's like working out, it gets hot in the summer. "
good,"The work at ups was at a fast pace, something i liked about it. I learned how to do much dealing with package handling, it is quite easy for the most part. The co-workers were cool, i had no problem with that at all. But the hardest part of the job was being rushed all the time i didn't like the fact the the supervisors got paid off our speed and how fast we unload a truck like it was a bonus to there weekly pay. Honestly i felt used. And Even though we wasn't getting paid minimum wage at $10.15 i enjoyed doing the double shifts and doing weekends getting paid double."
good,"Over all this is a fun job. Lots of running and very tiring. The few drivers I had been with were ok. They give you a call asking if you can work and if you can they give you a time and a place to meet. The one thing I really dont like about it is you never know when you're going to work. Could be Monday, Tuesday and Friday for 2 hours each day or it can be Mon-Fri 8 hours a day."
good,"Long hours, very high stress, zero work life balance. But you'll learn to love the people you work with to the point they become family."
good,"They said theyd assign me to one location close to home with one person all season. my first week I went to 3 different locations from payson to provo, with 4 different drivers. SUPER inconvenient. I was working close to home but then they started to assigning me to places a half an hour away. Didnt keep their word. Lots of walking."
good,"I've learned a lot at UPS; ranging from how to create labels, to how much goes into taking care of people items and making sure they get to the correct spot. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers, making people smile, and making conversation with the customers."
good,"A normal day at UPS starts off with your sectioned station depending on where your at your are reminded about safety precautions. What i learned was how to stack packages properly and also sorting out different packages to different states. Management there was helpful with guiding you to follow correct steps. The hardest part about the job was the weight of some of the packages and the heat in the warehouse. Nonetheless, the most enjoyable part was rewarding ceremony."
good,Liked the job but wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Management wasn't what was expected. They treated employment like trash and no work to home time ratio. You were always at work.
good,"Do your work and dont steal, lie cheat, and you'll be fine. Follow rules mind your business .don't do drugs or drink alcohol"
good,"Conservative culture with an old school mentality, but there are great peers to work with and learn from.  Management styles are very split between rigid and flexible. Dress code has gradually become more casual leading to a more relaxed environment, but the politics have gotten worse.  Pay is extremely non-competitive when compared to other companies, but they do not lay off employees when business hits a slump."
good,"This is a very demanding physical labor job in which the common phrase is ""GO, GO, GO,....FASTER!"" You are paid fairly well for the work that you are doing, there is just very little if any chance for advancement unless you put in your time and stand out from the thousands of employees"
good,"The job overall was cool. I was taught proper ways to maintain safety, which can be applied to any future job. My co workers seemed to be fine. Personally, I applied for the job because it fit perfect with my school schedule, and I was told I would be able to leave on time so I can attend school. However, the days I had school, the management wouldn't let me leave on time because ""Seniority"" leaves first. Overall,  I was satisfied. recommended if you decide to spend the rest your life there."
good,Good company to work for with excellent benefits and plenty of opportunities to advance. Supervision of the employees could be better to help boost morale and increase productivity.
good,"Manual, physically strenuous labor for a stable, year - round paycheck. Good for someone trying to get paid weekly and earn every penny. Little room for advancement and not for the faint of heart."
good,It's a well out together job. they pay well have good benefits as well. At ups the job is quite simple all is needed for you is to deliver boxes to homes and company's in a certain time each day. Each day a partner and I would challenge ourselves to have all boxes delivered at all locations required.
good,"This job truly is under paid slavery. The workers are terribly under compensated, undertrained, and over worked. The only upside is the benefits but they don't come in until at least a year later. After taxes you really don't make much at all."
good,I'd have to say that this was a depressing place to work. it was a point a finger at someone else kind of atmoshere. as a part-time supervisor the union has leverage over you and it makes it hard for disciplinary action to an employee that is a constant problem
good,"the only way to make real money here is become a driver or a supervisor. anything less is not worth the hard physical work. to be a supervisor, you need to be intelligent, have good people skills, be persuasive sometimes, and tough because the workforce is tough and when they smell weakness you're finished. if you can run this operation, you'll get paid some good money. you won't have much of a social life though. it's especially tough if you have kids."
good,It was good while i was there but when new ppl came in it got different. Its a good job fast place joking eviroment it will keep u in shape keep you some water nd go in there and ball
good,"My co-workers are all friendly and supportive people. Due to it being an individually owned store, management is a little to familial. They expect beyond professional work but are not professional themselves. A typical day has two prime rush periods. The day is either consistently busy or extremely slow. I learned what it is like to work in a professional environment, office tasks, and responsibilities of keeping the store organized and clean, as well as how to manage registers and close the store. The job is pretty simple. In my opinion, all you really need is common sense and a good work ethic. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain a professional demeanor. What I mean is, I had to learn to be assertive with how long I was scheduled to work and request lunch breaks. If its not requested, they will take advantage of you and not provide even a 5 min break to sit down. They treat it like a family business rather than a professional environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, and learning about life around the world. Oh, and the rubber-band wars, which occur on extremely dead days."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for the individual of this particular location. I also liked the environment, probably because it was only 3 of us. Therefore, we got to know one another's work habits very well & it was very easy to adjust and work together. I would stayed here if the compensation was adequate for my family."
good,"Good job if you want to get in great shape."
good,"It was a lot of hard work, most of the day was hard physical labor. Most of the people you will work with and around don't care about the job or you, but there are friendly people that you will find. Management was the worst part of the job they don't care about you or your co-workers at all, they see you as expendable and replaceable. That at times is the hardest part of the job. The nicst part to be honest is the pay."
good,"clock in at 2 am most days and meet with our scanner at the unloading door. Then I start to unload the trailer and put the boxes "
good,i enjoyed meeting new co worker that can encourage and help you i enjoyed learning how to do sorting and working in the air machines.
good,relaxed and a fun place to work its a great place for advancement.   Great people.  Good co-workers.  You learn alot about people and what they need.  You become a better person yourself.
good,"I enjoyed the position, great drivers and benefits. "
good,"It was an okay workplace. i mostly worked outside , going door to door or inside the building ordering package bins."
good,The people you work with are great but there is no upward mobility or health benefits and the bonuses are not that great. All in all its a good part time job or something to tide you over.
good,"This position was only seasonal.  The drivers trained the assistant on how to load the truck on unload while in route of delivering to customers, residential and commercial.  The work was not hard, but very fast paste to ensure all packages were delivered."
good,Not a real organized and team work type of organization. In the location and hub that I was in. Upper management did not seem to know what they were doing.
good,"Service providers (drivers) for UPS are the hardest working men and women I've ever known. The days are long and arduous. We work in every weather condition, deal with every situation that may arise (dogs, bad drivers, traffic etc) and still provide the best service to the public."
good,"A typical work day with The UPS Store involves doing a lot of packing and shipping of items both big and small, valuable and invaluable. We ship through both UPS and USPS. While that is a majority of the job, we provide other services such as typing, printing , faxing, and notary services. Days can be slow with hardly anyone to check in or they can be swamped with lines out the door."
good,"UPS is a very challenging environment for a sales executive.  Although the position is very challenging you can succeed if you have thick skin and a unrelenting drive.  I gave a maximum of 3 stars only because the benefits are not up to standard for the work done.  There is an unlimited amount of knowledge you can learn, the industry changes very rapidly."
good,was not a day that I didn't wont to be at work enjoyed working for my manager good work environment even though I had to work on my feet the hole time
good,Hard work with a low level of compensation. Workers who loaded trucks for a while were first considered when it came time to hire a new driver.
good,"You lift heavy boxes all day with no breaks until the half way point, where you get 15 minutes to shove food in your face and if your lucky hit the bathroom. If you didn't go full force 100% of the time you would get held up by too many boxes, and if you did you would injure your back. Most management members were awful and only cared about you being as fast as 10 year veterans."
good,"i come in sort bills, get on my forklift unload and load freight."
good,A typical day would start at 9:30 and we would do a sort of our five ton truck. Then deliver all of our timed deliveries. We need to work as a team to get our truck done. There is five off us who work out of this truck. We would divide up into five sections of the mall to get everything done on time. Time management was essential to get the job done.
good,"UPS is a great place for the long-term future. They offer great benefit packages, and it is a unionized company so it would be hard to lose your job. A typical day at work is starting at 4:30 in the morning with supervisors and managers screaming to make you work faster, because they are sending a massive amount of work and the managers do not want to deal with it at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is punching out at the end of your shift."
good,"Be prepared to work. Some of the advancement opportunities are limited. Over time, UPS can really make you lose your Christmas spirit, since even as a part time employee many people worked over sixty hours a week."
good,"the hardest part of the job, you must be horsework with low pay job. They always be watching you if you are fast one then put you in other people's work which i dislike it."
good,"The benefits were decent and the education assistance was very helpful while attending college."
good,A very easy job that only last during the holidays. Delivering packages on days were severe thunderstorms.I learned about giving good customer service.
good,"this job was ok ,didnt see a future in it and hope they make some changes fast, it didnt provide us with great hours nor pay,other then that work was normal"
good,"I worked for UPS during my senior year of high school. I was able to effectively manage work, going to high school, and take college classes because of their willingness to work with my schedule. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment without getting overwhelmed. Working at UPS is dangerous because of all the equipment, but I don't believe they were very concerned for my safety. I enjoyed working with others, however not all of my coworkers were very willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job was getting more volume than one person could safely handle and being expected to maintain a safe environment and steady pace."
good,they need to decrease the mandatory overtime for the workers its also some managers takes sides so not so a good communication going on
good,The job is labor intensive with constant pressure to move faster and more accurate. must be able to deal with working along side others. but has good insurance.
good,"A typical day at work would be to input packages for box holders, notarize documents, make copies, send faxes, process shipments for clients, and package items for shipment."
good,Opprotunity for a young company to really strive to success. Good job for those who are willing to be flexible in working various hours. Must be open for criticism in working for union and managment positions.
good,"I didn't like the hours, pay wasn't good , co workers were cool. The job was a easy job. Management was the best part of the job"
good,The most difficult part of this job is dealing with a union environment. You have to abide by the contract 100% of time. It sometimes takes months to get off the payroll after he/she has been disciplined multiple times.
good,Good Company with a fast paced environment. Competitive compensation but horrible work/life balance. Management team responds to concerns occasionally.
good,"Depends on the Franchisee and their vision. I worked for a multiple store owner so I was kept pretty busy with all the design related duties I had to do. "
good,"Management really didn't appreciate the worker, only appreciated the work being done. work environment wasn't to safe.  Not enough employees to handle work load"
good,Management doesn't really care about your safety and the worry more about the pieces per hour that is getting done instead.
good,Fast pace work environment. Great place to for college students or someone looking for a part time job. Very demanding job requires lifting and lowering packages throughout shift.
good,"While the job can by challenging, pay is not commensurate with what they ask you to do, in the Las Vegas area UPS is at Minimum 3.00 dollars an hour below everywhere else for an ICS technician."
good,"I enjoyed the variety of people who worked there. Fast paced, good with getting a reliable lunch time, wasn't good with giving out a good 40 hours a week though."
good,Its a great job for some but the hours can be long and sometimes you don't finish until very late in the day. It can become very stressful at times as they require you to take a lunch but a lot of times it delays your progress. Also if you finish too early they require you to help somebody else which is alright but if the other person is really slow or backed up your eight hour days can easily turn into 12 hour days.
good,"Typical day consists of coming in early and during seasonal super early (sometimes). Loading trucks with boxes/ sometimes things that are 120 lbs. During seasonal you can get really slammed with boxes, especially at the end of the shift. "
good,Worked as a sales associate 3-4 days a week part time.  Helped customer with any shipping needs.  Responsible for balancing till and  closing the store.
good,"Not an easy job, but it can be rewarding. Work/life balance is poor. Lots of stress. Great training.Management gets pretty stressed and it trickles down. Xmas is very tough. Driving i this city is tough."
good,I acquired most of my payroll experience utilizing a complex payroll system. I was able to sharpen my human resource skills through UPS.
good,i worked  at ups  for    almost  two years   it  was a good  place  to work   especially   during the busy season   of   christmas on a typical day i would be restocking  cleaning and  packaging
good,"Th hardest part of this job was the working conditions. No A/C, hard labor, belligerent coworkers. Aside from that, the benefits are great and the pay is consistent."
good,"Worked the early morning shift. It fit into my families lifestyle. Liked that is was physical, maybe a little to demanding. Enjoyed my coworkers and drivers. The hardest part was staying organized with such a fast pace. I like to stay as organized as possible. The most enjoyable part of my job was at the end of the day. Being able to comunicate with the drivers, letting them know what to expect."
good,"A typical day at work is a pretty good workout in the summer, hot and sweaty. The hardest part of the job is the weather conditions and short breaks."
good,"It's a pat time/on call position. Not always the most consistent work schedule, of ten wondering why I wasn't told to work the day before, if management knows the forecasted amount of work there should be the day before. Very inconsistent working conditions as well, one day the trailers show up on time the next day they are running late."
good,"On a daily basis I Scan,load, and ship packages to the western part of the state in Nebraska. Long hours and you are never bored."
good,Abwechlungsriche tätigkeit.Sehr gutes Team .Schnelles arbeiten .Führeschein pflicht
good,The start of my day at the job is setting up the warehouse for the beginning of the shift. After that I work on my health & safety assignments which usually takes up most of my day. My job is production and keeping everyone safe.
good,It was a high stress environment from the start of the day to finish. I learned how to adapt and adjust quickly due to many circumstances affecting volume distribution. Was a highly critical negative environment.
good,"Great experience and opportunities."
good,We learned how to process mail and correct the address information on each package. Our Supervisors were kind and caring . Co-workers were also kind and helpful. Hardest part of the job was keeping the pace going. The most enjoyable was the constant moving and staying active even though it would be hard at times to keep the pace going
good,"UPS is a great company to work for in general, but being seasonal is no guarantee of being held onto. I was let go after the Christmas Season, after being told by two managers that I would stick around. I was the last seasonal employee they had on staff, but even now I haven't gotten a call back."
good,"On a typical work day on the job you are load and unload trailer. Also it a warehouse so you must dress to the whether conditions and be safe as well. Management is not all bad, but most of them rude and disrespectful. Your co-worker are weird, but fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is working night and adjusting to whether conditions."
good,"A typical day at work was to load the UPS trucks with boxes from the slide and irregulars belt."
good,If you like to work part time just to go to work and just work nothing more than UPS is for you. The pay was very nice and was honestly the only thing that kept me at the facility because the management really is structured pretty well except for some of the supervisors are in position of power and sometimes take advantage of this.
good,"Grab a box and load it into the trailer. Then grab another box. Rinse and repeat. This is it, for about 6hrs a day"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at UPS. I worked in one of the skilled trades positions that was regarded as a protected asset and during most of my time there, I felt like we were compensated well but we were usually treated like possessions by junior management (supervisors)."
good,"Typical day of work will start early in the morning by checking the equipment and the loads assigned for the day.  Love interacting with Customers.  Learned a lot about logistics and how to be safe and proper at all times.  "
good,Excellent global leader in logistics. Gained a great deal of IT experience with my position at company. Took early retirement.
good,UPS will ask you to work day and night and will always have you on call. The compensation is nice but is hard to make it work with a family. Overall the management is only numbers focused with little to no care about individual employees. This is a place where you either are soft and will not make it or turn hard and will succeed through the ranks. Not for the faint of heart and will test your management skills.
good,"I was told UPS was a hard job, it was true. Being a package handler in the a.m. shift I would start work at 3 am everyday except weekends usually loading 3 trucks. Every employee that worked there for at least a year told all new people to not work too hard because if you do they will just give you more work. They were right, the harder you work the more they gave you and sent people home early. Anything to save a dollar. UPS is a great company but poorly run by management. I seen 12 people quit in the one year I worked there and that was just on my line alone, more than 30 in the entire building.  The job was physically draining. If you think I'm lying, apply as a package handler. Funny thing is when your doing the tour for the job they try to scare you a bit by saying things like ""if you like to being behind and never being caught up this jobs for you"" or ""most people quit in the first couple weeks"" The stress and physical strain is not worth it or the money unless you need benefits for yourself or family that's the main reason people stay there. Pay is good if you stay a couple years just not worth what you go through."
good,"I've seen the company go thru many changes in my 28 years. I enjoyed my relationship with my customers, and always tried to take care of their needs, but management expectations have become un-realistic and difficult to keep customer concern's as a priority."
good,"6- 6.5 hrs/ day day "
good,poor management. my boss would let the employes walk all over him when i tried to make the place better by getting rid of bad employes. he would let people off the hook.the money was ok . I love what i did but management was really poor.
good,"UPS is een internationaal logistiek bedrijf. Voor het parcel-onderdeel in Nederland is de salesafdeling in Amsterdam gevestigd. UPS heeft intern een heleboel verschillende salestrainingen, zodat het goed mogelijk is om je verder te ontwikkelen. Ik werk in een gezellig team, waarbij men altijd klaar staat voor elkaar."
good,"Generally a day at work consistent of any number of varying tasks. despite being a loader officially, I would often be assigned to assist in unloading or sorting depending on what was needed at the time. I feel that in spite of being personally incompatible with the work environment I still came away from it with an improved work ethic and appreciation for the responsibility assumed by employees on every level of companies both big and small. The management was very unsatisfactory and irresponsible. I was often asked or even commanded to engage in illegal or potentially life threatening tasks simply for the sake of improved efficiency ratings. I had a great deal of difficulty getting to work on time consistently due to the distance from my home coupled with the unpredictable traffic at the time of my shift, as well as the many health issues I experienced this last year as a result of the physically exhausting nature of the work. On the positive side of things I really enjoyed the sense of accomplishment that came from completing difficult tasks and working hard."
good,"It was a great job until a couple of years as part of the Management, was treated as a second class, screamed at times w/o having any involvement on the situation."
good,"Daily routine- Log into scanner, go to assigned trucks & scan/load boxes starting from cornerstone (left corner of truck)"
good,Ups is a good insurance and a good part time job it also a job with good benefits and you can bid to other positions ups can also send you to school
good,"UPS is a great company. I learned a lot from working here, both strategically and management-wise."
good,"My regular assignment is the off load and the loading of different types of aircrafts going to different destinations on the East and West Coast. I have learned how manage and direct up to 12 employees. I have also learned disciplining processes and how to determine what proper levels of discipline are needed. During the time I have worked there, I have learned to operate a wide variety of heavy machinery, as well. "
good,"The typical work day was very busy from start to finish. Management was never backing you, they would always question what you did. The hardest part of the job was deciphering what my boss wanted me to do with the special projects. I would ask for an explanation and the more I asked the more upset the got. There is minimal mentoring it this company for mid level management."
good,"Seasonal driver at UPS is going every morning to beg for a couple hours on the road if they need you you'll drive, but you have to go avery day to find out if they need you"
good,During my time there the work was very hard . Hours were short
good,Come to work and start loading in trucks where my mangers chooses.
good,"My experience has been generally positive.  There is good and bad at every company.  There can be a lot of drama between management and the unionized employees.  Regardless of your opinion on unions- good, bad, indifferent... there is a LOT of drama.  If you are the kind of employee that stays out of others business and focuses on getting your work accomplished, then you will probably enjoy a career at UPS.  They have excellent pay and benefits for most of their positions."
good,"This past 12 months I worked on a new project for UPS promoting their Express Critical services from an inside sales perspective in a never done before capacity. Sales leads came from a variety of sources including working with other inside sales teams from different branches of UPS, field sales representatives and unconverted rate quotes. We worked to target several key industries with the need for same day shipping or critical time tables with the use of special equipment. The day involved high call volume, assessing business needs, speaking with major decision makers, putting together business reviews to demonstrate where to help cut shipping costs, and also present pricing tables and negotiate discounts. I was part of a team of inside sales representatives that focused on promoting heavyweight air and ocean shipping in a freight forwarding capacity and offering brokerage set up when necessary. The best part of my job has been the incredible group of people that is not only a team, but a support group. We have met several business challenges head on and found success on multiple levels. The hardest part of the job was when I found out two weeks ago that our sales department has been dissolved and will be relocated out of state. All of us are now entering the job market after several years with UPS."
good,delivering packages in loading up the truck before headind out was hard but I learnd a lot.. driving all day in different place was fun
good,The workng environment is good . But no scope of promotion . They dont help people grow if you are not in direct sales.
good,This job takes you out of your comfort zone of always working in office setting.
good,"A typical day at UPS includes arriving at work early enough to clock in and stretch because the job is labor intensive. Fifteen minutes before your shift you pick which trailer you feel comfortable starting your day with to unload. Management is decent, some managers are true leaders and lead by example,and very upbeat and enthusiastic, while others are a little hesitant to uplift, or be able to connect with their employees. My co workers in my unit I truly enjoyed, we were more like brothers then co workers, we played basketball together every week, reason for our side being the most productive unit at the hub. The hardest part of the job is being able to pace yourself because of it being manual labor. You will have to stand on your feet for multiple hours and do a lot of extending with your arms and shoulders, it can be pretty ruff on your lower back. The most enjoyable part of the job was having your weekends free."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the clients face when seeing their packages being delivered before the holidays
good,"Unloading semi-trucks, Not much else to say. Got hurt on the job which led to me leaving."
good,"Prepare , work hard , short breaks , fast paced company , overnights"
good,"The only good thing is that i got an opputunity to handle critical processes"
good,"Getting full-time is a real job. As long as you get placed inside on the truck loaders position it's a piece of cake. But if your the delivery driver helper, it get's quite cold."
good,Typical day at work but upper management was poor. Enjoyed co-workers. Short breaks and long hours.
good,"worked 530pm to 330 am"
good,"Mid-night shift. Working in small sort. Doing the same thing every day, very boring."
good,"I learned so much of what has made me successful from UPS.  Management is vested in you and your operation, almost too much, but I had the authority to run my operation like my personal business.  99% of the time, they promote from within.  Other full time sups were great to work with, very team driven.  The hardest part of this job had to do with the hours it required, especially during peak season.  Compensation was superb, but it comes at a sacrificed home life."
good,"Fast paced"
good,About 80% of the management team is people who are 26 and younger with no people skills. They play favorites and harass employees.
good,"Although I was probably in best shape of my life, UPS (management and HR) doesn't care about you as an individual or your overall well-being.  All they care about is that you show up to work your butt off, and never make mistakes because not only will you be criticized by every manager that looks your way, but it will go in your employee file, just so they look good on paper to corporate.  I'm sure my situation is different from everyone else, but my ex-fiancé is in management, and even though I had several supervisors tell me and members of the HR department that they felt I was qualified to take the part-time management assessment, HR would not allow me to take the test until I agreed to move out of my ex's house.  However, even after I moved out and we continued to be friends, HR still limited me to the positions I could work because they felt it was a conflict of interest for my ex and I to work in departments that might have to share ""air"" at some point in time.  They didn't seem to care when I was just a customer counter associate and he trained me to be his backup for when he was on vacation. Like I said, I'm sure my situation is different than others, but they do frown upon employee's seeing other employee's, management or not."
good,A typical day at UPS consist of hard work and a attention to detail the entire shift.
good,It was difficult working there because you are made to feel like your opinions did not mattered and would not really be even considered to help better the morale in your work area with that being an issue it was a hard place to work because you need to be in an environment where you can at least smile and be happy.
good,"A typical work day is all work non stop. I learned the process that mail goes through. The management is ok. co workers come in all sorts. they ire anybody. But overall, the co workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with transportation because there are so many people working there. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I got to work at night. this enabled me to get things done during the day."
good,"Although compensation can be low, the job itself helps for people who want to make a career out of being a driver."
good,A typical day at UPS is busy fast paste and on going issues regarding customers delievries
good,"UPS. Is a good place to work. It had health benefits, pay for college, and give time off when needed. It takes allots to be fired. just come in everyday do as asked to do. Management didn't like me. cause they could not fire me."
good,"worked as a customs broker in new brunswick, horrible salaries compared to market reference. Definitely is one of the best technology companies out there."
good,"Worked the very early am shift at 3am, worked on unloading packages with co workers, had 20 minutes break only.  I enjoyed the company of co workers as well as the day went by very quickly-kept busy."
good,"The UPS store that I am at is an easy laid back job. Problem is that it does not pay me enough to live. I am able to sit around on the internet all day if I want. I get a customer from time to time that is a pain to deal with, but over all I don't have many problems. I feel like they do a good job in trying to train me with everything that I need to know. There is a lot of training videos and that can really wear someone down, but I understand that they are needed. "
good,I enjoy the fast pace work requirements. Great team members and management. No room for advancement which has lead me to pursue other opportunities.
good,"Co-workers a great, parking and riding a bus into work after you find a parking spot and pass the metal detectors takes too much of your time which you don't get paid for.Only at the Worldport location."
good,"Loved this job, liked everyone I worked with, had to leave because I was having a baby."
good,Typical day at work was basically making sure the customers were being taking care of. Organization is key when sorting. I always made sure to stay organized and on top of my work. I learned you have to be patient when dealing with people because it can become a little stressful. My co-workers were great always new that if they needed extra help I would help them I had good relationships with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the day I really didnt have one. I came in to work did my job and left just that simple. The most enjoyable part of the day was talking with customers and hearing great reviews about my self and building friendships.
good,"Job was ok. Wanted more out of a job. Learned more time management skills. co-workers were ok, the management could of been better"
good,The toughest part of this job is motivating the union workers.
good,"Long hours, tough if you had a family . But also great pay and great benefits"
good,"loaded trucks with packages, sorting, etc. fast paced job, great team work environment, hardest part of the job was sorting for each truck."
good,"The description of the job is as follows:"
good,Participate in the processing of new shipments and help the team to keep the receiving and back stock area clean and organized and Answer customer concerns and questions and provide information on shipping procedures and policies alone with Ensure each customer receives outstanding service by mystery shop standards.
good,A great job for someone thats in school. The pay isn't that great but if you do the job you will have a secure job.
good,"During a typical night at ups, i go into work to earn every cent i can within 3-4 hours per day shift. Its hard and grueling at night, from picking up 150 lbs-200 lbs packages at time inside of a 53 footer flat bed trailor. The hardest part of the night is mainly employees breaking their backs lifting those packages from men and women only for say a pay wage of $10.00 a hour. For me over the 5 years i should of been at $13.00 but im sitting at $12.00 now. Management is poor at times, But the most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers we get to know each other and bond. What i learned is to always give 110% no matter that others use you for your hard efforts cause it will get notice and just be a leader and supporter."
good,"A typical day would be loading trucks as well as irregular orders, without miss loading any packages. There's rarely time for breaks however since the flow of productivity is usually non-stop. I've learned also, always to remain a good Samaritan in my business of work, and to respect all employees, co-workers,  and managers in regards of professionalism; knowing my position in group discussions, and properly choosing how and what to say whenever I am required to be cooperative."
good,"ok place to work, not ideal if you are trying to advance. seems people do not retire or you have to know someone"
good,"this place can be both ideal or a terrible place to be depending on your attitude, bosses always complain no matter how much work you do.  they also do not pay enough for the work being done"
good,"high pressure, unrealistic goals, poor management team, corporate numbers game at its finest. Pushes safety but no value in the work force."
good,"The company send people in different cities places to work for other companies. Management is good, I haven't had a problem."
good,"I would arrived early in the morning for the preloader position and go to my assigned area.  After the conveyor belt had started the packages would be sorted and loaded according to their vehicle, placed on the correct shelf making sure to have the label facing in one of the excepted ways in chronological order, and marked with the corresponding number.  For the unloader position I would arrive in the early evening and unload all the vehicles that arrived with packages that needed to be sent out for delivery.  For the driver helper position I would ride along with the delivery drivers during the peak holiday season and help deliver packages."
good,Being a UPS girl really made me realize how much you have to watch your back.
good,"great place to work "
good,I loved working with ups until we lost our contract and another company took over and started showing favortism towards certain people.I miss my co workers.
good,short hrs. only part time. more hrs during peak season. high volume and high demand. short breaks
good,"Load/unload trucks, sort out packages for shipment, place things according to the labels, using machines such as the fork lift & dolly on the daily basics, and keeping my paste fast."
good,"I went on this job as a temp and was hired on permanent. The thing about this is that it was a company that was contracted as a call center for UPS company and you couldn't excel in this company to a higher pay rate. In order to get into another position, you had to move into another department but every job there was the same pay rate no matter what department you moved too.  The only thing you could benefit from another position was to come into work at a different time."
good,A typical day of work consists of reporting into an unloading supervisor followed by going into a trailer with a remote control conveyor belt and rapid unloading boxes. Physically it sucked in the beginning but after several months your body gets used to it and you get very strong well worth it. We unloaders lifted 50-100lbs boxes in rapid succession for about 4hr with 1 10minute break in between. It paid well until you had to pay union dues. That was probably the biggest reason I left. Management for the most part was seen as reliable and driven. They will push you especially during the holidays. Getting sent home many times to lack of business was upsetting.towards the end. The most enjoyable part of the job is to have supervisors compliment you on how fast you move the materials since you had to move 1300 boxes an hour.
good,"Company with great benefits,very physical job. This job expects and demands a lot out of you!!!"
good,doesn't start good.  The waiting list for drivers is ridiculous.  The staff and management team won't stop hitting on you.  Worse then any place I've ever seen as far as that goes.
good,"4 hours of non stop moving, at a fast pace"
good,it is  a productive working place with lots of new situations to learn every day
good,"This is a very strenuous position and if you aren't mentally and physically ready for this job, you are going to hate it and not enjoy it at all."
good,Same routine all the time. Very physical job. Strong union and comradary among workers.
good,Ok place to work fast pace. Great workout while work. Very repetitious.
good,"Loading trucks in warehouse then heading out on route for delivery and pick ups, very busy physical work."
good,"ensuring package care."
good,"Everyday I manage the busiest area in the building.  It is my duty to delegate tasks to my employees and make sure I move them to the work quickly and efficiently.  In the twelve years that I have been doing this job I have learned to be assertive and to always make sure my employees know who the boss is.  I need thick skin in order to do this job efficiently."
good,I really liked working here I just did not like not being able to move up in the company after being there 2+ years.
good,The hardest part of the job is being afraid to ask a question.
good,"Winter and holiday time busy, busy, busy, packages and presents. Its that time of the year. I learned that people do sweat in the winter. Management may be scarce, too. But co-workers lookout for one another for you to get a break. Winter is not the worst part, since you can cool down fast while in a trailer, But the Summer time is torturous, no chance of cooling down. The holiday time might lighten up some, but packages keeps flowing. Wow, time does fly while you're there, cause you don't have time to look-up, that's a good thing."
good,It's a repetitive job where you sort or load packages nightly.
good,typical day is to unload trucks as fast as humanly possiblle
good,"use it to go to school or continuing school, if your looking to grow with the company they almost demand a degree"
good,Good company to work for as long as you stay out of management.  Working as a union employee is the only way you are safe at this company.
good,"Working as fast you can to get the job done."
good,UPS is a place where you can grow in your physical capacities.
good,"ambiente molto stimolante"
good,You start about 10: Am and move at a very fast pace through out the day. You meet very interesting people and stay in great shape from all the running up and down stairs.
good,I work 9- 10 hours a day and I am the FT supervisor for safety and compliance.  The hardest part of my job is that I am on call and the most enjoyable part of my job is is training employees and developing them for the next level in their career.
good,Worked With The Company For 9yrs. Great Place To Work For Benefits And Future Planning.
good,My day started at 8.00 sorting my packages into postal codes for easy deliveries and I was on the road by 8.30. I worked on average a 10 hour day. I also worked every other Saturday. I had a good working relationships with my regular customers.
good,"Hardest part of the job, when your're having conversation with irrate customers."
good,"Scan People coming in and out of the facility."
good,"A typical day of work consists of walking back and forth in the same area, Checking bags for mis-sorts and removing old labels from the bag. I learned that everyone who is of importance there started at the same position I have and  worked their way up but it took time."
good,"Working at UPS is fast paced, as the nature of warehousing dictates. However the amount of work required for this part-time position exceeds the time allowed. This causes difficult decision making when it comes to eliminating a task to make room for the absolute necessary ones. The most enjoyable part of the job has always been the people who work the hardest for the company. I appreciate their daily efforts and work with them to make sure they have the proper tools to do the job safely. Next to the military I believe I do more before 6:00am than most people do in a regular 8 hour shift. I have an unlimited amount of energy when it comes to my own workload and doing whatever it takes to get the job done."
good,"UPS offers many great benefits, but the caveat is that management is full of rude, crass, self-important individuals with little or no people skills.  Each level at UPS treats lower level employees like sub-human scum.  Good employees are never recognized at UPS."
good,It begins at 9am and ends about 7pm of driving and delivering packages. I learned that you have to take care of yourself there and don't let the other stuff control your day. Also working hard here gets you more work not a life outside of it. Management should try and learn things about the workers and know that something is not right with them. Not just if the can get the work done and not care if they're ok or not. That there are far and few that you can depend on at this job for help if you need it. The hardest part about this job is not being able to have a family life but on the weekend. Trying to make it to a kid school activity is very hard when you get off so late. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers I saw everyday of the week.
good,"Start out with low pay for a few hours a day, it's hard work. After about 90 days, benefits kicked in, very nice. The building itself was older than dirt. Management was inadequate, there was no stability, only real thing I enjoy were the co-workers I worked around with."
good,"Good job security but may not provide good career advancement."
good,Properly scan and load all packages into a trailer. Make sure the the walls are tight and stable. Wrap up trucks to be sent out for shipment.
good,"Back when Roadnet was owned by UPS, we were owned by a company that didn't necessarily understand how to run a software developer, but definitely knew how to treat its employees well.  Since the take over by Thoma-Bravo, we are run by a company that knows exactly how to run a software company, and treats the employees like garbage.  We went from being a software company with a sales division to a sales company with a software division, and the change is palpable.  Former software developers turned entrenched management have not helped the situation, being primarily more concerned with the potential for a large payout when the company is sold off again, rather than making meaningful changes at the company.  The only positive that I can say is that more than 40 hours per week is rarely required of any developer, although it may happen on a few occasions."
good,I was working only as a temporary employee so my review should be measured with others.
good,"Hard work shift, learned how to use scanners, management  wasn't that helpful, co-workers friendly, hard part was walking into work, I enjoyed going home."
good,Very physically demanding job.  Excellent health benefits.  Co-workers were very friendly as well as some of the management.  Great job to take if seeking advancement in the company.  They like to promote from within.
good,I would package up boxes and help shift them out and did graphic design projects for customers.
good,"It’s all about production, production and more production."
good,it was a good part time job with flexible hours and a great workout for your body!
good,"I would get to work and go to my assigned work truck and wait for the package's to get-a-coming. I worked night shift, so I would load the truck from night until the early morning. I learned organization and time management. My management was very cool, I could have moved up in the company according to my supervisor he would tell me to be a little more efficient with my load and I could move up. I stepped up but decided that warehouse wasn't for me and decided to go back to school. My co-workers ranged from beginning workers to seasoned vets it was a so so experience with them depending on what night it was. Interesting though the warehouse made a lasting impression on my young budding work career. The hardest part of my job was adjusting my sleep pattern in the beginning. The most enjoyable was mimicking and learning from some of the older management and workers. "
good,"Early morning shift - great employee loyalty and focus on goals and job satisfaction. - great group of people to work with - strong focus on safety."
good,"It was a fun place to work while I was there. Besides the fact it was 20 miles from home, each way, I loved the customers. The satisfying feeling of knowing that you are helping people, is what made packing and shipping fragile goods a fun task."
good,"Don't freak out if you get the feeling that your just a number at UPS, because you are."
good,On a daily basis I sort and load hundreds of boxes of various weight and sizes. My job is very physically demanding
good,It's at least 4 hours of constant physical activity. I learned the process of shipping packages. Management is self absorbed. Co-workers are cool. Hardest part of the job is long days short breaks.
good,It is a fast-paced job that keeps you on your toes the moment the shift starts to the second you clock out.
good,U.P.S. is a great place to work. It also has a great attitude towards their workers. The harder you work the faster you climb the ladder of success.
good,"Not typical job, everyday different amount of work to be done. Can be physically hard"
good,I was totally unfocused on this job between school and practice. i did get around and learn bout jersey though.
good,typical day at work..go in and try to keep positive attitude
good,Responsible for delievering and sorting packages on top of packages daily
good,Days consisted of loading boxes onto delivery trucks ensuring safety of package contents. Workers talked very little outside of breaks.
good,"The company is a good company to work for, but you are not duly compensated for the pressure of the work."
good,Work in assembly line & make parts for oil-drilling companies
good,"It was hard to get off and on the truck, it was a nice stress-free job to only have to deliver packages all day."
good,"My position at UPS was unique and challenging in that I was able to participate and lead a wide variety of operations including account management, hazmat, environmental issues, facilities issues, personnel management, security and training. The daily operations centered around inventory orders primarily and all other duties fall secondary. I learned about many new departments and their functions and was able to reach out and make business contacts with many of them."
good,I enjoyed my time here the only problem was their is no room for advancement.
good,is come to work at and all times with a positive movement and do the best at your work and be safe.
good,Load and sort packages while managing 7 to 8 employee's on an daily basis.
good,"You clock in adn unload boxes from about 4 the trailors, you get two 15 min breaks.After your done unloading all of your trucks that you've been assigned to. You can clock out and leave."
good,typical day at work is busy.
good,"the corperate, needs to rething it's self, thats why there loseing the battle,and war between corperates,1 they are not getting the big picture, there not,standing back ,and see it all ,they dont here what drivers are saying about the needs of customers,needs and whants"
good,"co workers were great, customers were great, area was great, and benefits as well were great, but no room for advancement, everyone there had been there for years and to advance someone would had to actually just walked out or disappeared."
good,UPS has great benifits and thats why a lot of people work there for. i cant complain with too much more even though i could but overall it was a typical warehouse job.
good,"The hardest part about being an employee and better yet a supervisor for UPS is being able remain tactful in aggressive and deliberant situations. You have to be a person of character, morals, ethics and certainty. In order to train someone and expect the best for someone else, you must be able to do the same for yourself. A very good place to work and create a future for yourself!"
good,Several of my co-workers and myself consistently do FAR more work then even some of the full time employees. Apparently being 173% effective isnt enough to gain employment. I was told they are waiting for us to finish our temp contracts and yet they hired 1 and tried to hire another temp because of their personal relations with an HR staff. Why am I getting paid the same wage to do 73% MORE work then others. Tempted with full time employment then hear nothing for over a month while others are hired because they have been there 3 summers as a temp....
good,"I enjoy meeting new people and assisting them with their needs, always smiling, always cross/up-selling."
good,A typical day at work would include unloading numerous UPS trucks. I learned how to properly lift. My co-workers were hard working. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alone.
good,UPS is a good company to work for but not enough hours plus the pay was not enough .
good,"Very fast paced work environment, repetitive. Very good place to work if you stick around for the long haul."
good,my job was only seasona; so it was very busy and i didnt really like it. the pay wasnt good either.
good,"I was hired as an administrative assistant and ended up turning into an office sales manager. That was never a title that officially was given to me, but it might as well have been. I was doing the job that three other people should have been doing and working from the office and home a combined 50 hours. I received almost zero assistance in the tasks I was asked to complete that I had never done before. I also came into the industry with almost zero knowledge so having to learn everything on my own was very difficult. Then I ended up getting let go because the company decided to downsize and my boss was so cheap he never put me on payroll after working for him for 10months I was still getting paid by the temp agency that placed me there. Overall I liked the learning experience and it taught me a lot, but it also taught me that not everyone knows how to manage others correctly."
good,great starter job for school. A great job for working at while in college
good,"unloading, loading trucks at a fast pace. pretty good management, co workers are fairly tolerable."
good,"This job taught me a lot. One of the things it taught me was patience. Some days it was exciting to be there and some days I wanted to run out of there. The Customers made my days enjoyable. As for my manager, she had me more as her maid than employee."
good,Fun place to work. Good for those going to school or in need of a part time job for extra cash.
good,UPS is an upscale time sensitive workplace hat pushes you to the limit and order to make timely deliveries and also managment and employees do not have a good rep between the two. Its a constant battle between each other. they both have lack of respect between one another.
good,"Was a seasonal worker. The position was very busy daily. My coworkers were very helpful, since this was my first job."
good,"Working at UPS is difficult during the Christmas season, but if you can get through it in one piece the job benefits pay off for the rest of the year."
good,fast past and keep it moving with alot of cool things there i think
good,Very busy place only intended for people who like to work hard
good,Decent pay
good,It was a great start to mold me to prepare for future corp. jobs in life.
good,"I worked at UPS for 2 years. When I started it was great, offered Overtime for about 2 weeks. i worked the preload sift and most employees were part time. Its a great job for the college student with no bills or kids. Not so much for the parent with kids and bills. Expect to make about 100 per week. They offer great benefits though."
good,ups frieght was a ok job to start outta high school but it was only part time and it would run outta work during the winters and there is no job serurity or advancements for parttimeers which i dislike. i am currently laid off
good,"Supervisors and managers need to Solve problems and talk to employees if they are late instead of punishing them. I'm tired of every job punishing employees of the hard effort, grind and the hard work they do and they have to do better. We all here working and our paychecks getting reduced cause we are doing the best we can. I'm tired being forced to do better since I'm doing average good already."
good,"If you like to organize this is the job for you. Sorting mail, shipping packages, and selling shipping supplies. You also sell things like cards and gift boxes."
good,Strong Team setting and good place to gain experience to advance carrier. Management is good and supportive on all levels.  Very professional in upper management.
good,"This company offer great benefits, work with you on your job hours n your home hours. There is always a way to move up in this company. Steady work!!!"
good,That wasent treating me right I drop a big heavy metal thing on my foot in they didn’t do nun about just said walk it off I didn’t feel like I was getting paid right to
good,Just be willing to work and you will be good. Busy fast paced environment lots of opportunities to get hours benefits are awesome. Gloves are important
good,This is not cool you guys are making me put a review for every job that comes up I don’t really feel like doing it’s already hard enough trying to get a job this is just irritating
good,".Everything is very fast paste,and unpredictable, always on the go"
good,You will be worked to your max physical capacity. They do not care if you are sick and want you to work regardless of what state you are in 6 days a week. There is a 30 day evaluation period before your job is protected by the union and you have to sign up to join the union.
good,never got paid for travel time to the district I delivered jumper and not paid for return to the base site was 4 hrs total in travel time in company truck delivery to distribute center
good,I worked for a UPS Store and this was a very flexible job. Different task come with working here. Each customer is a unique experience which helps you think differently for each situation.
good,"It has been a less than positive experience with them, given that they offer very little hours, the company experiences rampant hazing. And there's poor communication when it comes to scheduling, benefits and pay."
good,this is a very good place to start if you never had a job before. best thing they had to offer was teamster union and the benefits.. its hard work with little pay
good,supervisors especially full time are tough and environment is sometimes unsafe and uncomfortable. Work is always hard when loading trucks but they make it harder everyday.
good,generally a good company to work for...strong emphasis on employee safety and well being...many people with a lot of experience to learn from...strong employee loyalty
good,J ai été très vite intégré à l équipe et tout le monde étaient sympathiques
good,I feel like I'm working to help the Big guys save and I'm getting slaved they don't pay enough for the workers hard work the supervisors gets overtime full week checks and the people who does all the work get nothing maybe 2slises of Pizza once a month
good,"While I was finishing my education at St. Clair College. I was working Part-time at The Ups Store. After finishing my education I ended up buying out the owner to become an owner myself."
good,Working at UPS was a mind blowing experience. You have to be prepared to work everyday that you come in. Honestly the hardest part about the job was knowing I’d have to do the same thing again the next day without knowing if the workload would be lightened or intensified. The most enjoyable part was the great work experience it gave me. It also made me increase my work ethic.
good,"If you can  take the abuse from management. You can work there cause the pay and benefits are really good. But holidays you won’t see or enjoy your family. Busiest time of year, forced to work."
good,Decent no problems just bad Communication I didn’t really know when I was supposed to work they would call me in the morning and ask if I can work today
good,"It's very hard work and they mess with your hours when it's not busy season, but the benefits are some of the best around, if you can manage to stick with it. ."
good,"Over all satisfied with everything except the pay , I felt taken advantage of working a lot of hours and not getting paid fairly . During peak season the break times were unfair ."
good,For a professional company they really know how to screw up payroll.I never felt that I needed to pay for my hard-earned money. The people that are in charge could care less about the workers.
good,"Not a bad place. Fast pace work"
good,"This is a wonderful job. Always moving around, there’s always something to do that will keep you busy. Management was good and they pay decent. Gives a good workout"
good,As a part-time supervisor you are getting under paid compared to most other logistic company. Management type is authoritative type of management. Very little leadership and communication skills within management.
good,"One of the best jobs I’ve ever had. They gave me the schedule I always wanted, off on Saturday & Sunday and working Monday through Friday! The best schedule someone could ask for!"
good,"And if it were your job to organize it, you'd go crazy. there is a total lack of accountability and drivers must spend extra time looking for misplaced packages if not return later after they have been uncovered. Time is money and frivers depend heavily on package handlers who just cant seem to get it right."
good,"Just helped deliver packages. Not much more to it. People were friendly. All UPS employees were kind and helpful. Work is physically demanding, but they don't give enough hours (usually around 25/week)."
good,UPS is a difficult place to work for several reasons. The hours are tough especially for the preload shift. The peak season during the winter is stressful. The employees are hard to work with as well as some of the managers. However it pays very well and offers some of the best benefits around.
good,"Hard worker also an easy learner very energetic adapted the the environment quickly, worked well with others, The experience taught me more for the future of working with other companies with the same background..If i could i will do it all over again!"
good,"I work as an unloader. I lift heavy objects Monday through Friday. I'm glad we always have Saturday and Sunday off so I can rest. UPS allows to relatively quickly move up in position, or change the job you have."
good,The Union has a strong hold over UPS. This means that there are opportunities to make strong salaries with no education required. But you will be forced to swim union bullying and politics.
good,Management was nice and easy to work with. The culture was laid back. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers and helping people.
good,"You carry boxes to houses, some of them are heavier than others, some of the houses have long driveways or other sorts of architecture that makes deliveries slightly more difficult than others."
good,Very physical job very cold very tired but great environment great helpful co workers hour pretty reasonable good supervisor good benefits stretch before work
good,"A typical day had a robust work load. At the job I balanced a work load of recruiting, scheduling, writing memos and sourcing. There was not much room to grow with the company, however gained a lot of professional hands on experience to take with me in the next occupation."
good,"It's easy to get the job. But what no one tells you is that you need to make book for the union. But...…. to make those days for the union is hard. You need to make 40 days of work in order to be in the union. But those are the hardest 40 days to make. Especially when they don't have work for you. As I write this, I have only made 4 days on the books since Oct that I was accepted into the company."
good,"J’ai peu travaillé là bas "
good,The money they pay you for the work is not worth it. So if you don’t have kids this could be money to save on the side but you’ll need a second job. The hours are sucky.
good,"The job is incredibly physically demanding and the managers seem to care only about numbers but its understandable to a degree. If you stay long enough, the wages get better and the benefits are absurdly good."
good,"when i worked for them it was fun, you were always moving and loading the trucks up. there wasn't a time where i didn't want to show up for work, i was looking forward waking up and going straight to work!"
good,I like the freedom to travel at the rate that I want. As long as I complete all of my deliveries I can take my time. I also like the time that I start everyday.
good,"The job was fast paced and enjoyable, but they frequently cancelled work. I received no work from then for a full month straight.  I worked very hard but didn't feel that it was rewarded."
good,"Boxes are everywhere."
good,Ups truly isn’t for everyone. If you like contsantly moving then this will be good for you. I personally didn’t like it because I work the night shift which is 10:20-3:40 it takes a lot out of you.
good,its a okay work place not what you think it is.Alot harder then alot of other jobs.pay was okay.not of alot of work hours.wish it could of been more work hours
good,Felt it was a sink or swim learning environment. Fast paced work environment. Feel it was hard to receive help when asked for it. Think that training should be better geared to help do job successfully
good,they will work you as hard as possible. they pay is horrible. the benefits are the best I have ever seen. the people are amazing friendship i have made will last lifetime.
good,"Hard work"
good,Was a pre loader was a great before school work job. Just not as many hours as I thought even for peak season. Your either barely worked or over worked there’s no in between.
good,Definitely a little overwhelming when you first start but once you get the hang of it.people there are very nice especially the ones that have been there for a long time
good,"Good While It Lasted Worked 3 Shift, Keeps You Busy And Focused Strictly On Job. Hourly Pay Is Good Plus Overtime. Friendly And Helpful Coworkers. No Dress Code Also"
good,Most days i loaded and unloaded packages from trucks so they could reach there final destination. More than half of the days i was scheduled to work i was sent home because they had too many people.
good,Helped driver to deliver packages to residents and businesses. Only seasonal is only problem. Very hard to get full time with company. Other than that was good experience.
good,"My job as a driver helper was good, making sure the customers received their packages on time. My driver was always on point with the locations and drop off areas."
good,I worked with a UPS driver that texts me the location of where we would be meeting at for the delivery day. while in route we would make stops in each neighborhood and deliver to each house.
good,Buena empresa responsabilidad con el cliente y con el empleado
good,"This job is mon stop and the shift will fly by, which is great. However it is. Very physical. You have to be able to maintain you strength and stamina throughout the shift and be ready to follow up the next day."
good,The company needs to improve its employee relationships and advancement within the company. Reduction in hours as business needs does not manifest into employee happiness.
good,I enjoyed working at UPS it was a good learning Experience I got flexible working hours  I  often worked double shifts I learned a lot about handling packages and how to pro
good,I had fun with the couple of programming projects with had but the tech used was a little out of date. would recommend if you want to get some experience under your belt.
good,"A typical day at UPS Freight consists of customer interaction, coordination with the operations staff and general administrative functions that will gain new business and maintain our existing customer base. The culture is geared towards supporting the UPS Ground enterprise overall. The most challenging part of my current position is the lack of corporate direction as we head into the future, where the most exciting part has always been training new staff and helping my contemporaries with special projects and products in my voluntary roles as a ""Subject Matter Expert"" and as the Regional Sales Mentor."
good,UPS is a great place to learn the value of teamwork. Stamina is key. It taught me how essential reading the fine print is and how to think on my toes.
good,"Hard work very high pace . Not a easy job very stressful but I liked it . Only good thing is  the benefits. Seniority means nothing, For moving up in the Company."
good,Up and down the steps loader and unloading was one of the top supervisor at the job went out of state with them a couple times move tub left and on plane
good,"Sometimes deliveries are difficult because you can have a package for someone behind a fence , and they have a dog there’s not really much you can do."
good,"It’s an ok place. Nice people. Loading is tough. The management is not the best, there was always a new supervisor every two-three weeks. Small sorts is easier but can be boring."
good,Worked there during Christmas. I worked at the New Stanton hub. At times it was very busy. My pay was good but I did not receive any benefits. I was a dispatcher.
good,"I enjoyed having learned how to drive larger delivery vehicles and newer delivery experiences. "
good,Great opportunity for a college student! They have an awesome education program that helps with tuition and housing. This is great for high school graduates who can’t afford to go to college right off the bat. The company helps you through everything!
good,Cool it was just i would get alil tired and the work was fast it was easy to learm good training ans the people helped you get to where you needed to be
good,It was as fine job the manger was little off and the days went slow.the hardest part of the job was how slow day was going.The others there are very helpful.
good,"UPS is fully union for worker not management which will cut down a lot of job uncertainty. Standard work hours (early morning and evening). Management is ok, there is a lot of BS sometimes but very much a team effort."
good,"When it was type for them to hire me on , they stopped paying me for 3 weeks before I decided to quit because I was working for free. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with why I wasn’t receiving pay and also couldn’t give me any exact answers."
good,It was a great work out experience for me. I just didnt like how unsanitary the factories are especially in New York. Hearing stories of how they are in other countries I always wondered why they dont do that here in America.
good,"Everything is rather disorganized, and you will not know whether or not you are working that day until you get a call in the morning. This job will tire your mind and legs."
good,"good work atmosphere , good training, physical and fast pace but really easy to catch on  what I like best abut the job is the company lets you train everywhere in the company"
good,you will need to be committed to working for this company it takes years to to get a higher position and a small raise it is a great company in the long run if you are willing to work 10+ years with not that great pay
good,"Typical day of work is 9-10 h.It is fun outside to looking for house numbers but is a hard work too.I learned north part of Chicago area,learn how to use maps."
good,"delivering stuff all day helping out with the holiday season and You just can't see it all. However curious and completist we all sometimes get as tourists, there are certain places that are forbidden, if not plain impossible, to visit, whether because they're too dangerous for humans to tread or but"
good,The customer was very polite and well respectful and it was a great job easy very ongoing I liked it a lot my manager was very nice and respectful and helpful
good,The management of the company is a good working environment. Perhaps the company should recognize the issues with the employee's time and working hours. There is no set schedule for the employee's that work in the driver helper department of the company.
good,working a seasonal job at ups was actually really fun when everything ran smoothly which was most of the time but if they mess something up its going to really mess up your work flow.
good,They give you great hours they meet you were needed they are very respectful responsible you work with one person it’s  seasonal job you makeover time
good,The company cared about employees but the work hours where brutal and the amount of work one person was required to do was unreasonable and the supervisor would let people slack off even leave early
good,Too much time on meeting... Every morning spend 1 hour on meeting even nothing was happened and not production issue. Just talk about personal events and waste of time.
good,"Good company and benefits ,needed better pay and Sorted packages to destination all 50 states. And Unloaded truck's .Took a sort test every few months and studied sort chart of each state and color belt of which box goes where ."
good,Tell you that you will work 5 days and 5 hours a day..but then they try to kerp you there like hostage and work like 8 hours..then tell you a day you are off is mandatoty to come in..4 hours earlier then normal schedule and keep you for hours..at interview i was told 5 days a week 4am to 9am. And sometimes extra hour overtime..complete lie..only good thing is time and half after 5 regulsr hours.
good,"One of the best jobs ive worked for highly recommended "
good,Every hub varies. Just hope you get good managers who values hard work. Some hubs do. Ore work than others but at the end of the day it  really come down to your personal relationship with your managers.
good,They need to manage better. They also need to give everyone a break no matter what. They don't give breaks and make you work 10+ hours and it isn't fair to everyone that is working there.
good,"UPS is a great company, the management is not that great , I rather the employees get alittle more punishments on what they do. I have had problems with management and the employees. I honestly didn’t like package handling but that was my first job and I would like to get a job to help others."
good,So far it's an ok job. No complaints. We load the truck with packages and boxes and go out and deliver them. And we don't come back until everything is done. So we work long hours sometimes. Fine with me just as long as I'm getting paid.
good,"The Potential is there, that why I choose it as a career job however they have some old racist ways with them. The racist managers makes the company look bad. Some of the racist people been with the company for 20 years so tell yourself if it’s the racist people or it the company itself but I also met some nice people in the company but in a different market. If UPS can get rid of the racist managers that in the company today, it’s possible can be a great company to work for. However, They HR  and they Finance Dept. needs to get better also too.  They be messing up people checks and also mess up my checks, they why I no longer there. Great Benefits thou. If you in the Union you will pay nothing for the benefits and only paid Dues. Management paid as little as a dinner for one, real cheap. Also easy for Union to Advance to 80k year positions in the company. That great for people who’s didn’t go to college. For management it’s hard to advance specially if you a minority."
good,"Depending on your job title the job can be very physically demanding.  If you work in the office then your job is not physically demanding at all.  If you're in the warehouse or driving package car then the job is extremely physically demanding.  "
good,I think ups should help there driver's more with help package's in stead of having the loader's just put box's ever where not fair for the driver's and need more support and want them to be done by a time they said it's not right.
good,"Better improve company policy."
good,"Even though there were co-workers with whom made the environment a better work place, the management, from belt supervisor to facility supervisor was terrible. The supervisors would constantly place blame for low productivity on the lower tier workers of targeted areas in the building. This was coupled with the poor decision making skills of the supervisors, which would lead to thousands of packages being sent to one area in particular, my area, lead to the resultant demise of the belt and the building on a daily basis. The new hires lacked proper training from the supervisors and as such would cost the business additional shipping cost."
good,Good place to work typical days usually start really early there is alot of lifting pulling and tugging that goes on will get hands dirty I'd recommend gloves
good,I had to quit for how they treated us. I understood it had to be fast-paced but a 10-minute break only for 5 straight hours of heavy lifting and getting yelled at if you weren't fast enough was not worth $11 and your health.
good,I liked working for UPS but the hours and schedule was not suitable. But i would go back with different hours. It was fast paced and laborous. People that worked there had fun.
good,"Everyday be prepared to sweat"
good,"The warehouse matched the temperature of outside. If it was cold outside it was cold inside and the same fir when it was hot outside. The work, loading the trucks, wasn't too realistically hard, but I did not find it too pleasant myself."
good,Obtain some experience with loading and unloading the trucks was able to get the job done in a timely matter and I was able to multitask. Did a lot a heavy weight and I also did a lot of shrimwrapping use the forklift.
good,"no room for advancement"
good,"On a regular  day at work I would show up  at 2am Monday through Friday. Go to the building they call the village where we load trucks. usually people don’t come in for work for whatever reasons so I am usually loading about 3 to 5 cars at one time. Reading a little sticker thats slapped on the backs it tells you the truck it’s supposed to be loaded on and also where on the truck it needs to go. For example, the truck is labeled from 1000 to 8000 on the sticker it would give a number like 2465. You woild then look for the area and set the package on the shelf or on the floor depending on the size. I do this until we are done woth all the trailers. We dont get dont until about 10:30 depending on if the rruck drivers are on time."
good,"te star. management niet flexibel, tunnel visie. goede opleider, leuke mensen. kunnen niet veranderen en dat kost ze talent."
good,Your coworkers is what makes the job fun most of the time. A lot of jams and issues with re spots on the line. Minimum pay for strenuous work.........
good,"Basically threw me by myself after a few days and put me on some of the biggest, heaviest trucks and I just wasn’t ready for it. I ended up throwing my back out really bad after one day of work and decided the job wasn’t worth the physical pain. I know they help a lot of people find careers but if you were hurting like I was you wouldn’t have wanted to go back either."
good,"However, when I was employed there a supervisor and employee ate my lunch sounds like sooo,but I get upset cause it's such a demanding job you have to eat ..I was told sorry ,but still noone replaced it so I walked ,to cool off ,and now I'm on the do not hire list if this is protocol then shame on you UPS.."
good,"I fairly have normal days at work but look to have more fun and I learn lots of new things, the main things that bother me is the supervisors as they can all be frustrating."
good,I haven't been working for ups for long but it's an okay job I'm learning new things as I work and for that I'm happy but still alot more things I want to learn
good,"I felt like they didn’t pay enough for as much work as we did but then again it was only 4 hours I worked so I can’t really complain, I just want a better job"
good,Great company give you the chance to continue your education or any trade school you want go so many great opportunities if you become a permanent staff
good,You will definitely be working hard while you are there. There is a chance for potential growth. They focus on their employees and appreciation for their work ethic.
good,I had to help the driver delivery packages to customers. Make sure that the customers get the package or leave in office if at an apartment. Scan packages
good,"Although UPS promotes from within, the company often fails to promote the most qualified people. Most individuals begin as part-time, operations employees, handling packages and/or supervising individuals who handle packages. Regardless of eduction or previous related work experience, the road to a full-time, bonus-eligible opportunity, with UPS can be full of bureaucratic and political potholes"
good,The manager was always ready to support and help. I learnt a lot of new things and techniques. The pace was fast and no room for errors. Great time with the co-workers
good,"war super, top team, immer freundlich, sehr empfehlenswert"
good,"Overall it was ok I liked my experience a great place to learn , but they need to pay more their employees it was too long and too complicated to get higher in ranks and to archive the status of driver and get more hours."
good,"This job is manageable but its hard on the body, especially during the peak season. Long hours and if you don't mind manual labor this job is for you."
good,I enjoyed working at ups because everyone was always always and enjoying their time but also because is was much like a work out so I was basically getting paid to work out
good,the job was very good pay was good for someone young of age the only problem is supervisors were very difficult to work with while some were ok others are not ok to work with at the job as they will try to make you do other things that you are not fit for
good,"Great co-workers, flexible time. "
good,Very hectic job. When applying it made it seem like I would get $10 8 hour shifts but turns out you only get maybe 4 at first until you start doing your over time. It’s very fast paced in my opinion for no reason. They would want you to finish an entire truck in 15 minutes. There’s also no breaks.
good,"The experience is great if you don't mind the physical demand on your body. The hours are not the greatest as I feel it's not enough outside of that you learn alot about how packages are shipped, and the people are friendly, amazing benefits as well."
good,I only worked in a seasonal role in the warehouse with the company. Very fast paced and physical job. Great if you're looking for extra income and exercise at the same time.
good,I liked it but there isn't enough hours. Loading trucks is challenging and fun.  Great job for a high school student or college student.  Its good exercise working there.
good,It's a good place to start your career you can work and go to school part time you can look for a driver's job a nice place to move up very competitive fast pasting benefits is good.
good,"poorly run and stressful work place but co-workers get you through the shifts with a great laugh, could be ran better if team leaders listened to the workers who do the actual job before making any changes mandatory."
good,I am happy to work here but I need more hours. I would like to feel secure at my job treated with More respect. I am looking for more opportunities and a higher education.
good,"its hard work with a fast paced work environment. You typically work long hours, and doesn't leave much time work family. You are compensated well compared to other similar jobs."
good,"Working at ups at all levels of employment was incredibly stressful and taught me how to work in a fast paced environment. I learned how to communicate effectively as a supervisor to help keep my employees motivated, how to work with union members as management staff, and how to keep checking for potential safety hazards in the workplace. The most difficult part of the job is the physical and mental intensity."
good,"I guess it has it's pros/cons as any job does! Supervisors are aggressive and competitive, but ease up some once they get to know you and respect you if you work your butt off beyond normal expectations. Stand your ground and they back off of ya! The Union won't fight for ya really either, they get their money and that's all that matters."
good,"Great learning experience , everybody was hard working and very helpful if u didnt know coworkers was there to help and teach the correct way to pack boxes"
good,Great salary at ups great people and good staff. They opened teir arms to train and promote good work skills that can further you at ups or life skills.
good,its good works and a lot responsbile and duties. i learned how to forklift also and loading but this part is very work harder from loading i made it by 4 truck rows .
good,"Great benefits, short work day, with a four day week. Could not survive on 15 hours a week. Only real draw is the benefits package. Takes forever to move up in the company."
good,"It is a male dominated environment. Managers can be very hostile and disrespectful. Advancement is not easy you have to be willing to stay for the long haul. Pay increases are minimum, people having been there 10years plus making only $20-25 an hour, part-time hours."
good,at UPS you are taught to work in a fast paced environment. you also learn to work as a team to get the job done. its a really great job with really good benefits.
good,"Bad Sides:"
good,The job that I had was a seasonal job. I am new to the work force and don’t have much experience. It was my first job experience and it was okay for my first experience.
good,"The environment is fast paced, high intensity, and loud. They don't micromanage, and self-starters, problem solvers, and driven individuals that enjoy leading teams to solve time sensitive challanges will do well here."
good,Although working there for about a year and a half the job really showed me to always put in hard work to give the best satisfaction to the customers and to work as a team.
good,Drive around with the driver on their daily routes. Deliver packages. Pick up packages every now and then. Be friendly to customers and be organized. Fast paced.
good,It was filled with drama and you weren’t always guaranteed hours. The supervisors were kinda rude and minded there own business. But the pay was good and the benefits.
good,"Nice job to work at and very fast pace, always a good work out, everybody at work had good team work, and we always were helping each other out, never a dull moment"
good,A typical day working as a package handler is 4+ hours or rigorous physical labor is a dirty and dusty weather based environment. Management is very political within the warehouse. Work place culture is deteriorating and moral boosting things like cookouts or t shirts have been completely cut.  The redeeming quality is the unmatched benefits.
good,"It’s a good jobi like it and it’s a good work out. It’s also a good work environment , a normal day at work means just get used to a 5 star excercise with ups"
good,"Working from 3 AM to 8 AM every morning allowed me to have the whole day to be productive, but the work was brutal and would often require some recovery time after work. The hardest part of the job was the break neck pace they expected for unloading, without incentive for achieving such a pace. If you met their expectations, all they did was raise them. The managers treated the work like a football weight lift and not a job with a reasonable expectation of productivity. "
good,Very good job go to work prepred to work and dont touch them people stuff.  do your job and go home !  Lifting and moving alot of packages to shift around
good,I worked with UPS around the holidays for extra spending money. I never intended to stay with the company permanently. it was fast paced and kept me interested and engaged.
good,"It was okay for the most part, if you want to move up to management you can, just gotta work hard and not mess up. Hrs are not that good tho, around the holidays there better but after they start cutting them"
good,Hard work if its.  Cold it will be. Cold if it's hot it will be hot. Alot of heavy lifting and only part time. Good pay. Can't take any time off within the first year of work
good,If ur looking for something that pays good then this the job for u but its fast paced and rn as of nov 7 we only work 4 hours but black Friday to the first sunday of next year it 6 hours a day 6 days a week with Saturday off
good,C'est ups entreprise qui est vraiment avancée  et qui paie bien
good,I like working at UPS because of the competitive pay and also I like interacting with people as well.  Also I get recognized for my good quality work and I get rewarded for it.
good,Assisted driver with delivery of packages. meet new people good work place move around love the fact the job changes you get use to your route  and the people you meet
good,"I like it there, it is hard to have a balanced life when you work all night and have class all day. If you just need a part time job and have a lot of free time during the day this job is perfect for you."
good,Working at UPS was definitely a challenge. I worked in the warehouse loading and unloading trucks. It was usually one man per truck which is crazy considering the load of work. I was working towards being a driver and right after I past my last test I got injured while lifting 70lb boxes. Overall it was great to be able to experience that kind of work and I definitely have a new level of respect for those who work in that warehouse.
good,"Tough work, but worth it if you're attending or planning on attending college while also working. Takes nine months before you qualify for health insurance though..."
good,"it was a productive place and a very neat work environment, the people where respectful and the management was very professional in handling issue that concerns their employees, the only downside to the job is that the pay is too law compered to similar jobs"
good,Es wird gut bezahlt. Ist aber wirklich ein sehr stressiger und anstrengender Job
good,My time working at UPS was a great experience for me and I have gained an emense amount of skills that will benefit me throughout my entire life. From organizational skills to customer service skills and manual Labor skills are just a few of the ways working for UPS
good,"Working at UPS was the hardest job I had. Being a package handler was very stressful because everything was so fast pace but the money made it worth it, especially overtime."
good,"Work delivering packages in the big brown truck. Physically demanding with some concern for well-being. Work/life balance is poor, as UPS expects you to be available to them for up to 60 hours per week, 14 hours per day if needed. Easy to move to management, but difficult to advance. Making relationships with customers is great."
good,"ambiente di lavoro normale"
good,"Come in on time, Help outstation before work starts, get brief by your supervisor on expectations of the day with some motivation. Work hard but try not to get crush by boxes."
good,"I greatly enjoyed the work at UPS, however, we were extremely understaffed and frequently cut to avoid benefit requirements and overtime. I started as a stocker and within a week gad become a driver."
good,"Great company to work for plenty of hours, great people, always willing to help others, very busy always something to do. Money’s good plenty of overtime."
good,"This job was okay when i strated here, due to going to college for my first year and how short the hours were. it was just a very hard job for very little pay"
good,"I made good money working at UPS, but was treated horrible and unfairly. I really loved servicing the public and did a great job while I was there. The job is very physical but I loved what I was doing. The managers treated us poorly."
good,Under paid for work you do. Benefits after a year but the work is so intense the first couple months no one wants to stay for them. Would recommend if you want to workout at work.
good,OK Place to work part time and have the rest of your day available. The benefits are good. you will have to join the Union and pay dues. Thats about it.  Hope you have a great day
good,I have enjoyed working at UPS I have made great friends. And learned a lot about packaging. I get a workout every shift its fast paced and the hours are great.
good,UPS is a great job just don't become management. Become a driver and stay there like must of the people that's been there for 30 years with great benefits.
good,The breaks are Not long enough as soon as you go on break 5mins later u have to go back to work and it’s not Worth it and the hours are terrible 3hrs a day and sometimes they let u off early with u only working 2 hrs which is also no worth it
good,"can be a fun work place , management a little iffy depending on who you talk too. Never got my work ID after being there almost a full year and never got my union booklet. Union dues are mandatory if they keep you after the season. The weekly pay is awesome but you don't make that much past peak season, may need to supplement with a day time job. Very physically and mentally demanding."
good,Upon beginning my employment here i was very nervous that i wouldnt have the ability to keep up with speed of packages... In theend i ended up one of the most accurate and fast sorters that they had
good,I’m use to loading and unloading big trucks so the labor I have no problem with at all. My only problem is the hours some days you will get off early and sometimes late it’s like you never know an exact time
good,"Company did not offer enough hours to maintain stability."
good,"Always moving/running.  This is a very physical and demand job.  You have to be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.  A typical day was scanning and delivering and/or picking up packages to and from businesses and homes.  If your truck completes  its deliveries early, you are requested to go and help another driver.   This  company definitely a team driven concept. The company uses technology to help you feel safe and secure. The most enjoyable part of the job are the regular  people that you interact with on a day-to- day bases.   Most of them are very friendly and say thank you."
good,They expected me to sprint from the time I left the truck and delivered the package to when I sat back down with almost no regard to the package's well being.
good,would load around 5 to 10 thousand boxes in a feeder truck trailer everyday to ensure that all the right packages were in the correct trailer before the truck left that afternoon.
good,"Being a part-time package handler is more stressful and physically exhausting than it would seem based on the compensation. Hours can be irregular for the morning shift but usually it was between 4-9 am. Overall, I enjoyed it once I got good at it."
good,This company is a fast pace company i really enjoy the fast pace but if i only would of started earlier it was a great exercise workout but my body wasn't fit for this  pace extremely tired
good,Had a good experience great company a lot of hard work and moving around great management and communication long days and a fast pace job and long hours on your feet.
good,Ok entry level job. Lots of driving and delivering products. If you are ok with that then this is the job for you. More for young people trying to get a first job.
good,"If you work in the warehouse it is backbreaking, fast paced work. The pay is not that great, but the benefits are very good.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement."
good,Learned how to stack and remove boxes out of trucks and how to properly scan and move a package to the proper location. Management was always a round helping organize.
good,"It was a temporary seasonal job. I was offered to stay on full time permanent, but this job was not for my best interest. I quickly became a favorite of the drivers and was requested every day."
good,Company has great benefits. Very fast pace and have to be able to manage on the go. The biggest thing is creating a team of Supervisors that you trust to help work/ life balance. Otherwise the company will eat up your time and the balance is out the window.
good,"Clients variés"
good,"I was on my own time so that was a nice part about it. But the bad part about the job was the hours, my last week there they only had me work 10 hours."
good,Working at UPS was a terrible experience. From the management to the coworkers it just wasn't a mentally healthy environment to be a part of. I wouldn't recommend it.
good,"Due to a lack of packages being delivered in my area, I was never called in to perform my work duties, though those I interacted with were friendly and helpful."
good,This job is very high business functioning where you must be on point and detailed orientated. great room for overtime especially during the holiday season.
good,A typical day at UPS starts around 3 am and ends around 8 am. We were responsible for loading and organizing the common big brown trucks. The training was mainly watching instructional videos before actually loading the trucks. The hardest part of the job is having to lift very heavy packages and figuring out how to load everything onto the trucks. The management at the specific location I was at could use some work. There was little communication and when something wrong were to happen management focuses more time on punishing the worker rather than explaining to them how to fix the issue.
good,"Ups was a job that i enjoyed very much . learned alor of things working there like using the scanner , learning how to read the codes on the packages also learning the routes im scheduled to. All in all i really liked working there it was an good experience for me"
good,"i liked it there it was kind of relaxing to me because once I got there I got in my zone and worked didn’t stop until it was time for me to go home , I always got the job done"
good,As a supervisor you basically have to run every thing. On top of making sure employees are doing their job correctly and efficiently pay is good well over minimum wage
good,"I liked the job but it was a bit  overwhelming sometimes..I sometines work by my self wben I needed help, when you first start they should not be too much on you until you break, maybe they should start slow and add a little more each day and tban you will be able to get use to working on their level"
good,Seasonal courier position. Deliveries & pickups during am shift. Labeling & package handling. Workloads & routes vary. Fast-paced 80% driving 20% walking.
good,"good days and bad days. supervisor make blame on the workers not moving at a certain pace But I understand productivity, but we are not robots with unlimited energy."
good,"I worked there for a season which ended up being 2 weeks because they didnt even need me. Why they hired 15 others with me, I dont know. Why I got let go? I dont know. The people were rude. During the interview stages you get paid so that's pretty cool."
good,Did not enjoy working there . It was just a job I applied to work and try something different. The employees were respectful but not somewhere I wanted to go to everyday.
good,The job itself was very productive. There was no time where you would just stand around. Must be able to move packages anywhere from 1 pound to 100 pounds fast and accurate. The worst part was being on call getting up at 3 a.m. waiting to get a phone call to go in or not. But overall the job was easy to do.
good,"Had to deal with many upset/,angry  customers management always pushing for faster handling time.upper ups mgt made rules hard to follow so they didn't have to give raises.they told me to be firm when explaining policy, then they failed me on call because the customer got upset, for me doing what th told me to do"
good,hours aren't always set in stone. standing on your feet for the entire shift. breaks aren't regularly given or for the amount of time that a person should get for working a certain amount of hours.
good,Good place to work ups takes care of its employees and pays them a fair and honest wage for the work that is done and great people to work with as well.
good,always had a temporary position so i dont know all the specifics they explain everything in orientation and training depending on your position no facial hair of any kind
good,I like the job and all my supervisors are very respectful but I’m used to making more money and getting more hours in I feel I can go farther in the future .
good,I actually liked working at ups I will consider going back if nothing else pops up. It was a good paying job and a job that’s gets you in shape and fit
good,Grate career to look into  if you are well strings to handle it 360 around the clock have good patient for the road and people you have to deal with 24/7
good,"First I have to say UPS in my experience with UPS the training program is sub par. There is no clear direction on what is expected of you. They kind of tell you how to do your job and ""throw you to the wolves"", as they call it.  The supervisors really don't do their jobs well because they are afraid of retaliation from subordinates due to the Union.  There is a lot of undercover racism. What I mean is people will do and say stuff that is racist but in away that has can be explained away.  So upper management turns a blind eye. The union employees are paid well and are well taken care of, however the management employees are not.  Dockworkers with 5 plus years with company make more than most management.  Upper management of course are very well paid. Long days are a staple.  They can make overtime mandatory and make you work 12hr days and mandatory an extra day if they wish."
good,"A good company to work for in regards to benefits, but the work culture is diminishing.  Not matter how good of a job you do, the management will find something you have done wrong and right you up for it.  For example, I was written up because of my hand writing was not professional enough."
good,The pay is low the supervisors were very disrespectful. The other employees were not friendly and the supervisors will forget to bring the clock in card.
good,"It's a great company to work for. It's has it's good and bad, but the company need to value all races, sex, ect... Really need to get votes on how they hire up for higher position and value the employees more."
good,It's fast paced but management is not so great. Good benefits. Lifting heavy boxes is the hardest part on the job. You are working as a team. Safety is a big thing in the company.
good,Excellent place if you like to deal with pressure in very fast paced environment or in a changing environment. Good for students and part time workers.
good,Amazing company just don’t go into detail of how hard the job will be and and much stress it puts on you. Early mornings must be awake and ready to go
good,I liked working with the driver he was really good to work with.  We became really good friends. He told me a lot about the job the good and all the bad.
good,Job was fast paced and a bit more stressful than. Usual but you get used to it fast. You start to feel stronger after a while there. The work becomes easier as time goes on.
good,Was a part time job that wish was able to be full-time there other than that was a relaxed fast pace moving job that helped in being a good worker. In the industry
good,Fast paced work environment requires heavy lifting can become very tiring flexible schedule good team members not much room to advance in the company.
good,"Hard work"
good,It was nice just great hardwork and great pay . My position was seasonal so it was non stop working but it payed of once I would get my check . Also pay is weekly.
good,If you have no obligations its great to work but if you have family kiss them goodbye. only good if you are a driver because you make more money or a manager but not good for package handlers
good,"Great benefits, leadership, communication skills are needed, work every holiday season, work in warehouse environment, hardest part of the job is work life balance"
good,We Would start off by loading the trucks in the morning until break them ge back to it. its kinda like a factory but you're just loading packages off of a conveyor belt
good,It is a lot of physical work but its a good place to work for a first job. I would recommend this job for people needing a job while the are attending a school.
good,"I worked for evening shift as a PT. Evening shift manager showed favour and sometimes got emotional too much. I got offended by some co-worker because I am visible minority. Drivers were nice. They gave me benefit immediately, that was nice."
good,"Was on of my early jobs."
good,Worked here a seasonal driver. The training was super tough and repetitive to become a driver. I wanted to be a full time driver but missed the date by 1 week. Was hoping to be kept on full-time after the season but that did not happen through no fault of my own. Just not hiring
good,"It was not what I expected, sometimes hours were like full-time job. You get a very short break. packages were sometimes too big to fit onto bands. Also walks inside were unnecessary."
good,"Worked at UPS for more than 20 years at which I learned many aspects of the industry. At work a typical day would consist of preparing customs documentation for Pars and EDI releases, determining if shipment meets CFIA requirements or needs import permits and rating."
good,"No place for the weak minded."
good,"muy buena empresa , lamentablemente no te dan la oportunidad de crecer laboralmente"
good,fast paced work environment. you must be flexible and remain calm in stressful situations. there are constant time commitments and demands that must be met on a daily basis
good,This was an extremely stressful job and you never knew what your hours would actually work.  Job stability is also very low in terms of this job being a long term
good,It’s okay if you don’t have kids. I wouldn’t recommend this job to people with children. It’s labor work and you pretty much have to work hard for a year in order to make any progress.
good,It was alright I just didn't get paid on time . they never gaffe me my first check but told me it we cashed the second day of it coming in. They never fixed the problem. My 3rd and 5th check came 3 weeks late
good,The job is hot and tiring yet easy if you don't over think it. Sometimes the supervisors would push us to go faster in extremely hot weather conditions which depending on the heat level could be extremely difficult
good,"work conditions were poor, management treated employees with disrespect, UPS doesn't value employees that have invested many years of their live within the company"
good,The night crew was fun to work with and communication was key there. A relaxed place to be while keeping mostly a fast-moving work speed while on the clock.
good,"Managed $5.9million annual budget and contracts for facilities across the country including analysis, cost isolation, cost cutting measures, and future projections. Provided fiscal and administrative oversight of charitable giving donations to 501(C)(3) organizations totaling 500k."
good,"Good jumping off point.  Good place to gain experience and skills.  If you last long enough, the seniority helps.  Easy to be overlooked though.  Promotion process is problematic and confusing, discourages many people from trying to get ahead.  Most common criticism is the low wages."
good,They just might over work you sometimes you won’t get paid the over time you did in less you remind them no over time in less you ask working there is like picking cotton
good,Training was limited and no follow up business too slow not enough hours given very.  Last minute let go with very little information given only the business was very slow
good,Great for working students. Tuition reimbursement. i work worked for the peak season which was a good learning experience. i wish i would have stuck with it
good,"Working for UPS was not the best experience at the time, it could have been since it was the holiday season and it does get more busy."
good,"As a temporary helper during the holidays, my shift would start about 10am and sometimes end about 10pm. I did like the fast pace as it made the days go by faster, but I was exhausted sometimes."
good,Good benefits..hard work upper management hard headed sneaky. If you do your job and mind your business you should be ok. Stressful overall especially  in management
good,"corriere espresso, consegne e ritiri) per privati e aziende"
good,"UPS is an excellent atmosphere to work on skills needed to better you're life and future work. The management was lackadaisical more often than not. Employees weren't held accountable for mistakes and errors that were made. "
good,Great place to work.  Constant learning.  UPS is a legacy company with a strong culture of hard-work and dedication.  Company can improve on adopting new technologies for internal use.
good,"while working at UPS, i learned how to sort mail for different areas of Florida and many other states. there's a lot of loading and unloading to be done, and don't have your phone on you!!"
good,All I got to say is the management of the temporary companies that are working at the actual warehouse suck. They do not know how to be a team lead/supervisor.
good,Ok could of been better they need more people to help a lot of fast past work and heavy lifting and in and other than that it wasn’t that bad the work is pretty easy
good,"Good job, not enough hours or pay. People are friendly and make sure you have everything you need. Good job, good people. Fast paced. Management is helpful"
good,"Package Handler "
good,It's a great job for a workout unless you plan on driving trucks. It's room for promotion but it takes to long to get there. The workers are nice but the supervisors can be an jetk. Your break is not long at all.
good,Typical day was unloading 48-53ft trailers of boxes bags etc weighing from 1lb-200+lbs. The job wasn't bad management just didn't know how to speak to employees so no one started caring about the actual job. Best part of the day was the accomplishment of finishing the trailer.
good,Load trucks for drivers and area code order take all boxes that belong to the trucks that you load and load them in the right trucks before 8 before drivers get there
good,working at ups was a really fast paced kind of job. you had certain goals to meet and it was seasonal as well. they also said stuff about there being a bonus for always being on time but I never got it with being on time and always there.
good,"salary ranging between 4000 to 5000"
good,"Management at UPS, is very weak, due to the fact that the Union provides job security, for anybody that signs up. So, coworkers could literally decide to not work, and not get in trouble for it. Actually the management team would usually get chastised, consequently for what the Union prevent them from exercising, which was authority."
good,"Your mileage will vary, honestly, depending on which one you work at. There's a lot of things to consider, they're all franchisees, meaning you might end up with a half-decent setup, or you might end up with something terrible."
good,When i had a mi or injury the hr( health resources)took it like it was the end of my life and i worked for 2 weeks and didnt get a paycheck and hr took forever to setup my pay roll..
good,Fast paced environment which is both physically and mentally challenging. Seasonal changes require longer working hours so if you have another job be aware that UPS may not fit your life/schedule.
good,"you get paid, stressful job at times, fast paste, must be willing to move at a fast pace, able to move up in the company, but once your out the Union your on your own"
good,Normal Corporate Sales Structure  More of an Account Management Structure then Commisioned Sales.  Hardest part of job is balancing the need to win business with non business elements of the organization
good,I don't like it as much as I would if I was getting paid more. The hour's are not bad but gas plus tolls are not helping any. I would like to get paid at least 19 dollars a hour.
good,UPS was flexible with my school schedule.  They have various shifts that you can work from earlier mornings to late evenings.  Also they are considered of my football schedule when I played allowing me to give them my schedule in advance and they would schedule me around it.
good,Typical day at work go in start the belt and start moving packages onto trucks into labeled sections if you put a package on the wrong truck it get shipped out to the wrong area and then returned to the warehouse if found.
good,N/A ok a it was a decent job the company treat me Fair benefits was good the people I work with was good management was good job money was good at that time.
good,Good crew to work with.  Difficult and fast paced lifting boxes and packages all night. Pay is very minimal but the benefits are about the best you can get.   Not bad for part time night work.
good,It was a cool job a first then they started to cut my hours so I had to go it was to many boxes you had to load then they move me to a different part of the warehouse so they cut my hours from 5 hours to 3-4 hours
good,"it was very hot in a big warehouse with no air, if it was 90 degrees outside then it was about 100 degrees inside, you would clock, goto your work area and start loading or unloading your truck (18 wheeler)"
good,Part time is the maximum you can get going in. Time is too low not to mention not enough time to make a good enough paycheck isn’t good for for sole job. Need other form of job to make minimum amount of cash needed.
good,"it's was a part time job that was very fast paced in the heavy seasons (nov-jan). It would slow down during the summer time, except to just stack boxes all day but you get to be a part of a union so it kinda evens out."
good,It get boring driving around nd delivering boxes. I learned how to greet people in different ways and I also learned how to comfort people more. Its an alright job.
good,its an okay job but its like no one in the whole place actually communicates and they all dont know how to treat or talk to their workers its pretty sad
good,I did not work for UPS but for a privately owned UPS Retail store that sold their services. It was an alright job with average pay for a retail position.
good,I loved the hard work and challenging situations but there are to many different people trying to run the center and it became very hostile and unpleasant to work for.
good,"ups was a good company to work for because they pay every week but it is very fast paced and not for everyone."
good,"had to work early hours and after 10 pm"
good,"If you are good at what they tell you then you will do find. The benefits are great for a part time employee, and the work hours do well with college students"
good,It was an ok job. Just long days and no breaks really. We had to receive paper checks. We worked holidays and had to commute to our Drivers locations.
good,"Was told it was a full time job. It wasn't. Was expected to show up for work just to be told I didn't have work that day. I enjoyed the job however, and if I hadn't gotten laid off, I would be happy working there."
good,Nice place to work good hours nice people and good pay. And you get to meet great people and meet New people every day at UPS. You get to see all the nice building oh and you work hard all the time.
good,free bathrooms and coffee.  unlimited use of international calling.  bosses always in meetings.  shopped on amazon all day.  best day of my life was leaving this place.
good,They make you feel welcome and train you the best they can. You have to be fast to keep up but they give the best tools. It was rough at the beginning but I'm a quick study and after that it was a breeze
good,"Ups could do alot better with morale at the centers, good pay but sorry hours. Employees get no help if they have a problem with another employee they just sweep it under the rug and ignore it"
good,UPs is a  good place to work. it provided me with more experience in the field that I'm looking to presume. It also provided me with the means to seek knowledge in the same field.
good,"This job is very fast-paced and can be stressful at times, but they do have a lot of benefits that you'll receive after a year of being there. They even pay for your school if that's something you're interested in."
good,"Utilized proper time management techniques to meet strict deadlines, load vehicles rapidly, and adhere to organizational systems preferred by colleagues.  Maintained a safe and organized work environment for myself and coworkers. Applied and honed a sense of professional urgency during the company’s high volume periods. Ensured organizational demands were met during mission-critical seasons. Very fast paced work environment that is continuous throughout the day."
good,"Talk to your stewardess from time to time especially if you're a new hire. And most importantly remember they could always replace a box but never your body, now good show friends work safe."
good,"Is and ok job ,,but they have this rules you half to memorize that dont make no sense even if your a professional driver if you can't remember this rule your not working at ups"
good,Going to the warehouse and helping the helper prepare for delivery organizing boxes.  I would recommend it to someone who is looking towards becoming a driver they get paid more season not so much unless your attempting to get your foot in the door.
good,Management give you very short notice for when to come in the next day. They promise days off and take them away if they need help instead of allocating resources.
good,I learned their system with delivery and warehouse. You is only a number and none of the managers know who you are. They string you out with the promise to become full-time but it has not happen yet.
good,"Highly experienced in performing duties that includes loading and unloading packages"
good,"Job tasks were very harsh and competitive for low pay. The environment was very poor, managers treated employees poorly. Small room for advancement in company over a long period of time."
good,Most jobs at UPS are challenging and high pace. The fast pace and high volume can create a good or bad work environment depending on your attitude. It can be stressful but there is plenty of room for growth in the bigger cities.
good,"There are some good points by working here such as great benefits after 30 days and sick/vacation days are earned monthly until 1 year then you get a bulk of days to use whenever you like. However, there are times where you may be asked to leave work at the beginning of shift or at lunch so 40 hours is not guaranteed. Bad management makes undisciplined decisions and are disorganized at worse making most of their production changes based on guesses. Might not sound like a big deal but you try working here for one month and can see this happen for yourselves the fact we don't have a union may offer some reason on way the got away with unethical treatment and abuse of employees, often in the past cursed or threatened employees and threats came from the floor manager along with allowing an disruptive lead to remain in charge after almost hitting an female employee with a 1 ton forklift/truck after several other incidents and after female and him had an disagreement on job many of  us thought this went beyond just an verbal warning, but what do we know we just work there."
good,My job responsibilities were to remove customers holiday packages from the conveyor belt to a tractor truck.  The packages were deliver to various ups warehouses to be routed to their customers
good,Good company to work for always trying to get there workers to advance them self to work up threw the company always there to take an issue and get it resolved
good,Se hai fortuna sei rimesso al lavoro se no devi essere raccomandato
good,"Working part time over the holidays at UPS as a customer service associate was a very good experience. I got to learn how to do customer service by working with the public, weighing and helping to mail packages. Sometimes when it was a slower day, I would help with the trucks by loading boxes and packages into the trucks. The working hours fit in well with my schedule at the time. It's a good place to start to get work experience."
good,"It's not a job for everybody, but there is something for anybody. Hiring from within & beginning at entry level provides a sense of security while moving up in any direction. Acquire skills that apply throughout life, not just while clocked-in. "
good,"I'm limited in my knowledge of working at UPS, since I was only a seasonal driver helper for one month during December. However, I did get the impression that if you can get hired full time, it is a good career avenue to explore at UPS."
good,Ups is not for everyone if you are looking for a job to get some exercise and stay active then ups is the perfect job for you. I would recommend that if you are trying to make this job a career then I would stick to being a hourly but if jus temporary then try and be a supervisor as quick as possible.
good,"I was hired on as a part time peak loader sorter. It’s good fun physical work with some amazing people. They kept me on after peak and moved me to inbound which was cool. It was then that I found out even if I come in at 4am , depending on workload they’d send me home with NO PAY!! Not cool. From what I learnt,an awesome company to work for if you can get through the first year."
good,"UPS is a fast paced company that hires many PT workers as a step in the door.  The work is hard and you're constantly lifting and moving packages, but if you can get through the initial stage of moving from a PT to a FT worker, there are many levels of career advancement."
good,"UPS as very fast pace, and very early hours. And also very fun to see the many packages and delivers they do a day. You have to carry a minimum of 50 pounds."
good,"Fast pace, time flies working here.  I really didn't like working here because of the pay wasn't good for the amount of work we had to do. ..........."
good,"While my first year two years doing temp work were great. The work was tough pay was good and the drivers I was assigned to for the day were friendly and very encouraging. This last year however, quality communication had significantly decreased for the temp workers. Many days I was willing and able to work I wasn't given info on a delivery route despite being told that there were ones open for me."
good,I actually enjoyed working for the company and I’ve acquired a lot of new skills working there. You would think that moving heavy equipment all day would be a little overwhelming but they never overworked my group to the point of exhaustion. The only thing that I didn’t appreciate was the lack of commitment and promises that were pushed to the side every time I was promised a raise but I never got it. I have to kids now and the rates for daycare are very expensive and that’s the reason for my departure from the company and continuing furthering my education
good,Working long hours as a supervisors. At times 11-12 hours. Stressful and and lots of pressure. Not so go with training when it comes to real life situations.
good,doing the work of 2 to 3 while some people are sitting in the corner doing nothing and getting mad when nothing is getting done. get mad with you start early or finish late.
good,"Throughout my experience, they tended to attempt to keep their employees busy in order to keep productivity high and make people earn their checks. While physically demanding at times, if you focus on performing your task well, it’s not the difficult of a job."
good,It was a Very good paying job but lack of communication and team work. Poor management and hard labor I would recommend if you wanna make some quick money .
good,Lots of opportunities to advance and a decent work environment even though things can get pretty intense. Very diverse and they pretty much give anyone a chance if you're willing to put in the work.
good,Depends on the driver your assigned to your job can be reasonable and quick or stressful and fast paced. Unfortunately for me my driver threw boxes at me without giving me time to react and made me walk long distances with heavy packages.
good,"Simple workplace to be involved in. Before you start work, everyone stretch to get loose. friendly workers that also work hard. I learned what to put on the trucks and what not to put on the trucks"
good,Breaks where only 5 minutes which didn’t compare to how much work you do for me the work was pretty easy but if you wanted to use the bathroom or anything you had to use your time wisely.
good,The job I had was very hands on . It took a lot of focus . I did enjoy having my own space nobody was over me. If you are a college student or don’t have Kids its the perfect job.
good,As you can imagine this is a lot of hard busy work.  You work fast and heavy almost the whole time your there and the positions are only part time.  Your expected to lift and move stuff that are clearly and not clearly but obviously very heavy and supposed to be lifted by a team.  They just started offering benefits to the part time employees but you have to wait for 9 month's after your 60 day probationary period so 11 months.  And unless you want to become a driver it seems to be a pretty dead end job when it comes to advancement.
good,it is not for everyone but work is available.   Working in the warehouse is a bit more difficult than loading packages onto boxcars.  The driver position may be a better fit for most individuals.
good,"Fast pace work, but offered full-time benefits. Work was very fast pace, however gaining full-time employment takes along time usually several years due to the active union and seniority rules."
good,We went through so many lay-off scares while I was there that you never knew from one week to the next of you would have a job. Too stressfull to work that way .
good,It was a fun job at first but not my choice of work.wasnt strong enough to load some boxes at first but with time I leaned out and got stronger. Pretty decent pay even though they get you with the taxes but it’s a workout so good place to get paid to workout.
good,"It was a great experience. I got to meet different types of people. I got to build my work experience. It taught me patience and "
good,This was a seasonal job that was fast-paced and physically demanding. I worked with a few different drivers for the month and a half of work. The hardest part of the job was moving heavier packages to peoples front door.
good,UPS would be even better if benefits started the day of hire. And if UTA transportation would go out to there location it would be better for those who don't have a vehicle.
good,"Working on the preload was always busy, but it was fun."
good,"Ups is a great company to work for if you plan to stay there in the long run and are able to deal with the crazy hours during the holidays and keep up with the work load. The work load for the pay starting out definitely isn't worth it and the better your work the more work you get. Its very physically demanding and intense. Management is far from professional, and they will get in your face and yell at you. Its a very fast paced and stressful job, definitely not worth the starting wage"
good,"This job is very strenuous and faced paced also physically demanding. At first you will not no much about or how to do the work required and it will take time to develop the skills necessary for a profession job, but after training things will make sense."
good,There was a Machine that slide packages in front of me and my job was to see if the packages stayed on grounds or off grounds and the states they belong in. There was days when it was really slow and I can easily see the package names and were they go. We're there was other days it was so busy I was being trampled by multiple packages but it was a fun fast job and I enjoyed working there.i learned a lot about how our nailing works in this state and I also gained experience so if I wanted to work at another warehouse job I could have but I love working and being able to have my own money and take care of myself
good,Working for ups wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst either the hours were short but the time being there felt long some of the managers were cool and some never showed interest
good,It was fun for the most part. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter. You have to dress for the weather even working in the trucks. The environment sometimes works around you
good,"Management did not even pronounce my name correctly. Person that trained me...… Didn't. Only part time for new hires. Employees were there for the medical benefits, which were inexpensive."
good,This is a very hard-working place of business I advise you not to come unless you are fit for the work a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of hot working
good,"I was a loader and an unloader, I learned how to build a perfect wall. the hardest part was probably lifting packages that weighed over 170. The only enjoyable part about the job was clocking out"
good,My tenure with UPS was short lived.  Seniority played a major part of the job.  There were times when I went into work and was sent home because the senior workers had the monopoly to work the shift instead.
good,Very quick paced job. Not for the light od heart. They keep you on your toes with lots of running and heavy weight to lift. Mana3is hit and miss sometimes
good,The pay was pretty good depending on the hours you worked. The job requires you to always be ready for a call from a driver making it not so easy to plan events with friends. The pay offered a 150 bonus for being available for 5 days in a row.
good,The Managers were not understanding to situations. I was wrongly terminated. Never paid fully for my services. Very unprofessional. Lack of communication.
good,"a typical day at work "
good,I don't know why this survey is asking me about UPS because I never worked for UPS. One company that I worked for dealt with UPS so maybe that's why they are asking me about ups.
good,"During my time at UPS, I worked as a loader in the grande vista hub. I worked there for 2 years. During my time there, I had around 6 supervisors. There is oppurtunities to move up, but it's fast paced and hectic, if you dont know what youre doing in this physically demanding occupation."
good,"Job was is very intense and takes awhile to get used to , most supervisors are helpful but the management wasn’t good. Someone gets screwed over everyday so be prepared"
good,The typical day at UPS included sorting and loading and unloading packages. The pace was very fast. It was a very difficult job and I would recommend it to anyone so that they could learn what really hard work is like.
good,It is not bad for part time work if you get hired on for early morning shift or the midnight shift. Work is very heavy so recommended for more of a young student looking for quick money.
good,"You will receive dental and health insurance. It was a warehouse divided by sections which were: delivery drivers, management, unloading area, and loading area. As a starter the give you less than 35 hours and sometimes they send people home because it's ""overstaffed'."
good,"I worked graveyard shift. They way you're paid is anything for 25 hours is time and a half, but they always let me go before the 5  hours of the day were completed. They don't pay enough for bills, needed second job."
good,"i put the ups store but they gave me ups and ive never worked there before. the ups store, though, was a great place to work at. The workplace environment was great to be in."
good,"The job itself can sometimes not be the best, but the people you surround yourself with is what makes working at UPS worth it. I can definitely say that the supervisor you have in your area really does make a deference on how the work place environment will be."
good,Really didn't like working for them  because they would put you on the  schedule only if they need you and you may have to fill in after your shift is over because someone can't finish
good,"The people at this job are single handedly the best part of it. As long as you are a diligent worker and show up on time, prepared for the day they WILL NOTICE YOU. Can’t speak for drivers or union workers but the benefits aren’t bad. The hours can be tricky and if you aren’t ok with working nights or extremely early mornings then this is probably not the job for you."
good,It was hard labor. You moved from trucks to trucks. There were no breaks. You had to be a fast worker or they sent you home early.The managers were great.
good,"Everyday feels like the Christmas season at UPS - with the recent increase in delivery volume from Amazon, our drivers are working long days and nights."
good,It was a nice job. However it was to much for and they let me go before the training was over. It is a fast paced job requiring good strength and efficient movement.
good,"I loved working at UPS but it was not enough hours and require a lot of walking. I really did not like walking from different buildings at night alone. i felt the job was safe at all,  but i stayed there until i found something else."
good,Great opportunity to work and learn. I was given the opportunity to work as a temp and was later hired to support the Marketing Department where I was given the opportunity to learn new programs and involvement with the Marketing Department.
good,I started at 4 in the afternoon. You clock in and check out a forklift for the day. Then go to the office and ask for a trailer manifest. Then you just go out on the dock and start unloading your trailer. Placing your skids where they need to go untill your trailer is empty. Then you get another trailer and start over again.
good,"The work was fine. Physically demanding, but I was ready and used to it. The management can be kind of tricky to deal with, but most of them are pretty good people."
good,"I worked here part time for 5 years working in the preload."
good,"Hours can be long, especially during the Christmas season. Pay, job security and benefits balance the long work days. Management manages by exception, but makes positive reviews for working safely."
good,It was actually fun for the little time i did get to work there. Many of the employees were good people and help when needed. I would recommend yhis job to my peers
good,"It used to be an alright place to work. The fast pace can be a drag, getting struck with the in-town trucks meant fighting for space and overall stressful. I got lucky that I got a small out of town section with handling the roller products in that regard."
good,This is the perfect place if your up for customer service and comfortable working alone. this location doesn't really get too busy and the workers there are great.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to fix pieces of equipment, and get them back up and running as quick a possible. The hardest part of the job is navigating the centuries of ingrained bureaucracy that an organization as old at UPS has."
good,If you r willing to work hard be have a job that’s a workout be my guess. Still if your just going to get some little cash because they let you in with ease. Don’t do it.
good,"Blue collar job. Not for the weak. Very hard to work at, fast paced environment. Must be very careful when operating machinery around the dock. It is very easy to lose control if you're not careful."
good,"The local 340, is about as useless as can be. I was always let down by them. "
good,Simple and professional. Very fast paced and enjoyed working for this company. Very challenging and was a very good workout.nice coworkers and good hr group
good,"I feel they get you in the door with ""promises"". I was told 4 to 5 hours a day yet I've not worked more than 3 hours a day. That includes during busy season. They only give you ten minutes for a break."
good,"Job was fast paced and hard work, not much else to say. Got up early, loaded trucks and help drivers deliver packages. Pretty basic job that was many years ago so no feedback."
good,I have to converse with supervisors and hourly employees daily about the quality of the loads that are going out. Greatest part of my job is doing the reports and presentations.
good,"This company is a chance to be apart of something that didn't stem from college education. Advancement, education, great and better opportunity to plan for your future"
good,"i sorted packages that came from one area of the country, or world and distributed it to a convener belt to go to a truck where it would take it to the destination where it was meant to go"
good,Was given an opportunity to go straight into driving during peak season. Turned out to be a fifteen year career after working very hard the first peak season. Provided an excellent salary and benefits for me as a single working mother of three.
good,UPS is a great package delivery company  I worked for The UPS Store and do not have direct employee knowledge of UPS.  The UPS Store however is a great organization.
good,"While the pay and benefits are good at UPS, those are the only good things about working here. If you prove yourself a productive worker, you will often be saddled with extra work with no extra compensation so that the other areas that are failing can be given extra people to do their work with no repercussions. This will continue so long as you continue to do the extra work until you can no longer keep up, at which point they will attempt to guilt you into over working yourself."
good,It’s was an ok job lot of favoritism but great for new experience the managers need to be more professional and listen to workers issues and problem the pay was great
good,"Easy hours, good union at the time i left and tuition assistance available, along with good a medical and dental. Twisting, bending, and lifting are a must."
good,"You are just a number when working for UPS. They will replace their employees as soon as automation will allow. I have only one positive thing to say is I received a great deal of training on what not to do as a manager. I learned my management ethics by not following how to treat employees. I do not like the union politics but if UPS did not have a Union, employees would be at risk. They do teach management how to drive a workforce and at all cost follow the process."
good,It was alright. I never intended to stay there for a long period of time. I needed funds to move away and focus on my true career path which is very different than anything i would do for UPS.
good,"required a lot of kneeling, slouching, and standing. You were always active. Required much repetition. Training wasn't difficult, at least for picking/handling"
good,"Package handler for UPS Warehouse, packaged damaged boxes. Learned how to identify hazardous materials and packages. Rerouted packages to their correct location."
good,Good job for people who don’t plan on going to school. Recommend the daytime shift to those who are in school. This job is very hectic during peak season
good,"Ups is a great company to start off in high school . The income is more reasonable for a high school student, but for a college student as myself the income is not enough."
good,"Good company culture"
good,"UPS as a whole is a great company, but I worked for NCO, a contracted employer for UPS. I will say that growth within the company happened quickly, but reaching your salary cap approaches just as fast!"
good,overall good place to work backed by the union not bad if you want something part time! Full time can be stressful but overall not a bad place to make a career!
good,Nice job if it's your secondary but primarily job not enough hours or pay. I know it's a part-time job but working only 3 and a half hours isn't enough money to support yourself.
good,UPS was the first job that promoted me to a part-time supervisor.  I was responsible for ten docks and 10-15 people.  I eventually moved to the training department.
good,"I work hard, I have a Bachelor's Degree, and I'm a mild mannered type of person. On the contrary, co-workers that don't have education Degrees but are good at being funny and make the manager laugh all the time. These people are getting ahead in the career much quicker than I am. "
good,Basic labor job with good timing if you have other things to do in the day. you go and move boxes from shipping containers all shift long. if you work harder and get the trailer done before you need to you are told to go do another trailer with a lazy person on their phone.
good,"In our office we were reimbursed fairly, but the work was rather mechanical with not much decision-making. Decision-making was at the time centralised in the corporate office and region office with low local competence. The overall atmosphere in the office was rather bad and demotivating. The whole process of my department seemed to be messy from my position. Not to wrong the whole company, some managers, including mine, were very good and helped their employees grow."
good,Job is very stressful for management people. Pressure over things that cant be controlled. Work environment is very hostile at times. Enjoyed the pay but came with great cost. Upper management really doesn't appreciate the hard work the supervisors put in.
good,Really early hours and work could be hard. The shifts could range from 3 hours to over 10 hours. However there will be only one 10 minute break given no matter what. Around Christmas the work picks up and there is usually not enough workers
good,Its was a temporary job. It was good to learn more and also to get more knowledge about customer service and shipping and receiving especially customer service.
good,I wait for them like 3 months it was okay it wasn't simple really but I would love to go back to start working back for them at a different location I would recommend them just friends or someone else because they was pretty good I liked it that job I like it the person I was working with my driver he was very helpful in life and made sure I got my rug down real quick and easy we did a good job good teamwork good membership
good,"Need to work quickly and efficiently and besides that its a simple and easy job, I have an easy enough time getting time off and its not horribly complex"
good,I work in the building. I actually like the job. I like to work and get out of there. The job itself takes effort but the work is not bad at all. The union protect you but enables lazy behavior. Benefits are too notch. They run it by seniority so that the wrong  people are in place some times. Overall it's a blessing but you have to put up with a lot.
good,To work at UPS you have to be in shape just a little because it is a facepace job ..You have to be aware of falling object and packages on the floor ..the day at UPS goes by pretty fast.
good,Working under a fast pace  with time sensitive delivery’s and time sensitive pickups.   Working in a safe way at all times. Following DOT regulations at all times.
good,"you have to wake up early . strecth prepare for a hard labor 5 hours loaded up the truck , make sure your body is ready for a fast pace enviorment and challenging shift. the harderst part is when the shift is about finsh you get slammed with boxes and must take them off the convaory belt, all trucks must be loaded at a certian time."
good,i would show up about six in the morning we would all greet each other on the way to the metal detectors were we would be searched before entering the warehouse. After some light conversation and the occasional snack provided by management you would prepare the loading docks and trucks for the influx of boxes to be shipped before the lunch hour.
good,The UPS Store was a laid back place to work. The hours were great for my schedule as a working mom of two kids. The pay was fair for the amount of work and responsibility.
good,You're going to be moving a couple hundred packages an hour regardless of what position your in. It's honestly not the worst thing in the world and the work itself is demanding but manageable. However the pay for the amount of labor you put in just isn't worth it. You work hard for that $10.60/hour which would be ok of the hours were there but more often than not you're asked to come in for only 2 or 3 hours before everyone is sent home.
good,"The work itself was nice and physical, I'm a lot stronger than I was before working here. There is some problems with management stemming from 2018 issues, but they have made some attempt at fixing the problems they created."
good,"A normal day with ups is quick paced, focused, and must be executed as swiftly as possible. Expect criticism, vulgar personal conversations and to learn how to operate a handheld scanning device."
good,I didn't really enjoy the people that worked there some of them were cool but the supervisors didn't really do much to help only sorta pointed fingers and let other people do the work
good,I was not adequately trained and felt like I was always under the gun. This often lead to mistakes being made. My bosses were Type-A personalities. I would not recommend.
good,"Fast paced, physically demanding and you will get dusty and dirty.  Its can be cold in the work area in winter months based on your assigned work station. I suggest one dresses accordingly."
good,Ups was a ok job for people trying to get their foot in the door of logistics. It thought me many different lesson working as a supervisor. The pay is ok.
good,it was a good and easy job but I was hired on with a bonus and when it was taken from me the hours worked and pay was not worth my hour drive. i would drive a hour there to only work three hours and have to drive a hour home.
good,"I've been with UPS for 5 years now and I have to say it is very physical, the pay a is not that great but the benefits are are amazing! you pay $0.00 for your insurance and you can put your spouse and children and still pay $0.00.  the downside is the hours are really minimum they try to keep it at 3hrs or 3.5hrs (according to the collective agreement) if you do work over 5hrs you have to fight for your time and a half because they try not to pay! They have a program for school which is not too bad they reimburse 100% of schooling  and cover $300 for books, but you have to have good attendance at work (including lates) and it maybe hard to leave or miss work for school depending on the time of year and your supervisor. you can move up in the company which is nice they hire from within first. all in all it's good for people who want some extra money or if you are looking to advance in the company."
good,"Recommends"
good,"The work at UPS is difficult to say the least. It is physically demanding and fast-paced, to the point that it is in many ways a workout. You will definitely need to bring some water with you. As with any unionized workforce, there are pros and cons to the management and culture of UPS. On the one hand, there is great benefits and job security, consistent pay increases and opportunities for advancement, and a tuition reimbursement program available to all part-time employees. On the other hand, lazy workers cannot be fired and incompetent managers don't lose their jobs or get demoted. If you can deal with the minor frustrations of bad workers around you then UPS can benefit you in many different ways."
good,You always have to be on your guard while working. People there need to be team-orientated and a high turn over rate means new people all the time. Best of luck working there
good,Ups is good for young people out of high school. If you have a family and are a little older it's not good. Too long to wait for benefits and hours are not good.
good,You are moving boxes and putting them into big containers and putting the loaded containers onto planes so they could be shipped to other places. I would a late shift as well.
good,The work is hard and fast paced but think of it as getting paid to go work out and it’s not so bad. The location I worked at had poor management and the direct line supervisor had no experience running the line and it showed. Doubt it was all her fault due to lack of training. The hours at this location were too short to make it worthwhile for the driving expense.
good,UPS is a great company to grow with but the pay rate is pretty low for the intense amount of work you’re doing . In order for you to receive a raise from the job you must work there for a few years ; I’ve been there roughly  for 6 months & feel as though I’m not receiving enough to provide for myself.
good,I was hired for full time work but was given less than part time work. The environment was sort of disorganized feeling. I never received clear communication about what was expected or what I could expect.
good,"Loading and Unloading trucks"
good,"I Mark and label containers, containee tags or products, using marking tools, measure weigh and count products and materials.  Examine and inspect containers, materials and products in order to ensure that packing specifications are met. Record product packing and order information on specified forms and records."
good,"Good opportunity to grow within the company if you are willing to put the effort into it, great support from the teams, good and paid training, good colleagues"
good,I wish UPS would look into doing some things differently  when it comes to the way they treat people and their employees. I've learned a lot and I hope to take the info gained with me far in life.
good,I had a nice time at UPS but there were a lot of problems that were prevalent before I was there and the bare minimum was doe to change that. Once I would make a change I would be moved and then they would most times go back to their old ways after new management was brought in.
good,I say it's an alright job because we're not getting paid enough or getting the right proper hours for the job to be too competitive and a little bit hard working.
good,"Not a job I would recommend to anyone. As an employee, you will learn how to package, price, and ship packages. Then you would run the store all by yourself."
good,If you want an easy job that pays for either JCTC or UofL fully then ups is for you. Sadly the only downside is that the “metro-college program” is only offered during 3rd shift; usually 12pm to 3-6am
good,Every day is always a challenge with new experiences.Very enjoyable working with different drivers with different needs and personalities. A typical day would be to accomplish the goals given and achieve results and grow the business with maintaining  workplace culture.Learn something new everyday.
good,"I really don't have a lot to write amount UPS. Managers really left a bad taste about the job and how they treat employees. The job was not very hard, but the UPS system is very behind on time and the managers aren't very helpful to their employees."
good,"The work is tough! However, as a tough person, I am able to get through tough things. This job is competitive and fast-paced! You must stay focused!!!"
good,"•	Collaborated and communicated with all levels of management and subordinates feedback, data collections and resolutions to continuously improve quality according to company core values and mission."
good,Buena empresa buen sueldo pero con sobrecarga buena convivencia con los compañeros
good,It was alright. Only worked seasonal during holidays. Very stressful during that time. It seems that the packages do not stop coming but it is a good time to make money.
good,"Everyone was on board with getting the work done, same pros and cons as most jobs.  There were opportunities to move up, and management encouraged it.  Things have advanced technology wise since my employment, so maybe a completely different working environment."
good,The job was pretty good for someone who was looking for a part time job that doesn’t interfere with your school schedule or just day schedule in general.
good,"Se puede rotar de cuentas, pero no hay muchos niveles de puestos superiores a los cuales aplicar"
good,"Typical work day would be usually from 11 am or 12pm to about 3:30 4pm.  There are 10 tractor trailer truck that i would physically setup package rollers inside.  After i would sort packages to their correct destination trailer.  Short 10 minute breaks, The temperature could be 25 degrees outside and the heat would NOT be on, i have worked numerous days with my jacket on the entire day.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be all the really cool people you meet."
good,There wasn't much room for advancement and management is difficult to work with. I didn't seem to have much career growth there. I loaded the docks and helped with managing packages.
good,"With the short breaks, hard work, and some problematic co-workers, you do not want to come in to work a lot of the time. A co-worker lashed out because of some other issues they were having from something else in front of a supervisor and no action was taken, it was just considered normal."
good,"treat people fairy I can say but people do come and go "
good,"This is a perfect job for ex military people, I think.  That is, those who can handle high stressful situations day in and day out.  It pays among the best but I had the bad luck of having the worst manager that drove me out."
good,As a new employee it is expected of you to work hard. Some managers may use the probational work period as an advantage to threaten you. Work environment can be stressful in the beginning due to lack of training. If you want hours apply to the twilight shift. It is a good place for benefits and good opportunity to become supervisor if you so desire.
good,Holiday seasonal worker. That's all I have to say. I worked two months for Christmas delivery help. Basic stuff as a seasonal helper. Do what your told from your driver/supervisor and you'll be good. Wear layers. LOTS of them. And knee sleeves for your knees.
good,Is better to try the job and do it in your life as experience is better to do it as you never know if you will like it or not.. it doesn't hurt trying..
good,"I believe that the boxes hat the female employees should have a limit on LBS because some were entirely to big to try and drag up to a front door. They do not have an assigned place for there employees to go to the bathroom. you bearly get to eat lunch but they offer pizza but with the amount of people there your lucky if you get a bite even always gone by the time I got to the boxes. I believe that there should be 1 male to every working female  to help with picking up and carrying those boxes some are to big for dollies sure you can make a career out of this job if your back hold out, legs strength"
good,You do not get paid enough for your work and you're constantly moving at a fast work pace to only get three hours and $150 a week and only a 10-minute break and sometimes have to lift up things over 70 lb which on your contract you only supposed to only be able to lift 70 on your arm not 140 pounds
good,"UPS is ok but most of the cut they do is the benefit that the people have like vacation pay, their employees free water and incentives. There is a lot of operational expense that can be audited but the account executive does the easy part cut the incentives and vacation time even for 20+ year employees."
good,Typical IT shop. Communication was good. Difficult to communicate with some of the visa workers.  Management some what difficullt to deal with.  Other than that it was OK.
good,Its fast paced and not easy. Your against the elements every day and if your not as healthy I will reconsider. Not for the feint at heart. But the years you put in could work wonders.
good,"Very hard work but rewarding  at the end"
good,"Driving and parcel delivery within the London area, Can be very busy yet rewarding with the customers one has to deal with. "
good,"United Parcel Service is an American multinational package delivery and supply chain management company. The global logistics company is headquartered in the U.S. city of Sandy Springs, Georgia, which is a part of the Greater Atlanta metropolitan area."
good,"* great place to work "
good,It's kind of a weird place to work.  They have a safety meeting every morning before your shift reminding you to use proper lifting techniques.  Then they bombard you with heavy packages non-stop with no time at all to lift anything properly.
good,"United Parcel Service	                                	                                             			           2001-2003"
good,"I only worked there for a few months, but most of the people were friendly. I had a great, motivated team and a nice supervisor. I would've stayed longer, but a better opportunity came along."
good,"A pretty good place to work overall. The management can be degrading, and the communication is lacking, but it is what you make out of it. It's honestly a pretty easy job on the loader side of it as long as you have a good work ethic."
good,Good job to gain work experience its fast paced by the book and get extremely busy so you learn how to move at a fast pace and get the job done effectively.
good,hardwork poor managment bad safety hard to move up . needs better workers bad safety not enough workers bad pay and bacl breaking hard work for low pay
good,"It's a good company to work at and the benefits are ok if you plan to make a career out of it. Like any courier, the day can be long depending on the time of year."
good,"This is a very faced past job environment and you must be willing to work and not slack off, I would recommend this job only if you’re willing to move to make your money if you aren’t willing to do so you will fail"
good,Ups is usually lighter loads year round excluding seasonal weeks in the winter when most packages are shipped because of the holidays. Overall as a group not everyone was putting in the same amount of energy in work as others.
good,The hardest part of being at ups is the hours they give u sometimes no overtime  also no doing doubles the benefits is good that’s the only thing that matters in ups
good,For a person with seniority the pay lacks the punch you'd expect. Good benefits and paid vacations. Outdoor working environment hence it can get very hot and extremely cold.
good,Tough place to work. Very physically challenging and fast pace. Location needs improving leadership awareness and communication. Planning for busy season is very low key.
good,"Not available   No comment  programmed cellphones and shipped them. ..........long hours, hot building, and freezing in the winter time. It’s a good place to work but the management is all not on the same page."
good,Les responsables de division mettent sans cesse la pression à leurs employés et collaborateurs
good,"This is a nice place to work at if you are looking for tuition reimbursement or health insurance. However, when it is not peak season it is very difficult to get many hours so do not work here for the pay if it is your only job."
good,UPS is a fast paced workplace with tons of nice people. Some not so nice. People are very helpful when it comes to needing help. The management definitely needed to be changes though
good,"Fast paced environment with somewhat disorganized. The company said they were going to raise the rate of pay in august of 2018, it is now close to the end of January and the rate has remained at the same rate of $11."
good,"What I expected for a seasonal job, a lot of in and out truck and a lot of stairs but it was good for my health. Would do it again once I apply again."
good,"It's a fun place to work,  but not something to make into a career if you don't want to move up. They have you work in all departments because They are always understaffed because they keep losing people because of the hours"
good,It is a good start to work at UPS because you learn great work ethic and you get to stay in shape. You also get to learn from your coworkers and supervisors.
good,If you weren't getting paid then you would probably would question weather or not the Job is slaved labor. you don't get many hours unless your a superhuman with mutant capabilities an work at sonic speed.
good,It was fun excited. Work hard and fast when needed.made sure job was finished. I was trying to do my best. Take care problems when needed. Keep doing what you have to on site.
good,It is a very fast pace work environment and I actually went everyday that i was supposed to . And it was a hard job but at the same time I like it . But when I went for a whole week me and a couple of others we kept getting sent back home because they were saying it was first come first serve so I had to find something else
good,Pay is great go benefits stock plan and also pitching for retirement. But behind all that it's very micromanage.. very stressful and demanding. 14 hours a day is very stressful mentally and physically
good,i drove around dropping off pagages all day in a ups truck as a  driver helper it was fast paced and kept you busy and on your feet and aware i would work for them again
good,Shifts went by quickly and you are constantly in motion and engaged. Environment was typical of warehouse/industrial zones and there was a huge emphasis on safety and accuracy.
good,"Good job to have if your'e going for school."
good,"Never seen a supervisor there, or rarely would, and if something isnt working properly you’re out of luck. Very fast oaced and pretty heavy boxes that i can see damaging one’s joints"
good,I only worked with UPS for a couple of months during their Peak Season. I enjoyed working with the driver as his helper and it was good money when i needed it the most.
good,I was on a temp assignment. I held the position as office manager. The lady I replace was on leave. It was a great place to work. I was told they would keep me if she didn't come back. Unfortunately she came back and I was let go.
good,Great if you started young long time ago- a lot of empty promises about moving people from part time to full time. Not consistent enough to be able to stay.
good,Great place to work while going to school. Paid college tuition in full to employees working third shift. Seasonal employees make very good bonuses weekly.
good,"you go into work and they give you a brief visual on what your doing then expect you to just do it, the belt is extremely slow and the first week or so you got no idea what your doing or what not to do. then you go and ask questions and its not like your worth the time to explain they just expect to do it."
good,"preparing paperwork for customers , answering phones dealing with carriers"
good,"IF you have never been in the military; but worked at UPS, then you could say you have been in the closest thing next to the military. You will follow the program that is the focus of the quarter to make goals. There are not exceptions, and its not negotiable."
good,Working for ups is a very fast pace and stressful job. The benefits for a part time job are amazing and unmatched by any other part time job. There are way to advance at ups but its very difficult.
good,Fast pace caused you to make less money. Was only getting 20 hrs per week with a very small take home. The work to pay ratio was very off and not fair.
good,"I work at the airport, maybe if you’re at a differenr location they might treat you better. Very poor management that will lie to keep them out if trouble."
good,"This was my most recent job. It is really a good workout. Usually a lot of heavy lifting, some boxes even said team lift that you would have to handle on your own."
good,it was never a long term job for me I got a job there as a second job and was doing it for extra cash on the side wasn't to bad it was just extra cash for m e
good,"It is a good job, good benefits, not enough pay for the hours I work. Management could be better and it is very stressful. I learned about priorities and time management. The workplace culture was stressful. The hardest part of the job was during Christmas, also known as peak season and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet in the work place."
good,"United Parcel Service is an American multinational package delivery and supply chain management company. The global logistics company is headquartered in the U.S. city of Sandy Springs, Georgia, which is a part of the Greater Atlanta metropolitan area."
good,I did not like ups they usually do not Care about their workers and are not friendly thier you only get a 10 minute lunch break that is not enough for your food to digest and get back to work
good,Great place for starting a career and to finish school they help with alot wen it comes to schooling and getting your education settled I would recommend it
good,This is a good job for drivers who are young in age. This is not a job I'd recommend for people seeking management opportunities. There is ZERO work/life balance. UPS demands a huge amount of your time and you will have to sacrifice your family/social life if you have aspirations of advancing in this company.
good,"If you’re trying to advance in the company, go to school, get the benefits then it’s a good job to have if that’s your main focus to come to UPS then you will be good."
good,"work facility was average, well organized and clean. Employees were pleasant to work with. on the job training was provided, shift work and pay was average"
good,Drivers were accommodating to my schedule. Drivers would pick me up in a spot close to my school. This was a temporary job for the holiday season. The reason it was busy and they needed extra help was because of the holiday season
good,The job essentially is a long shift of cardio and heavy lifting. You are expected to perform at sometimes super-human levels. You must be mentally tough to work here due to the amount of stress you will be put through.
good,this was a temporary position if you are able to get into this company on a full time basis would be far more beneficial to you then temporary work in the long run
good,fast paced house to house work. rain snow sleet hail. it is hard. at night its hard to see house addresses. dogs chase you around and you constantly have to get up out the truck which puts pain on your legs. its ok when its not busy
good,Decided to returned to ups although could not returned I was very ill at the time also had an opportunity to become a fulltime driver not a fair work load so I were terminated.
good,I always enjoyed my job because my supervisors were very helpful and supportive.   I worked hard and they knew that and would always thank us for our hard work.  Over the years the managers and supervisors changed and they stopped caring about the employees and everything we were taught about how to do the job and became more focused on how fast we could get it done so they could get bigger bonuses.  And us older workers who were making a lot more than the new hires were pressured into leaving.
good,Good workplace I enjoyed my time at UPS it was one of the best jobs I ever had. I would recommend this job to any individual who is people friendly and retail experience.
good,The business was ok but when I injured my wrist and I had to quit because they didn't have any lite work for me. Im not sure if id work for them again.
good,I just worked seasonal ups was a great temp job was busy not much of a break was thirsty a lot everyone was nice I guess anyone could work there. it was cool
good,I worked for an individually owned store for USPS.  Really liked the atmosphere as well as the customer service/sales aspect.  Can't help with this.  Not a UPS employee.
good,"One of my favorite jobs i've had. However the job was only part time and seasonal, due to lack of work I was forced to find further employment. I would recommend this job to people looking for a second job that's part time."
good,Management is detached from the real world ramifications of what the average working person must endure and it negatively impacts their ability to treat people fairly.
good,"Typical work day is hectic, chaotic, and stressful. Fast paced work environment, which I like. I worked on the preload shift which was overnight so it allowed me to get a second job. Being in management is very stressful there but I learned a lot of to work with people and made close bonds with my coworkers."
good,"As a supervisor, the other supervisors will treat you poorly in front of your colleagues and even in front of the employees. Come peak season at UPS, do not expect to have much of a social life as they will work you until you can no longer stand and make you come back the next day. Other than that the pay is alright and my employees are AMAZING! They are what make me keep coming back."
good,this is an ok place to work at. I leant a lot for my bosses and a bunch were really nice to me. the problem that I had with this place is that it was  either too hot or too cold.
good,"i did not have a positive work experience at UPS. I felt the supervisors were rude and belittling, I felt they were not concerned with their team as they were with getting trucks loaded and sent out."
good,"Learned a lot of organizational skills and how to work in a team. Management was shakey and seemed like they were hiding something. Was laid off over the phone, very unprofessional."
good,I enjoyed working as a driver helper but the time working was limited. You are only able to work during PEAK hours and even then you are restricted by those who schedule the helpers.
good,Working at UPS loading and unloading trucks on a daily basis. What a minimum of a 5-hour shift but over time was always available. Fast Pace Non-Stop for 5 hours
good,"i left the union for a Management position.  at the time UPS took care of its Management.   then they slowly took away bonuses and incentives as well as decreased raises while increasing hours and goals.  if you are there to just collect a paycheck then its fine but if you take pride in your work and try to take care of your team, then you will be frustrated constantly.   you will be expected to do a job with limited resources and time.  the only thing they care about is hitting production goals regardless of safety or customer service."
good,The people there are great how ever if you are not a fast worker it is not the ideal job for you. It does make a good part time job but you will find your self tired and drained.
good,I would recommend to people who are just looking for a random job. Its very fast paced. You have to help yourself not everyone is gonna help u. You should bring ear buds.
good,Part time hours but not guaranteed. Always good to have a second job because just this will not allow you to provide for your family. Hours fluctuate as well
good,"This is a good job for someone in highschool or in college that needs very good medical, dental etc benefits but the shift you are given doesnt include mandatory overtime"
good,"Review sales performance and target."
good,Good advancement opportunities if you are looking to become a manager or driver but if you are the warehouse type not much movement. Benefits are great and come in very handy.
good,"Intially, the work climate was good.  Working at UPS definitely taught me how to work hard.  I enjoyed working with my co workers. It was part-time. Constant pace"
good,"During season (October to Janurary) this job is long hours with a chance to make good pay. As soon as season ends, however, the shifts can be very short or there will be not enough work at all and you'll be sent home."
good,"If you're looking for something part time and are comfortable with early morning / graveyard shifts, then it can fill a need.  The job is simple and learn as you go.  "
good,A typical day at the UPS Warehouse for me would usually start on a Tuesday morning around 12 am if you worked morning shift. You would just come threw the security gates and swipe your card to come in then walk threw the cross walk to the warehouse and proceed to the back to where the converter belts start. Calmly wait for my position manager to arrive at the desk to give us our working stations. The job as an unloader was traditionally pretty easy and quick to get the hang of . The working environment was actually pretty decent considering all of the loud noises from the various of machines going at once. The Manager and all the rest of the employee's were great to work with and made learning how to do things fun.
good,"work Monday through Friday with shifts ranging from early mornings to early evenings. With this position, it’s important to note that shift times can and will vary slightly with each day. This is due to the constantly evolving nature of the business. Hours can range anywhere from 20 to 40 hours each week based on their employment status."
good,The job is a bit stressful depending on the shift you have. I worked the late night so it was pretty intense. The management did tend to pit their employees against each other in a competitive way. This would lead to non-cooperative work environment.
good,Great job to work with others fun time killer nice people to help with what you don't know great way to make money great job to start off with great for time killer
good,"during peak time holiday you can make decent money after that your hours are cut to 4 or 5 a day "
good,Management is okay. Supervisors change very very often. Either from getting fired or quitting. It is an okay work environment. I dont think the workers get paid enough for the amount of work completed in the short amount of time they are given.
good,"Extremely hard and stressful job, give you way too much when you start , pay is good yes but my word do you work for it. Wouldn't recommend going there. Recruitment process is a stringent as the SAS (I'm not joking ) it just isn't worth the hassle at all, take a less paid but less stressful job, money isn't everything."
good,Mir hat es einfach gefallen den ganzen tag alleine zu arbeiten.
good,The work culture is heavily influenced by a demand for OT hours. The higher up the pay scale the more they require personal time. It's a great place to start your professional career but I personally can't say it's great to stay.
good,"It's a nice, calm work environment. Easy work, sometimes you have a lot of work and are moving fast but overall it's not bad. When there's nothing to do, you clean and make everything nice, but when all that is done, you just walk around doing nothing until there's something to do"
good,Good company to work for.  Good pay but long hours.  the hardest part about the job was the long driving periods.  the most enjoyable thing about the job was the flexibility of work schedule.
good,"Go to pre-sort meeting and get prepared to start the day, Ensure everyone is ready for day."
good,"Its a fast paced job. Your always moving, bending, pulling, stacking. I would say lifting was the hardest part of the job. I liked the atmosphere and everyone was so helpful."
good,"The that are there do NOT follow any of the rules and regulations there, and it's an very unsafe work environment, holes in the dock metal rails in the ground are sticking out, the managers are very unprofessional and rude, A lot of favoritism. Hardest part of the job is the weather.It's an open dock (no door) so whatever the weather is like outside it's gonna be the same on the dock. The most and enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck. It's not the type of job that you can come to work and be happy that you are there."
good,"Good Place to work, lots to learn and grow. Hard to advance on the supervisory side without a completed degree remotely impossible but if you have a degree and are willing to relocate a lot of opportunities will be available for you."
good,Conditions were cold as I was hired on for the christmas rush. Package loaders were expected to load enough packages per hour to make you break a sweat in freezing temperatures.
good,I worked here for only a little over a month. It was a seasonal job. It was an easy job. My job was to load a trailer whether it be a 47 foot or a 53 feet the trailer needed to be filled all the way to the door.
good,"I liked ups because it wasn’t only weekdays and you had weekends off, but they pay weekly plus they have a 300 weekly bonus so it was kinda good to get paid a little bit more"
good,"High pay, good work/life balance, and fair use of skills."
good,It is good money but a hot workplace. I am not fond of this job hence why I am looking for another. I learned package handling skills and I learned better communication skills working here.
good,"This is a very productive and fast-paced job.  It can feel overwhelming the first couple of days, but once you get used to the pace it is a very enjoyable job."
good,load and unload semi trucks and assist in packages getting to their intended destination. fast paced environment working with many people. assist in damage control
good,"An average day would consist of meeting your driver and doing the route. Quickly hopping out of the truck to leave a package or get a signature, depending on what needed to be done."
good,"Ups is a great job with many benefits, raises, job oppurtunities, etc. But its usually a struggle to make it through the week cause management are always clueless and dont care, the money is good for an beginner but if your trying to build yourself and live then you need a second job or full time job. In general its a good job if you can will yourself to deal with the laziness of others including the higher ups."
good,"I was in LTL department. I was trained on equipment and how to update the computer. It was a position to where you can work alone. However, it depends on the other departments to accomplish their tasks in order for you to accomplish yours. This didn't happen often and you were forced to do tasks out of your job description."
good,"not for the weak. "
good,"Working hard was satisfying, but if other people were lazy, you would end up having to help them do their work.  People couldn't be fired for being bad/slow so many people were. Management dropped considerably at the end."
good,"My job was through a staffing agency, and I started on October 5th. This was much too early for the job I  was hired for. I was kind of on my own for while, and found things to do. "
good,Güzel bir iş yeri ama sorumlu olan kişilerin elemanlara hitap şekilleri yanlış
good,"Basic Job. Worked there for about two months, had to relocate for life goals. Pay was fine, even got a raise. Managers were fine. Just your basic college job."
good,Pay was not good enough for the labor. Nasty work area can be very unsafe at times. the manger was really cool. the best part of the job was the benefits
good,"I love my co-workers and dispatch.  If someone comes along and isn't a good fit for our hub, they get weeded out fairly quickly.  You have to be very versatile.  Our daily schedule often changes three times before we leave the yard.  "
good,"I have to come through the Security gates and get checked and then go clock in on the computer, go to my meet up area with my teammates & manger. We break out and go to work  area & get started loading up trucks, I loaded about 4 trucks a day & around 900 box’s a day I touched"
good,"Good company if you have the drive for it."
good,Its a great experience ive have fun at the same time i was working hard work with others we its come down to it im good at being a good team player work hard. Unload trucks as a team until everything is well organized
good,"Great place to work. The team is great and feels like family. Fast paced in the holidays but keeps you busy. If you need experience in shipping and packing, The UPS store is the place to go."
good,"Stressful work environment. Especially during peak season. Great if in need of quick cash, temporary employment. Not the best working conditions. Just pray."
good,The job is hard work not intended for everyone. Fast paced and back breaking. Can be rewarding as far as compensation. Work life balance is ok but not the greatest.
good,from the moment you walk in your job is piled up waiting for you some days you would unload a truck and the packages on the belt thats coming in or you could be loading the truck up and taking the packages off the belt and putting them inside the truck
good,A stressful job environment that is very fast paced and always busy.  Managers vary in term of their performance and you have to always be ready to work under pressure.
good,"Busy work, for the area I was assigned at for the holidays."
good,"Work is hard for most and you have to have very thick skin. It is a militant environment. When it is hot outside, it is hotter inside.  Also the same is true for cold weather.  There is a lot of yelling from everyone."
good,I was a coordinator for the drivers. I provided driver helpers to them during the holidays. I would send the driver helpers to the drivers tto different locations everyday. The driver helpers would report at different times through out the day. This was a temp job
good,"no room for growth, the company has very limited mobility."
good,for me the work load became a burden when more demands were put forth. supervisor turn around was the worst part. could never feel adjusted to one supervisor.
good,"•	Manage and sort all outbound mail pieces according to various zip codes"
good,"The typical day at work is unloading 4-5 trailers a day. Some of the management do not know what there doing. Sometimes you get easy, light packages other times you get packages that are 100 lbs or more."
good,"called only at times when needed.. after a week of training, waited two long weeks before actually working. human resource at bradley airport doesn't care much about you"
good,"4429 Old Highway 99 S Roseburg, OR 97471"
good,"I would not recommend anyone applying to work at UPS and persuading a career to expect any of that here because their are people who are on seniority wait list for years and have put in so much time for this company and have still not yet got what they needed, overall I’ll recommend being a driver is a better option for someone who’s looking for a career"
good,I guess my review is a little different for the simple fact that I was a driver helper. I was planning on consistently called or working throughout the week but in fact I was not. Dealing with that is what actually turned me away from this job. It was too inconsistent.
good,It was a really fun job but only seasonal for me. I would have loved to stay there if I had been given the chance to stay. They took care of there employees who
good,Ok job to have if you are looking for part time work but there is not much room for improvement as the hourly rates are low and the hours are short outside of the holiday season
good,Eskiden kalma patron şirketi kültürü devam etmekte.
good,This company helped me a lot in speaking to people and dealing woth complaints whilst staying in a good working manner. Also helped me in learning on being a  clerk.
good,just do whatever they tell you to with a smile and put in the time and eventually you may be fulltime management within 15 years. if you stay union you will have to put in atleast 15 years to get on fulltime
good,UPS is a place where you want to make quick money but it’s not really worth it. I would consider this job for younger people who don’t go to college or even college students. But no
good,The ups store help me work more on talking to costumers and get a feel on what to say to sale more products and get the sales up at the store nothing was to hard had great teaching
good,"very busy work, no time to catch breathe, but very good company to work for. great people, great co workers, just have unopportune hours and work for me"
good,"Driver you are assigned to for seasonal work are friendly and understanding."
good,"It was okay, you just are being paid to work out basically, just be prepared to handle HEAVY packages. If you work seasonal be prepared to move at a faster pace than normal."
good,"UPS store is nice place to work, however, in my experiences the UPS store is franchise base, so it depends where and the owners you working to. In the store that I worked, everything is okay, but I obviously need more hour but can't be added since I only work part-time."
good,UPS has a strong culture and decent pay.  If you are in upper management you have a lot more opportunities than you would have as a business professional. People stay in the company for a very long time so there is not much movement as one would think in a corporation.
good,A high challenged position. Every day is a new and difficult challenge. Lack of communication from upper management and micro-managed in decision making. Establishing an open relationship  and servant leadership with union employees is one of the job's great accomplishments.
good,"I had trouble at first,but I learned alot an picked up certain skills from most of the men I worked with. Overall I would recommend this job for other women"
good,"recommended if you want good money and good benefits, but don’t recommend if you like your beauty sleep, very hard and demanding physical work, varied hours."
good,I would arrive to work and clock in and report to the loading docks. The loading docks is where the trucks would unload boxes of products from different companies from all over the world.
good,"The hours were not represented right. I was told while being hired that the hours would be 5 to 9. I have never  gotten those. My hours are really as follows Monday it's 5:30 to 8:00 or 8:30. Thursday through Friday 5:45 to 8:00 or 8:30. Honestly those are about what you can manage at the pace set with heat in the summertime and repetative lifting of quite heavyweight packages. (Everyone starts at unloading) Most of the packages I lift are 30 to 45 pounds this is back to back nonstop to keep up with the pace needed to get them out on time. I will say the volume of 50 pound plus packages is rather high and I don't recomend the job to anyone who already has back pain of any sort. The hardest and most painful job is loading (which I am currently doing) though not as fast paced as unloading. You must stack packages to the ceiling of transfer trailer's, that means lifting many 20 pound plus packages over your head and shoulders repeatedly. I have had packages fall on me and have been bruised all over my legs and arms since I have started working there. I am 5'2 125 pounds. It is just not a fit for me. The mangers are very good to work for and when I do ask for help with 70 pound plus packages (I try just to push them into place if I can but if they have to be stacked or I get 3 or more at a time I just ask now) they help. And they bring around water when it is really hot."
good,loading the truck as packages came down the line. putting them in alphabetical order......   during the Christmas season  a lot of the packages were very heavy the conditions were very cold!!   It was very loud.
good,"Was good while it lasted. Encourage every employee or trainee to take every job serious and disregard how bossed make talk or interact with you.  a typical day at work consist of loading packages, reading labels, seperating packages by belt color and so on. United Parcel is a good job, but it's not where you have to end."
good,"Great place to work and learn all the functions of UPS."
good,"Very physical work, very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Fast paced work environment must pay attention to detail specifically in the case of what package goes to what dock."
good,Can be a very hostile place where nobody really cares. They play favorites and only enforce rules on certain people. They are way behind other companies.
good,I hated it they had me always doing extra work that I didn't have to do . they always made me do somebody else work with no questions asked . they were very stricked
good,"A typical work day begins between 1:30 am and 2:30 am, between those hours your always loading packages non-stop and you on get a 10 min. break. I've learned how to function in a fast paced environment and how to properly lift and lower heavy packages. The hard part of the job is pulling package that weigh over 70+ pounds each and every day. There's not really much enjoyable about working at UPS, it become pretty mundane and stressful after awhile."
good,Great job but not paying enough. Overall productive and interesting and keep your hands moving.  I really like this job but it has a lot of responsibilities
good,"Not too impressive, but not absolutely terrible. Most management is semi-professional and you'll be working hard for up to four hours for so-so pay. The workplace culture is alright if you have the patience."
good,its ok just takesalong time to get useto the envirnment wish it wasnt to hot in there . can use more fans or ac to keep others cool. love to talk to us be=ut work at a fast pace
good,Not a bad place to start if you can handle union work at $10 an hour starting with the only chance to advance to driver is someone retiring or quiting all of a sudden. slow advancement.
good,A regular day as in every other company. learnt about agile technology. Management is not so knowledgeable. work place culture is good. work was enjoyable and no hard part.
good,"Gives promotions every six months , good place to work if you like hard work . Fast paced worm so times goes by fast and it is rewarding at the end of the day ."
good,This was a fun seasonal part time job for extra money during the holiday season. I only worked here for a short time until I found something more suiting.
good,I didn't enjoy working here. The hours didn't fit my needs and the wage wasn't enough. Sometimes I stayed overtime and usually didn't get paid for it.
good,Label and packaging packages making sure everything’s in order in correctly shipping them out on time  in good perfect shape. It’s a great job if you love working with people and fast paced
good,"Not a bad shift time wise, IMO"
good,"They really need to improve on communication and professionalism, there is poor supervision"
good,"As a Seasonal Driver Helper you are prepared for the job by attending and completing and orientation.  This outlines: the delivery of package expectations, policies and procedures as well as compliance with driver instructions and safe work habits.  Days could be long dependent on the package load.  The drivers don't stop for breaks/rest periods so be prepared to go non-stop all day once you get into the van.  The drivers were mostly very friendly and helpful.  On occasion packages can be very awkward to handle and can be very heavy."
good,"Long hours, very cold warehouse, heavy lifting. I would not recommend this job for a woman, very strenuous. Hard work, be ON TOP of your hours, supervisors are carless with them."
good,"for 4 to 8 hrs straight sorting and loading boxes into a truck. we had to adjust to changing conditions of the weather because there was no air conditioner but there was heat in the winter."
good,Good starter job.. starter career. In the first few years ( unless one becomes a driver) it will be hard to survive off UPS alone. Will need a second job.
good,"This was a decent job. It required a lot of bending, squatting, and lifting of heavy packages. I would load and scan packages to confirm delivery, arrival, and for condition."
good,i enjoyed my time working with ups i really enjoyed the environment i made a great net work while working in the establishment itwas a overall great experience
good,"Good if you can stand constant chaos, company infighting, and stress.  If you can... and you last a while.. pay is top end and benefits are hard to beat.  Develop a hard skin and tolerance for stress and you can do well either as management or crew."
good,typical work place learned a lot working hear management was okay noting really hard about the job I liked work for them the only hard part was working night shift staying awake.
good,have to be willing to work in any type of weather and very dedicated. they offer you good benefits after a certain amount of time that you are there so that's a plus
good,ups had to of been my favorite job of all time. wish i never moved from it. it was definitely a career and if i could i would return there anytime....
good,The work is mental and physical. People complain a lot. It is very cliquey. There is definitely poor morale. People are snakes. Poor teamwork. Not overly proficient leadership.
good,"$10 an hour is not enough for this job, not even close.  "
good,"Hard work, hard to advance, want a company to grow and possibly make a career. You can start at ups. If your looking for part time or full time or seasonal."
good,I have also learned a lot from working at UPS they allowed me to gain just as much experience as I did working for Walmart. For the seasonal/temp jobs they have it is good for a person who needs extra income.
good,"UPS provided a stable work environment where they like to keep you in a position that you are good at. It is very difficult to move up in the company unless you are a favorite with supervisors of management. if you are good at your job, you can expect to be there for the long run. Not much room for advancement."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. I learned how to be a better hostler  and how to  work with containers. Management was very organized and fast paced. The work culture as professional and upbeat. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was how great the salary was.
good,"This is a temporary job to regain job history. It's not in my field, but would be great for someone without a college education. Great opportunity to move up within the company."
good,UPS is good for younger individuals that need a union to stand up for them.  I was not allowed to help my team as a supervisor because of the union and I fully understand why but when I can't get union personnel to help them I don't think it is fair to make my line work twice as hard because union reps (which didn't volunteer to help them when coming on the line to verbally tell me I can't help them) can't get the company to help the individual
good,"Be ready to jump in - sink or swim! Compliance training is the only training that remains constant and informative (if one pays attention). Organizational development and training can be found online, but would be much more beneficial if presented regularly and personally to lower-level management: mentoring, networking, team-building are flash ideas that suddenly become unavailable (budget constraints... or too time-consuming)."
good,You'll learn alot working there and sometimes it'll get rough when loading the trucks but you'll like it once you get the hang of it. The pay is good but the hours aren't enough.
good,"Its fun to work for UPS, lot of learning, and good co-workers who care about each other. It gets busy during December , and management has to go out and help delivering packages but it takes us closer to our service providers (backbone of the organization) and help us understand our customers even better. Culture of giving back to the community you work in is something I am very proud of."
good,Ups is a very challengimg job and its very competitive and quick pace you have to really be aware of your souroundings on the job because anything can happen.
good,Nice pt job flexible hours i don't won't to give anymore feeback and can't understand why i have to answer this question ups i not for everybody.  no i.
good,"this was a seasonal job. I worked there when i was younger, Very fast paced. Unloaded trucks all day. That was my only assignment. It was good excercise"
good,"Overall experience at UPS wasn’t too bad. Hours were shorter than expected, wouldn’t provide as much em tea hours due to huge staff. Commute from my home in Berwyn was too much after the holiday season"
good,"I would be better off working for myself, the managers at this company have issues and they take it out on the ones doing the hard work."
good,"The company is just ok.  There is nothing that stands out as being spectacular or a driving force to stay.  Most people are looking for more, but they just don't know how."
good,"Fast paced and dispensable employees. UPS applied stress and danger in my life I can never forget. I am grateful for the experience and knowledge, however."
good,"Los once años que estuve trabajando en la compañía fueron gratos y satisfactorios contando con un gran grupo de compañeros haciendo amistades que todavía conservo."
good,I worked in customer service and also in pricing. The company had great benefits but my pay was very low. I ended up having to leave because the cost of living was more than what I made.
good,"no where to put personal belongings management was disrespectful an work environment was very old an dirty not secure at all."
good,"I loaded trucks for three years at UPS."
good,UPS Freight is a part-time position. They are an expanding business. Management are very understanding and family oriented. Co-workers are helpful and work as a team.
good,"Overall a decent place to work. plenty of training. Working conditions not so great. Hot,cold and sometimes dangerous weather. Highly mismanaged upper aircraft maintenance supervisors. Great pay & benefits, while working."
good,UPS was an ok place to work but it was alot of work for a little pay. if you work alot of hours you didnt see it on your check...it was an over welming job with long hours.
good,"A typical work day included answering phones, and customer questions.   Along with that you would on occasion have meetings geared toward increase location profits and customer satisfaction."
good,Management needs to to better for a huge company they have a lot of issues  they need to work out especially around the holidays when they hire all the seasonal people.
good,"There were good days and bad days at UPS. Days when the work was simple and quick and days where it was a long slog. Sometimes the supervisors were pretty mean if you weren't going fast enough even if you were trying your best. And the conditions were bad at times as well. It wasn't for me but if you like that kind of work, it could be good for you."
good,"Not many hours (5-)"
good,"Management of department resources to ensure maximum output, accuracy, and efficiency at all times.  Meet or exceed all established standards for accuracy and productivity.  Ensure that all department and/ or corporate policies and procedures are communicated, understood, and adhere to.  Establish and promote a positive, team-oriented work environment emphasizing employee involvement, pro-active communication, inter-departmental cooperation, and continual improvement on all levels.  Responsible to ensure that all employees adhere to safety policies and procedures at all times, operating in full compliance with department, station, corporate, and OSHA requirements."
good,"Overall the job itself is not difficult by any means. What makes this job difficult is being on call 24/7. Living day to day being called in at different times all around the clock is both exhausting and stressful, not to mention trying to find time during the week to do literally anything is next to impossible. The senority list is so long it would take a new employee 20 plus years to even get a steady schedule at all, which makes staying in the company that much more dreadful. Also, the communication in the company is awful, to the point where you have to ask 10 different people thr answer to one question. The best thing about the job is the pay and benefits, but honestly i would take the pay cut just to have somewhat of a steady schedule."
good,"Its and easy job, you just move boxes around, there are certainly some days where it can get overwhelming, I would have loved to keep working here but the facility I was assigned too has really poor management, also the turnover rate for new employees is really high."
good,Its really hands on and quick paced but mostly depends on how much is on your truck...your so busy that u have to bring your own lunch because theres no time to stop and really do anything else but work
good,I would work here again if it was or is possible. I am not sure about the kind of clients they are working for. All and all it was a good place to work.
good,very productive and work management work place culture is good a typical day would be come in and start working on your project Finnish project start you on another one.
good,"UPS is not a bad place to work. If you are on the management side of things, it can get a bit hectic like any other place. I work on the maintenance side of things as a supervisor, the people in my department are always stressed always getting chewed out by managers from different departments. It is fun there is a plenty of things to do and always something different. In my case, I get bored because I do not like sitting in an office doing paper/computer work all day. I rather learn and work with my hands."
good,Flexible when it comes to hours and great if you’re in school. Lack hours during the week sometimes. Pay could be better but they are really good with working with your schedule.
good,"It’s been almost 30 years since I worked here, a lot had changed but I still keep in contact with some employees and they are happy to be working there"
good,"Hard job, but not if your used to the work. Its easy once your about 3 or 4 months in. With my experience there management was poor but the pay is worth what time you do put in."
good,"I worked at a UPS Store, not for UPS.  I liked the job, lots of different things to do.  Putting mail away, making copies, laminating things.  I thought it was fun."
good,Took a lot to get the job done each day. Early mornings and fast paced. Training process is required and necessary because it takes awhile to fully learn how to pull a belt and load three different trucks.
good,UPS is a great company and has a lot to offer those who need tuition assistance and decent benefits.  I was lucky enough to pay my way through college while working for UPS.  The problems that I have with the company is the upper management in the company drives production above all else.  Hitting production goals does save money but what does that matter if the company is damaging its reputation by destroying packages and racking up costs from injuries in the process?  This practice is a killer for employee moral too since the apparent solution to not hitting production is typically making management work longer hours until the problem is fixed.
good,"•It’s a very poor job at times."
good,"Pay is low, very hard to move up. You will start slow, doing basic office work. Difficult to get training, sometimes it will be up to you to find out how to do thing."
good,Fast Pace But Short Hours And its hard to get hired in. but very easy job and its kinda laid back. the pay was weekly. My biggest issue was the hours.
good,"Was fast paced, got in good shape."
good,No comment. Its a very busy job. If you like to stay busy this is the job for you. You work usually about 12 hours a day so if you like working here you go.
good,easy job slow paced get to work on your own the hours arent bad max time you work is 3 to 4 hours a day unloading was the best part about the job i never really loaded
good,"early hours, part time hours, long time to advance in your career.  a lot of moving and lifting.  chances for advancement after a lot of time spent in the warehouse"
good,"It was an on-campus temp job for me. I don't have strong opinions about it. Unfortunately, I was not hired on to be a part-time worker. Culture seemed to be pretty cool."
good,UPS can be a great company to work for if you put in the time.  I considered myself fairly lucky as I became a package car driver after a little over a year of working as a package car loader from 3am to 9am.  UPS has great benefits and insurance but the stressful day to day duties can take a toll on your body and life.
good,"As a young professional, UPS provided me a chance to grow by working with seasoned team members. This was a great experience as I learned from the ground up."
good,Recommend if you need money right now. Pretty much the average day you just go to your area. Clock in and get ready as soon as posssible to start loading boxes. When you get the chance you will be told or you will just know to come out your truck to take the irregs off the tables that come from the train driver.
good,Just didnt like the job. it wasnt me. since it was a union job alot of people acted like they were the boss and did what they wanted even at the expense of co workers. and there was too much drama work place was just poison
good,"It really depends on the function and your manager as to your experience with the company. In operations I experienced very bad management. In corporate, management is friendly, holds rigid ""old school"" values, very helpful, however career development is extremely slow and mostly avoided."
good,Ups hours start at night and theres no set time you get off you have to stay there to you get finish with your job thats one reason they cant keep employees
good,Its ok to work for just had to move farther away. Required to load a truck. That's about all I do. For about 4 hrs a day 5 days a week. For 10.35 cant live off that.
good,"UPS is a fast paced competitive environment.  Very physical environment you must keep focused, alert and be in shape to handle daily packaging workload."
good,You definitely have to have a strong mind set. I just looked at the job as going to a workout ..for 4 hours each day. I had to pray each day  before I enter the building. God Help Me...
good,"It wasn't difficult it was just relentless. The people were friendly, but if you try to low ball your pay at first they'll take advantage of it. If you don't like the hours they try to work with you but rarely will they fix your personal schedule."
good,"If you can work 3 - 5 hours in this fast-paced and physically demanding job, then you can be a UPS package handler. Consider the low pay and what it costs to your health when working in this job."
good,"Peaceful alil nosey but good working conditions "
good,A difficult job with heavy lifting lifting  heavy boxes onto trucks. Workers worked together to do the job right. We worked under a time constraint so time was up to the limit. Sometimes there were injuries.
good,"Exactly what you'd expect, hard physical work, weird hours, etc. On the other hand they're pretty much always hiring and will hire most anyone, so quite useful as a stopgap job if you need one."
good,It’s a good place to work but it’s tough and unforgiving.  Upper management will have you back as long it counts for them. No proper time to actually train new employees so most books are made up. Go in there knowing it’s for benefits and it will take years to go anywhere.
good,"the work was hard but manageable my colleagues were always helpful, but eventually i had to leave as it was a temporary jo while i back packed thru Europe."
good,New management is focused more on the dollar than the employees. They have removed or people has left positions and UPS hasn’t replaced the workers but added more on the plates of  existing employees to compensate for the void without increasing their pay for the additional service. So workers are being over worked and under compensated. You can maintain your life working at UPS but not really get ahead in life expecially with the changes being made.
good,"Work can be stressful at times, but for the most part rewarding. This company demands fast pace solutions in order to meet customer demands and deadlines as with any global logistics company."
good,Nice Place to start off with great growth potential especially if you trying to work yourself up in the business. Its good job to work to make some extra money if you are a college student
good,"Wages as a preloader aren't good,you get 25hrs a week not including overtime and your check comes out to barely anything at the end of the week,Benefits are great but they make you have to work extra overtime at my position to see the pay you really deserve"
good,"Fast paced company and that is a good thing. "
good,IT temp position at UPS 6 month contract was extended.  travel to offsite customers. weekdays no weekends.  decent benefits and travel expenses.  would recommend
good,"ups is a stressful job to work for. In the long term of working with ups as an employee. There is a lot of wear and tear on the body. Which, will eventually lead to injury."
good,"At the beginning, the job was worth staying around for but some months in, I'm considering leaving. Only reason why I stayed this long is because of my co-workers, they have convinced me to stay. If this raise doesn't improve my finances tremendously, then I would have to look for a new job."
good,very good not to much to complain about unless you do not like hard labor. some supervisors feel entitled and might be condescending at times. Really depends on shift
good,Good benefits and competitive wages Strict work environment/conservative. Management has a large divide between management and administratives. Lack of confidenciality is an issue.
good,I liked working there for being my first real job they were great at offering training for the position that git hired for package handler it was great working there
good,i was the helper to deliver packages to customers during the holidays. they would drop me off with packages and i would walk to deliver them while they deliver other packages
good,Im a hard work  i’m looking to get a job done and make more money give more hours and help with the company grow in like manner from other people as I start a new job that I never done before
good,Incredible place to work with friendly staff it's just the poor working conditions at the warehouse in summer and other seasons that affect staffs which contribute to low daily output.
good,it was a temp job...i really didn't plan on staying ..there year i worked there it was kinda crazy a lot more packages than normal.so it was stressful @ times
good,start with a meeting with other supervisors and discuss the plan for that day and the results of the day before. Because you have to make adjustment to the plan spontaneously this part is more exciting for me.
good,Happy to work with UPS. Its good company to work with but the tech mahindra contract was completed so I had to move on for other assignments with in TechM. I will love to work with UPS in future
good,working in 85+ whether. rain or sunshine. carrying 1 lbs to 150 lbs packages for 8 to 12 hour days. dealing with management and union members. dealing with the public and private sector.
good,I will wait until the supervisor to tell me which trailer to get in  before i start. I learned how to lift heavy boxes without hurting myself & work as a team. The hardest part of the job was to push the boxes the other side of the unit. The most enjoyable part of UPS is the break/lunch.
good,The pay is just not fair. You get paid every week but you can't do no over time at all. They make sure you get less hours every week. They just need to do better. I have no problem other than the pay
good,Fun people to work around but the job itself is absolutely terrible. Hard work. Fast paced . The management is not so good. Never set up and ready to work when time to open
good,Nel complesso una buona azienda anche se migliorabile per quanto riguarda i responsabili (preposti)
good,I enjoy my time at UPS. I learn something valuable from every department and work area. My work ethic helped me become a high performer at UPS. People enjoy working with me and working to get the job done together.
good,UPS gives me solid corparate culture that I was looking at from beginning .
good,A lot of extra hours due to demand so you end up working more than you think. Team work is necessary. Managers are well trained but can be abrasive. If you want advancement you need college degree but experience sometime trumps degree.
good,"I kinda wish i never i took this job, the pay could've been way better and the hours a little bit more better. My supervisor was inexperienced and threatened my fellow workers and i."
good,"A very fast paced work area, with multiple goals set per day. Work is very physical and can be non stop at times. Hours can be flexible if you need it to be."
good,If you cant lift a lot and move at a fast pace then this is not the job for you. It also gets very hot and you have to be able to follow all safety procedures.
good,"most days I didn't mind going to work everyday, and the work environment was pretty pleasant in general. My main complaints would just be the high turnover rate/frequent change in employees and the days that were unbearably stressful!"
good,This job was seasonal for me because I do attend college as a full time student. The work was hard and very fast paced but paid well. I learned a lot about the warehouse business and gained experience.
good,"UPS is de grootste vervoerder van pakketten ter wereld en voorziet in vervoer van vracht en pallets."
good,It was a fun place to work and the employees taught me a lot. Just the work place was not for me. The manager knew from the start i was not good for the job because it was to fast paced.
good,"As a Ramp Worker at the airport, your job is to operate various equipment that handle the daily volume of packages that arrive/leave through the UPS Hub."
good,I do not feel comfortable reviewing a company that I am leaving. I do not wish to participate in this exercise and I wish to omit my opinion from the review pool.
good,"the typical work day in the summer is very hot. They expect you to process the packages as fast as your can while placing them in the correct place, that's it."
good,"Co-workers are very helpful. However management could've been much, much better. Work is very even paced for the most part, but could get a bit hectic during the peak season/other holidays. Overall a very good job, schedule and pay wise, if you're going to school."
good,i did not really care to work at ups i kind of just needed a job thats not the type of work for me ups was a very stressful place to be at it was a non stop kind of work
good,UPS preload is a very challenging place to work. Management sets the time limit and you are expected to get the job down within that tight timeline. High pressure is an understatement.
good,UPS is a great job to work at it was alright when I work it was seasonal wish I could stay longer are recommended to the people that like staying up and put in boxes where they need to be
good,"Work an average of 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Management is poor and cares only about making money and packages being delivered. There is no time to take off unless you are a senior member of the company. During holiday seasons you work 12+ hours  a day every day, and are not allowed to come back to the building until every package has been delivered. Do not work at this job if you want to have any free time or any time with your family."
good,"Pushes you to work harder and harder everyday, its fun to load the trucks and beat the goal you set the day before. It also takes away any stress that you been holding in"
good,"It was a tough job, we got plenty of exercise. But overall I thought management could be more professional. Upper management would yell at employees all the time. It was not professional."
good,This company was a great place to work at the time. I received general warehouse experience in a team building environment. I will use my skills for future opportunities.
good,"Everyone they call in to work should be able to work not first come first serve,I don't think that's right.Peoples feelings get hurt thinking they going to work but get sent home."
good,"Take packages off truck, 5-7 a day,"
good,I work early in the morning. They throw me all over the place. People will load up to four trucks at a time with over 300 pieces in them. Supervisers don't know why people have stacks outside the trucks and everything is the employees falt.
good,The job was alright my time there was okay I just did what I had to do it was a seasonal job I only worked a couple hours a week tihe time  went by fast there
good,"This job breeds hard work ethic, regardless of job position. Everyday is a new challenge to finish work in timely manner, cautiously, and get packages to desired destination correctly."
good,Ups wasn't really that bad of a job but it left much desired as my pay was usually late and management was a complete disaster. I'm glad I left the job
good,UPS was an ideal job for me. Great work environment. This company provides plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. UPS also process great health benefits for its employees
good,"It was good "
good,Kind of stressing job. Says it’s suppose to be a part time 4:30-9 everyday Monday-Friday. Then when I got the job they tell me I’m on call. Been times where I haven’t work almost two weeks straight.
good,I needed extra money for the Christmas holidays so I applied for the seasonal package hander position for the season. The pay rate was kind of strange to me.
good,fast-paced in 3 hours. The co-worker work together in getting the job done. The supervisors are somewhat are doing there best in a short amount of time
good,The managers seems to be the ones that mess up the building an they seem to have a plan for the work for that shif but for the most of it the building can easly go hay wier but we the part time superiviors are the ones that get back in order.
good,UPS  is a very nice place to work. The work environment was friendly even though it was fast paced. Opportunities for advancement were fair and open for the taking if you so desired.
good,it was a temp job for the holiday just needed extra money but the money is not worth loading semis i think i was horrible the pay was 10 an hour and u had to load at least 4 semis
good,"Given the opportunity to work in different departments within the company ( allowed me to learn great deal regarding operations, management, and most currently planning and optimization -industrial engineering"
good,Lower Management is great. The higher you go the less they care about you.  the airport is a much better atmosphere than the Harrisburg HUB.  smaller centers are better.
good,I worked in the evenings and mornings loading and unloading trucks either heading north bound or south bound it was a hard and fast paced job. very much pressurized
good,"i held this job many years ago so my memory is fuzzy, I do know that the job was busy and could be physically demanding at times. the people that worked there is what made the job enjoyable"
good,"It is hard work and not for everyone. It is fast paced, and things can go awry and build up quickly. If everyone - employees, supervisors, and managers - does their part and works together to achieve an appropriate goal then the job will be smooth, otherwise there will be more accountability, more micromanaging, more paperwork, more everything until you've either had enough or the workplace begins improving enough."
good,"The ups stores are franchises, which means there are no benefits offered and no real way to grow within the company. Its not always hard work but when there is work to do you are working hard."
good,"Working at UPS was an okay experience. What I did was I had to pull boxes out of color coated cages, organize the package with the right truck then chronologically organize the packages."
good,Wasn't a job I could do everyday because of the long walk to my station and being on my feet until it was time to get off. As the days go by it kinda got easy.
good,"I was a supervisor at UPS, so I got to see handlers, fellow supervisors, and drivers at work. First, the hours are awful, and are never set in stone. Extremely high-pressure workplace during sorts, decent communication between the high-low levels. The Job Culture gets 4 stars because it's a blast working on the sorts with the wide variety of employees. It should be a one, because the high-level management only sees numbers when they look at you."
good,I have two trailers two watch but get hit hard then get yell at me for that but how if im the only one loading a trailer with no help until i get hit hard.i hate and love that place
good,It was a pretty quick - paced work that provided a lot of energy to do. it was pretty relaxed at the same time and i enjoyed my time there. It was really a fun job.
good,"Position was through a temp agency, warehouse setting, indoors, working with different teams, good for students or anyone looking just for parttime work."
good,"The company has great medical benefits. You just have to work in the warehouse so many years, before you could get promoted to having your own route to run."
good,"This was supposed to be just be a summer job before i got into undergrad, but the job was a night time job that allowed me to go to school and work at the same time."
good,I have the make sure I send the right package to the specific truck and make sure i send the right package in it prefict location. I have to make sure the area im at is clean at all time.
good,"Monitored packages insuring safety, transported packages from trucks to conveyor belts on average 2300 packages a night. Ups was very fast paced, high demanding job."
good,"A typical day as an unloader, you start off unloading packages that did not get completing by the previous shift. Throughout the night you wait for planes to come to your area and you unload the packages. Putting small envelopes on a certain belt, put anything on under 100 pounds on the regular belt. Then put packages from 100-150 or over 5 feet on the irregular belt. After you finish everything that needs to go out today, you go help the loaders finish loading cans."
good,"The amount of physical labor you do here is unbelievable. The pay rate starts at $12 an hour. Constantly being rushed, management was terrible. They make it known that you're easily replaceable."
good,Travaille très facile à effectuer tout seul dans le camion pas de
good,"Most days a UPS start off a tiny bit calm, however at the tip of a hat the day will go into overdrive, yet others will be sent home almost a guarantee so there are less people to do the job. Once the minimum is achieved of employees, the management will be screaming at everyone for not being able to keep up with anything. Even the employees that have worked there for over 10 years will still struggle to keep up and be yelled at, yet you will be treated very poorly for not being able to keep up with it. Though they do teach how to load properly, at a brisk pace, packages still come down too quickly to keep up for even the most experienced employee. Often times the packages too will become damaged with how management wants things run."
good,The typical day begins with a team meeting to let everyone know what the expectations for the day are. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting some of the many fine people who are employed here.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the many examples of mismanagement which occur because UPS installs too many inexperienced people in positions of authority.
good,It was a lot of menial labor but was a good workout. I worked here over the summer before I went back to school. The workers were friendly enough to make work bearable.
good,Typical day at work was getting put on two truck bays that you were responsible for unloading in a fast pace. i learned how to unload trucks really fast. management was good they were understanding. culture is be fast and get everything done before your shift is over. hardest part of the job is keeping up the pace at first and sometimes you get things that are awkward or very heavy.
good,Great fit for someone who needs to pick up fairly quick work.  The job is seasonal and offers fair pay for fair work.  The work pool of people can be transient due to high turnover at holiday season.
good,wonderful company to work for. management was nice and very understanding. pay was matched with the area and workplace culture was awesome. I would recommend this job to others
good,"My time at UPS was very interesting.  The work is hard and you must be in acceptable physical strength in order to complete your assignment within the allotted time.  The hours of your shift did not correspond to the hours you entered on the online application.  Therefore, you must be very flexible.  Changes were made in the staffing as manager sought need to change.  However, when staffing is decrease, the amount of work is still required.  But when possible, as the parcels runs over from the conveyor belt to the floor assistance is provided.  Management, can on occasions make you feel that you're unable to keep up."
good,Typical day at work consist of scanning packages to appropriate location. Hardest part of my job is the weight lifting for a small person. Workplace culture is friendly and loud.
good,The pay is decent for the simplicity of the job but the hours aren't the greatest unless it's November-December. The supervisors are great and listen when you bring up concerns.
good,"Hard working pace and lots of employees.  It is a 3 hours of work and your for the day.  It early mornings to complete your job duties."
good,"At UPS I worked here part time whilst studying at college, it was ideal to fit in with the hours as they offered evening shifts. Full training was given."
good,At UPS it's fun you meet great people but at the same time it's stressful people think its a easy job but it's actually hard it's not easy loading 1500 boxes in a 20 foot long trailers
good,I don't recommend in today's world. The company changed over the years and is run (in my case) by people not qualified. I retired from there after 30 tears
good,"Very fast paced, had to work hard. Use back & muscles to lift boxes into appropriate place. Had to sort boxes as well. Had a water break & a quick lunch break. Short shift, not too bad."
good,"If you like handling packages, printing documents and photos while listening to the customer's requests on their needs and wants, this place isn't so bad. You learn how to sort mail, handle, wrap and discuss with customers their mailing options and learn how to notarize documents."
good,"Good culture, good people, fair pay. Can get hectic at time if there is a service disruption but management makes sure their team is taken care of. A very caring employer that puts employees first."
good,"The job was very fast paced, something to get use to."
good,Was a driver helper for over 5 6 years. Most of the reviews do not pertain to me because I was not full time they have Al of those things but I was not full time. Cool job riding and helping driver no complaints.
good,"Great place to work i would recommend it to anyone, Upper management is not organized but it has great opportunities to advance up the ladder and move up."
good,I learned that packaging and handling is very tiring work. I learned how to package and unpack  boxes. The hardest part of the job for me was the toll it was taking on my body.
good,A typical day at the ups store is providing quality customer service while helping customers to pack and ship packages. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help someone that is new to shipping and how it works. The hardest part of the job is having to master print jobs. This however makes the job even more fun and challenging. From my time at the ups store I am much  more experienced with computers and print software.
good,Great place to work while you search for what you really want to do.  It is a constantly growing place but the career advancement is limited.  It requires hard work but is a team environment.
good,Management is a bunch of snakes. Good job with union benefits but don't ever trust management. As soon as you get past the 30 day period join the union ASAP.
good,The UPS Store did not pay employees a livable wage. The owners did had no problem sending people to different locations but the different locations were all managed differently so employees were not properly ready to work in different stores.
good,"This was a good job starting off with being young ,but I feel like if your in school pursuing an education  this job is the last job you should have. This job requires a lot of work"
good,"The job is pretty straight forward if you are in the union. You come in and get the job done and get to go home. If you are a supervisor, there are more responsibilities to manage such as employee payroll, working under pressure, conflict resolution, etc. Overall a good place to work."
good,Back breaking work when lifting up heavy boxes to load and unload on the trucks.  Break time too short. I felt the work load was not distributed equally.
good,"It was okay for the time being, didn't see myself unloading and loading trucks without moving up in position. I would go back to it only if they change the ten minute break and move me up in position."
good,"Working in the field and with the drivers is great, youre outside all day and get to stay active. You also have a great opportunity to move up although it is ran very unprofessionally in my opinion, the hiring manager wasn't trained properly therefore misled me on job requirements and actualities of job description."
good,"As a supervisor, I felt as if nobody had my back. We had performance issues with people but they were just talked about and there were no repercussions. There was no incentive to do a better job and there was really no fear of losing your job.  Management did not support us as far as job performance. Yet, my review/raises were based on my team's performance."
good,I get into a grove when work. I learn fast.I can left more then 50lbs.
good,I was not there long. I really don't have much to say about it. It was in Manhattan that was not that far from my house that was the best part of the job.
good,"Very fast paced work enviroment, not super competitive. most people in the workplace get along. Although there were some poor management choices and some supervisors should not have had their postiion due to their lack of ability to communicate with others and delegate work"
good,"You would like it but than you wouldn’t because the supervisors there are mean. Your hands will get really dirty and when u wash them, they won’t really wash off cause if the dirt. It’s just a lot you have to do there."
good,"You start working as soon as you come in you have to be able to lift over 60 pounds, 200-300 boxes a trailer, 5-6 trailers a day, you must bring your own water bottle."
good,"It was okay, Lots of lifting and organizing boxes. Very very few hours and the hourly pay isn't good. Early morning morning hours, waking up at 3-4 am."
good,Expectations were set high and when you reached them they set them higher. In my opinion is fine however when the employees are Teamsters its hard to get them to hit new levels with no motivation. There are incentives at UPS because each Full-Time manager is given a company card to use on employees but they would rather use them on themselves for lunch. This is why I would like to find a job that values their employees as much as their growth and profit. This is probably the hardest thing about the job while the most enjoyable would have to be the people I work with. I've worked there over 10 years now and have worked different positions and on different shifts. I've learned if you do the opposite of what some managers do at UPS and treat the employees with respect they are more willing to open up to you on a personal level and work with you and get the job done in a timely manner.
good,"Lots of time spent moving packages inside of warehouse."
good,boxline runner I would put the packages in there rite box to go to there wright area make sure my area was clean when iwas done an helpin out the team
good,I worked temp position to be able to provide a Christmas for my children at the time. We were in a very bad place and was getting  back on our feet. UPS provided what we needed at that time.
good,Usually working on a regular day you help your driver deliver 150-250 packages to your drivers routed area. You must wear work boots. Sometimes you may have to lift very heavy boxes and sometimes you may lift very light boxes. You will be entering in and out a ups truck consistently so you have to cautious of your surroundings when doing so. You get paid every Thursday by check. They don’t provide lunch you have to do so yourself.
good,"Day starts off prepping your work area. As soon as the meeting is over, its all fast paced and loud environment. Workplace culture may seem somewhat negative, its just too much stuff going on in a short time span."
good,"This was a seasonal position serving as a coordinator of the holiday peak season's influx. "
good,Patrol property and drive watch surveillance cameras of property check doors and lock up after business hours. Continues to monitor property for safety
good,you work 4 to 5 hour a day loading and unloading I've learned zip codes all over maryland supervisor were ok at what they do it is a ok work envoirment the hardest part was dealing with the weather most enjoyable part was the weekly pay
good,I probably have gotten into the best shape i have ever been in working here. It is really a workout you get paid for. Also pretty good benefits for a part-time job.
good,A typical day involved the loading and unloading of packages to a conveyer belt. I learned how to operate a forklift and various routes. Management was tolerable.
good,"Loud and dusty"
good,i think it is a great company to work for. they have some of the best benefits i have ever seen and plenty of room to grow in the company. lots of seasonal work
good,I rode the bus so even a part time job seemed like full time. Good hard working people there. I'd recommend the job if you don't need alot of money.Good breakroom and vending machines too.
good,Management vs union employees. it is just a big game. they will tell you that you can advance but wont tell you when even though you went through what they told you go go through.
good,UPS is a great company with a great track record.  They should have it together a little better than they do at my local warehouse.  It seems like everything else--falling apart at the seams due to personal agendas and laziness.
good,"loading boxes in trucks from the beginning of the day to the end of the day"
good,Hard working  plenty of over time over the holidays. Double pay after a 5 hour shift. After holidays theirs not much of over time to work. Better off trying to work as a driver.
good,"The Seasonal Holiday package delivery position is very physically demanding.  You are required too jump out of the truck and walk ""real fast"" to ensure speedy delivery."
good,"Pas d'avis personnel."
good,"very strict , repetitive clean work environment. meet worker needs very busy and fast pace , safe and secured. friendly opportunity to exceed on the job"
good,This job is great for people who don't mind a faced paced environment. I loved the constant changes that kept me on my toes. I appreciate the open mindedness of all who work there.
good,"Manageable hours with weekly pay. It's a nice side job if you're looking for a little extra cash."
good,"Good benefits for the employees, the hours of work are manageable and the atmosphere is fun as you are always moving around if you are the type of person who likes to stay busy."
good,"good job for kids in school and definatly good to stay in shape, very stressfull on your body and mind, in my opinion the pay is nowhere near enough for the amount of stress done to your body"
good,Stand the whole time while scanning packages. meet a certain rate in every shift. Helped maintain consistency. Friendly coworkers and bosses. warehouse is closed on Saturday.
good,This is a very challenging company and fast paced. Great for people that are driven and willing to go the extra mile for the company and customers. Great Cross functional collaboration.
good,Got along well with coworkers.The benefits were top notch so it was helpful for my family. I wish there’d been a Monday through Friday schedule but there wasn’t. Management relations with employees should be worked on and improved.
good,"I was hired for the X-mas season. I was will trained. It was a nice place to work. They are concerned about your safety, they do exercises before your shift."
good,"We all aim for higher goals, but if there is just no other opportunity working in your favor, go to ups. It's great character building work, but I only recommend it as temporary."
good,"UPS is a company that tries to fit a triangle in a Square. The hub I worked at went up in flames as approximately 75,000 packages were pushed through this factory into the hands of the distressed but trying preloaders, I have never respected anyone more than my co-workers who endured peak season with me. I finally resigned after losing 20% of my body weight, chipping my tooth, fracturing my toe and receiving a concussion. UPS should take better care of their employees we take care of them."
good,"Lot of job to do, have to be organized. Solve issue and find solution all the time. Need to be flexible. don't count your hours and you won't get compensation"
good,"Seasonal help, less than part time hours. Didn't work enough to form strong opinions. Overnight shifts were regularly cut short based on volume to be handled."
good,Den andra dagen är inte sig lik utan ser dagen som den kommer
good,Working at UPS as a pre-loader is a great job for college students to pay your way through school. They offer tuition reimbursement and great health benefits.
good,I want to work additional hours but due to corporate guidelines I am not able to as a part time sup. A lot of people leaving due to advancement structure
good,"typical warehouse environment. good pay, poor work environment; hot in summer and cold in winter. Hours are not great, location is good. Benefits are offered, and school tuition."
good,you will sweat. It hard-work. the pay is ok. if you trying to advance to management there will be opportunities as far as driving truck you will have to wait for seniority to  get the opportunity it could take decades.
good,Good for someone just getting out of high school with 0 experience. It was a good job but you have to like the warehouse environment in my case I liked being outdoors.
good,10 minute breaks. back breaking work where you will be told to speed it up while also carrying packages as heavy as your own weight. starts at a measley 10 bucks an hour.
good,"As a package handler for UPS, I worked faster than most of the workers on my team due to my OCD. I hated having boxes on the ground, and everyone else would just throw their boxes everywhere."
good,"Great transitional job, room for some advancement, workplace culture can be fun. Hardest part of job is the physical activity, sometimes the facilities and equipment can be rundown."
good,"The job is very stressful and you need to be committed. The benefits are amazing and the job security was there, but you are expected to go above and beyond your job title without the necessary compensation. Often times I work past my paid day without getting overtime, and I am given no breaks or lunch. I feel as if we are being taken advantage of at times."
good,"Eat well , stay energized ,drink a lot of water ,communication is key , schedule  is important see supervisors before leaving work area for schedule and if you staying for over time make to write your time down"
good,This job has great health insurance and benefits if you can manage to work enough days to get into the union. The union also provided its members a great deal of job security and protection from being fired for just about any reason but this would also allow some of its members to slack in their job duties.
good,was offering bad hours even though the job was very standard for an office setting at first. after 4 months of being there i felt it was time to move on because the shift had changed to a time that i felt i could no longer work the position
good,Loved working at this job I wish I could go back really have nothing bad to say about them other than the work was very competitive and fast-paced if you cannot keep up your at a chance of losing your job if you want to place where you can work and stay in shape this is it
good,"in principle full of good ideas and practices,but at times these are overlooked for statistics.The Bar is set very high and this is managed through a culture of accountability."
good,"UPS management is vastly lacking in support from upper management."
good,A typical day at work as an unloader for ups would involve unloading boxes from trucks and properly placing on a conveyer belt using safety training and procedures.
good,"Loading packages into trailers, tires, electronics all type of items we as package handlers had to load into trucks. I would load 2 to 3 trailers a night.This was a fast paced job so you that to be quick on your feet."
good,Typical day at work was very laid back and I learned a lot about customer service and packaging items to ship all over the world.  Printing jobs and mail services as well.
good,Intensive training with way too much to learn and too fast.   Testing very difficult and hard to follow.   Work environment is ok.  Company expectations difficult to meet.
good,Worked for the UPS stores as a COOP position through my university. Built great business relationships which I still leverage to this day for insight and help.
good,"You can work as hard and as fast as you want you don’t get a raise until you speak up, but speaking up just means you’re getting moved to a bigger position such as a supervisor instead, but other than that, it’s not a bad pay, you lose weight and get literally paid to do it but you’re gonna be sore after the week is over or in that first hard working day."
good,Used to unload all types of trailers with packages and shipments. If I needed help with an irregular there was always other works to help out with that.
good,Working in the hubs is hard work. You have to be very productive in a short period of time. The work is most suitable for young college students looking to earn money while in school.
good,"if you like to get paid for working out then this is the place for you. As a high value clerk it was an a pretty easy job, a package comes in with value over $1000 i sign for it and walk it to the designated place for departure"
good,It was almost 30 years ago..the pay and benefits were outstanding for a part time job.  I believeve there was ample opportunity for advancement. At the time promotion was done from within .
good,"you are constantly moving and if you are looking to get paid for hard workouts, this may be the job for you, It is kind of a dirty job for the most part."
good,"UPS is a great place to work because the company teaches you life skills that you can use in any work environment. The work culture is awesome because you will get access to people that love to see you grow within that company. Also, management is great because they make sure your schedule is arranged in a way that is suitable to your current living condition. However, the hardest part of the job are the customers and the most enjoyable part of the job are the customers."
good,Great place to work with others and to train if u don't have any experience. Great multi culture environment to work with. Great attitudes from employees.
good,Good company to work for if you can deal with the fast pace environment with a rigorous schedule. Also have great benefits including helping pay for college.
good,Working at United Parcel Service was very high paced . The management was extremely poor in my area. Also the pay raises were not great. There were also no benefits.
good,"Yorucu ama eglenceli bir is tecrubesi yasadim.          "
good,I learn how to unload truck quickly and correctly. the training was excelent. The management was carring but firm and respectfull. I liked that we were able to have music wile working. It made for a comfortable work enviroment.
good,"high energy job, fast pace, training and job advancement available cross training available,good pay, not family friendly at Christmas time,great benefit package"
good,"Even though they offer great benefits, there are certain situations that we as the staff at UPS could do without. "
good,"This job was brutal in almost every way, but paid fairly well compared to other comparable jobs. If you need to get on your feet, this job will be good."
good,"The job isnt bad just not a long lasting job the only issue is you have to wait so long for full time due to the union everything is seniority based, good for someone young"
good,"The company is growing so fast, new airplanes coming onboard, hiring new mechanics and related employees. I don't know where the salaries that have been previously listed are coming from, they must be coming from the truck mechanics salary or another class. We have made $50.44 an hour for the last 5 years, 5 years without a raise because we haven't had a union contract in that time period. We have been in negotiations that long. Unless you have 25 years with the company, be prepared to work weekends or nights for a long time, unless you are at a smaller station, then you never know."
good,"tough job, but rewarding.  makes you really have a sense of accomplishment and personal growth.  Not for the person who doesn't want to work.  This job will work you."
good,"Great place to work if you're starting out. It will teach you a lot of things, especially about Unions."
good,This company needs to get better at a lot of things mostly have their workers show up and the pay needs to be raised for working hard the benefits are good if you have a family or college student.
good,Good benefits only part time and low pay. There is no future for me at UPS have graduated with my degree in biology and I would like to work in field of education.  I am looking for a career not a part time job.
good,"Working for ups is a hard steady workplace you have to be willing to wake up early mornings and on your feet for the entire shift with only a 10-minute break, it's perfect for a second job when your only working part time"
good,Good place too work and make sure if you do overtime you get paid for it on your check but they will give you overtime hours if you want then they are good bout that
good,"you get assigned to a truck"
good,"The work pressure is there but I enjoyed to work with UPS as  client."
good,At UPS we would unload boxes out of trucks. Working about 2 1/2 hours to 4 hours depending on the day.  worked the evening shift which could start anywhere between 4:30 pm and 6:00 pm
good,This is a job where you work at a fast pace.  Once you learn how to use the equipment the job tends to get easier.  The most difficult part of the job is dealing with irate customers.
good,Its a great job to start off. You should be fit and able to handle being under pressure. They have great pay and you can advance your career within the job witch is amazing if you take advantage of the opportunity.
good,"Depends on the site, the role, and the manager. Room to advance if you want it but you will work long hours.Work life balance can be tricky but a lot of good people."
good,"UPS was a good place to work. You are fairly compensated for the work that you do. Some improvements could be made, but that is any where you work. Management should focus more on their employees."
good,I did not like working at ups is was a terrible 2 weeks it was hot and there was not climate control which I think needs to be a requirment for the work place
good,"The UPS Store I worked at was a one-stop print shop. Due to the limited employees, the owner had to work really hard as well. Although working here allowed me to have a better understanding of how a print shop works, the store wasn't providing really good quality products and customer services."
good,it was ok to workplace just need more hours and higher pay the people I workaround was cool nice friendly it was a great environment to work around a lot of teamwork
good,"A typical day at UPS is stressful, with management screaming at you and boxes constantly flying at you nun stop for 5 to 6 hours. They say u have to be able to lift up to 60 to 70 lbs but its more like 100lbs. Most times u don't have help and the management shows favoritism (especially to beautiful girls)."
good,"- I learned how to operate walkies"
good,Loaded trucks. decent place to work. bad hours. no airflow in the warehouses but they pay decent. only time you actually see nice checks is during holiday seasons when people do most of their online shopping.
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee.  This position was only during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday.  There was never a full time position, but I would have taken one if it was offered."
good,Low pay for a year more than minimum wage  but not too much more weekly pay.. Great benefits afterwards regular raises. vision dental health the whole thing.
good,the place was terrible they didnt give enough hours and it was very sickening to have to load all of thoe packages in a short amount of time and not geting paid enough
good,"Overall not the worst place to work, has some great benefits for full time employees, but not a place I would ever see myself working at again. The employees were very stressed out and were prone to yell at each other."
good,Fast paced with no room for error. I learned to be efficient to be more organized.  The culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the same work performance in company that changed policy often. I enjoyed supervising people and the challenge of reaching the company goals.
good,This job can pretty stressful at times.  I highly recommend people to be very cautious when applying for this job. You really need assistance to get the job done effectively.
good,"It was too stressful to work especially around thanksgiving, christmas and new years. Breaks where rear and there was to much miscommunication on orders and receiving and shipment."
good,I worked outside with the cargo airplanes and inside as a package sorter. The management was poor when it came to problem solving. It was very stressful due working with very expensive equipment. Hardest part of the job is during the holiday season when its super busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with.
good,"Working at UPS would be fast-paced, package handling, setting up the UPS trucks to get read to deliver to customers. With learning at UPS, I gained experience on moving quickly with customers, patience and staying focused. The hardest part of the job would be the hours depending on the shift I chosen but the most enjoyable  part of the job is networking and putting the effort to deliver every package to customers"
good,"It was hard work for low hours. It was also out of the way. I learned to never work outside of the city. The management was very helpful, and understanding."
good,I consistently do manager level work as an analyst. It is depressing to be in meetings with 5 people who all make more than I do. The promotion system is random and luck seems to play a role.
good,Good part time job. But not ideal to work in if you aren’t fast paced. Short breaks. Only good thing is they hire fast and almost any one can win here
good,I worked with a very dedicated team of employees.  We were able to work together to greatly improve our accuracy and productivity.  I learned how to multitask and how to get results from a team
good,The position i had at ups was a package handler which is a very physical position. You were required to meet a certain PPH (Package Per Hour) or you would be penalized. This made an impression on me as if I didn't have job security which was worrisome.Other wise I had friendly associates and grew mentally and physically form this job.
good,Good security in management roles with opportunity for advancement.  The salary is competitive and the benefits are good.  There is good teamwork and it's amazing what gets done each day.
good,"Average job, No benefits, Weather can bring things down. At the same time a really nice day outside can really pick up a drum attitude. More hours needed."
good,Management salaries were ridiculously below market. Very difficult for women to move up. Very high expectations considering how awful the compensation was.
good,Well I actually was only able to be there for a week on the count of I had hurt my Achilles heal I think it was the boots I had worn but it was hurt enough to where I had to stop working but it was fast pace and fun
good,I was a seasonal drivers helper delivering packages but it was temporary otherwise it's a job I most likely would have stuck with for quite a while. I liked it
good,Working for ups was a cool and great  experience although I wish I had more time to be able to grow in the company it was a temporary job. None the less I would work for them again.
good,True blue days come in you won't load you load trucks you wait to you get through boxes of the Camaro bill I need you going home I mean you stand around and you wait to get to your truck come in so you can load it all unloaded mean you walk around and see if any employees needed any help but did you prepped for the neck trucks
good,The work ethic was just amazing here. Everyone worked together and got along. No one was ever behind because there was always assistance even from the supervisor
good,"Never been dirtier or more tired in my life. Some packages weigh upwards of 100 lbs. Dusty, dusty, dusty. Hey, it's a warehouse. Being located next to DFW Airport, it's definitely at the center of major distribution. The building manager was callous, to put it kindly."
good,Loading and unloading trucks is what I did it was easy but physical they gave me all the tools I needed to do my job safely and quickly. Supervisors made sure you were doing good
good,"•Solving task with the use of a ticketing a system."
good,Always listen to the supervisors's advice especially if you are building walls with the packages last thing you want is for that wall to fall down and you have to rebuild the wall and at the same time deal with the packages that are sliding in.
good,A typical work day just consist of me sorting boxes into the assigned cages so they can be unloaded from the cages and loaded into the brown ups trucks you see around richmond.
good,i would not recommend my friends to work there because of lowest income only earn $100.00 per week for hard work for peanut pay. Its nice they have benefits but only if you work there for a long time.
good,"Too much to write about, not enough time to write it. Decent career, they pay less than other parts of the business. You do multiple different jobs that are out of your scope but are expected of you. Not very good communication. Can be long hours, and its on you to work until the job gets done, no matter the length."
good,"From the time I clock in, to the end of the day it's non-stop movement. Packages weigh from 0lbs-150lbs with 250-700 packages per truck and I load on average three trucks a day. The management staff are always nearby and always willing to help."
good,"I have nothing to say about Ups as an employer.  It is a place to work if you need a job, just like any other place would be  if you needed a job....."
good,"Fast paced environment with a short ten minute break. A lot of heavy lifting, hard on the body. Hourly pay is low, and there's not a lot of appreciation for the work you put in there, but the benefits are great if you stay long enough."
good,Ups is a fast paced job it can be easy but sometimes on busy days it can b a little frustrating like sometimes u may miss a stop a miss place an item but it’s not to much it’s doable
good,"As a long time employee, the only thing I can say is to stay union. Benefits for management are skinned based on keeping up profits and they tend to only advance people that are more aggressive. I have learned many things and really have no bad to say except that they need to treat their longtime workers as assets and not scraps. Benefits are of course good, but once you leave the union you will pay a lot for them. Training needs to be physically done, and I would like to be part of a company that really does see family life as important. I should not have to spend my vacations working, or be away from my family because union workers decide to not work with little to no repercussions. I will recommend UPS to those that are willing to put their job first. If you value your family life, stay PT or stay Union."
good,"UPS is a solid company with great benefits, but the leadership is the spoiler for the distribution side of the house with poor management with no leadership skills, and the communication was awful. Operations was ran by seasoned employees who only knew one way to get the job done...the hard way!"
good,"The pay is excellent .health care is 100 % paid with 100 %coverage...with exception to eye and dental which is about 70%..coverage...pension is outstanding. Full package with wages and benefits is worth 130,000 yearly. Without a college education I am grateful for the standard of living UPS HAS AFFORDED ME AND MY FAMILY!...and with 27 years of service I now get 6 weeks vacation with 8 sick days. And 9 paid …"
good,My position at UPS was as a seasonal helper coordinator.  They paid well at $18.78/hr but everyday was a mess.  Communication between management was very unreliable as everybody was not on the same page.  They also were not enthused by any idea of progression with the systems they used.
good,If you have worked at Fedex  or any warehouse job then you have worked at UPS. Same stressful dust and dirt fast paced environment that is not for everybody.
good,I am a great leader. management was ok. ok work culture. over 100 calls per day. typical day is taking calls back to back with people wondering where there packages are.
good,"I did not work for UPS. UPS was a client for a company that I worked for. We set up pick ups and also tracked packages, I also worked for an extended dept that tracked packages that were lost in transit."
good,"We make sure everything in the factory is ready then as the boxes advance to us we stack the boxes in a proper manner. "
good,sehr stressiger und auf Geschwindigkeit ausgelegter Arbeitsplatz
good,It was a good experience in postal services. Also I learned how the truck deliveries operate. Must a have a better scheduling process which means more callings for job opportunities.
good,"The UPS Store is a franchise and the culture at each store varies because almost every UPS Store has a different owner. At the location I worked at the start rate was at 8.25 bumped up to 9.00 after 3 months and an annual review that determines how much of a raise you earn. The only benefits my location offered was a week paid vacation after 2 years of being an employee and a flexible schedule if you had school or etc.."
good,"For the most part, this is a very easy job that just about any one could do. However, you do have to be careful when doing some things, or it could end up biting you in the butt later."
good,The jobsite was far from where I lived and having to take public transportation I had to leave extra early for work and would get home late every night. Everyday with UPS was a hard day of work being the weather was always bad.
good,"You will make good and fair money but the working environment can promote laziness and carelessness, as well as unneeded stress. If you care too much about your work quality you will lose out due to others not having the same standards. Other supervisors were also not very cooperative in hearing out other ideas, made working together a bit of a struggle. Overall, if you are looking for a good paying job and have a ""leave work at work"" mentality and stick to it you should be fine. I would not consider this a long term job."
good,Working in either cold or hot conditions did not really get breaks however the pay was okay. Most enjoyable part was working with people I generally get along with .
good,"I worked at UPS over 20 years ago.  While there though, I enjoyed working at UPS and was hoping to advance to a driver but those advancements were slow coming about and I had a family to feed."
good,The Harrisburg HUB is every dated. the summer is hot and exhausting and the winter is extremely cold. all of the equipment is very dated and they expect near perfection while not paying the associates much at all. The only way this is a good company is if your full time. part time employees are treated like garbage.
good,"Easy and steady work, pays every week. Great seasonal and 3rd shifts for busy adults looking for extra cash. Relaxed work environment. Safety first is always practiced."
good,"A typical day at Ups included loading trucks, moving around the building to multiple locations. You do this all evening or morning as well as various other job duties asked of you."
good,"how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"
good,"This is a good place to work, payment is not the best but you can definetley make a career out of this place. Definetley recommend this job to anyone trying to get off their feet or attempting to make a career of of themselves."
good,"A typical day at UPS is a day full of information and opportunities to get to know different aspects and people in the work place. My favourite part in the job are the people that I met there, all hard working and trustworthy."
good,This place is a great place to work as a part-time worker. They work with our schedule and are very flexible. They talk the time to work with you. Hands on training.
good,On the job I was a package handler and lifting heavy packages for 9 hours straight and trying to organize them in trucks also did more than one truck.
good,It was a good work area overall. They provided water and ice beings though i worked in the warehouse part of the building. My supervisor was the best.
good,"Working at UPS over the holidays is a challenge in its own.  The sheer volume of items was a bit overwhelming at times.  Overall, this job is good for people who have good hand-eye coordination."
good,"Was to unload trucks as one after the other as came into the docks, help others with heavy loads at times had to unload a truck by myself. Therefore, some supplies not loaded right would fall while being unloaded"
good,"I did joy the health benefits and purchasing stocks, UPS is behind me and I have moved on. Great place to work and stay in shape, you will be worked hard !!!!!!!!!!"
good,I was fortunate enough to be placed with a driver that had a consistently busy route. The hours were good and the drivers were a pleasure to work with. The season was cut short by three weeks which was disappointing. Good temporary job.
good,"Unorganized, chaotic, but I guess that happens during the holiday season. What I did not like was being told I was not needed AFTER showing up for work at 4am after Christmas. I could have been told they did not need me beforehand, but it is what it is. Met a few good people. Would have liked to stay on."
good,"Delivering packages in a timely, yet courteous manner despite weather conditions. Knowledge of local area and roadways. Basic communication skills to deal with commercial and residential customers."
good,"The job was pretty simple load, unload package were the LZ is located and deliver the package safely but the weather was a game changer too cold but it was cool to work in the truck"
good,great place to work if you are looking for a challenge. great management and co worker who are there to help you. Not many hours are schedules if you are hired part time
good,UPS Store was fact paced friendly environment. Manager was excellent. Owner was at his other store most of the time. Peak season was always hectic. Overall a good company.
good,"working at the ups is incredibly stressful, tiring and dangerous and it.  if you dont mind physical work its not that bad but the work is dangerous and not worth the pay."
good,"UPS is a quick paced environment that required a lot of manual labor. The hours were extremely flexible, and were great for a job while pursuing my degree."
good,"A typical day at work would start be long and sometimes over night "
good,"9 hr days , being efficient, effective, and professional . Making the deliveries in a timely manner, no accidents or injuries. Other drivers worked with the same goal to get the job done"
good,The UPS Store is not someplace one is meant to be forever. It is a job that I feel is meant to be kept for only 2 or so years before you have to move forward for the sake of personal growth.
good,"No Home Life, work and work some more while in full-time management."
good,"Important job for the company, which is pretty obvious based on how much they advertise the position and how much they pay an entry level job. It's very easy work but the days are long and require a lot of climbing in and out of the truck, as well as lifting packages. The driver I was assigned to was very nice and enjoyable to work with, and I think that the communication between driver and helper makes or breaks the job."
good,"Manual Labor, with long working shifts. Lots of heavy lifting sometimes the weight of the product can vary to 20-30 pounds. The pay is average but fair."
good,ups was ok. i liked the simple fact that they had weekly pay. The workplace was ok as well wasnt bad just didnt give you much hours and your hours wasnt consistent
good,"Hours could've been longer, or small increase to pay. Environment was safe and friendly. Management was excellent and very experienced. Physical labor was a little too demanding."
good,"working outside was the hardest part of the job "
good,Low wages and low hours. Didn’t have enough time to take my lunch break! The Manager acts like he doesn’t care about you or your safety. I was workn my butt off  only make 300$ a week. I can’t support my family with that!
good,"It was like being a glorified dolly unloading trucks and sirying packages gettibg piled up literally to the chest with boxes having to constantly break safety rules kust to make ""good time"" amongst other enviromental hazards not properly addressed"
good,"I left UPS back in June having worked there for nearly a year. It honestly wasn't the worst place to be at but it definitely could use a lot of improvements. Many of the employees and even supervisors you work for are pretty great to work with. That makes it more manageable to get stuff the necessary tasks done as many works days tended to get highly stressful because of the high volume of bulk and other packages. "
good,its an ok job it can get hard and overwhelming but if you wanna expand in the company and want to do something you really like then this is the place to be
good,good environment and good people to work with. I learned that everyone has a role to play and everyone has to work as a team. management was o.k. The job can get stressful but its how you do your job and work around everyone else that determines that. The part of the job I enjoyed was being around people that I was comfortable with being around and working with.
good,"You will pick up heavy boxes more than 70 Ibs, up to 150 Ibs max, not like the description, however, there is assistance rules for that so you dont pick it up yourself.  3 am to 9 am isnt always true either, basically depends on your position in the facility cause there maybe times where you start at 2 am or even midnight in the holidays for an 8 hr shift."
good,"It is a convenient place to work in "
good,UPS has its ups and downs but it's no longer a place for me. I am moving on to something better because there is not room for growth from where I stand.
good,"Always working around the clock and able to multitask"
good,Loading at UPS is by far one of the most difficult jobs i have had. They give minimal training in the Actually PD your assigned to and make you figure out every thing alone.
good,A typical day as a driver-helper consists of long days of getting in and out of the package car to deliver packages to residents no matter what the weather consists of.
good,"Depends on what part of year you work in is depended on how much packages you will get. During peak season, you will be having more packages then a normal day due to Christmas time. You do start being more quick pace with packages as you go on. Above all the people there do help you out and the work environment is tolerable."
good,i did not work long enough to make an accurate assumption. I was pi9cked up and drove around wth the driver.  We stopped frequently and delivered packages too the correct houses.  It was very hard.  I was unable to carry some of the packages that were to be delivered.
good,"This company was ok. They need to allow the staff to work more hours, and to give some type of vacation days off, more perks for the staff. Instead of just clocking in then clocking out, make the work place enjoyable it makes the day smoother."
good,"Easy and light job as most of the parcels are very light. Ideal job for those who like the speed and enjoy the steps, ive learned lots of things about parcels."
good,You go to work and work. It’s a general labor job. You work hot days and cold days. You don’t just work one area. Peak season you get a lot of overtime and can work multiple shifts
good,its a warehouse job ok benefits no promotion 30 hours a week great part time just do the job and go home I haven't worked there in years but  I hear its the same just do what you got do
good,We would get there at the start of the shift and begin our daily inspections and along with or preparations .to begin the daily operations. There were a number of challenging issues to resolve before we can start.
good,Getting threw the probationary days to be a regular employee was not difficult but the supervisors were uncompromising. The sorter job was about memorizing the sort guide. With concentration I caught on.
good,Good job fresh out of high school short hours but would let you work longer if need be. Low pay but good work experience. Incentives for not missing work
good,It like a workout when you work as a loader or unloader and you can have two jobs position like a driver helper that work in the morning and still be a loader at night which you get double pay
good,"Great place to work , great employees , excellent benefits, room for advcancement within the company, would recommend to anyway looking for employment"
good,Hard company to work for. Only strong can make it. If you have a family and they do not support what you do then problems will start at home. 15 hours a day and not getting paid for it.
good,"great place to work just not enough hours or benefits, This job was stressful because I wanted to work but work hours was not availibe other wise I would sstill be working for the company."
good,Just a high school job.so not much to say good or bad. went to work everyday was assigned a trailer. Unloaded the truck and if I finished they sent me to another.
good,This was a job I had while searching for a more permanent position elsewhere.  It was vert busy and extremely fast paced and I do not think that I was paid fairly for the amount of work that I did.
good,usp just wasn't the job for me but i will recommend this job for others but some of the drivers will put most of the deliveries on the seasonal help which makes them quit so they cant become re-hired
good,The job was long hours and was physically demanding. The management was changing. I had both good bosses and those that were more challenging. Benefits were solid.
good,"Ups was a okay work place, sometimes its just not safe and its always something about someone getting hurt and or someone stealing and getting locked up. and its also not somewhere that I don't want to be in a longrun."
good,"It was nice and interesting. It was cool to learn how the mailing system works. It was quiet, quick, and just business. I learned how to fax papers correctly, I've also learn how to ship boxes to it's destination. Overall, it was a great experience working in the UPS Store."
good,It is a UPS job but at a customers site.My first job in the states and i must say it was best for me as at when i came into the job. Need benefit? look further
good,Pay was decent if you are promoted to management. You are under serious stress. lower management is also this way. If your job is loading or unloading the job is extremely physical. understandably culture is based around timeliness. A plus is they are very safety oriented and the perks are great. You SHOULD speak with employees working in the position you desire before you take the job.
good,"Working at UPS was a nice, temporary change of pace. I enjoyed working as a driver's helper because it offered a change of scenery and allowed me to push meet many different people."
good,UPS is a fast paced environment and the company does not seem to care about their employees. Hence the high turnover rate. The employees that work with me were great to work with.
good,"Translate freight bills and manifest to for proper route placement."
good,good company to work for. Difficult if you want to work full time due to split shifts but a good experience. I learnt how to x-ray for cargo which was a very rewarding experience
good,"I was a delivery helper for the holiday season. My job was to help the delivery driver deliver packages. This job demand packages to be delivered on time which required to work in a fast-paced. But I enjoyed working with these guys, they are friendly as well as the people who were expecting their packages."
good,"Working at UPS can get repetitive at times but as long there’s a good group of people that knows how to get the job done at a reasonable pace, the job itself flows well and the hours go by quickly."
good,"Delivering parcels door to door to commercial/businesses and residential. "
good,"Good place to get broad perspective as one tends to wear a lot of hats.  Very heavy work loads and bare bones staffing."
good,I cannot really write anything about my work experience with UPS do to not getting many hours so far. Everyone that I have be able to work with thus far is great.
good,This job was only temporary. It paid very well but I feel that my entire training class was not properly trained and we were all thrown in very abruptly before any of us were ready.
good,"you typically sit and wait for customers to come. many strict rules which was not necessary. good high school job. hours arent the best, but good for part time"
good,"The benefits was great, the bad part about the job was the pay. It was pay Check to paycheck, it may be great job for a kid in school or someone that needs a second job."
good,"It was a great place to work, I did not intend to leave but my department was eliminated.  The worst thing about it was the frequent department closings and lay-offs"
good,I would love to have worked 40 hours a week but I barely got a whole 8 hours sometimes and on top of that they would talk to people any kind of way abusing there authority
good,"Ich war als Lagerist tätig, und es ist harte Arbeit."
good,"Really lay back, too slow paced and barely any customers. Peak hours might differ by each day. The owner is great but the pay is really low and the business isn't up to part."
good,Great part time job at UPS. A very fun environment to work at and tons of great people. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great part time job.
good,"Typical work days around long "
good,"I think for students ups is very beneficial, because ups will pay for students to go to uofl of jctc if they work third shift and keep their grades up."
good,I work in fast pace enviornment. I have to make sure my employees stick to the task at hand. I have to be able to communicate different task in a way that my employees understand because majority of my job deals with communicating.
good,"As long as you follow directions and are committed to the work you do, you will do well. Be cool headed and mindful of your work detail and everything else will fall into place."
good,It was a seasonal position so i had a short positive experience. It allowed me to be independent and work in a faced paced environment. It allowed me to build confidence in myself and grow as a person.
good,"a very busy and fast pace environment, time management a priority...Energetic and always on the move. Never a dull moment.. Working under unfavorable weather condition and circumstance. New challenges every single day..."
good,"Working for UPS was at times exausting but I loved the fast paced work.  I really liked the fact that during the holidays when people call out we can work there hours, which can always lead to overtime."
good,would have to assist with loading and unloading trucks. assist with drivers on their routes during the holiday season. would have to deliver packages on a handcart.
good,Could have better time amnagement skills. but overall is a fun workplace for those looking to challenge their physical capabilities while also performing these actions safely.
good,"The job was okay. The only thing that I didn't like was that they were not as flexible with my school schedule. Addition to that, the managers was rude."
good,"UPS can be a very good working opportunity, there are a lot of options you can take to get to a job worth working. The benefits are incredible once you receive them. The work is fast paced, stressful, and tiring. Upper management is terrible there's always some drama with words, and assault."
good,"Very fast paced job, Long hours and odd hours. Clean facility, nice people. Working with the temp agency is the most difficult part about the job. Good people to work with."
good,Decent enough company to work for. The environment between corporate and hub operations is totally different. I am sure there is a place for everyone. Some people love the environment. Other people hate it.
good,"come in get straight to work, learned how to stack an loader a wall perfectly, some managers are cool enough to speak to some are not. no culture at all,"
good,"Once you learn zip codes your potential is endless. I was able to help production in different areas. Held many titles. From trainer. Safety inspector, loader ,pick-off. Depending on your co-workers the job was fun and days went quick"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the position is working with different personalities and successfully motivating these employees. I am able to do so while still being effective, efficient, and hitting my personal and organizational goals, ultimately maximizing profit."
good,It was a typical ware house environment. The only challenging part of the job was recognizing zip codes and knowing what location each package went in the warehouse. No job advancement unless you have been there longer than 5 yrs
good,"In addition to the 20 or less hours i would get weekly, i personally wanted to seek a job that better fit my educational background. I left ups to work in sales while i looked for a full-time position with 40 or more hours and related to my degree."
good,A typical day at the UPS store was greeting customers and to assure what type of services each individual needed and to fully have the customers satisfaction
good,Just like anywhere there are things you'll have to learn on the job. Pretty much anyone can handle it. There is room for advancement which is good. Seems to be a fair place to work.
good,"everything is good working in UPS, but the only concern is the payment for the work you need to handle there is very poor and not very fair. I believe that for the  amount of hard work should be paid much more."
good,Drink water and rest well most at your own pace some boxes are heavy make sure you get help bend your knees when picking up a package wear comfortable shoes
good,its a fairly good place to work the four hours a day i didnt like to much.Scanning and loading trucks is my type of work if you like to keep constantly moving go with u.p.s
good,This job is not for everybody. Company has considerable investment into technology for a changing environment in small parcel delivery. Peak seasons are the most challenging times
good,"UPS had a great environment, they paid very well and they had many time slots available for employees to work. Overall a good place to work, but the management needs to learn how to communicate with the employees."
good,this position was a temporary part time job with no immediate advancement   hours were 330 am to 8 in the am   very hard work for little pay...management was decent
good,"Working at UPS, was very fast paced environment. You are very much on your own. The teamwork could be better. I had to lift and maneuver 35-70 pound boxes in a timely manner. The company has very good benefits."
good,"if you are young and in college UPS is the place to work."
good,Its a good place to work but working there everyday while going to school was to much. I had to much to do and they didnt pay enough for what i was doing.
good,in order to work at UPS you must be proficient and able to handle a rapidly changing work environment. the ability to work hard labor and quick pace will allow you to succeed in this facility
good,Worked miminal hours and only worked around 6 hours a day. Super early in the morning and recieved no benefits. I was part time and it was a okay job for what it was.
good,Typical work day is around 5 hours. The management is very demanding at points. The hardest part of the job is keeping up because it is very fast paced.
good,I work the night shift - 8pm to 5am which is difficult and the culture there is different at night then at any place I have worked.   It is laid back and easy but the supervision is lacking.   They seem more reactive then proactive in the work load and for night shift not very interested in employee culture.   They had a tough task in implementing a new system in Scranton and I feel that they did not screen the applicants well and did the function a disservice by making it a night position.
good,It was a good job to have only problem was low hours because I went though a temp service and low pay and I was sorting mail that's stressfull trying to pay bills. For kids still in school and living home with there parents that's a good start for them.
good,"Working with UPS was fine. I had a late shift. Its a cool job if you like standing on your feet for hours. I learned how to pay attention more. The managers were nice and very strict. They made sure we stayed on tasks at all times. I was in a warehouse, so the environment was as its supposed to be. The hardest part of the job was getting up early. I enjoyed learning new skills and meeting new people."
good,"fast paced, must maintain constant focus throughout shift. must wear proper attire due to many safety precautions. Onetime is crucial due to the amount of packages being delivered and lack of staff there of at times."
good,The salary is good. The weather is unbearable sometimes and sometimes so are the supervisors. They have very good benefit with a good pension plan for retirement
good,"It take a strong mind to keep up with a strong company. You must be able to multitask, and work fast. Stress levels can be high and a good balance of life and work is needed to be successful here."
good,very fast pace. You need to be in shape because theres alot of movement through out your work day.I loved working along side of people to get the work done.
good,"Working at UPS as an HR Rep was stressful, demanding, and cut throat. UPS upper management seems to be disconnected from reality and often times asks for things to be accomplished that are impossible especially in the time frames provided. They are very resistant to change and like to do thing because ""That's how they were always done"""
good,it is very fast pace and good people to work around with. you get the help that you need if you ever need someone help. In the summer time they make sure everyone is great because of how hot it gets.
good,Great benefits but little pay for the amount of work required.  It was a physically demanding job as well as mentally demanding as a supervisor.  Better pay would have been nice.
good,"As a packager handler, you do have job security but as far as job advancement their are limited choices depending on your personal future. If you want to be a supervisor, you can apply and you have a good chance of becoming a part time supervisor. To be a full time supervisor a much more challenging. To be a driver, you can apply for package car driving and have your name put on waiting list. Now if these areas are not for you, then you may want to search for another job."
good,good job for someone young getting into school. they offer to pay for your college. I did not take this option but I do wish I would have. I was there for the health insurance benefits.
good,Okay place to work.  Learned alot about sales and spin training.  Was excellent at teaching how to leverage the technology to advance the customers shipping practices.
good,Great place to work as long as you are focused and delivering on time and working as a team. Provides proper work/life balance for their employees and help them grow.
good,Stay focus do your best at all times be friendly give advice and receive advice as well don’t over work yourself and don’t under work yourself quality over quantity
good,"people judge you over there they don't guarentee you the part-time supervisor like they said they would, and they always try to send you home early. They sometimes work you hard only to find out when you get your check stud its a hundred and something, there you go felling like your work that you put in was worth mare than a hundred and something"
good,"On a typical day in the hub, you are faced with many challenges. Sorts usually last between 4-6 hours. During that time you are expected to motivate and train your employees to work safe and effectively."
good,as a sorter my job was to sift through the many thousands of boxes coming into the tamworth hub of ups and splitting them into their postcode areas being shipped all over the world.
good,The UPS Store was my first working experience. Great place to work at. I gained valuable experience there. I will always recommend working there to anyone.
good,Whether you are a front line employee or a manager the job is very demanding physically. It's also very rewarding because everyone works together as a team each night to produce the best results.
good,UPS provided me with great training and management experience.  Which opened doors to future opportunities beyond UPS.  I am appreciative of what this experience taught me and opportunities that were available within the organization.
good,"Working For UPS was fun, It was a lot of hard work and sometimes weird hours. I was hired as a seasonal worker so my hours were funky but other than that I had a good time. The people treated you well and fairly."
good,I spent several years at the facility and the system remains the same. I've experienced different supervisors with one common goals to productive high volume in record time.
good,"One of the Biggest Logistics companies of the world, Best feature is 5 working days a week. It is a Fortune 500 Company   and is huge in the United States."
good,It was a nice job the people were nice. The work balance was difficult but wasn't impossible. Quick pace and a lot to take in if you are use to light work
good,"Fun place to work if you are just looking for a job while you go to school but I would not recommend for a career. The job can get stressful like any other customer service job, but it is overall low-key and relaxing on the pre seasons. Work does get hectic during peak season which is Christmas time. The UPS Store is a locally owned buisness meaning you do not work for the UPS company per say."
good,"UPS is a OK job for a college student who doesn't have huge bills. Ups doesn't really have easy advancements. You have to bid on positions which I didn't mind its just there were over 30,000 employees  I had to bid against."
good,Livraison dans son secteur de travail . La pluie et les oublies sont les aspect plus ou moins difficiles .
good,"Very fast pace, but very enjoyable. The culture made it better to work under the hot or/and cold conditions. I've learned to do what you really love, and if you like what your doing dont quit."
good,fast paced environment management is friendly and flexible. Benefits are great after you stay for a long duration and pay as well. You will meet friendly people.
good,Hard in the beginning. It's physically demanding and the company expects 110% from you every day. Always try to get on your supervisor's good side. Can be very beneficial if you can stick it out!
good,"Since I was working at The UPS Store not corporate UPS there wasn't great pay or opportunity for advancement. It was a fun job if you can handle chaos and a very fast pace at times but the pay wasn't very competitive. I would recommend this job to someone younger who isn't working towards a career. It is perfect for a college kid looking to earn some extra money."
good,This was a great experience and great part time job. The benefits were great and it was hard fun work. I loved doing this while I finished up my degree for College.
good,UPS is an okay place to work. Would help retention if new hires could get paid more. Management could be a little more consistent. It is a physical job and it can wear on your body.
good,It was a great temp job.I had a good trainer.  I was enjoyable. There are long hours for delivery thats why during busy months the drivers get helper.
good,"Great job, good pay but hours are quite gruelling sometimes. Must meet quota for delivered packages which is expected. Good bonuses, support is great, workers all work together!"
good,"I like working there, it was just a quick pace job. The managers were friendly but yet unrelaxed, and impatient. Service there was also average but it was also understandable."
good,"Fast paced, hard work. MUST, be able to multi task. Being responsible for 3-6 direct reports and up to 80 indirect reports, maybe more if its peak season. If it is Peak season, you will live in the hub."
good,A typical day at UPS is having to come in 15-20 min before the actual start time to set up. Depending on the day the supervisors can be a little harsh. One of the hardest parts of this job is trying to keep a positive attitude when while getting hit with the flow and having to deal with supervisors harping at you. I would say the easiest part of the job honestly is clocking. It feels as if a huge weight has been lifted of your shoulders
good,"It's a Good Job , check it out see if you like it don't take everyone's word on it find out by applying , attending the training sessions learning the job then make your choice"
good,didn't like it. only 10 minute breaks and too much work not enough pay. don't work here if you don't like to workout everyday. if you like to workout this is the job for you.
good,Ive been working there for 3+ years and the only hard thing is the customers. Every task is simple to learn and once you do it for a while everything becomes easy but customers are the hardest thing.
good,I loved working at UPS Freight because it was such a delight to make the current customer happy and would want them to keep coming back because they have had a good experience with using UPS Freight.
good,Great career for recent graduate. I was able to learn so much and I had great colleagues who showed me the ropes. Hours could be long but it just depends.
good,"If you are a good worker, than the few hours you are there you will be busting your butt working hard. The management gets into a bad habit of relying on a few workers to do most of the extra work. The other employees with seniority never want to do work and flaunt the seniority whenever it is beneficial to them."
good,"I worked in shipping and receiving not much to talk about, I came to work on time never late. Loading unloading packages. the pay could have been better."
good,We are not paid enough for the work we do. UPS is a multi billion dollar company and cannot afford to pay the people who load package cars enough to cover for the hard labor we go through monday to friday.
good,"Unloaded packages from long and short trailers in a timed period. Usual work day consisted of about 4 hour shifts, with a 10 in break. During peak seasons shifts could be a little longer."
good,During my time with ups was great i learn various ways to unload trucks.It was a fast paste job busy all the time.Also a great place of opportunity you can grow with company if giving the time
good,"We clock in and get a good stretch in before we start because it is a very physically demanding job. We all get to our work stations and begin unloading the trailers using equipment such as a load-stand, rollers, and retractable conveyor belt. It's pretty much work till we are done which would average about 17-20 trailers a day."
good,Fast paced making sure all packages are develivered and accounted for. I learned how to use the company's dyad to  mark packages delivered. The hardest part is delivering so many packages in a certain amount of time.
good,"UPS is a hardworking, fast paced, competitive place. You are rewarded for your hard work. UPS also can be very tiring at times. The employees are fun to work with as well."
good,My time at ups wasn't as great as I hoped it to be. The management was terrible and all the bosses were unfair. Although their is career advancement in the work place its hard to advance in.
good,"Hard work. Good pay. Sometimes you have to wait for advancement. Able to have to work at a fast pace in all weather elements. Workplace culture can improve. Very physical work."
good,"A very fast paced environment that will keep you occupied with a lot at stake and a lot to accomplish as far as opportunities, benefits, paid vacation, etc."
good,This job was okay if you like being outside.  Supervisor was okay the work environment was cold I worked on a truck.  The hardest part of the job was in and out of the cold. I did no like this job.
good,i never worked there but it would be good to work there only part time cause they're job is stressful but yea i heard they dont pay you as much part time
good,"Veryct long hours, tough on family.  if you have kids who are active you will miss all or most activities.  very hard on your back, hips and knees.  thanks."
good,Great job if you're looking for part time employment... They havr great benefits for part time work. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for supplemental income
good,there are respectful supervisor there not that many hours though if you really need the money fairly good mangement good company to move up in the future and good benefits and compensation
good,"Fast paste and fun"
good,Working in hit condition and required to go a certain speed. Always finish a trailer before moving on to anything else. Always be there on time for work
good,The company has been around for years and will be for years to come.  The culture is stressful but if you can handle it the back end benefit can be beneficial.
good,be prepared to sweat the entire time. The environment is fast paced.  The working conditions are subpar due to dust and lack of cleanliness.  The benefits are amazing.
good,Five plus hours major physical workout. Young managers who are trying to make a point with there bosses. You have to work one year to receive any benefits.
good,No comment about the company or the way they do things I had a good work experience there and I learned allot about work and life being with this company
good,"Hours vary per day based on order and order picking rules change, making the position fast paced but unmanagable. Would like to work in a office enviroment because of my college degree but am not sure I can find such a position with the company."
good,If you young been looking for a fast-paced job hit-ups are they good alignment that work with you work around your schedule they God bless security good workers to hit them up and I really do like working for them hopefully I can work for them again
good,Easy working environment. Busy. Extensive data entry. Reliable corporate support. Appreciative ownership. Independently operated stores. Raises usually annually.
good,Responsible for Loading/Unloading packages quickly. Maintain a clean and clear warehouse with organized packages and safely handle fragile and dangerous materials.
good,"its a cool place to work ,doing the driver helper job is so easy you meet good people while you delivery their packages on the route and sometimes they may feed you and the driver."
good,"stressful"
good,"Passing the buck:  Poor management,  liked to point the finger of blame. "
good,Its not the best place Ive worked for and its hot and you are constantly forced to work with only a 10 minute break and that's not enough to get you prepared for the second half of the shift
good,training wasnt all that great some drivers take advantage of the helpers and make the helpers do all the work instead of helping them and still doing their job
good,"you just work and don't wait for anything. the quicker you deliver your packages, the quicker you get home. i was a driver helper and my second driver helper was worst then my first. my first was cool and trying to teach me the ropes and tell me about the company and what it can do for me."
good,"If you are physically capable you are guaranteed a job and they'll hire you on the spot! You will be loading Trucks for about 5 hours straight. A positive that you are pretty much guaranteed your hours but there's still a high turn over rate. If you are not management it takes a year to get medical and retirement benefits. This is a union position, so expect to pay fees even though you are receiving no benefits for the first year. If you really need a job this may be the place for you."
good,"fast paced, you need to be self motivated, you won""t last if your lazy."
good,nothing much to say it was my first job and i really liked it at first but i started having problems with transportation and also family issues at the time so i had to leave
good,Nice seasonal job to work to gain experience.Dress warm in the winter months and weather appropriate in the summer months.Job is decent as long as you are paired with someone who equally shares the workload.
good,"Ups is a pretty cool gig . monday through friday. The pay is every week, starting off at $10 an hour for only four hours. Which i didnt mind at the time because i didn't really have no responsibilities. So just getting a little bit of money in my pocket was fine at the time"
good,"good, not great. i just knew that i wouldn't be staying at UPS for very long. i used it to stay employed until i found a good place to go to. either way, it was still good"
good,"I did not like the job, building was just opening , you would work one day be off the next only work 3 hours and be sent home had lots of people to work but no work to do"
good,I had a great time working at UPS. My coworkers there were very nice and helped me develop as a person. I learned many valuable skills. The owners are great.
good,"Fast-paced work. Heavy lifting and carrying from the moment you punch in till the moment you punch out. Fun people working, making the time go by a little bit faster and with less stress. Good place to work, just very few overnight hours."
good,"I would recommend this company only as a starting point. By this I mean, this is a job not a career. It's a good place to see if customer service or inbound call centers are for you but not much more."
good,They didn't care if you had a family or not.  Couldn't plan on when you had to leave at a normal time or not. It wasn't a friendly place to work for. UPS only cared about the higher ups.
good,"This job is hard work. If you don't mind a fast paced job, this is just the job you're looking for. From the moment you leave the warehouse it's go, go, go!"
good,"UPS does a lot of getting people hopes and dreams up, but they will keep you in the same position for years. They talk to employees any type of way, but you have to accept it. (No). They pay you 11.00 hour for to load a truck that the driver will redo. The best thing about UPS is the tuition reimbursement. That is the only legit thing that I have seen."
good,"I did not enjoy this much because we were supposed to have a Dolley to assist with delivering heavy packages but were not provided one. Due to this, I had to lift a five-foot long air hockey table to the front door of someone's house."
good,Work was fast pace and stressful. Very hard to keep up with as a female. They asked for nearly impossible speed and accuracy. We had to choose between doing things right and safety.
good,It's stressful if you're a morning loader but it pays well. I was a loader and a drivers assistant hence why I worked so many hours a week but I could handle it. The schedule was pretty balanced
good,It gets very hot in that hub even as a supervisor I got very hot especially in the summer months. Some supervisors get very nasty with you if you are not working fast enough
good,"A typical work day, I handled call from customers that needed help with a package in one way or another, shipping tracking, and process new package delivery. I learned not to take in personal, when customers call upset, its my good to"
good,"Hard work, many opportunities for advancement.  Not very competitive with salary.  Work very long days.  Need to be able to multi task and adapt to changing conditions."
good,the hours were not consistent even though it was a seasonal job. other than that UPS is a good place to work. Everyone was very nice and helpful even though I was a temp worker
good,perfect part time job with great benefits and good pay. great place for advancement if you are willing to work. good management and co workers would recommend
good,"The benefits of this job is outstanding it makes staying there to work bearable. They do not have the best circulation inside the building for the summer time, and management really don't care for the employees just the merchandise we handle"
good,Great pay and great benefits. Long hours and difficult relations with management. Monday through Friday hours mostly. Holidays were tough as you don't have any time with family and are too tired to enjoy it.
good,Good benefits and potential to make career but hard to get full time. Supervisors have lack of communication and are very unorganized. The pace is extremely fast and sometimes there's no way of keeping up.
good,I worked here as a teenager very intense labor very low pay also warehouse so know a/c working in trailers in florida weather which reaches dangerous tempertures
good,This is a high volume work environment and processing has set guide lines. Over all its a good place to work! The people are easy to get along with for the most part and the management is very understanding an supportive of all its workers.
good,fast paced and very fun to meet customers when delivering packages.  good exercise and helps keep you in shape. no benefits for temp employees who work the holidays.
good,pretty straight forward job not much to it. it was good for seasonal work. i dont know how the full time side of it goes but i wouldnt mind being there full time
good,The night started with our crew leader showing us which bins would be filled that night. and then we would load boxes from 11 to 4. we would get a minimum of three brakes.
good,I have been working at ups for A Little While .These benefits there's are excellent But I Rather Have A Good Job Near My Area .I Am a Fast Learner and Can Work At A Fast Paste
good,Same thing day in day out but do have good opportunities to progress. Enjoy working with the people at UPS and the management are very fair and honest with employees.
good,Quickly loading and unloading trailers into delivery trucks early in the morning.  Great for those looking for hours before going to school or for a second job.
good,"Shipping out packages daily, assisting with package pickup, answering phones, looking up shipping zip codes for final destination. I loved working at Ups had a lot of challenges, Didn't like loading the trucks much. Management was good but could have been better"
good,UPS is a great part-time company to work for. UPS offer benefits to part-time employees and their families. There is room for advancement but union employees receive better benefits than non union.
good,This place was a pretty good place to work.  This place is more for someone without anyone acting professional.  The workers are hard to control with it being unionized making it difficult to get anything done.
good,"Job is fast paced and requires heavy lifting. This job is easy enough in that it only requires you to separate boxes and also pick up boxes that correspond to your trucks, issue with this is that your dealing with  thousands of boxes coming down at a quick pace that can become overwhelming quite quickly."
good,You have to be self motivated to make it through a typical day. You must be able to work at a fast pace. You must be able to lift heavy objects and load properly.
good,There are definite benefits though the job is not easy. For certain jobs they do pay a decent wage though the work can be extremely fast paced and laborious.
good,"Ever since the company went public, it has become a numbers game, putting profit before people. Employees are expected to handle ridiculously large 150 lb. boxes as quickly as they handle small boxes. Many employees are very unhappy but feel stuck in their jobs because they need the benefits. Pride in the company is virtually nonexistent."
good,manager brainless teenagers and old crackheads. watch them move boxes around for hours. and repeat yourself over and over. turn over rate very high. management is good.
good,It Was An Ok Place To Work. It Was Very Far and Only Worked 3hrs. Not enough Hours and Didn't want Us Working Over. I Was Unloading Trucks and Placing Them on line
good,"Well qualified location to handle all needs the were presented in a daily overview of work."
good,Working at UPS was kind of a challenge to me because being so little. Trying to up heavy boxes was kind of hard but I kept trying and trying everyday.
good,"Good company to work for if you want to learn Brokerage for Imports, Exports and Compliance. Great Healthcare Benefits, paid vacations, 401k, flexable to family needs."
good,"A typical day at work was loading and sorting packages for delivery, I learned how to track and tag packages, there are always supervisors on the loading bay to assist you if you need it, the culture was open and fast paced, the hardest part of the day was the short break time, the enjoyable part of the day was knowing you put in a good days work"
good,"Multiple jobs done by one person makes it more difficult to achieve the goals set forth by the company. days are very long just to finish the daily tasks at hand, then the other tasks that get added on some days add to the hours."
good,Everyone here is friendly. I enjoyed working here but there wasnt enough houts given out where i could make a means of living so had to get another job.
good,"UPS is a great place to grow with the company, it is also a very high benefits place as well. The specific job that I had was high paced high intensity and very stressful but once mastered became fun and enjoyable."
good,"Move quick pace job , u will get your exercise from working at ups. You have like 3 to 4 ups trucks u have to load items on to in a quick fast pace. Over all it's good for people looking for a work out or a part time job."
good,"Using Cherry-picker to pick orders for shipping.  Good job, but not enough money.  A lot of part-time work, not too many full-time jobs.  They like to use Job Placement Agencies."
good,"Hard work and challenging but nice that you get paid to exercise. Very top down militaristic type culture, but workers are represented by the Teamsters Union so that helps with pay and working conditions."
good,"UPS has given me a lot, including a front-door into management. But, that achievement has come at a heavy price. My view may be skewed coming from one of the largest hubs that they operate, but this job is not for the weak-willed. This job will test you every single day."
good,Overnight sort requires able body individuals to load up to 2000 packages per night into semi trailers.  Accuracy and speed are a must and have good attention to detail.
good,It's a very physical job that pays very well and can provide you with many bemefits.  If you like working outside and working alone this could be a good job.
good,My job here was very basic and did not have a lot to it. I am more of an outgoing person that likes to do physical work so this job didn't have a whole lot of benefit for me. Pay was good.
good,Has a lot if great benefits at this job wish they could pay a little more due to the work that's done.  Would be a great job to start off with for a first time job.
good,"In addition to acting as a supervisor for the loaders, expect to also have to load trucks yourself in this role. Most of the guys/girls who work there are good guys, but the work can be back-breaking and fast-paced. No PTO or holiday pay."
good,We would unload a truck and get the packages moved to the loading area as quickly as possible. I would fuel the truck and move it to the area for the next morning
good,"This is a great place to work they could just pay better though, it does take forever to get on full time in a decent paying spot. great of you want no debt after school."
good,"A typical day consist of sitting for 4-8 hrs, applying tariff codes to clear ships for customs.  The work place culture is pleasant, however there is a lot of talk among other employees."
good,"UPS is fast paced with a high process rate."
good,"taking personal address information from clts"
good,"Il ritmo lavorativo è altissimo,come tutte le aziende di spedizioni è una corsa contro il tempo."
good,"A job day moves faster when you have coworkers who become cool with you."
good,"This Job experience was ok, I enjoyed it. I liked the job environment and the job pace. It was ok. I wish I was paid more for the work but it was okay."
good,UPS is overall a good company to work for. I think the culture is slowly changing to accommodate modern work environments. Your job depends a lot on who you work for and how they manage their employees.
good,The environment is balanced n controlled. They are all about safety. Everyone is treated the same . your aloud to do a lot of things that other companies can't do because ups is all about trust
good,"This company provided well health benefits, paid-time off and holidays, and has been a pleasure working for them. I worked here for a couple of years and have had few problems."
good,"Answer phones"
good,"Loading and unloading of inventory belt and trucks, Fast paced and physically demanding for very little money. Early hours finished by 10 am. Management was alright, lied to me to get me into the workplace though. Advertised job as a delivery driver but upon hire said I would start in warehouse and be sent to driving school in a few months, later stated that 6 other individuals had 10 years of service over me thus ahead for qualifications for drivers. Lack of trust after that."
good,A typical day at UPS consists of dealing with customers who are happy to see you 95% of the time; and that's always a feel good environment. Good place to get some part time seasonal work if needed.
good,The job was strictly professional and to the point. Everyone does their job in a quickly and timely matter to meet consumer needs. All of this must be done in a safely  manner.
good,Consistently met productivity standards and met work deadlines in all general warehouse functions. Experience included loading and sorting packages by weight
good,The job wouldn't be so bad if there weren't such a lack of professionalism.  The union sort of makes for uneasy relations between employees and management obviously causing for a uneasy work environment.
good,Trucks need to be standardized and purged. The height of the trucks can be detrimental from a HS standpoint. Number of entrances and exits from the truck can cause fatigue and lifting above the recommended height may cause long term knee and hip damage.
good,"UPS is too big to act smart. The management is very conservative and misses out on opportunities."
good,"Good if you like working with your hands. The benefits are nice, and for the most part its a pretty laid back environment. Guaranteed raises are nice, and having a union at your back can have its benefits."
good,Learned new customer service skills. More interactions with customers than I have had in the past. I love when we do drop off packages because those are just super easy and quick and the customers love how quickly they can go on with their days
good,"I have been an employee for a little more than eleven years. I have done just about everything on the night shift from loading trucks, sorting packages on a color coded system and sorting smaller packages."
good,"It's tough to keep up at UPS, but if it's the right company for you they'll take care of you for life. Good communication between staff and management. Fast paced, physically and mentally demanding."
good,"This was just a job to get me by during the holidays.  The hours weren't the greatest and you have to be able to handle the environment since you will be outside all day.  Not a bad place to get some extra spending money, but not somewhere I would permanently want to stay."
good,"This is a good job for people right out of college."
good,"To be fair, they warn you when you start out. It is hard work. In the summer it's boiling, and in the winter it's freezing for the first half until you've worked up a sweat. Nice people. Great place to stick around if higher education is not in your plans because there are many opportunities for advancement. High turnover rate."
good,Hardest part of the job were the hours of operation. It was very difficult to secure a full-time position as they were very limited. It was a fun place to work and it helped me move my career forward.
good,A great environment to learn about process improvement.  The structured nature of the culture makes it difficult for creatives and independent thinking.
good,You work a lot and are constantly busy so time does go fast on your shift. You can ask for overtime hours and sometimes they will give it to you. Some managers where great to work with and others let the position go to there head..
good,I was a driveres helper. I helped the driver deliver packages to the customers in a friendly and professional way. This was a great experience working here seasonally.
good,"the season is tough on both drivers and the helpers, job demands a lot on your body depending on the day and the work load. pay is very low compare to what the drivers make."
good,"I was actually only a Driver's Assistant, but there was no option to choose that one. Actually it wasn't that bad, I ran packages to and from peoples' doors during Christmas time."
good,The workplace was fast and motivated. I learned almost how to play a game of tetrus when it came to stacking boxes. The hardest part of the job was finding room.
good,Working here was alright. The experience was interesting but i had to commute almost two hours to get there and as a driver helper. driving myself to the places i would work was a waste of gas. The job was good over all and the people were nice to work with.
good,"seasonal drier helper position, called to work when needed it wasn't something that I would want to do full time but at the same time the position is only a seasonal positional"
good,"Good job but you don't have much of a life 55hrs a week and little down time in between , management really doesn't give you a hard time unless you screw up."
good,We were always busy and on our toes. The driver was very easy going and a pleasure to work with. Overall working for UPS was a great experience. I learned a lot!
good,"Cold, fast paced, horrible colors to wear, people from all walks of life fighting for a paycheck, good company for the driver,  2 weeks before Christmas, enough said!!"
good,It was definitely a fast paced job. I worked there so long ago. It was a okay job I just hated THE Commute WAS DEFINITELY HARD WORK AND LONG HOURS. it WAS A MAJOR WORKOUT BEING A LOADER.
good,"Very hard work, and even harder to get other people to work as hard as you do. Learned a lot about supervising with running my own area and how to do time cards for my employees."
good,Took job on friends recommendation. The hours werected constantly changing. Lack of communication  made work environment difficult. Prices were not set due to being a franchise. Less then satisfactory.
good,"A typical day at work is lifting thousands of packages and placing them on a color coordinated conveyor belt depending on the the zip code and state.  Management does what they can do to satisfy their employees, however, due to the substantial amount of volume and the lack of warehouse space, it is challenging to keep a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy packages at a rapid pace for five hours with no break. In the summer, temperatures can reach up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, therefore, staying hydrated is vital. The most enjoyable part of the job are the benefits. UPS has excellence health insurance. Also, I was able to start my 401k at 22 years old. After serving five years, I will be able to receive a pension. Last of all, UPS paid for almost half of my tuition through their reimbursement program, earn & learn."
good,My first time working for UPS was wonderful I was only there for seasonal I had helped a driver get packages to customers at a timely matter it was an outside job but I truly enjoyed the experience
good,The Business development role in Phoenix is a great plac eto start with UPS.  Training is complete and they are an inclusive workplace.  The hardest part is waiting for an outside opportunity to open in an area that you would be willing to relocate to.
good,As an HR supervisor I was very aware of the tremendous benefits that UPS offers it's employees.  You cannot find a benefits package like this very many places.
good,"UPS was a decent enough company to work for. However getting hired at the company is only temporary.  A typical day as a driver helper is obviously, you meet up with the driver, get in the truck. Perform a light jog to each door, the driver will hand you the package that is suppose to be dropped off."
good,Have to load trucks Monday through Friday. Nice vacation time. Everyone works together when you need help to finish so the drivers can do their delivery.
good,"It was the first job I received when I moved from out of state. It was good for my schooling schedule. Since its part of the UPS franchise, it didn't offer the benefits UPS would give and thats the only bad part."
good,everyday I can expect a good work load. the leadership there was fair and opportunities for hours and advancement was there.  professional work environment.
good,"you work out of a storage locker, you have a golf cart with a trailer you sort then place your boxes in the trailer and you start your delivery. your outside you meet nice people i would recommend for a temp seasonal job."
good,"14+ hour days, made $400+ in 3 days of work, however. Would come in at around 7 or 8 and not get paid until the route started, which was at 10. Would work there again if I HAD to."
good,The only con is while your children are young you give up a lot of family time..I never got to watch my kids play sports and missed a lot of their growing years...the job can be hard on your home life
good,The ups business was hard labor. They only made us work more for the low pay they provided. Which was not okay for me. Overnight job paid 10.10 an hour i did not think that was worth the labor.
good,It provides great opportunities for college students as well other individuals. It can be stressful at times and hard to deal with but it is a great job.
good,"If you can handle working for barely above minimum wage lifting heavy boxes non-stop for hours, then this is the place for you. Added stress from your supervisor standing outside of your trailer with a clipboard giving you updates every hour on how fast you are going."
good,"Fast paced work environment, managers aren't truthful about the hours in work day. Hours are unsteady and extremely physical. If you plan to work here then expect to lose some weight."
good,"this job will be liked only when you are a super good-natured person with a solid patience."
good,"A typical day for me consisted of an average stop count of 210. My truck was typically loaded with 350-450 packages. My day ended when I delivered the last package in my truck and returned to the hub to unload the pickups I gathered throughout the day. My management team was very helpful and understanding when I first started. As I gained experience I noticed there was a culture of ""just get the job done"" at my facility. That worked for me most times. The thing that I disliked the most about the job, was the work/life balance. There was no balance. I would leave the house at 7:30am and not get home until 9:00pm. There were even nights that I got home at 11:00pm during ""peak season"". The parts I enjoyed most were being outside, meeting all kinds of people, and finally the health benefits they provided."
good,Assisted route driver with delivery of packages to homes and businesses in his route area.  stops are set to a time limit to accomplish all stops.  Good people to work with.
good,Keep your boots laced and learn how to write fast. If you cant lift a 100 lbs you might not want to got there. People dont have the time to help you with every heavy package you get cause they got their own.
good,Be prepared for the holidays because it can be very strenuous on the body. If you like to keep busy this is the job for you. The customers are great and keep things interesting.
good,"its a fast paced, hard labor job lots of yelling and no down time very boring work place and very hot. Not the place to work if your easily offended or get your feelings hurt easy"
good,"Good company, bad management. Culture is terrible. Managers don't understand how company operates.  Too much work too do. Good benefits, drivers are fun to work with."
good,UPS is a rough job. It requires a lot of your time and a lot of physical labor. Be expected to work 10-12 hours a day with lifting heavy packages and working in inclement weather
good,"you will drive for 4 years then you will start making a bank. "
good,Its an ok job just wish they paid more for the type of work we do and how hard we wrk constantly on a everyday basis. The management is not always truthful about work opportunities that could increase your pay rate or position.
good,At this time do not have any commits that would sway an applicant to seek employment. Each person should decide to accept employment base on their opinions and not the opinion of others
good,"My experience at UPS was a unique experience they were professional and balanced working environment. Every worker and staff member took pride in there job, and everyone was accountable for their bahavior and work. I think it's a great company with many benefits that can take you a long way."
good,I really loved doing this job. I delivered most of the packages and ran most of the time. the worst part was it was only about a 4 week position and not enough hours.
good,The pay was alright considering the work. Great job for a kid fresh out of high school. Not so much if youre older and just starting as the entry pay is pretty bad. Benefits are phenomenal.
good,I learned a lot about geography working with UPS. I also learned a lot about being efficient with packages and pallets. Inventory was hard until I got the hang of it.
good,this job is a good part time starter job you work you but off but that's what life is nowadays there is no easy road to go through anymore. you work for what you want and this is a good place to start out
good,"worked her for a short time, I enjoyed the job but I just didn't get enough hours for my needs, I would still recommend this to a kid looking for a part time job during school."
good,i do not wish to give my review about this job but yet i am forced by indeed to do so i do not wish to state my pros or cons about this job at all thank you
good,They promised me job security but ended up laying me off but calling me 2 weeks later asking if I wanted a transfer. Most supervisors are inexperienced and lack the leadership qualities a supervisor needs.
good,"When I first got hired, I was a package handler. The job is not bad, it is just a massive amount of manual labor. I had gotten plantar fascitis at the age of 17 from the job, so then I moved to DA. DA was not as bad, just extremely boring and dragged on through the day. The job itself is not bad for someone else maybe, but for me I dreaded getting ready to go."
good,"It seems as if Managers care more about the production value and process rate rather than employee safety. Also, managers seem to get high stress levels and start blaming others when things don't get done on time. The negativity that goes on in these unloads are strenuous and very unfriendly."
good,"worked there for two years, needed a shift change for school, after months of requesting it was not granted it. pay was good, transition to sorter was easy and well trained to complete job."
good,"Nonstop work days, management are cut throat,  customer service is more important than worker safety. Very hard to get promoted, company does not help employee become a better worker"
good,it is a nice environment to work at and every one is friendly and willing to work with you. if you need help with something they will help you out and the management is nice
good,This is a great place to work at where promotion depends on your output. They give you plenty of opportunity for raises and promotions to different departments and positions.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"UPS pay is the highest among the company I worked with. A typical starts with a cup of coffee. I have learned to manage time and work load in a short notice. The management is always transferring from one department to the other. The workplace culture is fast paced but with the frequent movement. The hardest part of the job is pleasing customers. As the world leader in logistics, customers look up to you for resolution which sometimes do not come in a way the customer expect. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to train and coach CSR's during their audit reviews."
good,Fast paced work environment that consistently challenges you to meet production and quality standards. Once accumulated to the job you learn a variety of  management skills.
good,great place to  learn the freight business.  employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   safe work environment. supervisors are very helpful.  love the place
good,"For a company that has so many employees the inter company expenditures are below the industry average. Just a very old, respected culture nothing wrong with that, but in today's digital age showing face should not be required as much unless the work is done. They do not believe you are doing work unless they physically see you. NO working from home."
good,a typical day would be either loading trucks or operating a forklift. UPS taught me how the postal services work operate and the rate of how its is expedited. management was bit brutal but I have tough skin. hardest part of the job was working long hours in a hot truck. Thay have great benefits the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move around to different assignments in the warehouse.
good,"I enjoyed working with UPS as I was working on my degree but when i went full time is when it got frustrating long hours with little in the way of support, and if you needed to complete training it was expected you stay even longer to complete it. That being said the culture depends on the operation you are in some expect way more then is logical others are have great people who really make you feel like a family just depends on how they conduct them self's in that branch."
good,"Working for UPS and The UPS Store are two different companies. The UPS Store is not a part of the cooperate job with UPS. You will be paid less than $10 a hour and required to do most of everything your store manager does, deal with customer complaints just as if you were a manager and also close and count drawers like a manager. You have a lot of responsibilities with not the right pay. "
good,Not a very difficult job at all. Physically demanding. Hot or cold depending on the weather. Only work 17 hours per week with low pay and takes on year to gain any benefits.
good,"There are 2 stores, working on 3, and they are owned by a father, wife, and daughter. Lets just say they all clash and it affects the work environment TREMENDOUSLY!!!!!"
good,a typical day at work would be busy fast past lot of package be handled loud fast eye opening lot of moving around packages being moving from trucks to trucks . i learned how to load the trucks put package in they right order management is very cool understands is workers very well the hardest part on the job is when you have to unload a 28 foot truck and pack the packages in order on the rightful truck so it could make the deliver to the right area  culture of the works place is very compacts everyone gets along well as a family spoken  when only be spoken to because everyone hands and head be so focus making sure everything is been put in place the most enjoyable part of the job for me is when am about to punch out and go home to start another long day...
good,"Bad for someone trying to get a full time job out of it. Management sucks and they could care less about their employees safety as long as they are breathing and able to load cans. Airport is the hottest place in Louisville during the day time and they do not provide us water, or any other sort of incentives to get us to work harder. The risk-reward is a bit streaky. There is not enough people to work here so they lure people in with a 200$ bonus and meanwhile show no love for the people who stay there and continue to deal with their BS."
good,You are pressured to complete huge tasks in a short amount of time. If you ask for help they get annoyed with you. Sometimes they have one person trying to load to many trucks at one time. The worst part of the job was having to work at 1am sometimes.
good,"It's a hard job, the only good thing about is the benefits. Management usually sucks and the work breaks down your body. In a typical you are lifting packages weighing 1lb to 200lbs+."
good,"Great job for those graduating high school and wanting to go to college, they work with ur schedule and help with the cost of college, I definitely recommend it"
good,its a blessing and I enjoy working for the company and I enjoy the work that I do I find nothing hard about this job and i'm a people person so that would be the best part of this job to
good,It seems like the harder the worker the more work flow they push on said worker.The way they had things set up was very unorganized. You would think it was the first rodeo.
good,Management was ok got along with everyone mostly just kept to myself unless need. First real experience with working in a warehouse so that was a nice.
good,"Ups can be stressful at time, you have to go in with a positive mindset, and clear your thoughts before starting, this is because the job itself is already stressful, and if you walk in with a negative attitude your bound to be miserable at work that day."
good,"•	Physical and fast-paced position"
good,"typical day at work started out in warehouse finding out where your route would be and organizing/sorting and making sure all packages are accounted for.  I learned aside from needing organizational skills, time management and moving with a sense of urgency is a big requirement.  Workplace culture was strong, teamwork and a brotherhood was a big deal there.  Hardest part of the job was learning how to use a hand held ""palm pilot"" call the DIAD.  Most enjoyable part of this job was dealing with the same smiling customers everyday and the healthy fat paychecks."
good,It's a alright job especially for a part time. Decent management but overall they need more professionalism. Great job to get a work out in.  Most employees are very friendly. Safe work environment.
good,I was with UPS for 13 years. You have job security but when you are in management you can get moved around at any given moment and your immediate managers can change at the same time.
good,"Not quite the best place to work, as the manager and supervisors can shadily cut your hours. It's best to keep track of your time, and verify that it wasn't trimmed down each week. The hours fluctuate throughout the year, with earlier and later start times, and you'll almost never get 20 hours (as a Part Time job) per week. To become full-time inside the warehouse, you have to sign a bid sheet as a full-time job opens, and wait your turn with seniority. This can take well over a decade. On the plus side, you don't have to deal with customers (if working in the warehouse), and the job isn't too difficult, depending on what you're doing in the building."
good,"This company works in fast pace environment and can be physically demanding on you. They offer great benefits to anybody willing to work hard including education assistance, insurance, and pension. You can also learn a lot from working there if you stay there long enough."
good,Demanding job which requires a lot of time and effort. Constant pressure from upper management to meet predetermined deadlines and values. Room to advance in company.
good,UPS has many good benefits and a great advancement track for management if you can get a degree. The pay was competitive and you'll learn a lot as a supervisor. Co-Workers understand how demanding and hard the job is so they try to have fun as well. But the job is extremely difficult and demanding at times and production is the #1 priority. They say it is safety but walk around the hub and quickly you realize its production driven.
good,"Working as a pre loader was no too bad. You basically just load trucks, and meet strict quotas every week. This was fast paced, and a lot of hard physical work."
good,its always a good place but sometimes it gets busy u can grow with the company its a good place to work many people work there the have class that u can take and some day become a driver also off weekends and good time off
good,Very hard working environment with much exposure to a wide array of corporate practices that are excellent to develop your business acumen. The workplace culture team focused.
good,"I assisted the driver with the organization of the truck and delivery of all packages to both commercial and residential customers."
good,The bosses were not organized at all. they had us employees all over the place. low paying job with horrible hours. You wouldnt know the time you had to work until the last minute
good,"Fast Paced job. "
good,UPS is a great company but there is no room for advancement quick enough. You must be there for several years before you are considered for a good position with good pay.
good,stayed in the back of a truck for 4 hrs. just made boxes of walls. there were really nice people that worked there. the irregs were super heavy. i didn't really like this job.
good,"I enjoyed the work at UPS, the people were friendly and the environment was safe and relaxing. I learned a lot about shipping and receiving, and just all the basics of a warehouse."
good,A typical work day consisted of loaded and unloading freight as well as cleaning. I learned time management while working at UPS. The hardest part of the Job would be Working more than 12 hours during a busy season and slowing down to 5 hours or less a day
good,"Very nice working space teamwork"
good,"It was pretty straightforward.They bused us out to the main UPS station in Addison and from there we rode off with our UPS drivers and helped them deliver packages. It was nice to sight see the neighborhoods, especially since this was around Christmas time."
good,The management was very unprofessional with training. They would choose and pick favorites to do lighter loads than others and I just think they did things very unprofessional.
good,Being a loader was pretty hard labor but there is a sense of satisfaction after working a good shift. I learn how to be careful upon procedures for my own safety.
good,"Worked with TFE Group, a contractor for UPS.  The front office manager.  I kept the office operational for 150.00 employees and kept HR records current and future employees."
good,I really enjoyed this job. I would load and unload the trucks everyday making use its easy for the drivers to find the packages. The only reason i stopped was because of my back pain.
good,"I enjoyed learning how to taxi semis and aircraft's.it was pretty physical,which I enjoy.the people were fun and caring.I'm happy I was qualified to work at the airport"
good,"Work could be great you deliver daily to the same commercial stops and through out the week the same residential blocks. You build a relationship with the customers. Work is fast paced and has great benefits. You learn to be punctual, fast, safe, and your constantley tested. Management needs major training"
good,"Nothing to say! I did not enjoy the job, due to my manager! You all know exactly the problems you have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"This was a week long posting for seasonal help - I was told that it would be very busy and that they needed as much help as possible. However, I was called for one day of work and was not contacted again. I was disappointed to have gone to the trouble of applying only to only work for a day!"
good,"Benefits good, get work out 💪 while working,independent working, the job is high demand on you physically but the hours are not long and there always hiring"
good,The hours weren't that good the work was very hard.I didn't get enough hours. the pay was very poor due to the number of hours worked but I learned how to work a RF gun .
good,"Spend my day packing boxes, loading trucks, taking out trash and shipping product all over the country. have to verify shipments and process paperwork."
good,"Didn't offer any other positions after season was over, needed a full-time position or at least other position in company to try to grow within company"
good,"busy but had its down time"
good,"As long as you're fine with having a physically demanding job, then you should be fine. I would suggest exercising and stretching before your workday. otherwise, you will get put a lot of strain on your feet."
good,"My experience at UPS was only a temporary one during what is likely their most difficult time of year, so my review is a little skewed in that sense. With that said, UPS is not a place to start if you are not physically fit. Some of those packages are quite heavy and when you move them around there is ample opportunity for injury. I can't imagine what it's like for the folks moving pieces around on the dock day in and day out. At least the drivers, I would guess, don't have to move as much in terms of total weight around each day."
good,One great thing about work at UPS is that there is almost no down time or screen time. It's all hard work. And the people who succeed here are hard workers. So the colleagues and the comraderie are of superior quality.
good,"If can become a delivery driver and can stand getting dirty every day, sweating, and winters - great career!  Management, outside of operations, is great job too.  Military culture."
good,"During my time working at UPS I was able to learn numerous skills such as; pack and ship packages, handle print jobs, complete copy reports/logs, send faxes, and build on my cashier skills. I did not like working at this job because the organization of the company was poor. There was not appropriate communication among team members."
good,overall working with ups was okay i just wish peak on the route i was assigned lasted a while longer. I would love to be employed by ups again in the near future.
good,"a typical day at work begins with reading & replying to all email & daily reports. Create Daily operating plans & summarize all scorecard elements to be reviewed in our management teams daily meeting. Prepare & partake in regional conference calls discussing service & safety elements.Hold daily meetings with our staff. Then it is on to oversee the daily operation of processing shipments of packages in upwards of 30,000 a night."
good,I only worked for ups seasonal job so I really can't say too much for them other than they are a fast paced company who gets jobs done asap. It's a great atsomphere but they need to also think of employees and their needs
good,"UPS  ticks all the boxes as far as good pay, benefits and paid days off. Of course, that comes once you're in the union. But there's a long grueling vetting process which includes a week of class and then 40 business days of training. it's demoralizing and panic inducing at times. That said, if you can( and do) jump through all, the hoops.. You can look forward to a pay raise every year for four years with a top pay of 36 an hour. But be clear, this job is no joke. It will test your mind and body."
good,Verty nice place for a nursing home. The clients are well behaved and loved when you show empathy and love in your careing for them. Also the staff members were very professional.
good,"- Help the driver deliver the packages to the correct residency"
good,"It was ok working there, for me. got a lot of hours but the training took long due to all the people that were hired at the same time. they were hiring a lot of people due to it being seasonal, and all. i worked here from October - January. Met some cool people. They were nice. The end of the seasonal work and the beginning of it, i think, was sloppy. They never told me the last day of work for me. I showed up for work and the supervisor comes to me and tells me my seasonal is up. A simple phone call would have been enough, instead of having to use my gas and wait through traffic."
good,"The company is not going anywhere, so it is stable to work for. Peak season can be miserable, but the overtime is nice if you are willing to forgo any time with your family."
good,"•	Worked efficiently during high traffic holiday season"
good,This place is a great place to work. You dont have a supervisor breathing down your neck at all times. Give you a great work out and every one there is nice.
good,"I'm not sure how to rate, I didn't work there long bc I found out I was pregnant & I couldn't lift the heavy boxes. Managament didn't want me move me to an easier dept where I wouldn't be lifting"
good,Ups is a nice job to have if u are currently in high school or college and need some extra money it's a starter job help you build yourself and prepare yourself for the working world
good,"Great if going to school. Hours are not flexible and very early in the morning though. The job is very physical and you dont have to remeber alot, just put packages in order on trucks before the drivers work day starts."
good,"Great job to have as a career, wonderful co workers, lots of opportunity involved with the job I enjoy the pace the environment, I would love to work for this company again"
good,"I dont remember much from working there, if you enjoy manual labor its great and there is definitely room for advancement if you work hard. Personally hated the union there as the only protect lazy workers"
good,Eventful place to work. Constantly new challenges are presented on a daily basis. Always opportunities to take on new rolls and positions.  New technology is embraced
good,I didn't too much like ups they where kind of rude workers and not so easy to work with had very short time to eat on lunch break . The only thing I got out of ups is learning how to scan packages
good,UPS was a good job to gain experience in graphic design for me and working with customers. I was able to learn some things that I didnt know before. The hardest part of the job was learning how shipping packages work from the inside. I had friends that worked there with me and that made the experience enjoyable.
good,I learned how to use a scanner gun and how to carefully deliver packages. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to drive around and learn new routes.
good,UPS was great but they demanded more than any other company I had worked for.  I don't mind working hard but UPS burned me out.  Learned alot but would not return unless I had no other choice.
good,UPS was one of the most physically demanding companies to work for. The amount of volume increases each year and thus the production rate is expected to increase. However all the work is done physically by the employees with slow innovation on how to help them move faster.
good,UPS is a good company to work for when it comes to benifts and work life balance. Where they have started to lack in the last few years is in management and management accountability at the front line supervisor and the area supervisor levels.
good,Go to work in the morning there is chaos for the first 15 or 20 minutes involving management and drivers. Start your route and the fun began.  The hardest part is the morning because the drivers complains all the time about their route being too heavy.
good,"ups was a great place to work , the hardest part of the job was to stay awake , because i worked 6-6 everyday no off days. the most enjoyable was when i got paid and meeting new people."
good,"I was grateful for the experience, but at the same time sometimes they do not value you. The drivers treat the handlers bad, and the main office poeple are rude to new people and seasonal workers. Also One of the main bosses at my UPS was outwardly rude and yelled at a customer in the store. She received no backlash even though she was also racist towards the Mexican customer."
good,"Not a bad job, takes a lot of manual labor and hard work. Work a high pace but overall good job to give you a feel for manual labor."
good,"A typical day at work would be a safety pre-trip of my vehicle at 7-45 then getting inside the already fully loaded vehicle with 100 deliveries. A quick look at my express parcels which have to be delivered by a certain time and then decide where I'm going to start on my delivery area. While delivering my parcels throughout the day I get also collections sent to my from my depot and these can be up to 10-30 a day. UPS is a very busy company and the amounts of deliveries and collections is pretty much the same every day. The work can be tiring but there is a good sense of achievement when you clear your work each day in what is a very demanding job. While I was at UPS I was singled out by my manager to become a driver trainer, so went on a course and became a certified driver trainer where my duties involved taking new drivers out, accident follow ups and teaching safe work methods"
good,"There not enough hours for part time workers ;especially after the winter peek. Constant lifting, lowering, bending. Overall a good place to work but not for seasonal or part time workers ."
good,"the company is very good but the working environment is not that much good.They have internal politics in the working environment."
good,Worked seasonally during Christmas to help the drivers load and deliver packages.  I was hoping for more hours but was used on an as needed basis.  Drivers were very helpful
good,"easy job great customers but the owner at this store is difficult to work with, illegally doesn't provide 15-30 min breaks for a 6 hour or more work day"
good,"Love the fast start raises, and benefits for the part time. The tuition reimbursement   was very helpful while going to school. As for moving up in management, it seemed as if it would take forever."
good,needs better management and communication with employees. management needs to have better planning before hiring employees. when hired be up front with the new hire about future at company.
good,"Fast paced, no breaks, short hours. It is quite a fun job sadly it is only seasonal only around Christmas. Knowing how to follow intructions os very important"
good,"I would start the day by opening the store, count the register and balance the till. After get all machines powered on and ready to go for customers. Then I go on to make sure store was clean. The fun part was meeting all kinds of awesome people. Downfall can get real busy with only one person on clock until someone else was in."
good,I don't really have that much idea about UPS cause it was jus a seasonal job . the only problem to sort these boxes in order and sometimes you deliver stuff to disrespectful costomers.
good,"Every experience will be different, depending on the driver's route and location, i was fortunate to have a patient driver and willingness to train me on the diad and route, after a week i had it down pack but watch out for loading too many packages on one hand truck, only advice i can say, remind the driver of safety and not being able to see whats in front of you, he should understand but a driver will load as many packages as you let him."
good,"Hard-working, fast pace job for those who can really commit. There are extra hours and good pay. There's a school program that a lot of people take advantage of as well as paid vacations. The co-workers are helpful and selfless as well as the supervisors are understanding."
good,"Loading and un-loading aircraft in the rain, sun, hot or cold, making sure that the airplanes were loaded correctly and would be on time for customers"
good,Ups was Ok I was loaded da truck then my day was done it was a good job they just wasn't giving me fair hours.........................................
good,It's a job. But at the end of the day they don't give out enough hours for a person to comfortably survive in this economy. They've cut hours as well as giving employees a hard time overall
good,I don't plan on working there again. My short time there wasn't that bad because I did seasonal but I worked third shift and I couldn't handle getting up at 3 am
good,Worked for a company that was acquired by UPS.  UPS tried to get our mid revenue clients to conform to their way and we lost many of these customers.
good,its a lot of boxes coming at a consecutive rate breaks are  breaks are short and bitter and they give it to you fifteen minutes after you clock in instead of waiting closer to the shift its kind of funny and the pay depending on what you do is disappointing.
good,"This company has great benefits and pay. They demand a lot and the more you're able to do the more they demand. Everything is fast paced and urgent. Safety is prioritized but not always supported, so be your own advocate. "
good,Meeting new people and being able to compete with the person next to you on who can get the job done the fastest is always a fun thing to do.
good,"I manage around 15-20 people making sure our customers packages are handled with care and our service goes on before 1030am."
good,They are a rough bunch. Always looking for ways to exploit here workforce. Do not go into management. Most operation managers work 60 to 70 hours per week.
good,this is a job where one runner would deliver participles of people demands. run jump and lift to be careful. wear uniform and drink constantly. only urinate in back of truck
good,"It was an overall great learning experience I got a chance to learn how to better my communication skills, but the work was difficult"
good,busy fast moving environment management available at all times shortage of staff sociable working environment average pay no incentives or bonus when working on the administrative side
good,"A typical day at work would be about a 5 hour shift with a flow of about 50-60,000 packages. Things are changing around the company so there is always new information daily as well as management. Management is a young generation some not very experienced so might have a different understanding. The hardest part of the job would probably be days when we get a lot of Magazines because those are the heaviest boxes. You are always working with or next to someone so you can socialize and work at the same time."
good,Store manager cross trains each employee so they each have skills and knowledge to assist customers with any tasks and answer relevant questions. Most of our customers were returning after they received satisfactory services and products.
good,"I enjoy my job it keeps me busy and the pay is ok, but working part time is a struggle for a family to live off of. The shifts are good and the staff are very helful and friendly."
good,not a bad  place to work short term. overall a decent place if you need a job. pay isn't high and raises don't come often if at all. don't expect to get breaks
good,Come into work and log into a scanner . Begin as soon as you get there and work hard until you leave. Very fast paced. You Have to adjust to changing conditions
good,I work with new hires and other employees dealing with the safety division at UPS.  I work to maintain safety through out the company. I enjoy working with people.
good,Work work and  get a product to customers fast as we can on time built a goal to keep a service perfect what can  Brown do for you a good experience to work at UPS also get discounts Healthcare
good,UPS was a fun job for a high school student like myself. Management began to hire incompetent employees and started to play favorites and began even giving raises to individuals who would brown nose and have romantic relationships with other employees
good,"A typical night at UPS is safely unloading, sorting and loading the trucks that come in and go out. I learned that different levels of package handling. The management is a hard working, trusting, dedicated to job people who want to see the success and progression of the company and great people to work with and for. The culture of the company is fun and easy going but focused and driven at the same time we know how to have fun and enjoy our jobs while working hard to satisfy our customers. The hardest part of my job is probably the stress it puts on the body over use of the same muscles every night can be strenuous on the body. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to be a part of a hard working team."
good,"Early morning start to day.  There are a lot of managers on site, each one is in charge of a different job.  This is a very physical job and it is not for everyone."
good,Good for a challenge benefits of a good pay too. Always different people you meet out delivering and of course your regulars. Great place to work just fancy a change
good,"I would have stayed there, but they do not hire full time staff, only part time. Otherwise, nice place to work, plenty of work to keep me busy, nice co-workers."
good,UPS is a great job for the benefits and part time job seekers. Hard to balance life working a full time and a part time job.  Only full time positions are drivers and that takes years to accomplish.
good,"This is a stressful and fast paced job that can be rewarding.  The levels of management disagree with each other, the management disagrees with the employees, the departments within the company disagree with each other. For a company the size of UPS, it definitely has its flaws."
good,Great place to work and is based on seniority so you have to start from the bottom and work your way up. Easy money but hard work is required.
good,"Excellent company to work, but some department supervisor does not do a good job as a supervisor and do not have equal oportunity for all of their employee."
good,I like it it's hard some days I don't like when they send u home I need to work everyday even it's two hours a day I still need to work. I went to work I and was sent home before signing in in. It was a waste of gas. I need to work not play with bill money.
good,"very fast pace place to work, better keep up, and smoke quick. dont have much to say, nor am qualified to review companies"
good,"The highlight of working at UPS as Twilight Preload (the shift from anywhere from 2am-10am)"
good,never had a bad experience with ups. They delivered packages and always let someone know if theyhad one coming if they had called.
good,"I enjoyed working at the UPS Store, but it was a job that I could not stay at due to lack of pay. As a Retail Associate, and delivery driver, the work required vs. the pay was lopsided."
good,A fast paced job that requires you to be on your feet and requiring some dictation supervisors yelling expletives all in all an okay first job.
good,"it was good hands on experience in mail delievery, my co-workers were nice, helpful, and informative. the hardest part was just the walking and lifting done on the jobe, if your not use to it it can be a pain."
good,"long days, basic delivery skills and safety, decent management, driver was fantastic. decent seasonal job, will most likely do it next year"
good,"This job is mainly to just get a few extra dollars on the side. not consistent work. They were always saying they didn't need me to work, or send me home early"
good,"Advice - if you get into the Union, stay there. As a driver you work hard and long hours, but you are well compensated for it.  Management has to pay for benefits, receives no pension, and almost always works overtime without overtime pay (paid for 10, work 12-14)."
good,Ups was a ok it was a good experience the workers was nice but can be improved but other than that I enjoy.working there.wish I.had more hours
good,"My time at ups was good but felt like I needed to change careers closer to home due to personal circumstances I am"
good,"need better pay wages, nice environment, but need something that can support my bills. Move and organize boxes from different trailers."
good,The benefits are really good. Plus they pay for school so that's good.  Cons are the pay isn't really that good.  The money is only good around peak and that's at the end of the year. It's an alright place to work overall.
good,Very good benefits but it comes at a price you have to work here for a year to get free benefits for yourself and a year and a half to add spouse and kids. The job is not an easy job a lot of people can not do the job it can and will be very physical. So if you want the job be prepared to work.
good,"unload the truck making drop offs "
good,Great work/life balance. Excellent benefits and perks. Open atmosphere and work environment. Busy work schedule on a daily basis.and nice co worker and management
good,"Provide face-to-face customer service and oversee employees"
good,this is a great place to work if you are looking for a career if you a simply looking for a part time job you can do a lot better then ups as far as in working for someone who cares about their employees
good,If you are looking for a lot of hours in the time period of October to January this is the perfect job. You average about 45 hours a week plus driver help in December but once Christmas time is over the hours drop down to around 19 a week.
good,"This job required constant energy, to complete simple tasks in a timely fashion. Work was team oriented and taught workers how to work with one another. Management oversaw operations to ensure work flow progressed smoothly. Co-workers always trying to support one another in order to get the job done quickly and efficiently. Hardest part of the job was the constant movement of lifting and sorting boxes. Most enjoyable was the snacks that upper management would provide from time to time after work."
good,"i learned how to deliver packages as well as preload them into ups trucks."
good,"UPS invests a lot in their employees, training is available if needed. This is a great place to learn and to gain experience. Employees have good work ethics."
good,"I worked unloading and preload. I worked primarily in what is called the ""pods"" the heaters in the pods never worked and at some points the temperature down there would be cold enough that we would have to stop working just to go to another section of the building to warm our hands and body's."
good,"They do pay for school, and the other benefits are great. There is a reason they are always hiring as Notorious BIG said, it's not the best job and the night shift messes up scheduling."
good,Just when you thought it was over.... Its not... First day on the job as a seasonal employee and they sent me out in a rented truck with no shelves with 1500 packages in the middle of the floor of said truck in a mountainous pile for me to sort through to find 1 package at a time....The following day they asked me why I was out on the run for 15 hours?? Really??
good,"ok place to work not the best co workers are easy to get along with work as a team unload trucks pick sort packages,make deliverys"
good,"- process shipments and assist drivers"
good,This is a good job to work at and the supervisor including drivers dispatched are easy to get along with. This job has taught me how to multi task.
good,Loads and unloads packages into or out of UPS vehicles in a very fast-pace. Fun and friendly environment everyone works together. Lifting very heavy packages can be tough sometimes.
good,Self driven to complete all customer services needs throughout the day.  Dealing with the public and being self sufficient leads to challenging days..
good,"UPS, "
good,"Buona relazione con I lavoratori."
good,"The benefits are very good for such a physical job, however the presence of union creates a sort of complicated relationship between management and employees.  Lower management gets walked over, corporate figures point fingers at each other based on outdated information.  And nobody cares about the customer."
good,"It's not the easiest job nor is it the hardest job I've had, however the work is strenuous. The hours are crucial especially during ""peak"" which is the month of thanksgiving and Christmas. BUT, the pay and insurance is great as well as the people I work with."
good,Start off by checking the vehicle to insure that it is safe to drive. I learned about packaging process. Some of the management team was helpful and some were not so much. My coworkers were not so good to work to with .Getting the packages off on time.  had 2 trucks to unload .One in about 2 hours. Getting paid on Friday.
good,"fast paced, nice friendly environment, the hardest part of the job is making sure the packages are going on the right truck"
good,Typical day starts with me helping my driver deliver packages. I learned that the job is actually pretty cool. Management were very professional and nice to me which i liked.My co workers such as the drivers were very respectful also and actually taught me things that i can use in life.The hardest part was delivering in rain and snow.The most enjoyable part were the people saying thankyou to me i felt important and was happy to help them
good,"UPS was a really nice place to work at. Very easy work. The only problem I had with them was with my hours, they continued to mess up my checks. And they are just very rude."
good,The place is very strict and stressful. The employees have to put everything they have the whole time without stopping for a second.
good,"Fast pace, a lot of walking involved and must know your route and plan according to make deliveries on time. Most employees don't get out on their routes when they need or want to be. But I heard UPS is a good company to work for."
good,"Must be a self driven, strong performer, with internal desire to grow mentally and self educate. Hardest part of the job is relying on co-workers to do their job. You must stay on top of everyone in this company to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility."
good,i had a good experience at ups freight because it was close to my home and it had good pay. i would work for this company again.
good,"It was a good experience, I was i couldve stayed longer"
good,"The job is fast paced, and you learn new things everyday. The co-workers are nice and friendly, and the management is okay. The hardest part about the job is getting everything scanned and in the system within a two and a half hour time frame. The best part about the job, is the opportunity for growth within the company."
good,"if you stay hourly, union dues of 50$ isnt that bad compared to what you get. patients is required in order to get advancement"
good,This is a easy job. They offer good pay with good benefits. There are also a lot of people with a lot of different personalities.
good,"Getting hired for the holidays in a part-time position is normally a great way to make some extra money for the season, but the management is quick to let you go over the smallest of injuries, even if you don't need a lot of time off for it."
good,I hate to complain about this job. I was young and in great shape. They pushed people so hard all the older guys quit. I saw a few people pass out. theyre benifits were great but it was a long term part time position
good,Managed to load and unload trucks in a timely manner. Able to assist other employees with there loads when needed. Offered assistance when needed.
good,"Organized and fast paced"
good,Αρκετα καλη εταιρια  χωρις προβληματα και καλο περιβαλον καλη συνεργασια με τους συναδελφους και τους υπευθηνους εποικινονια με πολυ κοσμο και αρκετες δημοσιες σχεσεις
good,"Worked there for two months before i got the job at deca."
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,"I enjoyed working for ups, the hours were flexible I was able to pick the shift that worked best for me and the work was light. Every season I go back ."
good,"Working as a package handler at UPS its as great as most people make it seem. The management is not the best and when the start time for next work day changes you MAY NOT be informed of the change. Also when you work there you are guaranteed 3 hours a work day but sometimes the supervisors will send you home as soon as you arrive at your work area telling you that they are ""OVERSTAFFED""."
good,this job was very redundant. I personally do not like desk jobs and this was your ideal desk job. you sit behind a desk and sale over the phone.
good,had to be at work at 3am to get off at 7am. unloaded and loaded trucks. management was cool. what I learned from the company was discipline with changing my lifestyle habits to get up early.
good,To start off UPS is a great company if you have a family. Great pay. Drivers start off at 18.75. 33 after 4 or 5 years. Union in 40 days of work. Full medical dental insurance.
good,Most of the workers were good to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything how the driver wants it on the package cars and having management come and tell you to hurry up when we are going faster than the rollers can handle.
good,"Must be able to multi task at all times, not much room for advancement if you are looking more on the lines of a full time office jobs. This is an industrial company. Most jobs in the warehouse are permanent part time."
good,Go to work review mistakes made from the day before. Correct those mistakes in meetings preshift with staff. Lad and unload freight to ensure delivery intact and on time
good,"The ups store was always busy.  Heavy lifting was required . The ability to analyze customers needs and match them with our services. Mail sorting and p.o box set up required. Typing shipments,  packing delicate items."
good,on a typical day at work it is usually busy and the hardest part of the day is sometimes having to many interviews back to back with potential employees..
good,The work that has to be done here is not equal to the amount of pay. It's not a company that I can grow with. It's a steady position Job and will take a long time to rise.
good,for a seasonal position not bad but to get a actual job there full time would be very very hard. the work it self wasn't bad but the fact you would have to come back and  work season after season is what i didn't like
good,"Company has been great, but since UPS became involved with the NYSE, the daily goal of ""what would be best here,"" went to ""how much can we cram on every driver's truck."" The money is great with daily 8hr and weekly 40hr base overtime, and the benefits that are even available to part-time after 1 year are second to none. What the HR reps fail to tell you is how much pressure management will put on you to be faster and faster, even making you feel that you need to clock in bathroom breaks as a lunch, or making you work during your unpaid lunch hour. Just because a computer tells them it can be done within a certain time, they expect you to complete it, even though the next day it shows it should have taken longer. Expect 10hrs of work daily, and during peak season, up to 14hrs. Most centers is a Monday-Friday workload with a very small crew on Saturdays, however some centers are changing to Monday-Saturday full work days."
good,This company is no longer in business. They went out of business while I was employed there. It was a retail store locaed in Manhattan Mall in New York NY
good,they slave you for little bit of money like seriously you do alot of work there you ride around on the truck as a drivers helper
good,"Ups is a  Great Place To work, Its A Good Career Job,,where you can Succeed an only Move Upward.i Had A great Time Working There,The staff There Helps you out when In Need,Met Some Exciting People, Also U can Get A great Deal of A workout while You Are There"
good,"The job worked you to hard for the pay there would give us, short about of hours per week. if the pay was better the job will make more sence"
good,"working at a diligently fast pace, lifting heavy packages into the package cars, tiring and very monotonous, for the amount of work you do you dont get paid near enough. Decreases my family time and makes it harder for me to see my children,"
good,I enjoyed my time working at ups but with all the changes to their pay system it was very hard to keep up with my bills . They focus on getting the work done and getting out of there by a certain time .
good,It was a awfully fair job for the price at first. But with the turn over rates the work load would vary. And certain times of the year when volume is heavy and they where way under staffed defiantly not worth the pay
good,"The unofficial term for a U.P.S. driver as used by our supervisor was ""UPS athlete."" The typical day delivering consists of upwards of 25,000 steps walked as well as any number of floors climbed. The job consists of consistently heavy labor and a necessity to be mentally sharp; you must be able to intelligently organize how you approach each day and each route. There are also time commits as the day progresses of which you must be actively aware and able to make before the commit time is reached. Once through training, the job isn't all that bad. The worst part is the toll it takes on your body and your mental faculties when you aren't prepared for it, especially when starting."
good,UPS is one of the last companies that gives a person the ability to have a career that they can raise a family off of without needing a degree. Each person begins as an unloader/ loader and must work their way through the union in order to gain new positions. It is an incredibly physical job so one must take care of their body and be mentally ready when they come to work in order to manage the fast paced expectations.
good,"Some days we could have flyers being printed, folded, tabbed and labeled for businesses all around the St. Albans area. There could just be drop off packages to be packed and/or shipped. Also random projects such as banners and books."
good,they just don't pay enough for all the work that is done and they only offer part time which u can't live off of. so my overall rating of that job is poor to average.
good,"This job is not for everyone.  They will find capable employees and load them up with responsibilities with out knowing when to stop.  It is very easy to advance if you show them you are a competent worker and can take responsibility for your own actions.  The environment is hostile. The pay an benefits are the only reason employees stay.  If you have worked for major corporations before and understand micromanaging then you will do just fine here.  If you do not understand micromanaging or think everyone is out to get you, you may want to consider something else.  They only care about numbers and not that they are seriously overworking their delivery drivers."
good,"Good atmosphere to work in, lots of friendly people but the pay could have been a little better. Overall good company to work at."
good,Charter was a great company in regards to pay and they have amazing benefits. Although the pay can be great it have become an unstable job due to all of the metrics they are required to hit. You are truly just a number.
good,"I worked overnight hours part time during the holiday season while going to school."
good,"It's a very fun and cool job. Typical work day include; clocking in and logging into your scanner, standing around  until the convertor starts, loading about 250-300 boxes a hour."
good,This job was a part time job during my late teen years but I enjoyed the customer service and friendly people.the management was very in tune with the employees making sure we had everything we needed and the hardest part of the job was understanding people who may have had heavy accents.
good,Working 2 to 3am every morning loading 3 UPS truck with item coming down a conveyor belt. I have learned to ask for help when i need it. Management at time were not on the same page with each other at times but we got the job done. Co workers were funny and made easier to work. Working grave yard shift was the hardest. Most enjoyable is working with people.
good,"start working around five in the morning everyday, loading the delivery trucks, may not seem like a team job, but all the employees work in a team organizing the convener belt as the boxes come by the trucks. the hardest part of my job is putting the correct boxes on the correct trucks. The best part of my job would be the co-workers, everyone helps whoever they can out anytime it is needed."
good,"you don't have a schedule, they call when needed. you sit on the delivery truck and help deliver packages on the drivers route"
good,"I enjoyed my time at UPS until my co-worker became overbearing and invaded my personal space. Nothing was done about it, I had to leave due to its affect on my personal self."
good,Pay could be a better for the type of work done. I sort packages (heavy or light) to their proper place. Some management can take a refresher course on how to speak to their employees. Co-workers are cool. The hardest part is when you get a heavy package and the temperature during the summer months.
good,"worked for 4 years & 8 months, went for promotion 3 times, each one a higher level & more pay, economy crashed & lots of workers were let go due to economy ran out of money to pay companies & employees"
good,"If you don't mind working during the night shift,sleeping/waking up incredibly early, and willing to work about 3 1/2-4 Hours then it may be worth it."
good,"Typical day - my position I had little to no interaction with any one else until breaks, and shut down procedures. So how my work day went was solely based on my performance and attitude for that day. "
good,"This is jail. 4am work starts winter hours be there or get wrote up and in your workarea no breaks hard work 10 min breather in the middle of the 4 hour shift. If you like to work hard not smart then this the place for you. Management and Unions have constant wars people get fired and come back in a week. Union works band together Management fights each other for manpower"
good,Tough job for low pay. It is good exercise for someone who is trying to lose weight. It teaches you discipline and builds character. The benefits are very good but you have to work there for at least a year before you can get them.
good,My day at work was wonderful and I learned that working with groups of different people is great. The jobs was not hard. the most enjoyable part of my job was packing the computers.
good,Everyday I would meet the UPS driver at a desired and help him on his route distributing packages. My driver was an awesome guy and we got along great! It was a good way to make a few extra bucks during the holiday season. I was even offered a position to stay after the season ended but could accept do to schooling obligations.
good,Great place to work if this is you first job steady hour always work the pay could be better all-around good place to work long work days
good,"I love helping my customers, and providing excellent, unparalleled service that no other company could provide for them. We were able to do just about everything, from business card, to wedding invitations, to shipping a 100 piece fragile china set to New York. I am proud of this job, but I am ready to move on to working with my true passion: computers."
good,"UPS inside sales is a high stress environment, a lot of the job requirements are not listed in your job description, but are required of you to complete every week.  the overall job feels like a call center, high output calls required each day, customer service work, damages, claims, collections responsibility is put on the sales force to complete taking away from our selling time. the hours of 8-5 Monday to Friday work week is great, paid vacation and benefits.  the People that you meet here are some of the best I have ever meet. the job and environment in which we work is very much like elementary school. Commission is paid quarterly, Pay structure changes every year, but we don't know how we will be paid at the beginning of the year, we don't find out till mid year. First sales job I ever had that doesn't tell you how your commission works until have the year is over.   A lot of corporate training and certifications.  6 weeks of extensive training required, the training is some of the best training in Greenville for Sales."
good,Great atmosphere cool co workers slow and fast pace work depends on day and what you're receiving or shipping out different items going different locations
good,"My typical day at work would be helping customer face to face send packages, and shipment to different city and international, I would also handle questions over the phone regarding parcels and shipment and print jobs."
good,"Typical Day at work consisted of entering data into our system. Handling packages worth 250,000 making sure they reach correct destinations. Co-workers were fairly nice, I didn't really like the small pay. All in all I enjoyed the knowledge I gain, especially the data entry skills."
good,Working here let me taste working early morning shifts and helped me find out I rather work later hours than during the day. The graveyard shift works out better for me than a daytime shift.
good,best and worse job ive ever had all at same time great pay and great befints but they put you thru high water and takes all your passion for working outta of you
good,"Working at UPS is to work in a very fast-paced environment. The work may have a lull at times, but the work does not stop. Initially, I worked as a Loader, but was soon moved to a different section of the facility where I worked at a conveyor belt de-bagging tote bags sent from the trailers. To decide if the management is good or not depends on your perspective. Some supervisors are very likable people, others only seem to care about getting the job done w/o regard to the other workers. What I enjoyed most from the job was getting into great shape, and learning that my work ethic is amazing when applying what I've learned about working hard at UPS to other areas of my life."
good,The job takes a lot of hard work and as a manager you are required to fill in when employees are missing at work. Over all a good company to work for.
good,We drove around and delivered packages. I only had this job for a season so i do not believe that i can provide an accurate description of what this job entails.
good,"good job to start out at"
good,"UPS has a very high turn around rate due to the nature of the company and the way they treat employees. the pay is decent and the benefits are amazing if you can actually last a full year with them, otherwise its not the best place to work"
good,"good group of people. I start out by working on the driver logs, the the BOL and the delivery receipts, cash report, exception exception report and any rescan issues."
good,"There is no typical day, each day is different. You may do the same thing each day, but some of the trailers are not very good and are a mess."
good,"This is a very physical place to work, so if you are not in shape, look elsewhere. It was a challenge to me mentally and physically to stay as long as I did. Great company to work for, but my analogy was always that its like competing in a worlds strongest man competition, while running a marathon, while solving puzzles all at the same time. Its not for everybody, but if that's your thing, you will love it there."
good,"The long over the road trips took it""s toll on me and my family. I just needed to closer to my home so if my kids and wife needed me I could get to them."
good,UPS is a great place to promote within and have a good career. Learn how to develop your self and lead others. You can also use UPS to help pay for your college.
good,"Great place to work for additional cash."
good,Being able to learn and focus on task at hand and expand my work ethic to further broaden my horizons for the future. Finding ways to stay productive and stable.
good,"I was a seasonal worker that was in the process of transitioning into permanent full-time. In that process I was let go because I had to leave work early for my Autistic son who I had already given a heads up about. On top of being let go, prior to that actually, I was always asked by countless management to preform duties that were not mine to preform, (ie. Pushing containers by myself at least half the length of a football field, helping load other people's trucks then getting yelled at for my truck not being loaded....) I put up with it because I am a labor intensive preferred worker but I was never treated fairly there. In the warehouse anyways."
good,"A typical day includes managing employees, maintain corporate compliance, and meeting safety, service, and production standards. I have learned how to become an effective manager. Management is difficult at times but are committed to organizational objectives. Co-workers at the frontline supervisor level vary. Some are actively engaged and others are actively disengaged with the organization. The hardest part of the job is being able to adapt at a given moment within the allotted amount of time in an average work day. The most enjoyable part is the people. Employees, Co-workers, and management are all inside of the same building every day and each person has a role that contributes to the service UPS provides. If you don't collaborate, the structure of the organization wouldn't exist."
good,great place to work but don't offer enough hours good management and plenty room to excel as long as you stick it out
good,Sorted Packages in a assembly line according to zip code to appropriate conveyor belts. It was a seasonal position during the holiday season
good,"decent job, decent wages, I enjoyed working there for the most part. However their earn and learn benefit for employees is not what it should be."
good,"Overall good place to work. Staff was good."
good,always had a good day at work. i learned how to clean bathrooms. the management were terrible. They only thought of themselves and not the employees. the coworkers were great people.
good,"A typical day at work is sitting inside of the guard shack so I can keep an eye on the front gate.  When truck drivers pull up to the gate, I go out and log down all of the information needed such as the Container bring brought in and the containers being taken out.  I log that information into the system so that if any containers go missing, it can be retraced.  I also check in every car that goes out making sure they do not leave the site with any material from the warehouse.  I work at the shack alone but I do enjoy talking to the truck drivers and warehouse workers.  The hardest part of my job is the printers and tablets are down.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment."
good,"You are on your feet most of the day delivering packages and logging it into a DAID rain or shine, cold or warm days. The driver how i was working with was so helpful and was always there when i needed help."
good,if you are in school its a really good job you dont get alot of hours each week but you learn how to work fast loading trucks and unloading trucks its a good job
good,Just something that I did for a seasonal job. It does require a lot of movement and you really should be fit to work in this position. I am the opposite of fit and this job was very challenging for me. I would never work here again.
good,"This is a very good job for guys that are 18 to 22 , it can take a lot of out you if you are not lifting properly or bending properly."
good,I enjoyed being a Driver Helper. I did not enjoy having to deal with the human resources department or the union.  My co-workers were always pleasant and fun to talk to.
good,"job is great for anyone looking to grow and develop with the company. Fast-paced job required stamina, focus and composure to ensure packages were delivered in a timely manner."
good,Working at UPS was very hard. Being part time was a con to. I did not feel like I was getting paid what I should have been getting paid. UPS did have great workers and there wasn't nothing really fun about UPS
good,"Bad Management, Short Breaks, Flawed System.. The Environment Was Okay But I Wouldnt Recommend People To Work There But The Co-Workers Was Pretty Cool"
good,"I worked as a seasonal temporary for about a month. The pay was pretty good, Ten dollars an hour. You only got about 3-6 hours of work a night, depending on the volume of packages coming in. The management team is alright, they're just doing there jobs. If you can't keep up around the seasonal influx of packages don't expect to stay much longer."
good,"My position is in Pre-load. It is part-time, and you start at minimum wage. A pay increase is guaranteed per year, either from union or state minimum wage increase, but not both. There are benefits for medical and dental. After one year, you get a couple weeks of paid vacation. The union provides a buffer between workers and management."
good,Seniority overruled experience.  Compensation  was fine however it could have been better if I had more seniority.  Benefits were great.
good,While working here I was able to work on my security skills as well as communication skills. Also become familiar with daily reports.
good,fast paced and repetitive.It is a nice workout though if correct methods are used.Place for advancement but takes a long time.
good,"I had the best supervisors that i ever worked for, they made sure that your day went smooth everyday. I just didnt like the work hours, I wasn't getting enough work hours."
good,"This is just a seasonal positon that is needed during the holiday. You can work in the warehouse local to you and help sort packages and parcels and either load, unload, or relocate them. There is also another position which is a delivory man helper. this position is pretty easy, all you do is sit in the truck and drop off boxes to peoples houses."
good,"The typical day working with UPS is very stressful and hard to manage. When your working inside the warehouse it's a lot of people and you really can't tell who is who. You also, don't receive that many breaks either. Even though the pay is good I wouldn't say it is worth staying."
good,This job was a great one although only seasonal. Being at UPS was flexible with my schedule and went roughly from 7:30am until 5pm. The driver i worked for was very interesting and always polite with a gift for teaching skills about the job i was learning.
good,"Bei UPS geht es um schnelles arbeiten, da es accord-arbeit ist."
good,This job is very hard and physical. The thing with this job you have to maintain and come to work everyday with a focus mind set. I really would not recommend this job only if you were looking for something part-time.
good,"Besides the benefits at UPS, the fact that my job security was low and the sometimes shady job culture has made me think twice about working there but there are other positions that can benefit you in the long run if you are able to last that long"
good,"Great company to work for. Large company with lots of room for advancement. Due to the large workforce, you have an opportunity to work with a diverse and great group of employees."
good,This is the first job that I had with benefits and gave you a 401k and more. the crew that I work with is a great group of people that makes the work day go but fast.
good,Overall good place to work. Benefits are offered even for part time employees. If you put the time in there are many opportunities to advance in the company.
good,This job has a lot of benefits and even though it isn't for me I still recommend this job to others. Plenty of opportunity to move up in the business.
good,"Hours are early, but refreshing"
good,It has been too many years since I worked at this place. It was a temporary position. I liked the job. I loved the customer service part of the job; meeting new people and helping to pack and ship items was interesting.
good,"Real hard sweating job if you got the stamina good but dont forget about it, its gets better the longer you stay and the more you move up"
good,"The health benefits are really good, especially for part-time employees. The pay is decent, it can be ok or really pretty good depending on what your job title is. The work-life balance is terrible and so is the constant fluctuation of hours. It is hard to plan your life around this company and also to have a family life."
good,"The job is physically and mentally demanding. The shift only last for about 4 hours, but that 4 hours is moving at 100mph. By the end of the shift, you feel good about the results if you worked smart. The toughest part is maintaining your mental toughness at that high level from start to finish. That being said, the company offers a great compensation package."
good,working at ups showed me that i need to attend college and expand my education because working hard labor for the rest of your life is not a good idea.
good,My time at UPS was very good in terms of pushing my work ethic to limits I Found very beneficial. The people that work for this company are friendly and open to help.
good,"My review at ups, I didn't have enough hours, as I was told in the hiring process. my hours were 4 hours a day. the environment was fine. I enjoyed working with my cow workers. mangers were very helpful. it was a fun workplace just lacked on hours."
good,"It was a very dangerous job. When loading the trucks, speed was one's best friend or otherwise one could get buried alive from the the impending packages. Pretty much the same as a unloader, but observation is the key, packages of all varieties and dangers would arrive in these trucks. If one is not observant, injury or death could easily follow suit."
good,"You came at the floor and you started unloading the truck"
good,It was an alright seasonal job. Kind of hard to get your paycheck at times. Fast paced environment. At times we would have to wait there for hours without getting paid for it. The job was not hard.
good,"Working for UPS summs up like this. BUSY! But fun. You meet alot of great people and a great team atmostphere. The management is a bit of a joke. But the employee's are great here."
good,I received and data entered merchandise from the overnight delivery trucks as well as stock the storage room also the store sales floor.
good,"Great company, but way to easy to get lost in the grind, the management struggles to cover their responsibilites, the policy do more with less causes alot of unrealistic goals and the phrase there is no such thing as a day job applies to this company, the ability to balance a family and work is almost impossible with the demands of this operation"
good,"-Loading trucks"
good,"A typical day at UPS is busy, and very tiring. Co-workers are friendly  supportive and helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with jammed conveyor belts, broken machinery, Broken/ Heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is having break and leaving to go home at the end of the shift.    -.-"
good,"Supervise and manage loaders, send trailers to proper location, complete pre/post trip safety paperwork. Complete company goals and fill out constant paperwork."
good,"UPS has great employees with excellent work ethics, almost to a fault. They set the standard in the shipping industry, and they like to keep the bar high. UPS consistently outperforms competitors, but at a cost. I've seen a few people's health and relationships decline, and marriages fail at high positions in management, and even at a supervisor level. "
good,Great fast paced company. However the managers in our area lack in training and that reflects on the employees that they manage.
good,"I learned a lot from teaching myself the trade and putting into practice the lessons learned from mistakes and watching others.  However, as a non-commercial station there is a lot of wasted time and effort.  The boss ran over people and fired whoever he wanted whenever he wanted.  He was not accountable to anyone.  I enjoyed my time there and the people for the most part.  The benefits were great"
good,Can't fault anything about UPS other than the security of my job. Good place to work for! Quality staff & excellent leaders it's just a shame my time ended there!
good,A typical day at work is average for loading. Except during holidays it gets very hectic with very long hours and no breaks. Normal work hours none holiday season is 4 to 5 hours. So on a normal work week the most hours you'll see is no more than 25 hours.  During holidays it can be between 5 to 9 and you don't stop till everything is done. You may take bathroom breaks and water breaks. They encourage you to drink a lot water and are big on safety.  Management is not what you expect from a huge company like UPS. Its not very professional and lacks communication and everyone is only worried about their self.
good,"To the point work schedule  , vigorous multitasking , learned pecon and decon ,freight lingo , dispatching , appointment setting etc  .co workers  were enjoyable to work with . management was good at helping . hardest part of  the job was to many different views and no work ethic . the most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges and new learning experiences as well as keeping  the customers happy ."
good,"•	Work in a fast paced environment when loading and lifting packages 50lbs and above."
good,I did not know exactly what I had signed up for I was just trying to get some experience. I was physically not able to meet the companies standard in performance. It requires you to pay attention to the numbers and trucks that you have to load packages onto. I was burned out by the end of my shift. I learned that this job experience is not something I would want to do long-term. Management was pretty clear as to what each employer had to do. Co-workers were great helpers. The hardest part of this job was the weight of some packages that I had to take on. Some packages were over 50LBS. I was not able to keep up with the physical demands. I did not enjoy this job. My body broke down on the day they laid me off.
good,"It's a job that requires a lot of blood, sweat and tears, but they offer many great benefits and can provide extra opportunities if you work hard enough."
good,Learned how hard it was working in there. I didn't like it cause there wasn't that many hours. I also learned to depend on your co-workers.
good,good job a lot picking and packing lifting small package are very heavy and the big ones are light  that's the only thing you have to watch out for and always bow your nose to get that black stuff out
good,"UPS launched Access Point, a new creative way for customers to retrieve parcels at local retail outlets in residential neighborhoods.  Overall successful idea but incorporating 3rd party partners leaves large margin for errors and high drop out rates constantly changing venue locations which will ultimately frustrate consumers."
good,"UPS, wasn't a bad company by any means, its just management wasn't fair at times. We would get over loaded with work and packages would be every where and they'll want you to work through it so they totally dis-regarded our safety. Also the hub manger was very rude to workers he showed a total lack of respect and empathy for others."
good,"It was an awesome ride work for UPS. I've bad days just like many other individuals in any other work/task force, but I can honestly say there were definitely a lot of better days than bad"
good,the company provides employees with great benefits. I didn't like that with lifestyle changes such as having children they made it impossible for me to change my shift to a different shift.
good,fun place. at least it used to be till people left.  The company has gone done hill since.  It's a good job for young people looking to make extra cash.
good,"Management is a mess. A lot of disgruntled employees. Company trending downwards. Management being treated unfairly. A lot of potential for this company, but work needs to be done. Its a shame because you see what UPS could be, i.e. look at the company before they went public when they actually cared about their employees."
good,"when i started at united parcel services i was on early starts from 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock finish ,4 hour shifts within the 4 hours there was no break just consistently moving  packages to the correct post code . i leaned how to work under pressure and as part of a team the management wasn't greatest most of the time i needed help or something i couldn't find any management to assist me."
good,Glad I was able to leave UPS with a Pension after 36 years of service.  Overall it had its ups & downs throughout my time with the company.  I will not recommend young college graduates as their 1st job out of school - they will not have a work/life balance.
good,"Handle employee compliance, organize company records for FAA, OSHA and TSA compliance; train new employees on company procedures and protocol, create and maintain computer based files, data entry, heavy phones and in house communication, shipment tracking, prepare daily reports, knowledge of workplace safety regulations and procedure."
good,"I pretty much do the same thing everyday. My coworkers are cool people and I get along with mostly everyone. What I can say is hard sometimes is the load of packages, meaning how heavy the work load can be. The most enjoyable thing is that its an easy job."
good,"In my time spent with the company, I have benefited by gaining a vast knowledge of the freight industry and what it means to be an efficient leader. My position has led me to learn things that one would not originally expect upon initial hiring. Elements such as a knowledge of hazardous materials, performing audits and safety observations, and many others. Unfortunately I have decided to utilize these experiences else where due to the fact that I need to expand my options."
good,I learned a lot here as it relates to customer service and in office skills. I worked with some great people. Many no longer work for the company.
good,"learned how to work under pressure an in a timely manner.  "
good,"I would work day light to dark, long hard days , started out good pay great co workers, but towards the end of my summer break school would start again."
good,"Generally, UPS offers good part time work for college aged individuals looking to get into the workforce."
good,"Drivers' and training are good. My driver and supervisor was great."
good,"On an everyday basis, i stack boxes on an 18-wheeler. It is more of an repetitive job that requires a lot of your energy. The job itself was not hard it was just the constant moving that is really challenging"
good,"UPS-SCS  is a fast paced environment that keeps me on my toes.  A complex shipment at hand or workload requiring multi-tasking serves as an energizing force for me. Furthermore, it is always rewarding to see the end result in light of a successful release and customer satisfaction.  It is a very welcoming environment to work in exhibited in employees’ willingness to assist each other with projects or workloads. Furthermore, senior employees are open to share their knowledge and expertise with new / junior employees. Thus, if one is eager to learn one may do so by finding mentorship among the senior custom broker representatives."
good,"Working as a pre loader for ups is great experience, a typical day consists of loading packages on to or off trailers, theres a lot of room for advancement. The hardest part about working there is consistency of loading and unloading around christmas holiday seasons & the most enjoyable aspect of it is the overall experience."
good,The job pays very well starting off as a driver. The benefits package is also very good when starting. But I've realized over time that I have no time to enjoy my personal life and this thought caused me to become very unhappy with my self and my life. Which is why I am looking for a job that better suits the way I would like to live.
good,I was a package handler and loader. The job was OK for a part timer in school in which I was. I remember one night I had helped save an employees life after a major accident after work.
good,I worked during holidays which are very busy. The workers are half and half. Some being awesome like the driver I worked with and others are dead beats. The hardest part of the job is not driving the truck and not having music or a fun cab space.
good,"Working at UPS was a learning experience where I was given the opportunities to do more than what my original position intended."
good,"Arrive at 3 am normally get a radio, clipboard, all paperwork needed for the day and car placards. Next, I set up the belt according to the lineup i get from my supervisor or dispatch. Then i set up the white board at the bottom of the belt with all the information that the employees need such as safe work days, the safety tip of the day, misloads for the previous day, and any tips i have for the loaders. I make sure the belt is working properly and all resets are pushed in and ready to go. Once all my employees arrive at the bottom of my belt i have a quick 3 minute meeting with them letting them know everything on the white board and what is in store for the day ahead as well. After the meeting i set each employee in their pulls for the day and the belt starts and the day has begun and goes non stop for usually 4 hours. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the union at times as well as when s dispatcher makes a mistake and I have to many packages coming for one truck and it creates an issue on the belt and eventually frustrates the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is right when the sort is finished because it is a great feeling after you absolutely kill a sort and have no misloads! As the employees are loading the trucks i go in and out of the with a scanner scanning packages for misloads and letting the employees know if they have any or not. Once the sort is complete and my employees all leave then I have to complete my paperwork as a part time supervisor."
good,"Slow days but fun. Learn a lot. Management is ok "
good,"I was on call and told the specific time and place to meet my driver. They had taught me how to use the remote equipment that was given to scan each package. Managers and supervisors often helped deliver packages. I never had any trouble with my co-workers, they were all very helpful with the deliveries and specifying of how and where to put the packages. The most difficult part was maintaining balance with some packages that were heavy. Overall I enjoyed the hard work and steady pace of the entire job."
good,A typical day at work consisted of delivering pizzas and washing dishes between orders. Co workers often got into conflicts with each other bringing down overall morale. The most enjoyable part of the job was going out on deliveries and the hardest part of the job was prepping food (with no training or exp.) Management was not very organized or approachable.
good,"Very strenuous work sorting, marking, and loading packages into delivery trucks, as well as helping in other areas as business needs call for it."
good,"I was told if i got my class a cdl that they would find a driving position for me. so over the course of six months i got everything i needed and when it came to them hiring me they were only going to offer me  a part time job. not a bad company to work for but they dont honor their word,which means everything to me."
good,"My current position consists of arriving to work at 3:30am, loading and unloading extremely heavy packages. I've learned to work independently as UPS is a relatively free work environment. Management is fine, usually only become intrusive when working too slow or unsafely. Coworkers are generally friendly always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the day is to keep a fast pace when the work tends to speed up. Kind of like 6 hours of exercise. Overall the best part of the job is knowing you've had a challenging but very productive day.Pre"
good,"UPS is was unorganized, yet I learned a lot. Co-workers were friendly. The harderst part of the job is that it is a lot to do with a short amount of time to complete it. The most enjoyable part of job is that the co-workers their were friendly and helpful. The management was mediocre it could have been better."
good,"At UPS i was a package handler. my shift would be in between 4 to 6 hours. ups is a physical job and challenging at times but thats what i like in my jobs , so it can test my skill."
good,"A typical day at work would be long and very tiring. What I learned while working for UPS was that the pay was good but the hours they provided weren't. All of my managers were pretty cool and understanding and actually wanted me to stay for longer than I did working there. My co-workers were fine too, they enjoyed helping me get used to the ropes. I have to say the hardest part of the job was having to move bulk items by myself, the most enjoyable part of the job was everyone willing to help me with anything that I needed, that made me feel better each day."
good,"I would arrive at work and open up the store for the day. I learned that UPS has great benefits but terrible management. My co-workers never did the work assigned to them, they would goof around and procrastinate everything. The hardest part of the job was doing other people's work. I enjoyed the location the most."
good,"Set the plan, execute the plan and coach to success.  Hardest part of my job is at the moment i am not challenged.  I love when its busy."
good,Fast paced productive reputation. I was treated with respect. I enjoyed this part time entry level position with the hopes of having a second part time job in the future.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of organizing and packing semi trucks. Management was great as well as co workers."
good,"Great Place to work Sorted first class mail, routed large boxes to correct location to ensure timely delivery  to receiver."
good,cold harsh long hours with little breaks which really was a hindrance management was a bunch of power hungry idiots. Coworkers weree descent thats all
good,"Meetings, very fast pace you quickly and safely..Like a bag of apples not all are going to be sweet...Heat is the must hardest to deal with...Receiving my paycheck that I earn"
good,"It was not a hard job to be a driver's assistant but there are not enough hours available and I understand why so many people are hired at one time, large turn-over rate..."
good,This company is a good first job as the pay is low and you are only part-time at first. It is a good first because you can easily work at UPS and still attend school. However the work culture is horrible it is an environment that is very combative (management vs. employees/union). It is job where advancement takes a long time. It is a hard job physically but when you are done with work you felt like you really did something.
good,"UPS is a great company to work for. The pay and benefits are more than worth it for the job that I was doing delivering packages. The co-workers are great, and the management knows the ins and outs of what the employees go through every day, because they have the same experience."
good,The biggest negative for me was when I had to work at two different store locations only because I prefer to stay at one place.
good,"Co-workers were great to work with, very helpful.  Management was a joke.  They have a hard time answering performance based questions and demands are unrealistic.  I was hired as a full time driver but was set up to fail from the get go, on site management had some one else in mind (nepotism)."
