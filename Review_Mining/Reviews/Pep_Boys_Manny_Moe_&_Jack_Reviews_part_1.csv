rating,review
bad,They over charge the Customer big time . Tecks are not trained . Just not a good place to work at all . They also change  passwords to the Computer and didn't tell me for my Sunday shift then manger will not answer there phones.  So there for wasn't able to do business that Sunday.
bad,They tell lies about raises and never follow thru. I stayed there years waiting. District manager changes every 6 months and the new one doesn't know what the last one promised
bad,Only care of charging customers more and not pay employees. Pep boys cares only for themselves not the staff. No good benefits at all. I just felt like we are just replaceable at any time.
bad,Not the best job I’ve had at all. Glad I left because it took a toll on me mentally and physically. It’s retail so it’s a draining job. Not exactly a job to live off either.
bad,"Under paid, unappreciated, work is typically not fairly applied to all. No recognition for tasks performed without supervision. Hours are not equally applied to all."
bad,"I absolutely hated working for this company. The pay was very low for the job positions. District managers had no idea how to properly manage a team, they would have conference calls and just yell at you for not meeting unrealistic quotas."
bad,Not good  not honest  they do things behind the employees back  very shady company  stay clear of the DM  never will tell you truth  I learned the hard way
bad,Its not a good job they treat you terrible they dont do as they say i was sick one day and they still told me they care about money more then people’s health
bad,"No work,pay flat rate and no work no pay and expect you to stay all day and work 7 days a week"
bad,At the time management and director didn’t care about employees.  2-3 employees usually running one location and no motivation. No team work the pay was horrible for all those hours. It was difficult just to take a day off or vacation time.
bad,"A typical day at work is horrible, makes you feel terrible. Your boss has a bad attitude. The company hates it's employees. Your boss hates you. Nobody gives a darn. It makes you vomit."
bad,"The Manchester store has terrible management. They sell jobs to workers ,they would rather be on smoke break then do there job, they do not distribute work fairly or equally. The store has so much potential but the management team not only doesn’t know cars, they don’t know how to utilize a master tech for there whole shift."
bad,Theres poor management. Area director plays cut throat and doesnt care about your health or safety. Only cares about the numbers. If theres something you dont like whats happening dont bother talking to manager or anyone. They will laugh at you and demote you. Not worth your time.
bad,El mánager es un pesado no tiene modales para tratar bien a las personas se la pasa solo chequeandote y te estresa y te acosa
bad,I will never recommend anyone to get the vehicles serviced at that particulare PepBoys Store. They have incorrigible horrible service team working at that particular PepBoys shop. Do Not Go There. Very Poor service. They nearly destroyed my engine to my vehicle recently.
bad,Poor management Raises were never good if they bumped up starting wage everyone above it got no raise favoritism all throughout the building management if they didn’t  like you would get rid of you. Overall not a great place to work.
bad,"Not enough flat rate hours to go around. 3 locations within 5 to 8 miles. Broomall, haverford and havertown. No alignment rack, only alignment stands. 1 garage door shop. Small, not enough inventory for parts for the job, almost always waiting on parts."
bad,"This here is a bad location to work at, company policy being broken, there has been favors going on at this location for the company. Bad management and bad staff would not recommend buying anything commercial in the Bensalem location."
bad,"This job was terrible, the managers were bitter, and nothing went according to plan due to mismanagement or incompetence.  If you plan on working for this company, do it as a last resort, and immediately start looking for another job once you get hired."
bad,"Nothing to say.tha is it.the company sucks...."
bad,"Unhappy with my boss doing his job and he didnt take care of his responsibility  as a manager her lies to customers and  very rude.  Unhelpful didn't want me to advances as a service writer  ask questions(a as next to impossible I e would tell at me)  as a woman in this job I felt leaving was best for my mental health .  "
bad,underpaid and understaffed.you never get any help.this is more of an entry level position.long hours and not.only way to move up in this company this was my second time working for this company I Won't Go Back
bad,This environment was very unfriendly and unpleasant to low wages employees upper management was horrible I seen people hire and fire the next day because they wasn’t like by management the behavior of this is the reason why we have a Trump in office this behavior is very disrespectful to low wages workers
bad,"they literally hire whatever walks through the door and is breathing. experience or not. the last manager i worked for used to spend his time sleeping in the break room, then would just come out to smoke or yell and tell you how he does things.... or tell you the same story about sprint car racing."
bad,They care NOTHING about their employees.  You are just an expendable number to them. The can't even make their budget every day qhich means YOU dont make any money...... steer clear...
bad,"The company doesn’t care about people or employees, I worked 3 years without givin the opportunity to use my pto, upper management told me to screw people over, whenever there was a customer problem the area director would go hide in a different store and put the blame on some one else. Overall pepboys sucks."
bad,"No one does their job, but expecting others to do theirs. ""Unfair treatment"" is a everyday thing when you're there. If you have any concerns they say ""keep your personal thoughts and feelings to yourself"". Honestly I would not recommend working there at all. But thats just my opinion."
bad,Everything sucks about pepboys! There staff! Wages!! Supervisor sleepingwith employees! A lot of drama and a lot of favoritism. People don’t show up to work on Sunday’s! There is a lot of call off so you have to work over time!
bad,"Management had zero support.  Mechanics were untrained.  Every day involved a conference call from an area manager encouraging us to sell everything possible.  In for an oil change? You get a list of every possible thing wrong with your car and a huge estimate, broken or not."
bad,Service Manager bad ..... hard to make money when u can’t stay fully staffed .... overall not good ... can’t keep help ... don’t pay for good staffing .. open to many hours ...
bad,"I worked for pep boys prior to them being bought by Auto Plus. At the time i worked there, there was a lack of spuervision and direction thorughout the entire store. Also faulty equipment was forced to be used which resulted in my termination."
bad,Management is chaos. Assist manager thinks she runs the world. And favors one tech. And upper Management cant see that one guy makes 96 hours and yhe others make 40. Yheyre too stupid to realize rhat he gets fed like a cow
bad,"At the start of the shift, the supervisor and lead hardly greeted us. This made me feel unappreciated. There was no hype, no good morning, and no recongnition. Supervisor had his group of girls who he favored and that I noticed in my first week. When I addressed a situation to the supervisor nothing was done. However, if one of his favoites spoke up then something was done. I was a part-time employee here due to school. When I asked for a schedule change the supervisor tried to do anything in his power for this to not happen. He lied to me and said that HR had denied my schedule change. When I went to speak to HR about it, HR said they barely received my request for my schedule change. This was very unprofessional of the supervisor. This was not the last time the supervisor lied to get things done his way. On my last day, the supervisor called me into his office and raised his voice at me. This was the final straw for me. I have never worked for a company that was as unprofessional as Pep Boys. Unless you are willing to kiss up to the supervisor then, I do not recommend for anyone to work here."
bad,Very very very slow. Terrible work for flat rate pay. Never again will I work here or for flat rate pay. Manager let's people get away with things they definitely shouldn't
bad,"If you have the right store management it can be a good place to work and good pay. If you have a bad store manager like I did it will be a very difficult job. Worked 65-70 hour weeks due to lack of staff. Harassing, abusive, and unprofessional by store management was given a free pass from Regional management. Be advised you will work every holiday which  I expected. Easter is a waste of time for the stores to be open."
bad,A typical day could be taking inventory or putting up the truck that just came in. Hardest part of the job was management wanting everything done at one time.
bad,"as a flat rate tech you should have pleny of work but not here. they say well we will give you say 28 dollars a hour, but then they leave out that is only on less then 5 percent of their work, so for 95 percent of their work they give you you will get a flat 5 dollars for work. your hourly wage also goes down to like 8 dollars a hour if you can not force the cusmers to come in and buy stuff."
bad,Worst job ever no work life balance managers work 60 to 70 hours per week. No upper management support takes for ever to get equipment fixed. Can't get parts delivered
bad,I wouldn't go back to work there if it was the only job hiring around the district manager was absolutely awful and treated the employees like we were all incompetent and would scream and yell at almost every employee she would trash talk a lot of the other stores while in the conference call meetings all around awful company
bad,Wasn’t really happy with this job as a auto technician the job was extremely slow so you always had to find something productive to do even if ther isn’t anything
bad,Pepboys was okay at first but then the manager started to give me 40+ hours a week at part time pay. Was working there for almost 3 years yet never got a promotion or pay raise but other people who were close to the manager and who rarely lifted a finger or did their share of work did get promoted or had a pay raise.
bad,"First 2 neighbors and  I have worked for pepboys We all started at minimum wage + commission At different times. Agreed upon taking the job with them. Coming from another shop that closed  I knew how it worked or should have worked. Well as a trainee I didn't pay attention much attention to the customers I serviced and if something was sold by me how much my commission would be, because I was always taught customers come first and the rewards will follow. now I'M starting my next six months. Training over My outlook for a better paycheck started to take place selling what ever wasn't tied down.So on two occasions  in the same week i sold over 1500 dollars each tires and other repairs.Those sales would have put almost 300 in my pocket alone. well come paycheck time I don't see the sales. here an employee who knows the system would cancel the ticket and rewrite it under his name or change a big item tickets usually by talking to the customer and telling them he has a better deal for them. Taking away from my commission. when I said something to the Manager (he is salary) he said ok I'll take care of it. whats your employee number and gave me everything he sold that day. Which was more than I would have made.But SAID nothing to the bad employee."
bad,"Upper management was not willing to give you training, I had asked several times since the person who had my position before me was sent out of state for training if I could also and I was tond no, we don't do that here"
bad,"You can do everything right, be one of the top sellers in your area, and they'll still never promote you. "
bad,"Terrible management, would not recommend due to the lack of motivation for people seeking a full time job. Management will move around quite a bit. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
bad,Never work here. To much gossip and very racist towards white people. There are no insensitive to work harder. the medical and dental health care is horrible. basically have to pay anything under a 100 dollars.
bad,Use to be a good and fun place to work it change for the worst. Discount tires centers is way better. They just used me for my knoledge and hard work.
bad,"In part it was the worst job I've had. the manager made my life miserable and I left as soon as I got a chance. Would not recommend this place to anyone, they don't care for their employees."
bad,"Short and sweet:"
bad,"Didn't feel I was properly trained for my role. Store manager kept leaving early in the middle of his shifts, kept distracting other co-workers while helping customers. Intentionally cut back a certain employees hours if they didn't come in due to school."
bad,I witnessed a total lack of concern for others in the workplace!!! Th place was understaffed and the expectations were unbelievable with the staff! I was an extraordinary mechanic and despite these facts the manager was rude and unappreciative!!!
bad,"Horrible place to work. It was just blah, if you are female, you will be looked down on by your male coworkers and customers. Customers will tell you they don't need help but will go ask your male coworker for help."
bad,Not a good job who wants to woek with car parts all day and must of the products are rusty and and the products have mold on and they still make u work in the mold
bad,"stressful company to work for. They leave you with all the responsibilities then expect you to do the job to the fullest with mistakes. they promote you then don't pay you for the work. the HR does not even listen to your side of the story, just only assumes you are wrong and gives you a choice on your job, and you have done everything right. you don't get lunches. and you get told you have to work 13 hours because of no coverage!!!!"
bad,"It use to be a great company , I wouldn't let anyone I know work there  it's all about them . The company are the same make them money and that is it you and your family dont matter. I learn how to do it all myself because there was no help."
bad,Do not have a clue on how to operate retail and service operations.  Not a clue.  Changes like the weather.  Too many changes in primary focus.  This week one thing and next week another.
bad,"This company doesn't care about how are you work, whether you are extremely short handed or not or how well you do on you sales. If you are seen as a threat or is deemed a threat by other you will be fired. And if you are a female they will use you as an escape goat to get ride of you if you do not fall to your knees. I would never recommend this company to work for."
bad,This company has very poor supervisory practices. Depending on the mood your supervisor is in determines your stay as an employee. Stay away. Not good
bad,"Horrible business model, you advance by back-stabbing your co-workers.  The service manager told a lie every other sentence.  The district manager was unreachable.  The commission pay leaves a Tech A making about $8 an hour because management has to over-price procedures in spite of ASE book-rates.  Up-selling was done counter-productively.  I literally watched business shrink over a few weeks.  The car work involves unethical practices promoted by management."
bad,Company has no support team in place to help you as a manger to solve problems. You are on your own!! Understaffed was an issue and area director will not help you even though they say they will. There is no training . Only training is self learn on the fly. Out of all the Corp I worked for this by far has been the worse in my career.. good luck
bad,"I've been working for this establishment for a year and a half now and it is very dreadful. Not only that but everything that I've ever learned was either self taught, or by learning in a very stressful environment. This place is a joke and full of false promises. As well as managers who do not like to work. Currently there is a manager who has not been in for nearly a month because of ""workers compensation"" and the store is active through new experienced individuals."
bad,I don't even know why you asking about this I hated that company and would never work there again. They treat their employees horribly and I'm not going talk about this again. You want this information then go with there and experience it yourself.
bad,I hired in under minimum wage plus commission on anything I wrote. The pay system changed to commission paid only after achieving an unreachable goal.
bad,"Pep Boys is an ""Okay"" place to work. "
bad,"Just say no to working for pep boys. This was the worst job EVER!! the management has recently became a nightmare and I have watched people drop like flies as a result. No wonder they are hiring a the time of this review, THEY ARE AWFUL TO WORK FOR!!!"
bad,Worked for over 20 years. I was under paid over work with no help. They try to save money so they make you work the job of 5 employee's. They don't care about the employee's. Worked for 20 yrs once I got tired got a better job no one I mean no from higher level or HR did not even said good bye... guess I did want to be use anymore. Stay away from this Company they will under pay you while higher manager's get all the pay.
bad,"This is without a single doubt the worst company to work for.Their so called benefits are terrible,there is no chance of advancement and the management is the worst I've experienced in over 20 years of warehousing.They set unreachable production standards and if you don't meet them they fire you.There is no cost of living raises so basically your pay stays the same forever.The worst thing about this company is the act like they own you,and that your life evolves around them.They require you to work on Sundays which most times half the workers don't show up and yet they keep their jobs.Favoritism is rampant throughout this warehousealong with the simple fact that management could care less about you.Oh by the way you don't get the holidays off.This past Easter Sunday I worked 16 hours at regular pay because three quarters of the shift didn't show up.The only difference between Pep Boys and slavery is they pay you.I wouldn't recommend anyone working for this company."
bad,"Stagnant sales program led by insecurity, an inability to adjust to changing conditions, and incapable of establishing a long term vision --this is a company to stay away from until mid and upper management is willing to make the personnel changes required for future growth. Long term systemic cultural issues plague this once dynamic company. Try Napa, Autozone, Advance Auto or Federated Auto parts for a future.... there is none at Pep Boys."
bad,"You won't last long there because you will burn out quickly. They hate employees and do not treat them like humans, they treat them like animals. A typical day at work, open the till,check customer comlaints, get a call from district manager and get threatened to loose your job if you don't tow the line. The hardest part of the job is trying not to quit that day.Believe me you will hate it here."
bad,Manager is one of the laziest people in the entire store. Will come into work when he feels like it and just causes a stressful environment for everyone when he is there. Acts like a child 90% of the time and the other 10% he acts like a hardass for no reason.
bad,Poor management and hostile environment. Management does not care about the hostility and never assume responsibility. Very unorganized and just a filthy place to work at.
bad,"Didnt like working there. i didnt like the pay, or management. alot of hours low pay. always slow no work we got paid paid book time, my pay checks were always low."
bad,"I got very little hours, pay was next to nothing, my raises I got was 10 cents. This company is a joke. The store manager acted like a dictator. Do yourself a favor and don't work here."
bad,It was a horrible place to be I never want to step foot back in that store ever again in my life. And if your the new guy you will close every night and have no weekends off.
bad,Manager at hiring location does not respect the time of applicants. Recruiting department stressed the importance of professional appearance and punctuality. Staff on site looked poorly kept. I left the premises after waiting 45 minutes past scheduled interview time.
bad,It is the worst place that you could work because of the environment not enough jobs to go around for the amount off employees they had and a hostile work place
bad,Work for this company for several years..did work no one else wanted to do or could not do..some of the managers lack in automotive knowledge and some pretend they know it all..okay whatever..the business really needs an overhaul if it wants to stay in this industry..alot really need to be looked at under a microscope from management all the down to the lube tech..just my opinion.
bad,"I can in with relatively little experience, this was known when I walked through the door, I have done vehicle maintenance as a hobby before but not much else. They claimed they would train me, instead got frustrated when I didn't know how to do something and then transferred me to another store to make someone else train me, who in turn got frustrated about being saddled with me and transferred me again to a store 50 miles away out of the county. I didn't make enough to cover the gas to work there so I was forced to quit."
bad,"I was a manager of Service, the absolute worst work environment you could possibly imagine.  I cannot believe anyone would take their vehicle to get work done."
bad,"Promise training by management but never got any. pay isn't good either, they'll start you off at minimum wage, promise a raise in 4 months but then they'll tell you to ask again in 4 months."
bad,"They take away your life and you become a Pep Boys slave. Do not care if you have a family and most important are the broken promises that will happen time and time again, until you are either fired or quite."
bad,You would think area management would applaud the hardest working employees. No they pester and belittle them. Pay isn’t worth everything you want your to do. Hard to hire people and very hard to work there. Long hours and very little time off. The balance between life and work is out the door. I loved working there before things started to change
bad,"Management does not know how to manage, payroll does not know how to correct errors and deal with employee complaints. Took two weeks to past due to give me my checks and then told me i had to pay them back. Always told me i would advance quickly but then decided that there just weren't any positions open like they said."
bad,Hours were bad. Most people were rude. No room  for advancement. Had to go to other Building to pick orders for a few hours. Go back to Building I worked in and we had to catch up on our work.
bad,"It was a great place to work until AP management took over. Rude, and very arrogant people. They have no respect for hard working people . All they care about are numbers ."
bad,"Very dirty and unorganized, work is not tracked correctly, sometimes underpaying work done, lots of oil spilled everywhere and tools in disrepair. Lots of opportunities to get hurt or slip and fall. Facilities are extremely dirty."
bad,Terrible work environment. Low pay. Huge turnover. Clueless management. Poor attitudes of employees. Worst place I've ever worked. Do not recommend this company.
bad,Skills were underutilized. Not a salubrious environment  (dust and dirt everywhere) and I worked in a cubicle! Unprofessionalism proliferates throughout entire corporate culture. Unwanted advances and touching made me leave.
bad,grab parts off shelf and deliver to shops and to make the shop owner sign the papers and to drive carefully though the streets and make it back to get another delivery
bad,"Very little room to advance. Service advisors have very little or NO knowledge of how a vehicle works or how to explain things to customers. Job is very stressful with poor pay. PTO takes forever to accrue and when you do get PTO it’s not much at all. New pay system in place where technicians get paid $5 for an oil change, $3 for a rotation and $5 for a battery. The company is trying to drive technicians out of this place and it will just be a quick lane oil change company very soon. Get your ASEs and get out."
bad,"STAY AWAY! If you like working like a dog, yelled, talked to like an idiot, or have no ambition, living on peanuts, then work at Pep Boys Bear. Lazy, unprofessional​, drugie, useless managers, low pay, for hard workers, high pay for managers friends, favorites. No advancement, no Future, use them like they use you as a stop gap to a better job. There is nowhere but up to go working for Pep Boys Bear. Watch out for lazy long-term favorites stabbing you in the back, or setting you up to look good, and stealing the credit for your hard work. Corporate should take a closer look at this store. I can't believe all stores are like this, and if they are Pep Boys should go out of business."
bad,Very fast paced work environment. Not enough time off. Worked every single holiday and weekend. Never had time to spend with family or friends. Customers cut your throat.
bad,i worked at pep boys for a couple of years they would make us work over time and not pay us for it  which lead to legal problems which lead to me finding a different job
bad,"Management is slow paced,parts are marked up 300 % when bought outside which is crazy, mediocrity is company policy, I was top tech in the complete market area and couldn't turn 40 hrs a week,left and turned 45 in a 4 day week ,there number oriented and don't want to throw numbers way off for obvious reasons, have to cater to district manager daily ,change rules daily,they need to get out of automobile repair completely ,don't go there ,they can't keep people for a reason ,company horrible"
bad,"to many managers     i would never work there again, because of how you are treated and they never let you have a day off that you want , they make you work every sunday"
bad,"I would not recommend this job to any who has ambition because this place doesn't care about the working employees that makes the money for this company. All the profits go to the higher ups, while you'll be slaving and you check not reflecting all the hard work on your body."
bad,Job was awful the work enviroment was terrible. When its cold there is no heat in the shop. Half the machines dont work. Theres a dozen of safety violations. The managers could care less about employees.
bad,The area directors are very shady. The company expects way to much from employees they pay min. wage. Business model changes often as there is no consistent CEO or owner for that matter.
bad,Commack Store is horrible understaffed not enough training and causeing fellow inexperienced employees to give wrong parts.management is a joke just sit around and collect a paycheck.Working at pepboys in Commack made me realize how much better my job before this was.If you like. Circuses then definitely work in Commack Store.
bad,"Every dept work against each other no harmony between them.Every Manager wants to just sit back and play in the office while associates are on the floor dealing with guests and busting their behinds.Managers from top to bottom want to make it seem like it's all about them when it should be about the store,it's customers and the working environment.Autoplus(company that brought pepboys)have no idea how to run a commercial program and their employees feel like they can walk all over pepboys associates.Autoplus employees and pepboys managers(from store to area director)feel like their entitled to the world and are all full of themselves."
bad,The upper management does not care about anyone but themselves. they don't give benefits and they pay everyone the same rate and never give raises or even help their employees.
bad,"From upper management to the store level this company has very, very poor leadership. All levels of management do not have a clue on how to be successful leaders. I wouldn't recommend anyone attempt to work in this type of environment. It would be a waste of your time. They do not have a clue about what customer service should be, not even close."
bad,"My best advice is don’t work for that company and if you do, don’t get stuck because you won’t be recognized unless you brown nose the big boss (DM)."
bad,Since I have nothing good to say about this place I have no intention of even describing things that hey need to improve to make the place worth even considering.
bad,They fired me with out a cause due to the fact a lady hit me in the company truck and I sued her for pain and suffering and the intern fired me because of it very unfair.
bad,Management sucks whole company is garbage I never felt so degraded they made me feel like I didn't matter gave me no tools to help me grow myself or the company
bad,Upper management doesnt do much. Leaves most of the work to junior management even when its something that junior management doesnt know about. Often reprimanded for doimg something wrong when associates werent taught the right way to begin with.
bad,work day busy .. learned more customer service ... management was really poor ..lots of politics ... hardest part doing everyone elses job ...best going home
bad,"Pep boys was my first automotive job and it taught me a lot about taking care of my personal car, it also showed me what not to do in stressful situations."
bad,"Fast paced , heavy lifting , no help from upper management . Belittles female workers. Would not reccomend anyone to work there of have a car fixed there."
bad,The constant ever changing plans of the company not only make the job frustrating but very annoying. Supposed managers never know the full picture of how things are run in a store and are constantly changing things around
bad,I would never recommend working at Pep Boys if you have a clear conscience and morals they definitely rip you off their all their prices are overpaid and overrated.
bad,"Worked at second busiest Pep Boys in nation. "
bad,With my brief time there upper management did not know how to operate store. Divison manager made unkept promises. Inventory tracking was horrible. Would not recommend.
bad,"This is one of worst job I've ever had. My manager Roy showed a lot of favoritism on one worker and  treat everyone different. A lot of work with little pay. Schedule is sucks and varies hours during the week and weekends. This company would be good if that manager Roy is gone. I've seen some dirty work from there like break things to make customers coming back there again. As for me, I takes time to fix up and being honest. I feel bad for people who brought their cars there. This place don't offer advance in the future. Pay is flat rate and will be the same no raise. Not worth it. Stay away from this place."
bad,Abysmal management and time scheduling. The co-workers were always good people. Lunch breaks were always a decent length and got a fair amount of breaks.
bad,This is a dishonest place of business. I was forced to lie to customers about what their needs were for their cars. I eventually quit because of the horrible work environment.
bad,"Its all a joke, they make promises left and right and never fall through.. They steal money from you if you dont pay attention to your paychecks. The management from top to bottom have no care what so ever, the HR department is no help at all.."
bad,Management does not care for employee's well being would not recommend going there for service as costs are marked up higher than most other shops. 10/10 would not recommend
bad,I hated this job. very unorganized company the job sucked. My co workers barely did any work and I often found my self up n front of the store all by myself
bad,"Not enough hours to support a family. The company was better to work for before we were bought out a year ago. Benefits went up."
bad,"I've work there for eight years, there no advancement, not good place to work if you are try to claim corporate latter, manager were unfair and had their favorites and only give other horrible work order and repair."
bad,"If you're thinking about applying here, IT ISN'T WORTH IT. The pay is terrible along with the working conditions and management. Both of the managers think they know a thing or two about cars, but they sincerely don't. Was really irked that we had to follow work orders down to the fine print on the document and we couldn't challenge them if it was incorrect or unethical. "
bad,To much work for what you get paid. The people are very nice to work with but management is what makes it hard to be productive. I would not want to work here again.
bad,Very poor and unorganized management and they didn't know you but by your employee Id. They were all about the profit and not about how it affects the current employees. I don't work there anymore but still only 1 mechanic to 1 shop of 10 bays
bad,"I was only there for a short time and the structure of the leadership was not set as standard retailers. LP seem to be controlling operations, would not be a company I would recommend"
bad,"no work, old equipment, managers didn't care about employees, or work conditions. corporate ran business employees don't matter. all about sales not work."
bad,"Management has no idea what he's doing. He's very rude and caused more stress then needed. Always blames everything on a ""missunderstanding"" I'd never refer someone to work here again."
bad,"Minimum wage 12 hour job, promises of promotion without follow through, high turn over rate of ALL employee positions, bad customer reviews, employees lack experience for current job positions, corporate set goals very unrealistic, and even if there is no vehicle in the service bays, please keep your eye protection on because we all know how those pesky fingers of yours will just randomly poke you in the eye."
bad,"Horrible company, which is why it got sold. Management doesn't know what they are doing and employees are under paid.  I was a  found mice droppings around food. Employees got sick (possible from droppings or dust). The District Manager and Service Managers are horrible. Customers complaints were through the roof and they ripe people off. I saw at the Service Manager sale a service and the tech never did it. Horrible place for employment and doing business."
bad,dont go there not good company to progress im surprised there still opened.To much work for not a good pay it suck need to give up the older employees so new ones can get a better pay not fair
bad,"If you are a tech that has even the slightest bit of knowledge, there is better places to work.. you will work 6 plus days a week and get paid scraps. You will go thousands of dollars in debt just acquiring the tools needed for the job, that is if you don't own them already. Management will sell jobs and expect you to have the tools, and if you don't they will expect you to buy it... the pay breaks down like this.. of they sell a 300.00 brake job, you make 10%-14% of that based on your qualifications... this company is a joke. Plain and simple stay away"
bad,Sucks  not worth the stress makes you  feel like quiting just a job to say you have a job for probation or for fressh out school looking for work
bad,Any company that pays technicians 8.00 hr. +comm.  and advertises ASE cert techs and has none because a ASE tech.wouldn't give them the time of day is a joke. The only thing this company cares about is profit . They have no scruples and absolutely do not care about their customers and even less about their managers and techs. Don't waste your time working there or having work done there
bad,Minimal pay high expectation and no room for advancement. Long hours worked 7 days straight 12 hours a day because the store could not keep a proper service manger.
bad,"By far the worst ""Automotive"" company ever. They claim to be a full service automotive company, they can't even supply basic full vehicle diagnostic scanners. They are a very greedy company, they only care how much money they can dupe from people. They will over work you, make promises they can't keep. The company's mentality is to just replace parts and hope that it fixes it. They have no loyalty towards good hard working techs or managers. They're pretty much paid slave labour. Stay away from any and all Just Brakes!!"
bad,"Pep Boys in Oklahoma was one of the worst places I have ever worked. That is saying something since I have worked at over 20 different companies. They have horrible pay, poor management, even worse corporate employees, long shifts, no time for your family, no job security, no opportunity for advancing, and hire bodies to fill slots not qualified technicians or customer service staff."
bad,"After a very short time at Just Brakes, I learned they do NOT care about anything but making the most money from each and every customer, OVERSELLING is the moto. As the manager, I received no support from upper management. No lunch breaks but instead being asked to punch out and continue doing the job. I worked 2 weeks SOLID without a day off, 12+ hours a day. I had no previous experience in doing an inventory (at the end of every month), when I asked for help, I was told that it would be coming. Instead, I was berated and told that they could take a person from McDonalds to show them in 5 minutes how to do it. Now I agree that the inventory was not that difficult to do but when combined with all the duties of the manager, helping customers who came in, helping the inexperienced mechanics not only diagnose vehicles but showing them how to use common equipment in the shop, it becomes very difficult."
bad,"Expected to work 6 days a week for almost minimum wage. Getting a day off is a blessing. If you dont want to be around your family and enjoy working for a disorganized company, then this job is for you. Middle management changes faster than the seasons. Bonus numbers are set to unattainable targets. Constant threatening of being fired. Disrespectful management. Dont waste your time."
bad,"The days here at my previous location were very frantic, like the staff felt overwhelmed like a chicken without its head. If you ever made a mistake instead of your coworkers telling you in the moment what you did wrong and try to help you, they would rather wait till it has become a issue and throw you under the bus and still not correct you or properly train you. What can I say my time here was incredibly stressful, I was very intimidated by my store manager she was very cold and unapproachable at times and if you ask for help she seemed to have an attitude and would make you feel stupid for asking for help, it was a very very very unprofessional work environment. From staff refusing to help customers to the absolute no teamwork feel, everyone walked around half the time with a chip on their shoulders, not to mention the inside theft, some of the employees engaging inappropriate relationships with each other, employees taking very long breaks without clocking out, randomly changing the schedule and not letting employees know, giving customers attitudes and refusing to help them when there was a problem, the list goes on and on. Never have I worked in a place as crazy and unprofessional as Pep Boys, it was literally a mad house, I just cannot believe I was able to mange working there for so long."
bad,"Very hard to flag hours they give away the jobs."
bad,"You do not want to work here as a mechanic they have a flat rate of pay no work no pay I worked one saturday for 12 hours and only booked  a half hour."
bad,Save your time and your familys time. This company is by far the worst company ever. Friends and faimly company they run through dms every other month. No advancements what so ever. Bate and switch advertisement. Just all around the most unprofessional unorganized organization i have ever worked for.
bad,"I worked part time nights for six months and most of the time there would be no work one saturday I was there 12 hours and only booked a half hour."
bad,Worst company to work for. Don't care about employees. Management for the most part is clueless. No management skills a all.
bad,"You cannot work here with a clear conscience, it is impossible. The service advisers expect you to lie to the customers to make bigger sales. There is no support from the management whatsoever, and no opportunity to grow with this company. It is a dead end job where they will starve you until you leave. The only possible good thing about this job was the customers. They will attack anyone who thinks differently or anyone who tries to report the bad working environments. This is a very dirty company."
bad,this is the worst company to work for to much shady stuff going on behind offics doors and the managers are fast to blame the regular employees if somthing goes wrong.. plus the favortisim of other store managers kids working for the company is abolutly discusting
bad,"Pep boys was a horrible company to work for. I was Hired as a manager for the commercial department, but was held back on doing my job properly due to the store manager always interfering and changing routines on a daily basis."
bad,"there is a lot to say about a company that thinks that they are 1 on 1 with they're employees. but that is far from the truth."
bad,"The managers and workers were all incompetent. The manager are lazy and rather talk on the phone than do any work. The workers acted like they were the best there is, and talk to you like they are above you,"
bad,"This was the worst place. Bad customer service, management was horrible, and bad pay. People didn't know what they was doing. They didn't work with your school schedule or if you had another job. I had a better time training at the store in Hicksville"
bad,"Rey, the service manager is a good guy.  Some good people work here, but this is an evil corporation.  Watch your commissions like a hawk."
bad,"Dishonest place of business, no growth, no security"
bad,They are cutting costs and letting the wrong people go. Dont know what direction they are going in.Dont want to invest in the programs they need to get up to speed.
bad,"The worst special order system in the industry"
bad,"This was a part time job and I really can't say anything positive regarding this job. I felt like I was the mule of the job. No enjoyable times to mention, I rarely had a lunch break (I ate my lunch as I worked) when I worked longer hours and when I worked 4 hours, I never had a break. I have had a day when I came in as scheduled and was told that I was not needed that scheduled date and come back on my next scheduled day."
bad,"The store manager that I worked for got three calls inside of an hour from upper management types all with mean and nasty words and threats about low sales and non compliance with company SOP."
bad,management was not organized and or professional. employees were rude and aggressive. i was treated like garbage in front of customers and the ceo of the company for no wrong doing
bad,mangers did not care about customers or employees. would charge customers for things that they did not need. braqke things on customers cars if would not buy
bad,"Typical day is talk to customers, try to help them with whatever service is needed then get yelled at by that customer because I do not know what I'm talking about. I learned more patience, and how to lead a shop of people. Management is not the greatest. Co-workers- some are fun, others tolerable. Hardest part of job is dealing with customers that know nothing but assume they know everything, and the company changing everything and how it is supposed to be done every day. Nothing about my job is enjoyable."
bad,"coworkers were good, job handling, management training was not vary good. they all are not vary good at taking care of employees"
bad,"Way below average wages for the positions preformed. No management or training what so ever. No real benefits to speak of, you basically pay for your health care and they provide nothing. No lunches, no paid breaks, just horrible place to work. I left and will never go back or look back."
bad,The company is horribly run. There is nothing great about the company in the least bit. The work on cars is the only thing they do right
bad,"The managers never did a thing . Always under staffed . Promised promotions and a raise and got nothing. The manager said I needed to work on my skills yet I hate better skills than he did. He said to impress the area director and I did. Told me to engage customers and I did . Didn't want to promote me cause he didn't want to take money out of his quarterly bonus . I actually seen the store manger keep money from his assistant managers just to keep his bonus high and use that excuse of oh you guys need to improve on your manager skill. Once I finally left tried to say he was gonna give me a raise. Turns out it was minimum wage going up, that was my raise. And I was there a year before a new chick was hired and she got paid more than I did and she was a lot younger and didn't have any work experience.. If you are im high school or looking for a part time job with very little hours work here. But if you are looking for a career and want to be successful and want to move up in a company for knowing what to do and not sleep with the managers than work somewhere else."
bad,"run registers, dispatch parts, answer phones ,take tests, put away merchandise, planograms, inventory. management does not see employees efforts, the co workers are awesome, no career advancement and no benefits, very little hours, great customers."
bad,"slow days"
bad,"The pay is low, and there is no opportunity for advancement, management has a high turnover rate by far the worst employment experience, the only thing I got from this job was parts knowledge"
bad,Pepboys is a great place to work for. Everybody gets along most of the time. People work together. We work hard for customers in the autoindustry.
bad,Very micro managed and run buy a supervisor with nothing more than a cracker jack degree in business management. Everyone just wants to smoke cigarettes and neglect their duties. They claim that there is no pressured sales but then your forced to give repair estimate in the hundreds and thousands to customers that want nothing more than a simple oil change. Would rather scrub toilets with a toothbrush than work for this place again.
bad,wouldn't recommend anyone to work here...pepboys uses you..then ships you out..your nothing but an employee id to them..district managers have no back bone or character..human resource doesn't care about a persons character...they make bogus accusations just to get u terminated and so they don't have to pay you unemployment. they are nothing but a money hungry corporation that preys on their employees and customers..complete rip off. hope they go bankrupt.
bad,"	Managed workflow and sales for Automotive Department, including directing work of master technicians."
bad,"This company doesn't care about its people, they continue to cut pay and benefits, you be better off selling flowers on a corner."
bad,"Worked for them for about 6 months and I was hating it on day one. Was Asm and was supposed to be in charge but felt that the Service Manager treated you like a puppet. Training was more important than a customer, Customer complaints were handled in the course of if they broke they fix it; no matter if the vehicle came in or not broke. Customer just called customer service line and compliant."
bad,get people in the door for 100 dollar brake job then try to sell them marked up parts they may or may not need
bad,Was not a good place to work not good people to work with a auto parts store
bad,"theres no job security, they dont care about you or your family.area director and reginal director dont careor have any compassion about thier employees. "
bad,"Let's start out with the pay. Customer service advisers (CSA) make a meaningless $7.00 and hour to start, with a chance at a .2 to 1 percent raise after a years worth of service. The commission scale is a joke, so every cent the CSAs can make from a sale is needed. Pep Boys prices are 30-50% higher in price for parts, and if you need a part from the dealer the automated system marks the price up 20% higher than the dealer sells it to a consumer. These are not issues of the CSAs trying to rip you off, it is Pep Boys and their programs. Want to cut the cost and by the part at the parts counter for what Pep Boys deems the ""do-it-yourself"" price, and then have it installed at the service counter? They will give you a hassle unless you threaten that you will complain, then management cowers like a puppy and gives in to even the most ridiculous request."
bad,"Complete waste of time. Started as a part time working 40hrs a week with the promise of full time in future, that didn't happen. Co-workers are lazy, no-one cares about anything in this place. After more than a year here they tell me I could not work 40 hrs anymore and I could not do more than 34hrs. So no benefits, overworked due to no-one else wanting to do the work, and underpaid. Yes the pay completely sucks."
bad,blind leading the blind. this place is a coorporation however the dm run it as their own personal family business sucks 
bad,"My review for this company is they put the most productivity expectancy on the female, while the males are able to walk around conversing all day while only assisting w/returns."
bad,"Management is overall incompetent and does not care the slightest about their employees. The company is set up to be disposable, like fast food. The overall attitude is if this monkey doesn't want to work, I'll find I gullible monkey that will. Pep boys often gives customers free services, such as tire rotations. The company isn't really giving anything away for free. They just don't pay the mechanics on the ticket for these ""free"" services. They are simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. When the tires being install on a car are ""pep boys"" tires, the mounting and balancing is free. Again, they just don't pay the mechanic doing the job, that's how they make up for it. The disorganization and lack of care is completely disgusting."
bad,"Store managers schedule their employees while they are actually in class and then write them up when they are late. Constant hazing of employees by management, low pay, no benefits, and no ability to advance makes this company hard to work for."
bad,One of so many employees seemed liked no one cared. Had a lot of young adults working there who like to steal so it affected my numbers.
bad,the managment at this company changed like most people change clothes the hr dept. did not have the best interest of the employee in mind overall a dismal place to work
bad,Overpriced and poor management. Drove business down. Need to market themselves better.
bad,"if you want to work for a company that doesn't care about their employees, work for pepboys!"
bad,Management could care less about their subordinates. They do not understand that it takes people to make the company grow. All they want to do is crunch #s and that is it.
bad,they hired me as part time but worked me full time so i wasnt able to get benifits then i transferd to a full time position and they kept me listed as part time i brought it to my managers attention three times each time he told me it wasnt his problem so i finally called hr and tow days after i got my benifits package they laid me off
bad,"I have great confidence that Pepboys founders Manny, Moe, & Jack had a great deal of respect for its employees. However, over the years its obvious that upper management has lost sight of what makes a company great and who is tasked with providing outstanding customer service, and that is its employees. From Divisional management and up, the culture and tone is one of we can always replace you. the same management fails to consider input from the field management and therefore dont have a clue of how to fix things but rather continue to apply activities and programs that fail all because they lack direct relation to known challenges felt by the field management and employees. Employee compensation is literally insulting."
bad,"Pepboys was NOT a fun experience. The management was inconsistent and you never knew what you would be dealing with when it came to your managers. He would come in and sometimes take his frustrations from home situations out on the job; that was extremely unfair to the employees. My co-workers were pretty fun to be around. The job was easy, it was just extremely boring."
bad,Typical day was trying to bring new customers to the commercial division.
bad,"getting there was always the fun part, had to wait always for the management to open the doors always at their own time ,never the same, a fast moving enviroment great lack of communication betwen service personal ,jobs promised to certain time without informing the person working on the job ,scheduling costumers service a big problem,management always screaming over this trying to hurry employees to finish fast to mantain a good service report from the public even the lack of control he had over the people at the costumer service desk"
bad,The company is no good.
bad,alot of the time people would hide to get out of waiting on customers & a few liked to have a liquid lunch! the bigest issue was a manager that wrote a book in the office on company time. WOW what an example he is now a district suporviser
bad,"A horrible place to work. A blatant disregard for new employees. There is no hands-on training and when you do ask questions pertaining to job functions; you get a cold shoulder. Everybody who works here is very uptight and if they feel threatened by your intellectual stability they won't give you the time-of-day because they fear you will excel past them. If you are a driver: you will never get a regular schedule, or a regularly scheduled break. To add to what was prior-mentioned; you will get calls on your cell phone while driving, and you will catch grief from your portly, little man-of-a-boss, if you don't answer these calls. Words of advice: hold out and look for something better."
bad,i would never work here again. i was let go because i caught the managner stealing from the company. shortly after i was fired he was fired also.
bad,"I have worked at Pep Boys twice and both times the pay has been very low. They are not good to their employees at all. I have learned in my experience that you want a customer to come back because the service they received was great, but at Pep Boys customers always come back to complain that there car that was fixed is no longer running."
bad,they treat you really unfair if you are not a managers favorite.
bad,This company I wouldn't refer my worse enemy to work for. You WILL be mislead and used to your full potential.
bad,"Only plus is they pay for your ase exams if you pass, and have training programs. So if you are brand new in the field then this place is perfect to get all your mistakes out in the field, they dont fire cheap labor because they factor in how a newbie is and allocate enough for you to screw up all you want, other than that this place is not for a real technician or anyone requiring fair wages to survive."
bad,Upper Management is terrible Pepboys only cares about how much money they can make and their stores aren't even staff properly. less people in the stores means low payroll and more money for upper management
bad,Run! They only care about money. They sell you stuff you don’t need. They make you pressure sell and  if an employee can’t make the sell they get in trouble by the manager.
bad,"New manager showed favoritism to the white employees new commercial supervisor was a redneck, god bess America racists that showed favoritism to his buddy’s"
bad,"Management is terrible;a lot of double standards, and racial discrimination. The management will go so far as to slander,and black ball you.There is no professional integrity there.Pizza parties and little gestures are put in place to keep the natives from becoming restless about the pay,hours,and management."
bad,The managers were all know it alls. They didn't listen to any employee suggestions. The District Manager was the worse one of them all. Nothing good to say here.
bad,Low pay. You get a guarantee  and that's great because that's what you make every week. Just above min. wage. There customers are cheap too. They are only there for the 99 brake jobs that you'll have to do over and over again because of the terrible parts they sell until they get some brakes from Napa and the customer goes away. Don't work here ever. Unless you have no shot at any other job because they will hire anybody. Also the managers were all kids who couldn't sell any repairs.
bad,You are pretty much married to Pep Boys. No matter how good you are if you are not one of the Area Directors pets you get the get passed over. I have seen this many times. When they hire they expect you to work 12 hrs plus a day. I was told by a AD that this guy doesn't mind working this many hours because he was younger than me and maybe I should work that many hours too. This is for young unmarried people.
bad,The good thing is there's definitely alot of work but the pay sucks if you're a loader because you make the same as the other workers that hardly do anything
bad,"They do not care about there employees one bit at all , theres ac in the summer nor heat in the winter . The store also flooded and has termites and they nothing to fix it ."
bad,"PTO often times IF granted is reversed"
bad,"Worked there over one year. From what I seen, if you are not a particular ethnic group, you will NOT be able to climb the ranks within this company. At least in the long island region."
bad,Pep boys is the dealership rejects. I did not enjoy working there. I acme from a structured company that makes money and pep boys was very lackadaisical. I surprised they are still in business. No one there knows about business and making profits.
bad,Horrible company to work for they favor people . Pay is all screwed up General service technician makes more an hour then master mechanic. They over pay people like management who are hardly ever there. Buildings falling apart they have rats and bats in them. Bat droppings on showroom ceilling tiles which is unhealthy for customers but they don’t care to fix any of it because it will hurt their bonuses. Just horrible people that don’t care about customer and employees health. I am sure if they got inspections done from health departments or OSHA they would close a lot of stores. Just a really horrible company to work benefits are no good can’t even afford to go to doctors. Ever since Icahn took over and they bought just brakes the company has been going downhill as far as taking care of the employees that make the money for the company. Just horrible stay away.
bad,"Management blames their mistakes/shortcomings on the poorly trained new guy. Total CYA mode every moment of every day. Customers complaints are taken as gospel despite evidence to disprove them. Management takes advantage of and takes for granted all subordinates. Compensation was promised on hiring that was cut to HALF a month after starting the job. Commission targets are impossible to meet. Lack of techs and their frequent turnover makes it nearly impossible to sell recommended services. The service advisor is always the bearer of bad news and is consequently the one named in the customer complaint. My advice, avoid this company."
bad,Management only care about themselves barely comes in to work but expect you to break your back. Be prepared to be lied too at every turn. Favoritism plays a major part in that work environment. Job not even worth the headache.
bad,Great place to start out but at my location the management was horrible and even went to district wide managers. Lack of intelligence in most employees.
bad,The hardest part of my job is not receiving the support of my management when needed. I wish there was more support in the company that would allow associates to feel comfortable.
bad,"Just don't trust me.. as a Service Advisor you will get blamed for everything that goes wrong even if you had nothing to do with the situation.. If a technician messes up on a car, who you think the customer is going to be mad at? No not the tech.. YOU. Very unfair work environment. Cut throat customers that complain about their oil change taking to long even though they've only been waiting for 10 minutes. Management never wants to help whenever they're needed and provide zero support... Please put your time and energy into a company that will be worth it in the long run for you."
bad,"At least when I was there, it was bad. I mean bad."
bad,"days were always slow, no money to make, extremely low salary below ny state minimum wage never had a day to be happy im at work doing what i love to do"
bad,"Pay is not good."
bad,"The company was great to start out with. The pay is based on a hr/book hour rate. So I started at 7.00/hr-6.00/book hr. What this means is if I do no work all day I make 7.00/hr to work 10 hour days. If I get more work in for vehicles then I make the 7+the 6.00 per every hour I am physically working on a vehicle. The book hours are different for each service on a vehicle. Half of the time you don't even get paid for the work you do, so technically they are paying under minimum wage and making you work for free."
bad,"overall it's not a bad place to work however like most jobs when you become good at something, you become relied on most and it allows others around you to slack off and take advantage of that."
bad,"workers are expected to run the whole the store even doing management tasks which where not part of the job description still being paid min wage."
bad,This job will drive you to poor habits and mental emotional distress. A day at work is detrimental to your health. Especially when you have associates whose basic assumption is to stand at the counter with their phones in their face waiting for the next crisis to arrive.
bad,it's not a place you really want to work at.for the most part the employees are pretty good. But the management is terrible. The pay sucks. and don't expect raises especially if you anger your manager.
bad,"This company is horrible, they are severely understaffed and expect you to work 7 days with no breaks, upper management will never respond to phone calls or emails, it took them a month to pay me. since the ""buy out"" the company has fallen away from customer service and is terrible at keeping parts in stock, they have plenty of useless items there like ""as seen on tv"" products but not ""car parts"". This place was the worse company i ever worked for"
bad,"I would not recommend this company, and I would not bring my vehicle for service either.  They will over-sell you things you do not need.  They push this on all employees, and pay you 7.00 an hour so that if you don't sell what they want, you will not make enough money to survive.  Customer service is about listening to the needs of the customer, not using them to make money.  "
bad,"Minimum wage pay and expected to work open to close "
bad,"The management is awful. There is no training other than computer courses that you are expected to either take in between customers or take on your own time at home (unpaid). They will promise you anything to get you to take the job/stay at the job/stop complaining but they are all empty promises. The schedule is not flexible at all; for the first six months you have no PTO and are not allowed to take any days off or work any alternate hours unless you find someone to cover for you which is impossible since there is only one manager, one assistant manager, and one service advisor. "
bad,That place is toxic to your health working there. No one will help you out with anything. The management sucks. They wont give anyone a raise. the pay the service employees poorly. I was there a year and for 6 months was was the only retail employee during the day. I got no help from any one ever. I busted my butt on my own and never got a raise nor was i appreciated for my hard work.
bad,Upper management has a horrible habit of micro managing your every decision. Even as the store manager you might as well just be a place holder for upper management. The company does not do proper advertising to help the managers ensure a successful shop environment. Their pay and benefits are horrid.
bad,This company micromanage its manager does don't pay for any equipment to be fix and the tech are very slow and a pain in the butt to have work for you . Their no family they want you to work over 50 e week for too a week salary  . The shop has no customer basis  and I very unorganized.  I would not work for this company.
bad,"Manager liked to run things ""his way"" not like other stores, other co workers were lazy and worthless, unorganized at corporate level, many lies and broken promises from CAM and AD managers. Aways blamed for poor sales even though delivery program has had a history of poor sales for last five years."
bad,"Three different managers telling you three different things. Its too much hassel. Too many customer complaints. Not from me or my side, but from the service side which is making the managers not do stuff right on my side. High turnover rate. I have been there the longest out of everybody but the retail manager."
bad,Worst possible job I ever had. Pep boys corporate is like a cult. Low pay and long hours. Very high turn over of all employees. I quit after 1 week.
bad,"The best thing about working at Pep Boys is the relationship I have with a handful of my coworkers and the relationship I have with our commercial customers. The bad part about working there is everything else, bad management, broken promises, no raises, benefits are to high , favoritism , no respect for employees from upper management, the list goes on."
bad,it's a difficult work place only because of some co-workers
bad,Employers seemed careless along with managment was there three years and only seemed to care about profit and not of the employes
bad,If you can get a job ANY PLACE else. Avoid at all costs! Please watch the work they get BEFORE you take the job! DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY TELL YOU!!!!! No work= NO $$$$$
bad,"Hired as P/T was working 40 + hours/6 days a week"
bad,"I’ve never been treated as poorly by any job  management is awful hours are too many for the amount of salary  "
bad,"I started off training as a sales associate, which is what I was hired to do, then all of a sudden our Loop driver quit, and I got sucked into the position. There is no room for growth with this company, and the management is sub-par."
bad,If you have a family just dont think about working here they dont care about your family they dont care about your health they dont give a crud about you period stay away if you value yourself as a person if you dont have a life and want to work life away while breaking your back then this is the place for you horrible pay for the work you do with even worse management
bad,Management doesn't care about employees if yohave to take time off because you are under a doctor's care you will be terminated they don't care about any employee all they know is how to take advantage of people they have a terrible service department would not let them service a toy wagon much less a automobile's
bad,"Full disclosure, I knew taking this job would not be ideal for me but was not prepared for how unprofessional and stressful it would be to simply deliver auto parts day in and day out! If Bi polar managers who yell at you for no reason, back stabbing unsupportive coworkers, poor workplace safety, and witnessing horrible environmental violations as well as seeing workplace drama daily are your thing by all means..Go for it :/"
bad,The company demands a lot from all of it's associates with minimal to zero resource support to the field sales team. It is a top down driven organization with no understanding of what actually takes place in the field.
bad,"This was a stressful job where most of the days consisted of dealing with upset customers and working with little to no break. Compensation was terrible, and management was not at all helpful. No real room for growth or advancement"
bad,Shady sales practices.  Complete lack of team work.  Unprofessional from management to CSA.  Management encourages toxic environment.  No communication whatsoever.  Horrible place to work.  Also don't get breaks when you're supposed to.
bad,Would not go back or recommend this company is a disaster waiting to happen the owner buys up all the small companies and clearly pockets the money he doesn’t use it on the advancement of technology for the company he doesn’t pay the employees and he does not use it on a better brand of product
bad,"They need to get rid of the Service Manager, other then that it would be a better working environment. Has no respect for employees Whatsoever thinks he knows it all brings his personal problems to work. Very unprofessional!!!"
bad,"A typical day at this job included mass disorganization, rampant yelling and belittling by anyone higher in management, no clear chain of supervisors, and constant undermining of any authority. "
bad,"Upper management worry about one thing, themselves. Will take advantage of you and lies, has no value as a person or leader. I just don't know how pr what is needed to be a service manager, but whom ever has the power I'll tell you is all about the $$$$$$$. Employees are not a priority, technicians and service advisor to include asst manger in their mind they come in dollar a dozen and has no concept in training and retention of good employees."
bad,"If the rest of the employees work more than the manager, doesn't that say enough! I enjoy the work but wish the manager was in the store more often.  The store is unorganized and most of the problems are due to poor management."
bad,"Work you beyond belief. Management sucks. Its a job. Nothing more, nothing less. No set time of hours. You leave when job is done. Pay is not good. Occurrence system is crazy. Seems like management makes their own rules. Need ramdom drug testing in my opinion."
bad,Horribly place to work. Constantly changing of schedules and policies. Upper management are idiots that have never worked at the store level a day in their lives yet know everything about it.
bad,"Too many meetings"
bad,"I started as a full time employee. I arrived one day to find that everyone had left the department. I, by myself, worked overtime and did all applicable duties, carried that department until there were new people hired. I never got compensated for doing managerial duties.  The employee turnover and corporate support left me thinking that my talents could be used elsewhere."
bad,"The atmosphere is ok, but they will run you ragged all day long to hit their sales quota.. Then pointlessly  dragging the overstocked tires in and out everyday cause management won't/can't send them back. You've been warned! Just don't."
bad,"There is no room for advancement, constant stress over things that are out of your control, upper management is a joke, and pay scale is always changing so you never have a constant check to count on."
bad,Service Manager was sneaky and under-handed. Constantly lying. Always disrespecting techs and talking to people like they were pieces of dirt. Area Director was terrible as well.Did not keep his word about anything.
bad,"Very poor communications, too many changes, lack of strong culture, no vision for future. Too many layers of management at top levels with no clear guidance."
bad,Just part of the American Capitalist Companies that says floating on the business thanks to the ignorant and unknown automotive society of drivers that are consuming their services
bad,pep boys them selves is ok its the management that dose not know what the are doing they want things done right but they want you to rush so you can get the next car in or you are working on 2 or 3 cars at the same time for they over book when they have only 2 or 3 techs in the shop
bad,"•	Delegating tasks"
bad,"Sometimes a job is great and fulfilling, sometimes a job is just a job...and sometimes it's actually a painful experience that causes nightmares and disillusionment.  When the company was bought, the new ""leaders"" made a big deal about growth and advancement, none of which ever happened.  Whatever their plan was (I'm not so sure there was one), it expressed itself as micromanagement and emotional outbursts.  There was no customer or employee appreciation. The culture was characterized by bumbling mistakes, directional changes, and half executed initiatives. Now that the company has been acquired yet again (by Pep Boys) at least it will be allowed to die under a different flag."
bad,"They threaten all Service Managers jobs all day, every day no exceptions! No family life. Always calling, they work you 5 1/2 days and it still is not good enough"
bad,"The management was terrible always trying to get rid of workers for not selling certain products when customers are spending $400+ on repairs. Their commission system is terrible, personally I've sold so many repair jobs that I've should have made way more than $600 bi-weekly on my paycheck and they said that there is advancement but its completely false working so many hours a day for bellow minimum wage its a horrible job I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for. I left a perfectly good job because the area director sold me to come to pep boys. Biggest mistake I ever made. If you enjoy a company that offers no training and bosses that lie to you well this is the company for you. This company does not care about there employees
bad,"the typical day started by checking all the customers cars that were dropped off in the night drop box. Contacting the customers to verify what their needs are for their cars. You learn a lot about customer service. Management was just okay. The co-workers were a good bunch of guys.  The company really put profits over workers, no motivation to sell and be rewarded for selling over the limit."
bad,when I first started at the Burien location great manger and co-workers In Dec. 2012 new manger came and I quickly left do to manger treating me unfairly and not the rest of the team.
bad,would never work for this company again nor will i recommend anyone to work there or to use there services in any way
bad,"Part of the job was selling retail products, answering telephones, operating a cash register, stocking inventory and compiling service estimates. What I disliked most about this company most was that they expected you to do the work of 2, maybe 3, people for little pay-minimum wage to be exact. Even after all of this was done, they didnt make you feel needed or appreciated. People were constantly being hired and fired, on all levels-whether it be management, technicians, or floor people. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"As a GST you will have an opportunity to learn basic automotive repair services, to include, basic vehicle safety inspection, mounting and balancing of tires, engine oil change, battery testing and replacement, and performing other basic maintenance services."
bad,"The managers at the Woodside location rarely help the new guys at all. Also, the hiring process is a hot mess there. One time a manager hired a General Service Technician and instead of paying him hourly like they should, they payed him flat rate because they were actually looking for a B tech but couldn't find one and hired a newbie off autozone to fill that role with little experience."
bad,"When I started working at Pep Boys, customer service was the most important goal. We had plenty of team members working in the shop and plenty of help on the service counter. We were able to help customers off the street as well as those who made appointments to service their car. About a year ago it all changed. Now we're short-handed, are not able to hire any team members, and are turning customers away."
bad,"Use to get experience and then go to work for a dealership. I'm looking to get my CDL and drive for one of these big trucking companies if I can't get into a dealership soon. You will not be appreciated here, only used up til there's nothing left. They don't care about anything other than the bottom dollar and not wanting to deal with anything."
bad,"Area director and interim director are clueless. "
bad,Poor managed get stuck doing other peoples comebacks and dont get paid for it frt counter has no clue what they are telling the customers and create problems
bad,"Terrible Company !  Started seven days a week beeing open ... company went belly up in AZ . Terrible!"
bad,store manager knows i have a mental disability and decided to use it against me to fire me! this place is very stressful! they play favorites. i called hr for a issue and they still have not called back! management is very very poor. if you want to make a living and like your work GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
bad,Not a great place to work for management sucks the goals they set for you are not realistic they expect you to do paper work handle customers and well as the complaints but without any help
bad,"bad management, low pay, slow shops. If you don't hit your flag hours, your fallback rate is minimum wage. When the shop is slow, which it usually is, the tire techs are making more than the mechanics."
bad,"Corporate plays goody two shoes with you but doesn't care about your well-being or needs. Nor the needs of your customers. They don't care about you as a person, they merely want to see how much they can milk you for profit."
bad,"was my first retail store job and it was all the work and absolutely no pay. Prepare to operate all of the following.. the cashier, parts counter, and the store intercom at the same time. Management is usually poor. Stocking and storing bulk items that can weigh upto 60lbs or more an item and hauling over 3 tons of merchandise via a single pallet jack. its a nice start but till you realize it's a waste of your efforts and time."
bad,Corporate only cares about their unexperienced managers very hard to request time off forget about your weekends forget about your family  Decent job for a student right out of school that wants to learn automotive mechanics but all master technicians stay away from this place your house will go to foreclosure if you work there  and the best part or actually the most funny part is you’re struggling to make a paycheck the managers sit on their butt all day but yet they take $3000 home every two weeks
bad,i had a great manager. the coworkers were mostly jerks. most of the management were rude. pay was downright horrific. i worked 8-10 hour days 6 days a week and couldn't make enough to support just me and my wife. we make monthly budgets and could barely pay the bills every month.
bad,Most workers don't work together. The store manager is lazy all he does is just sit and make everyone else do his work. Some of the other workers don't help out when you are busy but only two other workers helps out when in need.
bad,"store management is horrible always has attitude and lacks the ability to delegate work, when this get done incorrectly or not at all they blame you. upper management - corporate - is seemingly against any female working in the industry and does not want to help them at all."
bad,"Ever since the Auto Plus buyout, Pep Boys is in a downward spiral. Health benefits for 2016 were excellent but for 2017 I ended up saving money by buying my own insurance on the exchange. Hours were all over the place week to week depending on how many days the manager decided he wanted to blow off. I was in a sort-of assistant manager position where I was the store's ""safety monitor,"" though things I pointed out as hazards were ignored and signed off as OK. After this incident, I requested transfer to another store but my vindictive manager put the Kibash on it. Never again"
bad,"The manager doesn't know anything about working on cars.  So he doesn't trust his mechanics to work on them either.  Pep Boys management turns away jobs that the mechanics there can do, therefore costing the mechanic money.  They use cheap Chinese parts, and when one fails blame the mechanic who worked on the car.  The pay is terrible.  Just not a good place to work."
bad,"Good company if your a higher up, but working in store is absolutely terrible. Management was pathetic, no store manager, and every other manager or employee that would start here leaves within 3-4 months. Service Department was the worst in terms of productivity, and really understaffed on mechanics. Equipment was always broken. Personal accessories were constantly stolen."
bad,"Put 1000 lbs of work on you and you never feel safe with your position.You can work super hard and have on ebad day in sales and they are all over you. Work LOOOONg hours, except a the end of the each quarter where they need to show a profit for their share holders and cut the hours so you are extreamly short handed"
bad,"My review of this company was that it was completely opposite of what I am as a person. Took all of my energy and then some, did my best and was not given any recognition for that. A typical day was boring as hell. When work was there it was great as long as no one rushes you which rarely happened. Terrible type of working environment for me in my experience. No matter how good I was as an employee or worker did not seem to matter much. Was not encouraging to work hard, most of good work went to other employees who had less certifications. Some coworkers were nice but most didn't last long. Management was secretive in other words they lorded it over me. I never knew when they were happy and that was the hard part."
bad,I was a basic oil change and tire rotation guy. Tbeg asked me to do some sketch stuff to customers vehicles to cause them to have to replace parts. When I refused to destroy other people's stuff I got terminated after the third or fourth time
bad,"I do not recommend working there "
bad,I had to fight to receive my full pay check after working about 80 hours per week as a manager. The district manager tried cheating me out of my pay only paying me for 60 of those hours when I was hourly. If that type behavior is fine with you then it will be a good fit for you.
bad,if you want to join a company that doesn't pay you very well and wants you to work every bodies job at once? then this is the job for you. workplace is very hostile all the time. do everything by hand and tools are always broken down. get ready for tool debt! the most enjoyable part of the job is leaving that place. the hardest part of the job is doing every bodies job. management is power hungry.
bad,"Area directors and managers are never on same page. Operational managers lack experience and do not treat customers well."
bad,Horrible place to work every employee has a dislike for the company. In my store the managers were uncooperative and disrespectful. Part time salary and benefits are horrible.
bad,Customers know how to manipulate the managers to make everything free and freely curse at us in the shop. The managers never trust us on our work with the vehicles. this place sucks the love out of the job.
bad,Working at Pep Boys was a different kind of experience.  I was the only female on the service side therefore I felt that I didn't get the same respect as the other employees.
bad,"A normal day at Pep Boys starts by attending customers on the sales floor , restocking the store with new merchandise, processing either retail or service related transaction, etc. The job is really easy once you have learned the the routine and the process. the most enjoyable part of the job could also be the most difficult part . I am talking about costumers. A good day depends when a costumer does not complaint about the services he or she is provided with"
bad,"This was one of the worst places I ever worked for! It was a dog eat dog environment cut throat people stabbing everyone in the back! One of the worst customer service centers I ever experience! One of the gimmicks is the buy 3 tires get the forth for free. First you must buy a road hazard warranty (which they warranty, it is not from a different source) which bring the true price of the tire to about haft off! Most road hazard warranties will fix the tire if you have a flat. But Pepboys gives this to you with the rewards card! so the only time you need the ""road hazard"" is when the tire needs to be replaced! Long wait times. Very poor pay. take home was about $400.00 per week."
bad,"Pep Boys is not that great of a company to work for.There is favoritisms,discrimination,and the Area Director for the Waterbury Location is a very bigoted person"
bad,I would not recommend working at Pep Boys unless you enjoy being treated poorly. They will remind you that if you don't sell what they want you to sell they will find someone else to do your job.
bad,"tough work not enough compensation for the damage done to your body., Just like any other multi billion dollar company!    One day you may be the hero, the next day may be a new boss threatening your job security for no reason"
bad,"Although they pay well, I do feel that Pep Boys is behind the times. Alot of their employees have been here for numerous years and like routine. I tried bringing new features and innovative tactics, but was quickly shot down. It was quite depressing atmosphere. The company does not appreciate their employees as they provide only the bare minimum of holidays off and PTO as well as do not believe work from home. Whether there is a snow storm or an unexpected appointment, Pep Boys will require you to take a PTO."
bad,"It was a fun place to work at one time everyone got along went to lunch built some strong relationships,a management change changed that you became a slave to your job management treated you like dirt."
bad,"To see a company have a reputation of professionalism yet in store everyone is negative and doesn't care for the company and its culture."
bad,I have no interest in bad mouthing any place that I have or will be working for. I do not know how the company as a whole work's but I will say the one thing I did like about this place was we were always plenty of training. As for the location I worked at let's just say it left a bad taste in my mouth
bad,"I loved working for just brakes,I loved the hours but being a store manager and only making$8.19 an hour is crazy. We would have conference calls every morning with a member of corporate who would always put us down and disrespected all of the employees if we did not hot our daily sale target I eventually had enough and discontinued my employment with that company"
bad,"Horrible mark ups and then you are left holding the bag to explain to customers. Managers will lie about pay to hire you and then HR does nothing about it. I like most of the people I work with. Overall, once I leave I'm not going back as an employee ever nor as a customer."
bad,Doesn't care at all about employees. Only about making a profit. Very hard to advance in company. All managers from the Store Manager all the way up to the Regional and District Managers do not take concerns of the employees seriously. Dangerous work environment with faulty equipment and no working safety features.
bad,I started out thinking ths was a great place to work. I saw in 2 weeks it wasnt for me. They use preditory sales tactics and intimidation to meet sales goals. The only way to get anywhere in the company is to be a slimy underhanded salesman. All i wanted to do was fix cars. The hardest part of the job was watching single mothers blow there savings on a $1500 brake job when they just needed pads and rotors cut. Theres a reason they lost there bbb cert and have thousands of negitive complaints on the internet. Save time and be a lube tech at a dealer. They never work 5 days its 12 hours 6 days. Pay is a joke if it wasnt for overtime i would not have made it.
bad,"The pay scale is way too complicated and is intended to keep the companies best interests in mind. They take money from their techs every chance they get by cutting labor, refunding money and giving work away. Which brings me to my next point, favoritism. Management, for some unknown reason, sees it as a point to give all work to their Master Technicians. As if no one else matters. For example, you inspect a car and find it needs front brakes. Parts are not available until the next day. Management will not take the extra steps to ensure that you get the work because you inspected it. They will simply bypass you and hand it to the Master Technician. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is trying not to just blow up at management when they blatently take money out of you pocket."
bad,Once upon a time I loved working with this company and thought I would retire there. After the buyout it has been a revolving door and the company focus changes from day to day. Place has its positives but more than it's fair share of negatives.
bad,"Everything I tried to do took a month at least. Getting hired took 1 month, benefits took over a month to be approved one i was eligible to sign up, my FMLA benefits took well into my FMLA term to be approved even though i started the process 4 months in advance then they over billed my PTO by 50 hrs and by the time it was finally corrected i had earned the time back (36 wks), approval for safety equipment always took at least 3 weeks, they were full of unnecessary corporate policies that slowed work progress down then they would be upset that work was not getting done, turnover was rediculous because of lack of ""competitive pay"" which they advertised as a benefit to working there....horrible upper management structure and processes!!"
bad,Not a good place to work or advance poor management high price on parts. Not worth it unless your in upper management .Customers constantly angry over web orders and special orders
bad,You will slave for the least pay they can give you. When you proceed you can produce more work than asked or given it is taken advantage of. Good luck with flat rate.
bad,"Manager is great!"
bad,I think it’s a good company just poor management over the store managers . They give no training and expect managers to know how to do everything . They have no support . Cut overtime for employees but make managers works 50 plus hours to cover stores . Pay for hours worked is not even close to other companies in this field .
bad,All the employees and coworkers were cool however poor management and not enough employees to cover the department. No breaks working steady 10 hour days while other stores in the district had drivers work half days rather then full. No tips were given by any of the commercial accounts delivered to and management sucked at working with my availability due to me having another job. The pay was poor and I was terminated for being scheduled on a day I wasn’t available and not showing up for a shift.
bad,Could be a better work place. Needs more communication between management and employees. The only decent part of the job is that you get to meet some amazing people on the outside.
bad,"Store Managers Are great, However upper management has to be more realistic "
bad,"Good to work for however lifers aloud to get away with a lot and blame new people for following rules and protocol. Benefits were great, training topics are questionable. The company is open every Holiday except Thanksgiving and Christmas."
bad,"The offered great pay, but transferred me to a different store farther away without discussing it with me first. No raise after 2 years and random schedule changes."
bad,"My manager of the store was wonderful.  However, corporate directors did not have adequate knowledge of the field nor where their expectations of what needed to be done (store layouts assembled on a busy day) even though sales numbers at the store where high."
bad,"i have worked at pep boys for almost 20 years. Never ever able to get weekends off due to shop hours. Always worked either Saturday or sunday with a day off in the week."
bad,"Old systems and clueless upper management.  Do not care about employees at all. Very rude and disrespectful Philadelphia, PA"
bad,I stayed with this company through thick and thin and saw many managers. But the environment changed so much it was rediculous. It went from a good shop where everyone was happy to a poor work setting.. the pay is great but I left due to the management I hated going to work because of them. I was always told to come in on my days off and to help. Felt like a didn’t have a choice. My family suffered because of that I was never home and kids got to rarely see me.
bad,"This is a screwed up company. Its all about who can suck up to the area director. You will be promised a raise and never get it, will have to deal with drama unlike any other job. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
bad,Excellent crew to work with and pay for certifications. Long hours but worth it. Training program for managers has disappeared since buyout
bad,"Nost of who i worked with were great people. Upper managment cant make up their minds and always change everything every other week. Dont hope for a deserved promotion if your ""younger""."
bad,"the personal is great the pay is low but the learning expiriance is at fast pace"
bad,Company was a pleasure to work for until they were bought two years ago. Now they have no corporate support and no P&L statements so you never know where you are. Have not made a bonus in over a year.
bad,"A typical day is very boring  especially in the winter time. I learned alot working here , from customer service to knowing much more about cars. The most enjoyable part about working here was I only worked Am shifts once a week which i found to be very cool."
bad,"After working for Pepboys after many year. Some of the biggest problems I saw was all the restructure that took place over and over, and now they are closing retail. I really enjoyed growing with the company but once you hit a store managers job. This is the highest you will ever go. They tend to hire outside the company for anything higher."
bad,Pep boys isn’t a bad company just wanted to seek something better and receive better opportunities. I’ve been there for almost 3 years and i felt like i was worth more so i decided to get another job
bad,worse job experience ever in my life. management was entirely lacking. store were poorly maintained and the lack of employees made work literally stressful and harshly demanding for everyone but management. Dont work here!
bad,"Stay Away. Poor Upper Management. Completely outdated computer systems. Even worse inventory system. Nice people to work with. Upper management uses & abuses people, hence, high turnover."
bad,To many people expecting everyone else to stock and supply necessary items in the work bays especially those lower on the totem pole so to speak. Sad.
bad,This is an awful place to work and the management is horrible please if you value your sanity do not work here everyone there is miserable and hates it there!!!
bad,"I am qualified for a district manager, but they wanted to hire me as a ""Service Writer"" for $8.50 an hour. I was never contacted by anyone other than the service manager. The rest recruiting process is poor. If they had a clue, someone that had a brain would have called me. I refuse to take a $45k pay cut."
bad,"I didn't like the type of work I was doing , the managers were always having issues with each other and the company was short staffed."
bad,"All I can say is that it is a good thing the company sold. Worked a 6 day week from 7am - 6pm and never any time off. Pay was horrible and they kept changing it over the yrs. Never enough staff members to help and always left it up to the Center Manager to advertise and hire, but never wanted to pay."
bad,"meet and greet customers,help customers to solve any automotive concerns so that they leave satisfied and would refer me to others and return for all automotive concerns"
bad,It was a good job and it was something I wanted to do but it was not paying enough
bad,A very good place to work. All ran smoothing. Good people to work for.
bad,"When I was employed there, people received opportunities based on friendships, more often than they  earned them. Certain employees operated on a sense of entitlement. Not answering phones, assisting customers and definitely not operating the Point of sale,/checkout aspect of our job. The culture and environment made it difficult to come to work  enthused."
bad,I don’t have anything to say  other than I didn’t like working there...made it seam way better then it actually was...management sucked not all of them tho just mine
bad,terrible place to work. managment was stealing my commision pay. very slow at times and lousy pay. i was terminated after a year and denied unemployment.
bad,this job is good for people who arent trying to provide for a family. lots of slow periods through out the work day in those time periods we clean the shop.
bad,Was at one point the only person in the store and was working over 90 hr a week just trying to keep the store running. It took over 4 month for them to get one of the 7 applicants I requested to get approved. Shortly after that they replaced me with someone that had never work in a shop before in there life and made him the store manager and then Demoted me to just the lead tech.
bad,The managers only care about them selves. If you have a strong worth ethic then they will take advantage of it so they don't have too. Raises at this company is a joke compared to other parts stores. I strongly encourage not to seek work for this company.
bad,"I will never again let a company take advantage of me ,  no life ,  scare you into working from open to close. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..."
bad,"Horrible place to work! Not very friendly."
bad,It’s sucks  no advancement at all takes advantage of good workers really hot in the picking department treated unfair if your not one of the favorites the bosses are not Professional at all l. Tells your business to everyone and when you have a problem with something you speak to a hr they will tell people what you said and so forth it’s really sad when I was working there for the 6 months  more than 20 people had quit seriously to where the big hr lady had to come see what the problem was she over all the pep boys wear houses!! Family can work there if your a favorite of on if the bosses .
bad,since new management took over work environment has declined steadily pay has decreased and bonus has become almost inpossible to obtain . management expects in store managers to cover hours not filled by other employees that have had hours cut . required to work 50 hours a week but pay based on 40 hour week
bad,"The people working in the shop were fine, it was the corporate management that lead to the downfall of the company now owned by Pep-boys. They push to meet goals and they personally sold services to Spanish speaking customers that were unnecessary."
bad,"You will show up to either a decent amount of work or no work at all, constantly short staffed, half of the employees will not help if needed, lots of very unnecessary rules to follow that hurt time spent and pay, hardest part of the job is going into work most enjoyable part of the job is getting to go home."
bad,"liked the work,but no place to advance in,managers had a set schedule never made it flexiable to work with,never rotated schedule,co workers are great to get along with.like to work with customers and help them find what they need"
bad,It was a good job. Good people to be around. I left a lot of friends young and old who look up to me there. Me and my shop guys had a sort of brotherhood their.
bad,This company can regain their title if the seek better leaders. Someone with expertise in the customer experience and automotive services.
bad,"Just Brakes is all about the money. They don't care how much the customers lie on you, you will still take the fall. Most of their slower stores have no chance because they don't market the area productively. The managers at the best stores are either the corporate employee kids or good friends. A new up and coming prospect has not chance in getting the best paying stores."
bad,"open at 7, close after 6 or when last car is finished. Equipment is not getting fixed, employees are working without adequate compensation or tools."
bad,"I would clock in and be going non-stop until it was time to get off. I was a parts delivery driver but I also rang customers out, assisted them with looking up parts, walked parts to the service area for the mechanics, assisted commercial customers with their purchases, did the mamager's display changes and I helped cleam up the store."
bad,"If you have been with the company for longer than 5 years. Then it is vertually impossible to be fired. No matter what you do as long as you are in their little clicks...Certain employees can call out, leave early but you burry a family member like a parent or an uncle just 2 months apart they forbid you to use bereavement and order and belittle you to be in work at a set time."
bad,"Drama central  and good ole boy club."
bad,"The store is closing, mangement and leadership is highly unprofessional. Our district manager knew nothing about how help us and was unprofessional in his conduct towards his subordinates/employees."
bad,Managment does not care. Motivation is by hostage. People are always looking to find a way out for something better to go too. Leadership will mislead and undermine people to achieve anything
bad,"You ate treated disposable, they will work Managers 6 to 7 days a week 10+ hours a day till you just can't take it anymore. They do offer PTO they just wont let you take the time off so you end up losing it at the end of the year. One of the worse management position I have had!"
bad,your  just a number here dont expect muchthey do not care for its people all the decisions are made from  office in philadelphia   managers come and go place is dirty
bad,"I want to make sure I'm being clear that my experience took place at the Mason City IA distribution center. I cannot speak on how the rest of the distribution centers work. The managment at the Mason City location are incompetent and heartless! Your value of your works are not compensated even if you are knowledgeable in multiple functions/programs/ software/ shipping methods.  Family is not valued at this DC, pray that your child stays healthy  because you will not get time off."
bad,"Good place for a young person to get some work experience in, learn a few basics but for a seasoned tech it will be a struggle mostly frustrating because the Managers aren't good at scheduling, communicating with customers and building a good repor so mechanic work is minimal at best which makes making any decent money challenging if not impossible. You get pulled off of a job and bouced around mutipple times which takes away the time you need to complete what you stayed in a timely Manor, very frustrating"
bad,Need better pay by hour.Better management that can be equal to ever employee.Better training and better way to help your customers.Better equipped and.
bad,"I was the Service Manager in a small town between two bigger cities. I am not sure if it was because the store is out of the way, but I received hardly any support, and only received direction with no feasible way to attain the goals. The store is in fact still struggling and they do nothing to truly fix it. I was unexpectedly laid off which was unfortunate because they then had to recreate the position recently and now try to fill it again. They just don't care and don't think things through. I also basically lived at the store, which I suppose, in my desire to be successful was my own decision, but the hours for managers suck - They just really stink all the way around and I very very rarely ever give bad reviews."
bad,Employees were expected to be at work for forty hours a week and barely given paid vacation days. Upper management is rarely there and often left work extremely early on the days they did show up. Shoved most of the work onto department managers who were required to sometimes both open and close the establishment. Not worth putting effort in seeing as there is little chance of advancement.
bad,"There was no trust in the shop, there was sales people stealing other sales people's sales. There was technicians screaming and yelling at each other. It is not a good work life could not trust the management at all."
bad,"Pep Boys is very shady and the upper management in corporate aren't too bright. Payroll is always wrong and they will manage to let TROWE (401k) steal money out of your check and keep it without your permission. "
bad,25 cents raise per year and barely any holidays off is a shame...Then add the 9 occurences per year not a good or professional job at all.  Employees with attitudes and littering all around the buildings..0 bonuses...Work till u get hurt. Them denied WC.  This is the worst of the worst to work for..such a greedy non caring job...with no future...a damm shame
bad,I two years I had at the end my forth area director and they had four changes above them as well. As far as moving up all I could see was sideways movement or outsiders coming in. I took the position with the understanding there was to be an 90 day evaluation which took place at 13months with a 2% increase. I can only say that nothing I was told every came true.
bad,"got the run around about pay, almost felt like i was shanghaied into working for the company, was told many things about pay and advancement but management never delivered, high turn around with technicians, no incentives to stay. no formal training programs, no organization, almost like the company looks for inexperienced service managers to run repair facilities. dirtiest shop i have ever worked in, have a hard time getting guys to clean up after themselves."
bad,"I had a manager & assistant manager who both hid in the shop so I was always working alone and non stop, many days did not get meal breaks had to greet & write up customers, get supplies for technician working on cars, answer phone, cash out customers deal with unhappy customers from poor customer service by manager & assistant, they were rude to customers & blamed me.  I enjoyed helping customers to get cars worked on & resolving their problems with their cars."
bad,"This company is okay if you like to work for a fast pace but low paying company. There is little to no room for advancement. Their health insurance benefits are not worth paying for, the deductibles are high."
bad,"Upper management seemed to change every 6 months. Constant change in direction do to change in upper management. Constant turn over with employees, do to hours and pay. Very hard to manage people and motivate them when things and procedures kept changing."
bad,If you want to work for a company filled with mid and high level management cronyism then welcome to pepboys.  This isn't from a disgruntled employee but a realistic one that believes in fair treatment to all not just the good ole boys... as is the case with most of pepboys.
bad,Working at this location was a real challenge. there was not enough business there. Upper management was not involved to say the least. Problems that arose with coworkers was not addressed. The best part of my job there was customers who came back and requested myself to perform the services they needed for their auto.
bad,"Don't work too hard. It will mean nothing. You will be treated just like everyone else, even the lazy ones. Hard work gets you nowhere at Pep Boys except tired and exhausted."
bad,The manager that I experienced on the retail side of thing was not experienced in the the repeat customer philosophy; save the customer money and they will be returning customers and speak highly of your location to their friends. Was disciplined for saving customers money but the manager's friends would do the same thing and they suffered no consequences. The manager had way too many friends and not enough managerial skills to separate them. The hardest part of the job was making nicey nice with employees that knew that they could do no wrong as they blamed their errors on the rest of the crew.
bad,The expectations placed on advisors and technicians are unrealistic for essentially an independent repair facility. Didn't have these types of goals when I was at a manufacturer dealership. Crazy!
bad,Poor management and training presented a hostile and frustrating work environment. There was no time available for family life and the expectations of area directors was unrealistic. HR and senior management have unprofessional relationships and it provides no real support for associates that worked under my leadership.
bad,but i had to leave pep boys cause there where very unprofessional the managers dint like to do nothing always left me alone in the store while they do their thing is a good company but bad employers.....
bad,"My experience wasn't long enough, but my short time there sent me looking for employment elsewhere. The pay was below minimum wage, the benefits were comical, pay increases were pennies and nickels, etc."
bad,"First of all the hours was really bad, I had to be at work at 8 in the evening and get off at 3 in the morning but I remember getting off at 3 our schedule time once the rest of the time I was getting off at 12 or 1 and the money wasn't good at all so when the COA watershed offered me the job I was more than happy and ready to leave Pep Boys Disturbution"
bad,"- Worked minimum hours and got cut early; sometime would get there and not even clock in which was illegal."
bad,"When I started at the Pep Boys there were 3 managers and 5 customer service workers. When I left there were 2 managers and me. A new gm took over in Jan. all the staff either quit or got let go. There was no replacing the staff that left. I gave it 8 months but still no support, just too much stress for one person running an operation of this size."
bad,"A typical day for me is maintain busy and finish tasks for the day. I multitask in Sales for Service, Retail, and Parts/Commercial department. I also pick up calls throughout the shift. I merchandise and manage audits/inventory. Data entry, filling, and filing forms is included. Customer service is the most important to the company, so I do the best I can. I came into this company not knowing anything about automotive and within the first year I learned to work for all departments. The hardiest part of my job is experiencing poor management, harassment, and discrimination. The most enjoyable part of my job is pleasing my customers as it strengthens my knowledge and communication skills."
bad,Pep Boys used to a excellent compnay to work for. Pay and benefits used to be good. Not anymore the company has LOST all sense of direction.
bad,pay was good store mgr was great but other management was not  experienced enough to know what he was doing.there for really good people lost their job because of him
bad,low pay wouldn't work for them again I have nothing much to say.
bad,"I enjoy the job ,  the pay is to low I don't break even .Get along with coworkers"
bad,"they hire kids to work as service writers, who then get their friends hired, who then get all the good work, and the experienced mechanics who have been there for years get next to nothing"
bad,"They will put you in a store by yourself and expect you to work wonders with little to no staff. No help doing anything, it’s hard to get a day off for drs. Appts or any other family events."
bad,"The job was a typical order fulfillment warehouse job. Management was nice at first touting they had an ""open door"" policy when it came to issues or suggestions. All that policy did was put you on their bad side if you brought issues to them. They see anyone who says more that ""yes"" as a disposable commodity. Some workers got on managements good side and then could work at leisure with next to no repercussions while the faster workers were sent to pick up their slack."
bad,I will not go back to this company ever again. If you ever get injured in this company they fire you while under doctors care leaving you with all bills then tell the department of labor that you quit.
bad,Lied to at interview. Told I would work every third weekend. I work every weekend. Had to argue with HR. To get my full four weeks vacation as stated.
bad,"Overworked and under appreciated "
bad,"I got hired as a driver. Only drove 30% of time. Not enough business for two drivers. Rest of the time was breaking down pallets and stocking shelves. No training on store operations but expected to perform them. Never felt welcome and I always felt like an outcast. No one would ever talk to you, When you tried to have a conversation with others they wouldn't converse in return. One person late every day, then take half hour restroom breaks, then go in company vehicle to pick up breakfast for everyone but you. Never invited on a breakfast or lunch run. Not that I personally care, but to show the culture in this place. "
bad,"Place is not the relaxed atmosphere to work at , very stressful and the pay is not good compared to the amount of work you have to do. Highly dont recommend working there."
bad,First manager who hired me was a good teacher... enthusiastic.... and friendly. Second and last guy made way too many mistakes. Of the original people there ... 6... not including the manager... 4 have left.
bad,"It really depends which store you work at. Management comes and goes, so does upper level management that really seems to be the big issue. Half the time you'll have a great manager the other half you will have a horrible one.  You'll never get a raise, you'll never be recognized, you'll never be looked at twice until you threaten to quit."
bad,"badly managed ,you can not learn noting more than a tire change or oil change and most of this repair comes back with catastrophic failure such as tire came of ,or no oil in engine,there is no joy for this place to work real bad management ,favorize their friends or family member big time"
bad,Pay isn't good for the type of back breaking work. Work conditions are not good either.  There never is a full staff in any department.  Work long hours in a warehouse with no ventilation.
bad,"Like any retail business change is always guaranteed. "
bad,"In the time that I worked with this company they have gone through 3 COE's and countless re-structuring. This in turn created an environment where all oversight positions solely looked out for there own jobs and created unrealistic goals, and when goals weren't met the little guy took the hit."
bad,always being told that something is going to happen but it doesn't. Management sucks and so does the company. Completely disorganized. Customer service also is not good either.
bad,During my time employed at Pepboys I have gained a lot of great and helpful experience. But it cost me a lot of stressful times. The store was constantly understaffed and was also struggling with deadlines. The only good part of working at Pepboys was the staff we did have. They were helpful and always willing to go an extra mile to help someone. I gained a lot of respect for them.
bad,Pep Boys is a ok place to work as long as the area. director likes you and you gravel at his feet. If you make the numbers he wants and more you are not recognized. So no recognition for hard work. The technicians run the shop not the managers or the service writers .
bad,"I worked usually 10+ hours a day and the service manager when he came in would stay out in the shop and not come inside to help with the customers, many days I worked all day without getting a lunch break, the assistant manager was a mechanic before promotion to assistant & still has that attitude and stays in the shop most of the time on his phone & smoking cigarettes.  It is hard to work alone from writing up the customers that came in, answering the phones,  speaking to customers with recommended services, getting the parts needed for services sold, then finishing the paperwork invoicing out work orders and bringing customers to register & having them pay for services."
bad,I was happiest when assisting customers.  The downside was that there were logistical issues and it could be a nightmare at times.  As a part-time employee you took whatever you got in hours.
bad,manager had anger issues and was not an easy person to get along with delegated his own tasks to other employees and myself because he did not want to perform them himself.
bad,Came in as a MIT with plans to take over a store. Was given a position with very little support and turns out not given time to turn the business around. NO support from upper management- they remind me of a clown outfit.
bad,"I was relied upon to take care of everything happening in the front of store to include advising duties, retail, and parts while other co-workers were playing on their phones all day in the back."
bad,"Unrealistic goals, unsatisfiable requirements, pay rate does not reflect long hours and work weeks, unprofessional upper management and administration, lack of guidance and support, bonuses offered to compensate are not attainable.  Job stability is a constant worry and lack of follow through on protocol."
bad,"Pep-boys is a nice place to work for experience but the leadership there is not strong and unproductive very unorganized now room for their employees to grow and have it is difficult to expand your acknowledgement in this company there were minimum communication between the customers, service advisers and the Technicians"
bad,Working at Pep Boys has taught me many thing. I have learned a lot about cars and I obtain very good communication skills by working with lots of customers day by day.
bad,"Not your typical fast food restaurant. Its fun to work at if seasonal or temporary. take as part time not full time. not a career job, more like a summer job"
bad,"Not a bad place to work to earn an income while you go to school or look for something better. Job isn't too hard, but can be stressful when understaffed. Management often does not keep their promises and pay is low with laughable raises. The best part of this experience is the friends I have made while working here."
bad,"Upper management continues to yell if quotas are not made. Company is only concerned with money. Lots of greed within this company. Excessively charging people for repairs they probably don't need. Not concerned about family time or family issues. Meaning no quality time off. Actually, no days off, especially the weekends. Work excessive amount of hours for little pay. No perks what so ever. No lunch time. Health insurance is junk. When the company was taken over, it was worst. Go find a job some where else."
bad,"On a day to day basis it was the same, Clean the shop then work on and move out any vehicle that came in. what I learned wasn't all different from what I learned in the army except the only difference was the vehicle were domestic and not made for combat. My co-workers and I weren't involved, we had a work relationship and that was it. the hardest part of the job for me was trying to remember every procedure."
bad,"the district managers seem as if they never worked in the field"
bad,"Managment doesnt get it"
bad,"At this point, the management is just hanging on and managing quarterly results. There is no clear vision or leadership. Cronyism is out of control and moral is at an all time low... Truly unfortunate."
bad,"The lower level management ranges from fine to excellent. Store managers do the best they can with what they're given and they aren't given much. Decisions made at VP level are either miserly or mystifying. Corporate policy changes rapidly and usually without warning. Pay is below average and do not expect a raise, EVER, regardless of performance. At the time of this review, the company is on the rocks and preparing for either a change of hands or to be broken apart. Stores are severely understaffed, scheduling is in constant flux, and time off is difficult to arrange without burdening your coworkers."
bad,"Great job environment in professional retail and commercial sales and customer service in the auto industry, low hours and pay, poor management and scheduling."
bad,I only worked for the company about 5 months. I can say the GM and asst manager were some of the best people there. they were fair and worked hard. If my compensation would have been a little better and received full benefits then I would have considered staying longer.
bad,"Upper management (corporate) often has little care for store level employees, often totally ignoring them unless a complaint is filed or it's time for an audit. Benefits are lacking, and the pay is far from competitive. Upper supervisors do little about incompetent management so toxic managers are allowed to circulate in the company for years. Overturn is high even for retail, which is explained by the terrible management and poor compensations."
bad,"If not for the money I would never work for Pep Boys.  If not for the money I would never work for Pep Boys.  If not for the money I would never work for Pep Boys."
bad,"their mentality was to keep you there as long and as often as possible, and bragged the compensation and retirement was fantastic completely forgetting we wanted equal time at home with family instead of constantly working away from family"
bad,Lied about my advancement opportunities to get me in the door in order to fill a spot.Manager then transferred out 3 months later and was replaced by someone else much less qualified.
bad,"Growing up working around cars my entire life I knew my way around them fair and square. At times the district manager was ok and understanding, however occasionally they would bring in new district managers that looked down upon any females working there."
bad,"10-12 Hour days for manager, dm never satisfied with improvements, even after store years of abuse and neglict.  "
bad,"If you are coming into this company as a mechanic be prepared to recieve minimum wage for busting your a**. Ive worked 58-70 hours a week and the jobs aren't there at times. Some other coworkers are nice some don't like new people. Management is slow to fix pay issues, corporate leaves the service dept out to dry, most of the equipment is older"
bad,"Pep Boys is a fast pace, stressful environment. Upper mgt only looks at customer complaints and not accomplishments. If you have no experience in the automotive service field, you may want to start here. Be forewarned, you will always be wrong and get little support from management."
bad,"While working for just brakes buisness was always slow because of a lack of grassroots efforts according to upper managment, People dont want to pay 3500$ for a contaminated brake system replacement. customers almost always disagreed with final price after parts and labor. Waving the sign didnt bring anybody in but bottom feeders the type of people who want to get the 17.99$ oil change and nothing else."
bad,A very stressful environment for employees- sell-sell sell-  feels more like a sweatshop than professional auto repair facility. Upper management are only result oriented. They appear never to have heard/understand the phrase consult selling to solve customer concerns/problems
bad,Stressful place to work when I worked there. Prior corporate run management had sales associates doing everything from answering phones to writing service for vehicles. This includes having knowledge of every car part and retail item all while helping phones customers and keeping service customer up to date on how their vehicle is getting serviced. Now I hear it has new management and services are now separate for works
bad,Instead of promoting from within they try to steal other companies managers. They change the company policies all of the time and usually the employee loses out on pay with every change. This company only cares about their best salesman and those who have a bad month or week are relieved from duty or relocated to other stores until they decide to leave company.
bad,Very high turn over rate. Not enough staff to provide excellent customer service. Over worked and very stressful enviornment. In a period of 2 years I went through 5 general managers.
bad,pep boys had a sever identity crisis when i worked there.  every two months they'd come up with brand new way of doing business. they would not stick with a program long enough to see if it worked.
bad,"Decent company to work for , all employees are friendly , there are better pay outside. Customers are friendly , the hardest part of the job is that there are  a lot of physical movements so if you're the lazy type , this is definitely isn't the job for you"
bad,"Management wants work done,but the company is short staffed. When I started working there, work was flowing perfectly before workers started quitting."
bad,The store I worked at I made good money but felt bad for the gsts as they are over worked and underpaid. I was a service advisor and didn't make money unless I sold a lot
bad,The management I had at my store and within the company to help employees was terrible to put it lightly. The area director was fired and you had no support from corporate.
bad,If you don't have a second income you have to live at home with mom.  In California for a technician with tools by labor law it's 21.00 per hour minimum you must sign a waiver that you will accept (per agreement) 16.00 per hour 5.00 less than lawfull minimum wage. That's 200.00 per week less than minimum. They also pay less than flat rate law guidelines ( in California) by the time you spend 50.000 minimum for tools to work for 10.00 an hr take home with no benefits. Mc Donald's  is a smarter choice for a person that wants to learn on customers cars and get paid its ok for a real tech that needs to make 400 a week till the next job it's ok.
bad,Recently acquired by much larger organization.  Now struggling with integration of work process and corporate direction.  Local managers have limited HR experience.  Some flexibility with scheduling. Entry level wages with no formal review process or career path modelling available.  Interaction with customers was highlight of each day as we worked to satisfy their needs.
bad,For my job I basically do more than what my job description and salary have me do. I'm trained to work basically the whole store but doesn't seem to break the two digits in pay rate.
bad,"typical day spent selling, to be expected, cleaning, meeting,greeting customers, setting floor displays"
bad,"not a good experience managment were mean.Hard labor very little pay.great location. Unwelcoming,I wouldnt recomment anyone to work here."
bad,"Ensured the prompt and correct delivery of auto parts to customers, stock and inventory merchandise, loss prevention, customer satisfaction, enter stock into computer system, order special delivery parts."
bad,"Bad managers, worse service writers. Inventory is never correct, you spend hours chasing your parts and tires around. Seems like all they want to sell is tires. Manager has his favorite Techs and takes care of them. Techs come and go as they please regardless of schedule."
bad,Its a retail store based on sales no room for advancement I would recommend to someone looking for a part time to make extra money.
bad,The paid is very low and your asked to do a bunch of extra stuff for 7.85 An hour.Its a rip off to work as hard as I do for 550 every two weeks.I went to school for this occupation to fix cars and this place makes me regret it.
bad,"I worked with some smart people. For that alone it was nice to gain the knowledge. But the hours were abysmal. I never knew my schedule, I never had a weekend off. Barely EVER a weekend day. Toward the end my manager left and Pep Boys had no one to replace him so I was working without one and had to take up the slack for the missing person. It resulted in being totally burnt out and fed up with the company. The hardest part of the job was the customers and the job itself. A service dept is not easy and I expected an argument everyday."
bad,"Company is up for sale and I dont care for the direction the company is going, they also have taken away our ability for comissions"
bad,"the typical day for work is you come in clock-in, get yourself ready for the first assignment or vehicle and do the job correctly and finish in a timely fashion. My co-workers are some of the best but you have some that would stab you in the back cause you got the job they wanted. well the hardest part is trying to satisfy the customers"
bad,Management is poor. Work is hard. Customers are not informed of dangers in driving with things wrong with cars.
bad,"PepBoys is all about great customer service, no doubt, they bend over backwards to give their customers everything they want, even if it means trouncing their employees. As an employee, you mean little and are quickly replaceable. Forget family life if you are a manager, you will be in the store a minimum of 60 hours per week. Their motto should be ""It is all for PepBoys and PepBoys for PepBoys"". They pay a halfway decent salary (mid 40's) for the managers, but, when you divide your salary by the hours they want you to work, you aren't making much by comparison. They only observe two holidays, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, open all the rest with no time off or overtime compensation for any of the other holidays. They have lost lawsuits brought from employees in class actions in the past, then do the same thiong under a different disguise, long hours without proper compensation, butwhoam I,thnxt one wilforce anothrchange to continue to under py their people. PepBoys spends more effort in making the company look good than keeping good employees, for them they only care that you are working to make them a dollar."
bad,This company has nothing to offer or advance. Same work load everyday. Very boring! Not learning much. A lot of cut and paste in Excel. I like being more active in my position.
bad,the company will not work with you if you have major medical problems occur they force you to quit or try to have the medical team working with you file false issues.
bad,Nothing ever exceeded my exaptation and also let me down sometimes. management was sub par and commination wasn't the greatest. Hours were all over the place.
bad,The boss here was a very active dude he acts nice at first but the longer you are there he starts to act rude and all mighty on top of all he acts like he is the best.
bad,The job in its self is not hard but the management is very poor. Favorites play a big part here so if you like to brown nose and kiss butt this is the job for you.
bad,Management does not know how to keep the work coming steadily. Trucks are not broken down throughout the day. Some trucks sit there all day and then get broken down at night when it's time to go home which cause us to have to stay much later.
bad,"fun and wholesome but no advancement opportunities, sometimes its hard to get any help from corporate offices. Upper management is lacking in strength as well."
bad,The complaints would be that of the customers more than the workplace. Be prepared to work with the bottom of the barrel customers. The ones that alwaya try to get something for free. The Northern California Area Manager is spineless and will alwaya agree with the customer because he has 0 Mechanical Inclination and cant see that something would physically not be possible. Other than that the work environment is awesome.
bad,"Very stressful work environment / Unreachable goals / "
bad,"when i was on the clock i was expected to perform two peoples job at the same time. As a loop driver, they wanted me to ""drive safe"" but then urged i did the deliveries faster."
bad,"AS with any corporate ran facilities, the bottom line is productivity."
bad,I would prefer to not write anything here but I have to. It is a mess of a place to work and with no real management that treat you terribly. Save yourself and don't apply.
bad,"Typical work day involves working well with others to maintain work flow. In the case of service working well with the store (a separate entity, and commercial again another separate entity)"
bad,Was bought out and immediately went downhill. Stopped paying their techs what they deserve. Changed payment for certain services to much less and forced emplyees to do it or quit
bad,"No real direction, it was a job that paid the bills. Management changes so much you never really know what you are supposed to do. I had 6 managers in 2 years"
bad,Hours were given to employees who did not complete the work. The managers showed favoritism toward certain employees. The work was not distributed fairly.
bad,worked really hard to reform the commercial parts and even some parts of the stores that were outside of my scope. never really rewarded my efforts either.
bad,"The job required of you is simple and easy work. The difficulty comes when management isn't qualified for the job their in. As with any other job, it makes one dread coming into work when they person above you knows how to brown nose and get away with not doing almost anything at all. Its a shame."
bad,My last manager there was terrible to work with.  He never gave me work to do other than clean the shop.  Never talked to you as a person but more as property.
bad,"I started work at 7 A.M and worked until 6 P.M most days, got 30 to 45 minutes for lunch. Management was taught that you got all or nothing from the customer that came down from Corporate."
bad,"I heard more perverted  stories from the mechanics than I care to acknowledge. As a commercial delivery driver, I often had clients that would say inappropriate things to me about how I looked. Also, this place is more costly than others. Don't buy the brake kit that they try to sell you in addition to your brake pads. It is literally just a scam to make more money."
bad,Very poor management. Most employees seem as if they don't want to be there. You will always start off minimum wage regardless if you are working retail or customer service.
bad,The job duties of an Auto Service Advisor may include: Greeting customers and scheduling service appointments. ... Writing service orders and descriptions of problems and repairs. Translating customers' repair problems into standard repair terminology. Explaining repairs to customers.
bad,This job was just a job. They're really isn't much of recognition with the job for driving around and delivering parts. Remember your working for people that something bad has happened to their vehicle.
bad,terrible leadership. terrible culture. terrible pay.; commission rate is very low. im talking 1 or 2%. really not worth it as most people wont spend that much. the people that can afford to spend a lot go to dealerships
bad,"pep boys doesnt care if you have a family, doesn't care what your schedule is, doesn't care about you, period. I wouldn't go back ever and don't recomend anyone work there"
bad,Not a fan of corporate jobs that push for higher profits that put a strain on its workers that lead to unethical actions. The stress definitely  not worth it at all.
bad,"I learned customer service skills, cash handling, quick problem solving skills, learned to work independently, learned how to work with the public         ."
bad,"i have learned a lot from other mechanics in this field. they have shown me a lot of new things. its a good place to work at, friendly environment but poor customer service."
bad,"They expect too much work from you and leadership is horrible, and they dont validate you your just another number in the system which they operate..."
bad,Really was looking forward to getting my promised raised. I ran over the counter operations as well as commercial driver position. Pepboys is not a promising company; felt unappreciated.
bad,If you are a female this is not a place to work they do not treat you the same and are disrespectful even when you prove yourself. The pay is unsteady.
bad,"This maybe a good first job to learn from if you don't mind first job pay for most positions.The people I worked for and with were great and very knowledgeable. I learned quite a few things from this job, some good mechanical skills, as well as some bad employment experiences. I can only speak from my experiences at Pep Boys. I started out as a General service technician and left as one. I was there for three years, and left there making the same amount as the first day I started. I have 11 years experience in automotive repair. I was highly praised by staff and management. I attempted to relocate cross state with the assurance (from upper management) that there would be a position for me; needless to say I am no longer employed by Pep Boys."
bad,Week days and weekends work required. Must be friendly and customer ready. Fast pace jobs and customers questioning everything.
bad,"i will have to say this has been the worst job i have ever had, the lack of employees on top of the lack of people who are will to work that are employed was very frustrating. their no appreciation and recognition for the hard work you do. just overall a very terrible job to work at fir very little pay"
bad,"Corporate company, does not care much about the little man.  Very hard to move up the corporate ladder unless everyone loves you.  Promotions not based on skill but on personality and who you get along with."
bad,Unsteady workflow from day to day. Lack of staffing for those needs. Too many employees on slow days and lack of employees on busy days. Lack of employee accountability.
bad,"Oversee Auto Brake Repairs. Acquired Brake Repair Knowledge, Management inconsistent, Co. manager -Alcoholic on the job, Mechanic, same. Job not hard nor enjoyable."
bad,"The company did not stand, by there words at all. They was not honest about team work. A lot of there manager are lazy for a fact"
bad,I been at Pepboys for 3 years and I feel like I'm not getting no were and no one cares for there co workers I wish that I could get a job were people matter
bad,Managed parts and employees but was forced to chose between family and work. Day to Day parts sale and managing employees
bad,"Pep Boys pays terribly, but offers pretty competitive benefits.  They are open 363 days a year, guaranteeing to miss family time on holidays.  The company, from the executive side, is more of a revolving door than the actual shops.  CEOs and the like continually leave, as well as district managers."
bad,"They do not care about their people. Worked in the Merchandise Planning/Planogram department and the Assisant Vice President and Director are evil self centered people, yet they still have jobs.No communication or recognition. We would have to celebrate both the Assistant Vice President and Director's birthday but nobody else in the department got a birthday party hmmmmm."
bad,I did enjoy my co-workers for the most part but it is a revolving door. Management frequently discuss their displeasures with there position at several store. Cooperate employees are out of touch and there is a lack of praise for a job well done. It seems no matter how hard you work Corporate finds some sort of flaw. I didn't see a raise in years. The job is an easy one no matter the position but the computer systems frequently freeze and are outdated. My fellow employees got me through my day and made the job enjoyable.
bad,"Got this job through a temp agency, and it wasn't bad at first.  After a year and a half, I received a 25 cent raise only, I took a lot of verbal abuse from management, and there was no positions open to advance even if I had stayed for a few more years.  I made productivity 80% more than others.  I worked weekends and holidays when no one else wanted to.  I did a lot for the company, and felt I was getting no where.  The benefits are expensive and doesn't save you much,  no matter what type of employee rating you get on evaluations you will still receive the same 25 cent raise.  Was not happy with this business at all, and will not be going back to work for this company.  This company totally takes advantage of their hard working employees and reward the lazy ones."
bad,"after almost a decade there I literally started from the bottom as a part time lube tech. I worked my way to full-time and then tech.  I went to the desk and then Ast. Mgr until finally reaching Svc. Mngr status.  The company being a corporation obviously looks out for its own pockets and I actually understand that.  What I don't understand is how it frequently changes its ideas, its goals, and most recently its culture. Way too many chiefs and not enough Indians in upper management puts too much pressure and responsibilities in an always changing environment. Worst of all, the lack of recognizing talent  forces the overworked and under paid employees to seek jobs elsewhere causing a high turnover.  I strongly believed that one day I would retire a happy PBYs employee. Now, I am more than happy to take all that I have learned over the years and apply myself towards bettering myself and my family."
bad,"most of the time busy work but winter it gets slow "
bad,Good for starters in the automotive field or people who have been in the field for a long period of time. They want speed over quality however and I prefer quality. Do the job right the first time and you wont have problems later. Was with the company for a short time first time I was laid off second they fired me just because my production was low on slow days.
bad,"Making the schedule, inventory team, store resets, new store opening, receiving weekly truck, testing car parts."
bad,Just Brakes is a profit driven company with little regard for the customer or employee.
bad,"This is where i grew my knowledge in the automotive industry and I'm very thankful for that, although i didn't really receive much appreciation for the workers here and many of the management above me were so closed minded they didn't believe in people going to school to receive a education they only believed in working. And that is the reason i quit this job to pursue my career as an accountant  and look at the big picture and extend my boundaries from being a assistant mangers to one day working for a large firm."
bad,"A typical day at work was clocking in and walking around the store helping customers and checking the shelves to see which items can be replenish, counting the safe, and cycle counting all items. There was nothing enjoyable about this job, and the management catered to customers who where wrong about something just so they would not lose a customer, and then tell the employee to do any and everything not to lose a customer or sell"
bad,no place to work if you want to make money. but if want to make no money and have fun this is the place for you.
bad,"wasnt great at all, management never cared about customers and workers"
bad,If you like working 14 hours a day 7 days a week or 3 hours a day 2 days a week you will get over worked and managements anwer to everything is to call you out in the middle of the floor and yell at you.
bad,a typical day at work is N/a
bad,"I started as a driver but ended up working in the store as a Cashier, parts counter, and stock clerk. All around this job was thumbs down."
bad,"The day would begin with email and calendar review followed by planning out, hour by hour, method of attack to ensure all tasks were complete by COB. The sales reps were contacted, sometimes the distributors had to be called, most days planograms were created either virtually or physically in our mock store in the basement of the building. At the end of the day, upper management had to give the final blessing in the form of a ""walk-through"" and then the sign-off was given. The most enjoyable part of this job was the immediate satisfaction of task-completion."
bad,We helped guests and signed them up for rewards cards. I learned a lot about cars.
bad,I worked there for six months and I saw a lot of favoritism ..I was told I was gonna get paid by hour...A week from the first day they told me they were gonna pay for every car I fixed..Pep boy hardly have like 10 customers per day..With like 5 empleyees..We only got a car or two...And gave the better jobs to the favorites
bad,rinigng on the register all day long stocking selves answering the phones helping customer get the parts that they need. putting up the truck shippment weekly. Managment was okay but not great. Co-worker did not want to help u wiith any thing.
bad,"Small, dirty, too many workers, not enough skilled techs, not enough business, management will lie to you constantly. Skilled workers advanced quickly!!! Other master techs will teach you if you are willing to listen. hardest part of job was waiting for there to be work."
bad,they dont care about there employees. the time I worked there I was never allowed vacation time
bad,"After transfering to another location, the job became too much to handle, management was under- trained, and the positive impact I had work hard to maintain was put into jeporady."
bad,"I worked for Pepboys for a year and half, doing everything from service writing to inventory stocking to cashiering. The people I worked with reminded me of being in high school. I cannot forget, however, that problems brought to the attention to management and HR were constantly swept under the rug."
bad,"Immediate supervisor has a positive, can-do attitude and backs up his employees. However, a typical day working at the service desk is very stressful and nerve-wracking due to:  impatient, demanding and rude customers, and due to an antiquated computer system that is slow, not user friendly, and causes excessive wait times while servicing customers. The district manager, who is the immediate upline to my manager, is callous, humorless, and he is one of those in management to blame for driving us employees like slaves. For this reason and others, I am constantly on the lookout for a better job."
bad,Like working with the people in the shop. Service writers are lazy don't want to get paid like we should we're checking out vehicles. Flat rate pay sucks no work no money
bad,It definitely depends on the store that you work at. But the one I worked at was bad. Poor management. Made us do stuff we were not supposed to do. The back was always unorganized because thy did not knew what to do to organize it properly.
bad,"I only work part time but the new store manger is great but I get no "
bad,"manager micromanages, so fairly taxing. Consistent work which is good. The offer free classes to get certificates in the field which is good for people who plan on staying in the field"
bad,"When I first started it was a decent place, but then as the company tried to change the upper management started to make promises then not fallow through. They would tell you they would have help come over to get your store straight after being tossed in to a new store then not fallowing through for six months. Eventually one gets the job done but it sucks to told help is on the way while you spend 60 hours in your store or more a week to catch up. They really like to burn and turn managers I guess."
bad,"First off there is no family life for a manager,there were times I worked 12 straight days 11-12 hours each day no overtime and no thanks got the same pay as if I worked a 5 day work week,"
bad,As an automotive technician i diagnosed and repaired multiple systems stemming from basic oil changes to brakes and drive train. A typical day is me inspecting crucial elements of the vehicle starting as i first get in the car. Does the A/C work? Do the breaks squeak? The typical day was enjoyable when busy because i like a fast paced enviroment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The mananger would sell services on vehicles that we could not preform such as brake fluid exchamges or coolant exchamges because our machines did not work and he refused to call it in to fix them. On top of that he would try to question and override what even the lead techs had to say about a vehicle to make it safe soley just to create a larger customer purchase.
bad,"I've worked for pepboys for 5 years and though I have met many great people there, management and lack of days off for the past 5 months I Feel like my store and management does not care about it's employees."
bad,thi8s place sucks its the most dead end job you could probably find do your self a favor and skip over this one and apply to a place that ac=tually care
bad,"Management was terrible on many fronts. Felt like because I am a woman, I could be walked over. They added lots to workload with no compensation or advancement."
bad,Basically you have to be a slave to work here and you are replaceable at any time. Can't really learn anything when you are not trained when you are hired.
bad,"poorly run stores"
bad,this was a pretty simplistic job really just need to be good with numbers and know a little information about a car. it was a pain to try and get promotions even when you are doing good
bad,"Favoritism, service manager has never been a mechanic of any kind and is inexperienced when it comes to working on a vehicle."
bad,"Minimul advancement available: You are hired as part time but, you work full time hours, no benefits and scheduling is never consistant."
bad,"Employees, all for the most part, get along. Work environment more relaxed. That being said promotions are being held off due to restructuring of higher management. Min pay increases only once a year below national cost of living increases. Also rumors of PTO time being taken away or reduced next year."
bad,"Employees steal your sales and management wont do anything about it. Pay is good but there is no advancement, if your of color, not the best place for people of color."
bad,"I have worked for Pep Boys for 7 months.  Work environment is good.  I appreciated the free uniform service.  Wages and commissions are low.  It is difficult to make decent pay as a full-time service writer.  The training program is minimal.  The computer system is not very user friendly.  This is a decent place for part-time or short-term work, but I would non make a long-term career here."
bad,It was an ok company but had some major flaws.  Most of the time there were to many people and not enough cars.  You spent most of the time cleaning their shop for free.  The management never pushed business and just kind of stood there.  If anyone over them came in you had to look busy or you were fired.  It was a very stressfull environment.
bad,If you don't have experiance don't work here. It is a flat rate job and you will make no hours cause the good jobs will got to the people that been there longer then you. plan on working 40 hours but getting paid only about 10.
bad,"Opening the store, getting all computer systems ready for the start of the business day. Making sure all employees are ready for work. Then greeting all the customers at the door and asking what there needs are for there vehicle."
bad,"When you are first hired, they promise you the world but they end up betraying you. They flood the shop with techs so that nobody ever reaches there flat rate amount and so you end up with this pro-rated amount of money which is basically min wage. My day usually consisted of the morning rush of oil changes and upsells that never happened or were worth recommending. I learned that you cannot build a career here, if you are a high school grad and know ""righty tighty, lefty loosey"" and a heartbeat-then you're hired. The co-workers were great when I worked their and after the morning rush, we ended up just sitting in our lawn chairs killing time. The company doesn't pay you enough to care about the customer, store, or pepboys profits, you only care about yourself. The hardest part of the job was motivating yourself to get up in the morning to a job that didn't respect you or reward you for hard work unless the area manager came around and bought a pizza for the shop (which was basically a slap in the face). I enjoyed when it was slow I could work on my own car and get paid for it. Like I said in the beginning it's a great place to work if you're a high school grad and want to learn by trial and error but not for a master tech like myself-you can't support a family on pepboys pay!!!"
bad,"clean,stock,repair and maintain vehichles, selling parts, cashier, data entry"
bad,"Began time at Pep Boys as salesman, then parts manager, 2nd assistant store manager and finally 1st assistant store manager. As a manager, I was responsible for the day to day operations on the store side. Scheduling, Inventory Control, Merchandising, Training, Loss Prevention, Employee Evaluation and Customer Service were all part of my duties."
bad,generally had good days.  stores seemed to stock more garage accessories than auto parts. 
bad,• Managing Sales
bad,Working with my co-workers ensuring work was accomplished to the expectation and the costumer were satisfied with the service is the most enjoyable part of the job. A smile and the appreciation I never forget. The hardest part of the job is when the costumer had a bad experience and trying to compromise the situation with not success. Working as a manager fulfilling the expectation of the company and keeping the employees satisfied is a great feeling.
bad,"Check in with manager and review my orders for the day. Sometimes there were no orders so we would stock store shelves or call customers to check if they need anything from store, so we can deliver it to them. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customer."
bad,"The managers we had at first were awesome and understandable, but then management changed and it was horrible"
bad,"no advancement opportunities. would say one thing and never live up to it.  would talk about pay raises and it wouldn't happen, good equipment, and new racks"
bad,"To get the big money you need to complete big jobs like changing engines transmissions , axels, or suspension parts. Doing oil changes will get you paid minimum"
bad,cant speak for every pepboys but my shop definitely had down time. and with only a 20 hour a week grantee some pay checks were really slim during the slow season. my first manager was really good but he moved on to corporate and then we had a couple of new managers that were not so great.
bad,"Managers and I worked hard to keep things running as smoothly as possible, but were consistently held back by our bosses' bosses telling us to make more money while at the same time cutting hours, cutting hiring, and wanting us to do more and more to bend over backwards for customers which limits how many people we can actually help.  They tell you to drop everything you're doing to help a customer in need immediately, and then get angry when projects don't get done on time.  Overall it's a stressful and toxic environment that at any point may change your job title just so they can start paying you a fraction of what they previously did, even though your responsibilities don't actually decrease."
bad,Working at Pep Boys was very interesting. Trying to adjust and read people for who and how they really are. The work can be fun at times and frustrating when things get hectic.
bad,a start up for your career as coming out of tech school but after a few years its time to move up compensations isn't good and depending on management you move up or don't
bad,"Pep Boys as a company is great to work for, good benefits, always opportunities for extra training. The current manager will make sure you have no life, doesn't care if you're sick, and refuses to take responsibility for any wrong doing, any employee slacking, or anything that he has actually done unless has gotten him or the company money. There are techs that work there that should not, there are regulations that are not being followed under his supervision, and customers that are being lied to. I would readily return to Pep Boys under any other manager."
bad,"This job is great and all, but it is too corporate. They change pay structures without warning and after you've been working for a good amount of time and doing great at your job you end up getting screwed over with a pay CUT instead of a raise. Makes no sense and is bs, currently looking for another job."
bad,They really just hire bodies. In Technicians and management. Quality isn't what they look for and business constantly drops. Finding quality seems to hard for them and people that bring hope to the business and is clearly visible in customer reviews are turned down or not recognized for their deeds.
bad,"While not a bad company to work for, management above store level kept changing around resulting in major gaps in logistics and placing immense stress on store level management"
bad,"I am not one to berate, or boast for that matter. But, I have been consistently disappointed with my employ here. The most enjoyable part of my day was being around an enormous variety of automobiles, the hardest part of my day is justifying to myself the sub-standard pay and the constant mantra of ""do more with less""."
bad,The hardest portion of my typical day at Pep boys is with my experience in the automotive industry as an A-tech I am in charge of all deliveries from checking in are shipment to the proper restocking of products. Keeping track of our stock level of daily used products. Helping the sales person and manager with sales and customer request and complaints
bad,"lack of work,i learn a lot of thinks ,poor management,work on team,the schuledetime, ilearn to many new thinks"
bad,"Co-workers and store management made the wokplace fun. I learnd all 3 fileds of the autmotive nusniess from wholesale, retail, and auto service department. The hardest part was the computer system(old) and parts on hand to provide the customer with the best experience was not good. The company was a learn as you go be thrown to the wolves, yes they did offer computer training but computer training is not always the best. Working with an actual trainer (human being) is first best. I trained myself by asking questions and common sense. Manage ment were always good especially if you knew the for a long period of time in the work place. A typical day at work rather not say."
bad,worked very hard but long time employees looked down on that . Store Manager was  more wrapped up in his personal life then taking care of the store. Assistant manager was more the store manager then the real store manager was.
bad,"Three mgrs in 3 months as upper mgmt wouldn't supply needed equipment. "
bad,They work you until you hurt yourself then they let you go the manager can do as they please and nothing is said they seem to like promoting bad managers
bad,"The people in store are usually pretty great. It’s the corporate level that is ran so terrible. Everything constantly changes and no one is ever on the same page. Anything above a regular employee does not pay anywhere close to enough. Assistant managers should be getting more than $11 - $13 an hour. Especially when they have been there a few years. But it is a decent place for part time work if you just want to make a basic paycheck. They are also pretty good about last minute time off, etc."
bad,"poor management, undertstaffed, no help, stressful environment for service writers general public can be very rude "
bad,"Great place to gain automotive experience. You're able to work on multiple car manufacturers, which is crucial for automotive experience. Don't expect much from management though."
bad,this company is good for teenager  or students under the age of 18 with no responsibility for a home or for newly graduated high school students and hours and no overtime and very low salary.
bad,Was disappointed in my hours and pay. I liked working with my manager and coworkers. The pace was slow. Mansger worked with me when i had a medical issue
bad,It is all drama at this place. People with a lack of common sense and education are managing and taking care of customers vehicles. Lack of management and respect for employees.
bad,Lucky they hire just about anyone but the bad part is its basically a dead end job especially if your not in the service department. Ideal for entry level and and younger people
bad,"I'll keep it short. I worked really hard and advanced quickly within the past 7 months, I was promised two separate raises in the last couple months but still haven't received either of them. I can't currently afford my bills, so I'm looking for different opportunities."
bad,"Great place for an entry level employee.  Better for those in need of a part time gig in college or a trade school.  Fun atmosphere, mostly easy days, stocking shelves, helping customers."
bad,"Scan in product with pfc scanner, process in merchandise then stage product. Management was the typical but nothing crazy. Hardest part of the job was seating in one spot for several hours. Best part of the job was there was local restaurants was near."
bad,This place has a high turnover rate for a reason. Most of the people i worked with were unhappy working here. The pay was not that great. You also dont get paid till the work order closes. If you finish today and customer dont come for 3 months you get paid then.
bad,"Not a bad place to work as lomg as you have a good crew. I have learned that sales numbers and metrics are important. I have learned how to handle customer issues on a management level. There really has not been any tough parts of my days, I have established a routine which makes the days relatively smooth. the most enjoyable part is when the customers leave happy"
bad,"Working a pep boys was a part time job. The job is fair, pep boys always giving training classes. I learn too much about cars. I did made very good friends. It was fun working with this company."
bad,"Great Service Manager, gained sales knowledge as well as tire, automotive knowledge as a whole as well as how to deal with angry impatient customers. Enjoyed delivering excellent professional customer service while giving professional advice and assistance. Co-workers for the most part were cut throat.  I learned from the honest ones as well as the Management to do a proper job and follow rules in a safe manner.  Enjoyed selling proper product to satisfy the customer exceeding the customers expectation of customer service.  Typical day at work was selling tires, automotive parts, advice and replacement options.  The hardest part of the job was keeping an eye on my sales which were easily deleted and written up under someone else's name.  This was hard to track and lead to my departure."
bad,"Good commitment by associates but not enough time to balance life with your family work is always open to serve the public."
bad,This company is very unorganized. I would not suggest anyone to become an manager with this company.
bad,"No work"
bad,The company structure is not the best. They take too much time to give you a raise and once you receive it is just pocket change. The only thing I liked here was the people that I worked with.
bad,"pepboys will work you till your tired and not pay you enough money, I unfortunately did it for 2 years"
bad,Always understaffed and long hiring process. Not enough work/life balance. Almost impossible to get in contact with area director or above including corporate  office.
bad,"service vehicles of all types in as timely a manner as possible, regardless off volume [of workload ]. learned many aspects of motor vehicle maintaninance. management at Niles Ohio store excellent, and supportive to employees. many different character types, [everyone has their similarities and differences, however, when one seems to have a really perplexing situation I found that everyone showed willingness to be helpful, espessially when one is new to the job. General maintainance personell espected [as per corporate rule] to do housekeeping in shop and grounds daily, as well as restock supplies, including inventory of [items used in shop]. what seem so unbalanced was fact that other personell [technitions or ""mechanics"" not responsible for house keepin or clearing thier own work areas, restocking etc. some would simply volunteer to assist, espessially if an employee found favor [in them]. Most enjoyable part of job was comradery should one perform job duties well an earn respect."
bad,"Everything is about sales. They push you hard over the phone to sell even when no customers have come in all day. Pay sucks and the level of professionalism of the employees is comparable."
bad,"If you like working directly with customers one on one, this is a place for that. The company has a hard time changing for the good. The have many little things you have to do that are time consuming and worthless. They have a few really good things as well."
bad,"Company is heading in the right direction but still needs a lot of work.  They are trying to engage employees more but don't have the slightest clue on how to do it. There are no opportunities for advancement as some of the people have been here for 20-30 years. Although some people should fired or let go, there is nothing that is ever done. Management is very stagnant and resistant to change, thus people sticking around forever ."
bad,"management is very dysfunctional, hardest part is working so hard and when its time to get your paycheck and it looks nothing like it should. The most enjoyable part is my co- workers are great."
bad,"This particular pepboy store was great to work for the first couple years. When management was rotated constantly there was no room for a female like myself to move up.  The company it self was not the issue, I believe the constant change in the district manager is what made this place a lot more difficult to work for.  My co-workers were great though out the years.  Hardest part of the job was never being good enough to move up in this company, when i worked my hardest to get there but management was rotating so much no one really got to know me to have me grow with them."
bad,"help customer with there need s on there vehicles, clean shop, helpful and friendly auto tech. help whenever needed"
bad,was a good job it was just to far to drive. It was a team system by management parts side and service side
bad,"Repair, replace & install parts, accessories, & lubricants. Operate hydraulic lift & other shop equipmentes."
bad,"It was a great place to work. It was fast paced and always on the go. I did deliveries and pick up for parts, so it was stressful at times, but also i was up for the challenge."
bad,"My typical day start with a saftey meeting preparing the day by checking scheduled appointments meeting qith all department manager Seevice,Retail ,Speed shop And commercial. Meet and greet every customer  handle all management problems and customer complaints"
bad,With the change to Pep Boys things went down hill as with most large corporations you become a number rather than a person and the management works on a buddy buddy system.
bad,Its your typical tire and lube job. Its low paying and you cant advance unless you go to school. You provide your own tools. No benefits or vacation time.
bad,"Was a full time employee working 30-40 hours weekly."
bad,There were a lot of issues with management. People were always quitting making it hard to know your place in the shop. Made very little money at pep boys.
bad,"Work here was a typical day in the shop, with all different variant of vehicles coming in for service.  Turnover was relatively high (in about 18 months I saw roughl y7-8 people come and go), and I felt mostly like another cog in the wheel without a lot of potential for advancement."
bad,Management does not care for it's employees.  Wages are good.  Hours range from opening the store or closing the store.  Lots of lifting of boxes and tires when truck makes delivery.
bad,"Lack of management, sexist management. Hired coworkers who had never even driven a car, much less knew anything about how to maintain them. Customers constantly irritated by lack of professionalism"
bad,"As a GST the hourly rate (not including the book rate) is too low, below minimum wage to be exact which is embarrassing. Associates should be paid weekly. If you are looking to earn certifications and become a technician you will see more money. The lunch break is an hour which is great although employees should get paid for that one hour being that the hourly rate is so low."
bad,"Pep boys offers a wide range of positions for automotive and management. If you are a student or new to this industry, this offers a good employer to gain experience."
bad,it was an ok job but theirs a lot of policies and dumb rules you have to follow.management is strict and will discipline you for almost anything. it was nice having all the parts u needed right there though.
bad,"It was a fun work place overall, but horrible staffing."
bad,"great place to work. loved working as a mechanic an helping people."
bad,"Management allow for flexibility in schedule, allowed to work independently with tasks presented simply, easy operation of software, inventory management system was simple."
bad,not so great to work with people who steal things and then blame it on someone else
bad,I worked there when the company was going through alot of turmoil and many things happened. I resigned because of how unstable the company was and how every single employee was pressureed to make sales in a failing economy.
bad,I was a new pepboy technician and the tools they had keep on coming up missing or not working properly. For an example one of the air hoses could not be shut off so they used vice grips to close the air way and air was constantly coming out of one of the air guns thru some cracks. Also they had technician that work there for a long period of time and made several mistakes. Since I was new for only a couple of weeks I heard several customers came in to complain one was wanting to take legal action. I was let go because I made one simple mistake with a car and I was new and the short weeks of working there I called the company and they said there insurace would paid for the cost of the mistake I have done. That was the only big mistake I have done while working with the company.
bad,"great company--learned all aspects of finance. company paid for my MBA, then promoted me."
bad,Not a good place to be. Corporate can never make up there minds and constantly contradict themselves.
bad,"Work was decent. I was always kept busy with jobs to do, from performing oil changes to cleaning and stocking the parts room. I learned quite a bit working there, especially about managing. I'm currently being trained to become assistant manager."
bad,"A typical day at work here for me would include coming in, going back to the parts counter, and checking the deliveries that were to be sent out that day. I'd take the deliveries in order of which they came in, fill the ones that weren't already filled, and be on my way to deliver them. I would always collect signatures upon delivery and sometimes payments. Due to the lack of poor training, and no one taking the time to teach me things, I honestly didn't learn much at all during the few months I worked here. New hires were required to start and finish training modules on the store intranet, before being sent to the floor. I needed more training than just staring at a computer screen for a few hours. I do a lot better with one on one training with another person, and actually being shown how to do things. My co-workers weren't very helpful. Like I mentioned, no one seemed eager to show me, someone new, how things were done, and where things were, so I could better help the customer. The hardest part of the job was being asked questions by customers at the parts counter, and having no idea what they were talking about."
bad,"This is my second stint with Pep Boys and I was terminated for nothing. I had been in line for the next Area Director position for over a year and I kept getting screwed over. Then they investigate you, terminate you, even tho the mistake was an honest mistake. When others do worst, they stay with the company. It doesn’t matter who you know, nobody has your back or try to defend you."
bad,When I was leaving to enter teh military I requested to have a couple days off the week prior and they refused so I had to quit to give time to my family before the transition
bad,The people you work with make the environment fun and the day go by faster. The company is changing a lot recently so I don't know if it's still the same as when I was there.
good,a typical day here is not bad at all. The more knowledge you have about cars the better because it is important to make sure the customer has everything they will need for the job they are working on. It's a friendly work environment. Customer base is great. Ive learned a lot about cars and how they run. Hardest part of the job is having a schedule that changes on a weekly basis. Sometimes you are opening and sometimes you are closing.
good,"its a good job if its your first job but not permant, been there for four years and its time to get out"
good,I'll learn that if you got hurt at shop they treat you same that I'm gaving big numbers to them. since I got hurt the shop is starting to go down and some of my co workers are quitting and some customers they trust the new management of the shop.
good,They really do not keep their promises to their employees. They say one thing and do the total opposite
good,"typical work day, get deliverys done and have tabs collected and paid by the end of the day."
good,"They loved ordering food for us and a lot of pizza. Which was nice on the days they made me skip my lunch break. I would often get threatened with possibly getting fired because of the turnover rate the auto parts business in general has. I was being disciplined for not being able to be in 2 places at once basically. Most of the time I was being scheduled as the only driver for the first 4 hours of my shift, then pretty much drive the next 5 hours doing deliveries. If I was lucky I would get a lunch break. I rarely ever got to work the register unless I was scheduled to close, so the commercial department was closed, so I was actually able to make the sales needed to get my boss off my back. He was a nice guy, but was extremely slow. I would say something and could tell it was going over his head."
good,I enjoy working here but their is totally no support from the Area Director nor the store management team.  The store manager has no clue how to run a retail store nor does he know anything about vehicles.  I started there last year and only 3 employees remain there that where there when I started. Toxic environment.
good,Pep Boys doesn't pay enough for the long hours you spend away from your family. You work hard all day and night for $10 a hour with a chance of commission. Meaning you can make commission but if your hourly is more than what you made on commission then you only get paid hourly and vise versa.
good,Your just a number and treated badly. You are expected to be available at any time and on a moments notice. Do your duties and others while the boss plays around when they are there.
good,A typical day was very long and didnot get to take a lunch a lot
good,Some staff who have been employed for some time are not receptive to newbies and make those new employees feel unwelcome. Managers have to be more proficiently trained to manifest leadership.
good,"Not the greatest company to work for but not the worst. The company tries to do a lot with the little it has, along with pushing the employees to the point of quieting on the spot."
good,"The retail area had great products simple enough to learn about to further help customers."
good,"Don't want to go back for a low pay rate, working everyday as an assistant Manager and still couldn't get a decent paycheck."
good,"No respect from the managers, They even  make you work in your lunch time. Technicians have to clean the Master techs mess. Not a friendly workplace.."
good,"Started working not knowing about cars, now I'm comfortable on the topic. There's much knowledge to gain, it's a good place to work, poor management.."
good,Working here taught me how to work with terrible peers. It taught me how to balance my school and personal life with my work. It taught me how to stay calm and collected when people stole from the store.
good,"The store i worked in was ok as far as management.. The hr department is h"
good,I loved boys in general but choices they were making were very poor choices. When cutting expenses they did not make the best choices. They would cut payroll to the point that you were not able to take care of customers properly but they were making new DVP positions left and right. It made no sense. Too many chiefs not enough Indians.. The team members are the ones out there in stores trying to make the company survive and working themselves into the ground because only 2 people would be on the retail side try and accomplish everything upper management ask to accomplish plus assist customers. unrealistic.
good,"manager not willing to move you up, not willing to work with your home life, lack of pay when not busy good company but lacks in managment"
good,"management at just brakes was terrible they never had the checks ready at the end of the week, they never had next week schedules done until monday so all weekend you dont know if you work or not next week, the managment at just brakes had no idea what they were doing and only cared about themselves"
good,"Upper management is out of touch with their stores. With a floor area the size of a small KMart, they often have less people than smaller parts stores. this leads to poor customer service, as employees are often at scattered through out the store working on tasks."
good,When I worked there is wasn't that bad. It was fun greeting customers and answer car care questions.
good,"Depending on the day; customer sales, stocking, front facing, cleaning and other tasks."
good,fun place to work. love helping customers find parts that no one else in town has or can get.
good,Pep Boys could be a good company to work for but the people I work with where not happy most of the time it just seem that if you try to talk to co works management would not be happy because you where not doing the job
good,"No Appreciation Whatsoever at this work place. "
good,Too much paper work no time to really take care of customers. So negative no pat on the back for a good job done. Associates have no advancement. They need to build a more positive attitude.
good,My reason for was because the new manager at the time I left refused me a day off even refused regular weekly day off. This interfered with my custody case and child care. The managers before were better able to handle things.
good,"Pep Boys is a good place to work if you have automotive experience and really need a job. Otherwise, avoid. Starting your career here isn't a bad idea, but Pep Boys tends to look bad on the resume of a more seasoned technician. They have a bad reputation built from hiring just about anyone, putting out shoddy work, and overcharging customers. If you can find work elsewhere, avoid."
good,"Pepboys has been around since 1921. Currently they pay well below industry standards. The management team currently works 50-60 hours per week, but can be over 80 hours per week, at times. Staffing is an issue due to lack of pay and little chance of advancement."
good,Enjoyed working at store and the other associates. Hours were good and pay was okay. Upper management was very unstable. Service policy's that came down from corporate were questionable .
good,It is a means to pay bills. It is a great venue to help people with their vehicle troubles. Other then personal ethics to help people it is NOT a company to build a career with.
good,Management hows too much favoritism. if you are part of the click you can do what you want when ever you want. i enjoyed the people i worked with. i learned alot about brakes and suspension
good,"Great for an hourly employee, not for a family provider to start out as a tech. flat rate is hard at this location for someone who has a family and has not work for tham before."
good,"time was short, company changes hours and cut programs in a moments notice to meet expectation's company expanded too fast"
good,"Was a good Job, Management dose not stick up for employees, Good Learning experience in how to deal with angry customers."
good,"Some days are busy, learned a lot about customer engagement, Management was poor, co-workers were awesome, Hardest part of job was not enough hours, most enjoyable part was making the customer happy."
good,its a good job for students and others working towards other career opportunities but dont see it as a career
good,it was fast pasted and helping customers was great. but i had to move to Oklahoma
good,"Selling and looking up parts for customers, answering  		   phones, restocking ,testing parts, and cleaning"
good,Although i worked there for 3 years the lack of management made it difficult to have a stress free work environment as many things were addressed threw corporate changes seldom-ed happened. This is the reasoning for me leaving to find better opportunities else where.
good,Worked was hard and long. But over all I liked it. Very busy place to work.
good,"i would basically do all the work no one else would do. i would go get food. if someone got griped at, it was me. im a good mechanic. im just not one to take that from co workers. especially when i deserve better. nothing about the job was hard. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able talk to the customers and makeing good connections."
good,I work very long hours. And they make me work on sundays because no one else will. They are constantly going through employees. And the management is very poor.
good,Very politically driven workplace.  It wasn't always about what you did or had to offer the Company.  It was more about how friendly you were with upper management.  If you performed well and worked well with others but didn't kiss the regional Managers butt you could lose your job at any time.
good,"Unfortunately, under the supervision of a mediocre supervisor, my experience at Pep Boys was short lived.  Even for an entry level position, I can not recommend this place for employment.  The Supervisor favored certain individuals from a bias standpoint.  Come to find out, he was arrested for stealing money.  Had management heard my concerns, these individuals would've been dealt with in a more proper time frame."
good,"Pep Boys has a vision, but in order to achieve it they would have to invest more time into employee development. Turnover is high and that is due to the lack of training offered."
good,It was a good place but they didn't care about seniority and safety of the workers. As people they were great but as management they need to work on that a bit.
good,Looking for places to work I believe government company has all the benefits and career advancement. Good place to work for someone in the 20s will be the septa bus
good,"It was a great experience working with pepboys. I learned a lot about business and management which really improved on my costumer service skills. Pepboys allowed me to improve on my management skills. I would say I worked harder then the average manager should. Anytime my associates needed assistance I didnt just give them advice on they needed help with, I would also demonstrate how to complete the task given to them."
good,it was okay i learned paperwork moved up to parts and service manager in a short period of time everyday was different we did displays almost every other day
good,Matrix table for compensation has changed.  The ability to make money for completed mechanics hours does not provide an incentive to work hard.  This event may now cause a high turn over for employees.
good,Pepboys is just a stepping stone for most i would try not to make a career long place lots of fight for work and not family oriented at all just business there
good,The company is stressful. No one works together. When its time to help out no ones there to assist customers. Hardly time for break. always packed. no communication with employees.
good,The management that was at this location when I worked there was the worst I have heard there is new management at this location but do not now if it is true. I will not go there to find out.
good,"normal day would be to walk into the store after school, get behind the register or the parts counter and assist people either finding parts for the vehicles or ringing up people that just part from our store."
good,helping customers. answering phones. filling orders. clerical. stocked inventory. received shipments. learned a lot about the automotive industry. love it. hardest part of the job was being understaffed.
good,"I work for boys about 3 years.  In 3 year with pep boys I learn a lot hand on work on the cars is much more than in the classes. I keep pay attention to my co-worker and teach from them, until today most my co-worker we became friends."
good,Working for PepBoys was very hard cause of the schuleds .they where changed every week and didn't have any productive time with family  and salary wasn't thee best and no benefits. My co-workers where great helped each other a lot and getting of work pretty late I was felt safe.
good,Upper management is terrible I have seen good employees  be run off from lack of pay and unethical business  practices  such as changing an employees job title to avoid paying overtime
good,This can be a really fun place to work. It can also be extremely stressful at times. Great employee discount program. Benefits are OK. Pay is typical for the business.
good,when i was first starting i was filled with fauls promises about them training me to further my education. i had to further and learn most thing on my own cause i knew they werent going to do anything for me
good,the  work  was  constant and  time  ridden  you  half  to make  sure  that  the  car's  are  safe  and  work  was done  right  to  comp.   polices and  that  was  my  practice.
good,Typical day is delivering parts to customers and answering phones on occasion. That is the better part of the day helping customers with problems and getting them the right parts.
good,"A typical day would consist of rushing between the cash register, customers in the aisles and customers at the parts counter due to being under staffed."
good,"The work place was good,but the manager had a very short temper and was not really into teaching and wanted someone just to catch on without learning."
good,Management was the worst. I can say they did not know what they are doing. I agree now more than ever after getting a degree in business and working in other locations.
good,enjoy working on cars but company lacks teamwork or management professionalism. Company fast paced but service writer push to make money over being honest with a customer and selling customer work that is not needed
good,"It's a decent place to work, but the pay is low and there isn't real job security."
good,Not a company to build a career. I want a stable position in the field I have chosen as a pharmacy technician. There are not enough opportunities for advancement there
good,balance was not allowed only work was ideal thought no concern for family allowed
good,"Typical day at work began with daily paper work,advising customers on repairs to their vehicles. I learned more about cars.Management wasn't the greatest. co-workers always made work worth going to. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers;but finding a solution to their complication. Enjoyed working with mechanics because they always presented challenges."
good,"It was a good place to work,it was just the management that needed work"
good,i love helping people and learning new experinces and the challange of being able to help my customers with there needs
good,"get work orders"
good,The full time employees have been there over 15 years. They do a great job. I went through four different managers in my three and a half years of service there.
good,The company is not stable when coming to different business aspects. Also there is lack in management training and morale is down
good,"i liked working here beause it gave me the chance to learn new things about cars.the people i worked with made my day a blast, having fun, while stayiing on task. The management was a bit shady. It seemed like eveytime i turned around we had a new manager. i enjoyed working there because of the people i met and the things i learned. i would definately refer this job to a friend."
good,The boys is a ok place to work. But it's not for every one. Techs are underpaid.
good,I didn't get to spend a lot of time with this company due to the poor economy but one thing I noticed is that when things got tough around there they had no problem laying people off. business was steady and the schedules were flexible which was nice since at the time I was a college student.
good,"I have been working at Pep Boys (Lone Tree) for almost a year now and I can tell you first hand that things have changed since I have been hired. My typical work day consists of help customers with the parts that they need to work and repair on there own cars as well as help customer purchase the parts that they need. I have learned my way around a computer system that is constently changed and going to be phased out shortly once a big change is made within the Denver stores. Management, this is where I have my biggest problem. Our management is unorganized and unsure of there exact duties within the store. They implement rules that they do not follow themselves. That just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
good,I was in charge of everything. Had to be a cashier and parts assocciate
good,pepboys does not allow for outside factors to influance business no matter what it is always the managers fault
good,I enjoyed working at Pep Boys for the short amount of time that I was there but needed something more challenging where I could utilize my skills as a Medical Assistant.
good,My work experience there wasn't the best. I wouldn't want to work there again. My co workers were friendly though. My boss didn't really listen to his employees.
good,Work environment not conducive to accelerating in your position  lack of support from management   Salaries doesn’t compensate for all the hours required
good,"I came from a company that STRIVED in customer service. Always took care of them to make sure they felt important. Had the appropriate staffing and were able to handle the workload. "
good,Will teach you what you need to know from entry level to management. It depends on who you have as a manager will determine how each store ran. Some will make you wanna leave or stay
good,I loved it the best job i had that i enjoyed. If you like production based jobs this will be a good choice. The hours may vary but hey it was worth it to me. I slick wish theyll call me back there
good,It has been more than 20 years so I am not sure what the culture is like. When I worked it was tough to advance as a female. Very few female managers throughout the corporation.
good,"Those who get to advance or be promoted are those who kiss up to their superiors. If you're a manager, your home life is out the window. Before i stepped down from management, I worked far too many hours. When i asked for less hours I received more. There were weeks i put in 70 hours, and not even a thank you for your hard work. Time and time again i was promised a promotion, but it was never delivered. I would see other people either being brought in because it was somebody they knew or it was somebody brown nosing their way up. When i was a manager, however, i did learn alot of new skills from my immediate supervisor. I cant say everything was terrible. There were some good to go with the bad."
good,Rules aren't followed they are adjusted to each person. Policies aren't followed and there is a lot of playing favorites. Not a very friendly place to work.
good,"Working with Manny, Moe. and Jack really taught me the value of good leadership and the kind of people that follow it. My time here i worked my way into management and i saw how complete power can corrupt and fragment a service staff and cause an entire store to splinter apart. Training was not a priority, they stuck us in front of an outdated program and had us ""test"" rather than use actual real life scenarios to benefit staff and be used as a teachable moment. "
good,Because there's not enough employees and nobody wants to work for the company at $8 an hour the schedules were unpredictable and constantly changing overtime for managers was mandatory to cover shifts that employees could not cover
good,Pepboys is a great stepping stone for individuals looking to start a career in the automotive field. Weather you are going to a community college or fresh out of a technical school. You get the opportunity to work on many different makes and models.
good,"Recent changes to upper management have resulted in many long term employees leaving the company. As a Store Manager, I was expected to work nearly 70 hours per week and was required to fulfill job duties outside of my job description to maintain store operations. There was never any assistance from Senior Management to resolve staffing issues."
good,Good Place to work. But advancements are hard to come by. I learned a lot from everyone. I love Working on equipment. Management could use a lot more training. unrealistic deadlines
good,"Valuable customer relations experience, operations management, and merchandising knowledge gained.  Communicated repair information to customers and offered viable solutions."
good,"Too many hours, no life at home no days off"
good,"Temporary job in school, poor management, poor pay, cant keep anyone to stay to work for them due to lack of business and poor leadership, would not recommend to anyone."
good,"Working by myself most days "
good,a typical day at work consist of customers coming and going service department working on cars checking out do it yourself customers pretty much assisting everyone that walks threw the door.
good,"well, when i was with the company there were so many things were different, left due to management issue, now company is under different management things mighty be better,"
good,My daily routine was to schedule appointments for customers to get their cars maintained. I was in charge of invoices and money. I also worked in the garage if were short staffed. I took pride in my job.
good,was ok to work for until management changes . loved my employees but hated the employer. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the politics in management.
good,Like many jobs things on paper do not translate to real life. Seems like the right hand does not know what the left is doing. Only saving grace is the people I directly work with.
good,"Since having been purchased by Icahn Automotive Group LLC in December 2015, and merging with Auto Plus there have been many advancements in product quality and availability."
good,"its an automotive company with a retail side of things. "
good,not the best place to work I got stressed out a lot I started smoking again a bit after I started because I was partially doing the assistant managers job and I was also trained the assistant manager and the p.i.r. manager because the retail manager didn't really show them how to do there jobs and the retail manager chewed out employees in front of customers and at one point I was at the cash register checking out customers and the retail manager was barking orders to the assistant manager and the p.i.r. manager the customer who was a manager from a totally different store I was helping said that the manager could have handled it in a different manner
good,"day at pep boys deliver parts too local shops."
good,The management is poor. It is a Very slow place to work at and under staffed badly. They refuse to hire anyone else to help.  There is no room for me to grow and learn.
good,Its an auto shop parts store. You often are trained to do more then one position. You do need to have knowledge about cars. I will say sometimes managers will have their favorites.
good,Just typical of all warehouses nothing more nothing less. The good ole' boy network no room for growth. You can work over a decade and still have the same position without learning more or moving higher.
good,"The Pepboys fleet is as good as it gets and its great for those who are above the store level. "
good,"Customers talk to you ant way they want to. Its always your fault. Trying to get a meeting with RM was pulling teeth, always an excuse but if you didn't hit your numbers hes calling you wanting answers. Don't care about people who work there. Low staff, micro manage everyday."
good,"Unfortunately, the people at the top of the ladder believe they see the whole field. The problem is they don't see the forest from the trees. Be careful what they tell you, they are all about micro-managing all aspects of your job performance."
good,Pep Boys had there own specific way of working. Management was not very capable of what was needing to be done all the time. An the store had many customer problems.
good,You can work 30+ hr a week but the poor pay. Have to be open with working 6 days a week..Tech only work 40.00hr a week. Management works 56. Low pay . Treat employee poorly
good,"Management is strong, corporation holds daily conference calls regarding sales and is motivating.  Average day consists of making calls to possible repeat customers, talking to walk in and telephone customers and upselling tickets after techs have inspected vehicles."
good,"Pepboys, depending on location as a Tech doesn't make good money.... 90% of there work is Oil Change and as a Flat Rate Tech. it is hard to make 8hr Pay of Flag Rate when you are only doing Oil Changes all day"
good,Its a good company however at the store i work at we tend to lose co-workers because my manager acts like a 5 year old all the time and then we get undermanned and everything is hectic and just not good all the way around.
good,"I had to work almost around the clock. I was losing my family because of work. I turned the store around from a deficit to a positive balance. In 2010, my store flooded, so I moved to Omaha, Nebraska."
good,"Too much middle management."
good,Stressful environment with lack of direction from management because it constantly changing. Do not seem to promote from within.
good,Pep Boys offers a good product but I am sad that I don't have much good to say about the operations side. I started at pep boys and was promoted several times in my first year. The co workers were interesting. The turn over was HIGH. If you had any values at all you could promote.
good,"typically we mostly get oil changes, some tire changes alignments, brake jobs. even if management tries to rush you in simply tasks I never do, id rather take my time to insure that the vehicle doesn't return in worse shape than it first came in. the hardest part would making the work hours when few vehicles come in. I truly enjoy when I can fix a car and the customer is satisfied with the work."
good,"Working with all the different customers and helping them fix there automotive problems, I worked with a good group of people and the best one was the general manager."
good,"very long hours , hard and demanding work , The people were great to work with . loved helping people with the vehicles needs . Very competitive market , parts and service ."
good,"With the good , there comes the bad and ugly. Not committed to service excellence and the benefits should cause their HR shame."
good,"It can be definitely fun working at this place, but that definitely depends on the people and management. I was lucky and worked with wonderful people, but when they leave you have to carry the torch and I think in any job."
good,my job was to write up repairs  and I also was a tire and lube tech also small repairs
good,Pep boys has a lack of good service managers at this time they won't compensate internal employees had a good start but it seemed like if I was not getting anywhere
good,"running register,stock,cleaning,orders,and deliver parts to business"
good,"Working at pepboys was an great experience, it taught what, to trust, and who to trust when it comes to dealing with automotive retail and service."
good,"Pep boys is a ok company, just lacks leadership and management skills. Management seemed more focused on keeping things the same instead of expanding and maximizing profits."
good,Good place to work.  Steady employment and the supervisors would work with me on hours.  Management was good.
good,"Customers You earn there trust"
good,"Helping customers finding what they need for their cars,  ordering products, working on planograms, cashier. I learned how to take care of a car and what the basics are on keeping it in good shape. I know how to do a managment positions, but managers don't want you to succeed or go anywhere. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers and doing their job while they don't deligate their tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer that you helped walk out happy."
good,"The shop was way more slow than the manager let on at the interview, then once I was hired they rode me for low productivity when they were not selling anything. It's SALES FAULT if the shop is slow, not the mechanics. Co-workers were great."
good,"excesive paper work that not allow the manager take care of the daily issues on the shop that can improve the sales"
good,Will explain in an interview a day consisted of talking to customers and understanding there concerns or service requested for the vehicle quote a price and explain the charges to the customer if they choose to perform the service I pull the car into the shop and perform service requested and inspect vehicle for other issues. to much to explain will explain more later
good,"This position was indeed fun for the first year, but unfortunately since, my opinion of this business from an employee's perspective has reduced significantly. A change in management has definitely affected the place, in some ways good, but in others bad, and the bad had a tendency to outweigh the good."
good,wont you to give you life to company and not woried about family values
good,They are sales driven and care more for what they can get and less about taking care of the customers. They have great workers but it is the manager who sets the tone. If the manager tone is ill then the workers tone is ill.
good,Learned more about cars as in parts and being able to take my sales to a high level
good,Great place to start if you are considering in being a brake specialist.
good,Store manager was hard to get along with. Mandatory store meetings at 6am Sunday 1 to 2 times a month. Control freak. He made me cut my hair on the spot so I go come back but still not short enough for him so I just go no.2 clip bald which he ok'd with a smirk but I needed the job.
good,Excellent experience that allowed me to meet and collaborate with a number of individuals with different backgrounds and talents. Looking for a similar opportunity elsewhere.
good,"It was an alright place to work. The fact that they took a chance on someone who didn't know much about cars is pretty astounding. People did quit left and right, and the situations were pretty stressful, but as long as you kept your head down, and did your job, it was an OK gig."
good,"I worked as a Cashier and Sales Associate.I enjoyed helping the customers with their automotive needs.The store manager was very good and easy to work with. The job was stressful, especially on the weekend, when the store would get very busy. I have a lifting problem and didn't like lifting the heavy merchandise that came in on truck day. Overall, it was a fun job if you enjoy interacting with people."
good,"most likely will not get a raise even though my productivity is great. So always open to the next opportunity that fits. Manager is great. works harder than anyone in the shop even does tires. Asst manager is the total opposite, blames everyone but himself and screws up often. some techs are there for an easy paycheck only choose to do easy jobs. and others are there to challenge themselves and solve customer issues. service writers often screw up and pay wrong techs the hours you are due. no A/c in summer. poor heat in winter. old tired machines that might hurt or kill you. alignment racks that makes the job worst than when it comes in. garage doors that don,t lock so one day your tool box might be gone. customers think all jobs take 10 mins. even complex electrical issues perhaps due to what the writer tell them."
good,"Pep Boys is a good place to work but many of their Area Managers like to micro-manage too much. Too much focus is placed on selling certain items instead of having wide varieties of parts and accessories available."
good,Changes in company policy and poor management have made it hard to make a living.I do appreciate the training and ASE certification and flat-rate increase.
good,if you want to  start off at a good job pep boys isn't the place for you. management their is horrible and they don't really care about the employees. they dont pay very well for the job they want you to do. they also dont care what time you go to lunch whether it be 30 min past your 5th or 1 hour past.
good,From when you open till you close it's steady work. Keeps you busy and makes the day go by quickly at times. I was upper management and a lot of task to do all the time. Most times my crew could handle the work load as I handled my duties. There are times where I have to step in and help my crew produce. I was very technical and hands on. Telling customers what it entitled to repair there vehicles when the price was high. Taking customers that were upset and making them happy when there vehicle was repair properly.
good,"The company is what you put into it. Management is non existent. Numbers driven. Hours are 7 days a week. They will take anyone. Definitely a job that you will pass through. Not a terrible place, you get what you put in."
good,"As a Sales and Commercial Associate, you are responsible for providing superior customer service and assist in driving sales across the commercial, retail, and hard parts business. Provide essential task support by partnering with management to execute visual presentation standards, provide phone and in-person support to commercial customers, maximize inventory, and proactively engage customers on the sales floor and at the register. This position has been designated as a safety-sensitive position."
good,"This company has been around a long time and sometimes upper management get blinded by this and does not necessarily embrace new ideas. A CEO revolving door,"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed making deliveries and interacting with the  employees and management at the multiple locations throughout the city and suburban areas..
good,Worked for 20 years and didn't get the satisfactory from the boys. I would do anything took to keep the store up and going in order make my customers happy.
good,a typical day at pep boys would involve picking parts from the store hub and then loading all parts into van and then drive off to the pep boys store in orange county and deliver parts to mechanics.
good,"long hours "
good,They had us working to get over 1000 orders out without any structure or a way to tell what needed out now and what needed out later. Would be a better job if they had everyone on the same page and the co workers would work together
good,Difficult to trust anyone within the company. Always have to look over your shoulder. Management is sometimes very difficult to work with. This was a while back.
good,"Work at pep boys at first was ok...but there doing a lot changes"
good,I really enjoy working for Pep Boys it taught me a lot about cars and the different parts that is needed for the car to preform. I also learn how to have the best customer service skills while still trying to make a sell.
good,"Decent pay must be fast efictient safe goods place to work over all good team environment great at getting certification on multiple peices of equipment high low ,reach/cherry picker, palette Jack's ect."
good,The job is fast paced with a lot of multi tasking when at the store if anyone wants to work there the better be a fast learner or have prior experience.
good,work all day busting your back and get nothing in return only good thing is the hour lunch. manager always up your  about everything get wrote up for stupid stufft
good,never knew exactly when i would get off or start until the night before. My boss was a major drunk. I did like going on the field and working. I didn't like the long hours.
good,"The work was interesting but the work culture was less than ideal. Employees were not hired based on knowledge or merit but on availability. Accountability did not exist, management did not make it a priority."
good,Work at my location was only given to the morning techs and those of us in the evening had to fight for work. Started performing basic janitorial and receiving work due to lack of employees doing those jobs
good,Money hungry that is all. You work underpaid not enough hours not appreciate it. I am not happy unsafe conditions people breathing people walking all over your back constantly hounding you to find things wrong with the car.
good,There is room for advancement as long as upper management likes you. It took me many years to move from cashier to store manager so it takes a long time for some they prefer to higher from outside rather than promote from with in. With new buy out from last year benefits are now awful. With new medical benefits you have to pay out of pocket till each person on the plan reaches their own deductible. Dental and vision are good. PTO is generous and is part of why I stayed so long. Pay is low to start but gets better if you move into management.
good,The work is easy and keeps you very busy. In my position I walk a few miles per day putting stock away. The software and technology used is somewhat dated but functional. Changes are in the works but no details provided to workers.
good,"Maintaining road safety is a priority for this company. The benefits and compensation are good, however this company does not appreciate long term employees."
good,I satrted with PBY in 2012 as a Mechanic and eventually became Store Manager in November of 2014.  I have been in that position since then.  The most enjoyable part of the job is giving the customer their keys back knowing that the vehicle has been repaired correctly and putting the customer at ease with the services that were performed.
good,"Pep Boys has been interesting place to work but with various executive level changes. It has become very challenging to maintain a sense of security. Management is competent but challenged to make radical operational changes, Unfortunately I believe its time to explore advancement in other areas of my career."
good,"Pepboys is a good place to start off as auto tech or service advisor .You can learn as you go."
good,"Repair 5-6 flat tires, 5 oil changes, and clean up shop before my shift over. Each car i do a full inspection on it. Did with rude customers who try tell you how to do things."
good,"the environment was not too bad, but upper management were not about the employees as many things went overlooked or not promptly corrected."
good,Pep Boys is a great place to learn a lot about the industry and gain a large amount of experience with a lot of responsibilities.
good,Store Manager is fair and great to work for. Individual dept. managers do not have a clue. Pay is not sufficient for the hard work and time that is given to the job.
good,"I am thankful for the opportunity Pep Boys gave me. When I started working for Pep Boys I had no knowledge of cars and yet they hired me. I have learned so much with them. "
good,"You are on your feet practically all day, the Manager can sometimes be over the top when it comes to looking busy. There can literally be nothing else to do but the Manager wants you moving, although it may not be the ideal job, if you move and stay active you could see some changes on your weight. You move between stocking parts and merchandise to assisting customers with their needs. You have to stay attentive to everything you do, as long as you do that you will survive"
good,"was not what i thought it would be. but i learned alot in very few time"
good,it ok if your starting out in the field and need to learn more in the industry its hard to get a raise co workers always changing
good,"Low customer input. Sat around alot. Could not work enough vehicle repair hours to earn good pay. This created a 8.00 prhr pay. They pushed training but limited time on training computer. Part of management was good. Their personalities created conflicts that did not allow the shop to meet its potential to create a good enviroment."
good,Compensation has been modified to include flag hours and is a problem.
good,Provides flexibility to work and go to school and allows me to interact with customers.
good,"Overseeing shop and employees to insure repairs were completed properly, ordering and receiving parts, keeping an accurate account of all inventories, scheduling employees, staff payroll and customer repairs."
good,"Was able to be a driver as well as a clerk,get good experience."
good,"pepboys is not the job to make a living off of,"
good,Harsh working environment with long hot days.  Micro management from upper level managers made daily operations tough to accomplish.  Limited man hours made providing great customer service difficult.
good,Pepboys is just like any other corporation i suppose trying to make more money with their resources stretched 
good,"co-workers were fun, you learn new things, you stay busy, though at times could be very stress full"
good,"Taking appointments and walk ins daily to service vehicles to perfection, and safety. Surrounded by great staff, and experience their is no better support system. The volume becomes over whelming sometimes, however the customer always comes first, and there is no better feeling in the world than to send each customer home satisfied, and safely."
good,Interesting place to work.Always something new to learn about the Automotive Industry.Enjoyed meeting and helping people and making them feel comfortable at such an arkward time.Even in the mist of all the seriousness somehow we found some humor.Laughter is the best medicine.
good,"it was a job didnt pay much and supervisor was a lil moody, but the other employees were decent"
good,a typical day at work was at the register helping customers. I learned how to do inventory at this work place. I loved my managers whom i worked with cause they were rarely transferred. I loved the people i worked with they made work fun and fast paced. The hardest part of my job was the pay! And the most enjoyable part was working with people that made the work place a place you wanted to be at.
good,Some days are slow and all u can do is talk with coworkers.
good,I worked from 8 am till 5 pm. Did not promote from within. There was no chance for advancement.Writers decided who got work. I was transfered to this store by upper management. I had to fight for work orders.
good,Like the title says If you're part time you're easily dispensable. If not for the great co-workers i had I would have quitted sooner than getting fired. I got fired because I was a delviery driver and I had some road rager call in a bogus call on me. Management has no way of confirming speeding so its the callers word against the workers. If you ever get a delivery job as a part-timer at pepboys you better just pull over and let people do whatever they want and then get back on the road.
good,"I enjoyed learning how to operate the hydrolic car lift, repair flat tires and how to drain and chang the oil correctly"
good,"This company has on the job training in a fast paced work environment. This has allowed me to learn time management, and helped direct my career in the accounting industry"
good,Not a bad place to work just a lot of rules to follow as management u will receive a lot of text messages and as a mechanic they tend to hire a lot of guys for the shop
good,Good company but lacks in promoting. Not the place to work if you want to advance or getting pay raises. Great for part time but pay is low and the up sell bonus isn’t that great.
good,I overall like my job but i don't love it. I would say this is a good stepping stone to gain experience. The company does throw holiday events and regularly helps charity programs.
good,"Work very hard, pay isn't what they say it would be. At time of raises, only the favored is paid regardless of what you've brought to the table. Some great managers and lots of bad managers."
good,"There is no time for playing around. You work and you work hard, if you’re not prepared to work hard at the Corporate office don’t apply for any of the positions."
good,Better for starting technician's or mechanics. Most people just stay here a couple of years and go other places. I seen alot of different faces as I been working here
good,"This job taught me a lot of things that I never thought I would learn. It's a great place for learning about cars/turcks if they even mildly interest you. I enjoyed what I was learning. But I hated that even though I was only there for 6 months or so, I wasn't aloud to advance because I didn't have enough experience. I was basically doing my job, delivering parts, invoicing orders for customers, helping the front counter and also helping put the inventory on the shelves. ..."
good,"It was an okay place to work."
good,"the job is hourly + commission (if you put in the work you get more) however at my location it’s very unorganized & not good with schedule to balance life. You also have to deal with the mechanics, your customers and yourself & sometimes half the time the mechanics are lazy to do the job and then customers will make a complaint & the blame goes directly to you. Atleast at my location it’s obvious that there are favorites"
good,"Overall, it is an okay job. Depending on the location and the employees, it can make the job quite enjoyable. There is always something new to learn regardless of how much knowledge and experience you have. Management is also helpful and supportive with helping employees that start with minimal knowledge."
good,"I worked as a part time  employee.  I delivered parts to the customers as they ordered.  My job included making sure they received the right parts,  also delivering in a timely  matter   I made a lot of friends through the  companies I delivered to,  they were happy with my efficiency."
good,The company can't decide what to do with itself. Retail profits are waning because the company doesn't seem to want to do any advertising or invest assets in growing the retail side if the business. The benefits and pay are decent and I enjoy working with some of the people that are here. But the company culture has definitely diminished.
good,If you want to make a living in the Bay Area and not live in your car or with your parents find another job. The training I Went to focus on selling 101 nothing I did not already know having been in sales before I worked here. They are very focused on coupons for everything cutting any money for the service advisors.
good,I enjoy Automotive but had a hard time working for a company that for being around since early 1900's need to send all employees to school including management and learn latest methods to be competative.
good,Techs are paid the minimum for maximum work and even when skills are proven management does not care and does not increase pay even by a little just to save money on his payroll and to save his bonuses.
good,"I didn't mind working there, i just wish they gave more education for working the parts counter.  Most of what i learned in order to help customer, was learned on my own.  With more education, my customer response time would have been faster."
good,"Managers would come and go since it was a ""busy"" store. Had good as also POOR managers whom would only look after themselves but the retail associates would have each others back which helped a little."
good,"Restock inventory ,new planograms ,waiting on customers. The other employees are great guy.The manager at my store is awesome and fair.Store under staff,"
good,"it was a fun place to work at but everyone always thought their jobs were going to move to GA. There was a lot of micromanaging though."
good,"Depending on the location of a pep Boys store, you’re experience will differ. I had the opportunity to work at 2 different locations and they were different experiences. One was great and the other wasn’t so good."
good,"Workplace is great environment to be, management has been improper at best and anyone that gets hired quits after a few weeks, or else they get fired."
good,no more to say its all in the title above. i guess make sure you want to work for who hires you. you can transfer locations though. that is always a plus.
good,"I will say for the most part all the employees here are honest, and just trying to take care of business. Upper management can make things very stressful, and really don't appreciate the hard work we put in."
good,"Poor Managment is all it takes to make you hate your job."
good,If you're looking for a first time job related to automotive parts the definitely give it a try. the work environment was usually very relaxed and the employees were very nice.
good,"A typical work day clock in at 7:15am work on car and clock out at 4pm. "
good,"Transitional time. moving out the veterans, moving in the new companies lackeys. Used to promote from within and support internal growth. Changing their direction to outside ""Snow-Flake"" standards."
good,"I have to say that i've learned a lot with Pep. My immediate supervisor is great, best I've had in a long time. But the upper managment... not so much. The Assistant CM position requires a huge amount of attention to detail, which can be stressful if that's something you struggle with. I wish I was paid more. I get the sense that there is definitely a gender pay gap. "
good,"Worked for this company for about a year. Before getting hired check thoroughly through your application paperwork thoroughly. Check Behind your commission hours that you accumulate through doing your job outside of regular hours. Employees, including management will find ways to take away what you worked for."
good,"fast paced movement, in between service, commercial, retail and tires departments, specially when somebody call sin sick not enough coverage body count, in reference to the hours of business open."
good,"Management lacked."
good,Its an ok place to work at but when you have a store manager that thinks he's managing a school than that's where the problem lies he really shouldn't be managing a store
good,"Working at  Pep Boys was ok. I worked in the Commercial Department, which I don't think they paid enough attention to.  Compared to other auto parts stores I worked at, they had very few accounts and extremely less revenue. They were definitely more concentrated on the retail side."
good,Great place if you are new to the automotive field and looking to expand your knowledge. Only issue is your knowledge is not appreciated if you have experience. It just makes your job a bit easier. They want people that know how to work a computer instead of knowing about an actual car. Pay is not the best unless you know people.
good,"Commission rates were phenomenal when I started with the company, however operation ideas change like seasons when dealing with cooperate. "
good,horrible customer service and communication between techs managers and higher ups definitely needs to be looked into and handled by the corporate office
good,On the lower level the job is fine. A lot of regular new faces because of lack of pay or advancement opportunities. I was a mid-level manager and really struggled with upper management being responsive to problems we were experiencing in the store. Pay was not adequate in accordance with job demand.
good,"Long hours no formal training for management only in form of computer modules"
good,I don't find this to be a good place to work. The management doesn't really care the employees at my store are miserable and it is a bad culture to work in.
good,"working at pep boys was diffidently a leaning experience, I got a lot of information on vehicles I hadn't known prior to working there, the pace was usually pretty high speed, running around getting parts and helping customers. management could have been better at my location. we ad issues with not having proper staffing and too much stress on closing employees which was usually just me handling parts sales along with service tickets."
good,Pep boys was a Good auto mechanic experience opportunity but coworkers were not willing to help. The manager promised things he couldn't keep and the customers were lied to about what was wrong with their vehicles.
good,"In the 6 months I worked with them, I have seen an assistant manager have a complete melt down with screaming and cussing fits. I have also watched everybody attempt to back stab each other all the time. A typical day at work involved rearranging the aisles in preparation for the remodel. It also involved searching for the lazy employees who have plenty of places to hide and forcing them to get off their butts and work. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I actually felt as though I was making a difference and improving the store I worked at. Trying to keep track of all the customers that came in around such a large store and only having two or maybe three of us to do it was not difficult. The worst part of the job was the crazy amount of back stabbing that occurred among some of the employees was sickening."
good,it was ok to work here except they play favorites management was split between good and bad pay was horrible  unless the bad management liked you and you stayed up their
good,The position was OK it was steady but I felt under appreciated and there was no room for advancement considering my ability to perform task and learn the company system.
good,"it was trying to get the customer to understand what may be causing the issue with their vehicle. that was the difficult part, because not everyone is a car enthusiast. it would make things very interesting."
good,"some management was fair and some was tough."
good,"It's was a great company unfortunately the management team need to learn that changes are good and to be able to be more aggressive wen it comes to business and to understand that it's a need to be the best an more competitive, demand the best from their team learn to recognize the good from their employees make sure that they know they did a good job"
good,The hours of operation are good but they need to keep up on maintenance with all of the lifts and other equipment. Currently there are three out of five lifts out of service at the location I work at and the alignment machine has been inoperative for about a year.
good,"greeting retail and service customer. Helping customers with question or car problems. All the stores are short handed, which makes it hard to help customers. Helping customers and resolve their needs"
good,"Come to work, do what you have to do, don't use your initiative. They only want to listen to their own scripted  responses on actual situations, not the reality of business or customers feedback."
good,Supervising associates and prioritizing work for technicians. Training and coaching associates on customer service and communication.  Great team atmosphere.
good,"The staff at the store was friendly and fun to work with but the corporate staff was not so people friendly.  A typical day was assisting customers with there purchase, making sure they had everything they needed to get there project complete.  I also assisted wholesale customers with there purchases and payments to there account as well as making sure everyone was completely satisfied with the services provided."
good,"My Hours aren't long because I attend college. I've learned about automotive parts. Management is nice, but isn't too knowledgeable about the store. Co-workers are are always in a great mood. Nothing is really hard, and I really don't enjoy working here because i don't see a prosperous future if i continue to work here."
good,"My for someone starting at Pep Boys is ""follow the rulebook perfectly and you'll have a job, a few classes with manager, but you'll learn how to properly handle and service customer the right way""."
good,I used to work for the company it was something that got me threw the door then advanced to management within a year. I enjoyed the people I worked with but once the company's system changed it went all hay wire for me and it was something I couldn't get used to and something I didn't like. Good company for someone to start with to understand parts and service.
good,"Not much to say here except, they have been around for a long time.  They are finally starting to get the face lift they much needed."
good,A typical day at work was making sure that the store and service center ran efficiently. Also doing the processes that made us comply with policy and proceedure. The management was good in the beginning but got worse as the years went by. The hardest part of the job was to run a very busy store and service center with a minimal staff. This created a very stressful environment. The most enjoyable part was running a top store.
good,I worked there as a service advisor when they were paid hourly. Worked great until they switched us all to commision.
good,Working for Pep boys was a high pace job with customer service as your main concern followed by your daily task list.
good,learned alot about Customer service and pleasing the customer
good,Compnay works well with personal life and trains employees well. But management needs to be more consistent in handling commission based sales.
good,"It was nice working alongside skilled mechanics.Although,the management wasnt very stable."
good,"Typical day at work was as a service manager, coming to a store that was consistently understaffed when it came to the service desk."
good,"Very busy store , always a different day . The hardest part of my job is finding time to be with customers."
good,"I am allotted three minutes per customer /Handle transactions,sales,check and deliver moving rental vehicles,Install planograms, handle inventory,check and stock all aspects/inventory,perform vehicle inspections,deliver parts,commercial parts sales,Maintain and quester special ordering,warehouse handling and routing / perform electrical verification on alternators,starters,batteries and many other automotive related functions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers complaints. Best part of the job is it is fulfilling,because at the end of shift there is the knowledge that people are satisfied."
good,"People are doing the job of 2 and 3 people and not getting paid for there work. Too much work for one person. No acknowledgment, just ridicule."
good,"When I was there it was difficult to move up within the company because there were so many people that had been around for so long. I was able to go through their Multi-unit training course (DOM) training and was recommended for promotion within the first year and then waited for a position to open up. Fortunately, Autozone recruited me and I moved on from there."
good,management does not have experience in conversating and explainin what is expected of employees.
good,"A typical day at work would start off with checking emails, analyzing sales and reports from the prior day and planning for the current day based on staffing and your weekly planner and sales goals. Holding short huddle meetings with associates to reaffirm sales and task initiatives starts with each associte's shift. Throughout the day walking the sales floor and service facility to observe and coach associates as well as identify areas of opportunity and discuss them with the service manager and assistant managers is key to achieving your daily goals. Checking sales progress, customer satisfaction levels, and task completion throughout the day consumes most of your time. However, there is a large emphasis on training and mentoring. The toughest part of the job is finding the necessary time to spend with your assocites. Therefore time and resource management is essential and probably one of the most important things I learned while being employed there. This also leads into my favorite part of my job which is training, mentoring, and interacting with my associates and customers. I enjoyed developing my associates and watching them take pride in utilizing new things they were taught and achieving success."
good,"I learned alot from the techs there but all in all it wasn't a very enjoyable experience. Long hours for minimal pay, this specific facility wasn't very well managed and benefits were really lacking."
good,This is a customer focused automotive company. The company is continually trying to locate ways to assist the employee in order to perform their job more efficiently in a timely manner. The company also has committed to provide better service to all customers.
good,This is a good starting place for employment. hours are flexible and most places are fun.
good,Pep boys has been in transition for a long. Pep Boys suffers from management that has been there for a long time doing the same things so they struggle transitioning into the future
good,"Working for the company was an experience to say the least. There are plenty of people within the company that are great to meet, but there are others that are only looking out for themselves that makes working for the company very hard to stay."
good,I like it at first then it went down hill from there. Found out I was making the same as another employee that has been there a year. And I was not treated right. So I left and found another job.
good,division between retail and service makes it hard to help others out. Hours were inconsistent due to being short staffed. Delivery driver was a fun job since you were able to get out of the store and see customers.
good,Corporate doesn't have a clue. The people I work with on a daily basis are top notch. Benefits are outstanding. The salary not so much. Hours are very flexible. Decent employee discount.
good,"Pretty good, but only because my direct manager was excellent. Upper management was less than excellent."
good,Service advisors work for commission while the manager is paid salary. The manager would write all the big jobs and pass the little ones on to the service advisors heavily cutting into their commission pay. The manager also did not believe in training. You have to learn it yourself is what you are told. He would run customers off and was extremely rude to them and the employees.
good,Needs more collaboration. They have to instill the one team motive more predominately and tell people their roles in a more straight forward way. If everyone was to help one another as they should things would run very smooth.
good,"Pep Boys has a standard management staff. A typical day would be to handle products requested by other stores and have it ready for pick. Additionally, answer phone calls and customers. Keep the store clean and presentable. Through this job I learned about cars, parts and management skills."
good,"To many long hour days, with not enough support, because of constant directional changes. Company directional changes impaired  the oppurtunity to complete task to be succesful."
good,"Setting Goals to your Team,Hiring,Training.Hitting our Core Objectives of our business.Learned everyday that the key to success is your employees and taking care of our Customers.Hiring the Manager to take pride in running the business.Your workplace culture should be fun in a positive atmosphere.Hardest part of the Job is finding quality employees to get the job done.Enjoyable part of the job is seeing employees promoted within the company and helping everyone reach a goal."
good,I had a great crew finally had people at a job who became as close as family . And that I think same morals and values that can be appreciated like honesty and loyalty.
good,it was okay. pep boys was not managed greatly. the pay was not equated to the work ethic all workers possessed. i will say that pep boys was a great learning experience.
good,"On a typical day I would sign customer into the system and start there repair ticket. Get with the mechanic to find out what is needed"
good,"I made good money working at PB. The work flow was good and there was rarely ever a problem. All in all, not a bad experience. I just had higher goals."
good,The people i worked with were awesome. i just wasn't able to make much money because the company didn't teach anything like they say they would have..
good,"The Company suffers from over valuing the Technicians and under valuing Management. The Techniciations can do pretty much anything they want against Company Policy. If Management tries to step in and reel the Techs in, they know that they can get rid of Manager and just continue to do as they wish. The Company is currently cutting experienced staff in The Service Department and asking Store associates to try to make up the difference, this I feel is a big mistake."
good,great place to work easy to learn great associates niice to meet new people but bad managment no enought hours to work and the management its always cheking on you .
good,Ok job but poor management and no room to advance to higher positions. Management is inexperienced and doesn't seem to care about their customers like they should
good,"loved the job of delivering auto parts. but terrible management. Manager was lazy, had myself doing 19 other jobs while he sat and did nothing but play on the cell phone."
good,It was a decent place to work for some money. At one location it was super slow and another super busy. Management wanted high numbers that were practically impossible based on records of sales.
good,"Too much of a ""large corporation"" feel. Doesn't pay well for the work you do, commissions were restructured to make them virtually impossible to attain. Commonly referred to as ""the Walmart"" of the auto industry. Good for entry level automotive experience."
good,"The manager was crazy, he always complained about his life, he barely got days off. Heard he is doing a little bit better but he was a bad person. Threatened the crew and everything. Super weird."
good,"understaffed most of the time. good entry level job. Management turnover is high. typical day is a lot of routine maintenance  (oil changes, tires and alignments.)"
good,"While working at Pepboys, I found that it was great. Especially for learning about different parts, ordering, and new cars. It was a typical work place punch in and out. The best part of the job, was the small team, you can get personal with the team, and someone will always check on you. The hardest part of the job, was the lack of coworkers, for some reason no one wants to work there. In addition, you have to round ability such as being a cashier, pulling parts, putting up parts, and delivery the parts as well.  With very staff, it was difficult for a person to get things done."
good,This is a commission based job that can be very rewarding under the right circumstances. You have to be aggressive and work for every dollar that you earn.
good,"typical day at work was a lot of pressure form management of sales ,sales ,sales"
good,Pep Boys has aided in me purchasing my home and employment for over 21yrs. I have also met some wonderful people while working here. I have recommended a few people to work here.
good,Pepboys is great about providing training to introduce or refresh the general knowledge of automotive repair. I am currently work on my L1 certification.
good,Good job when first go out  tech AMD managers welling to work with you and help you learn a lot to help advance in career and like there ase program they pay for you to take the test and pass or fail
good,"Pep Boys is okay to work at, but the company itself does not care about its employees like it should. The job doesn't pay enough to deal with the everyday mess that happens there, and that includes the poor attitudes and customer service. I learned a lot about cars which is one benefit of the job, but other than that, it's not worth it."
good,Not really much of a reliable place to work. Management isn't the greatest to work for either. Pay leaves a lot to be desired. Experience doesn't mean much to them.
good,In charge of super store hub. Drive sales in retail and commercial B2B. Supervise two managers (retail and commercial) Serve 9 Pep Boys tire and service centers with loop deliveries
good,For people who loves cars and has knowledge about them. Other then the car maintenance environment it's like any other sales job. It's a job that has a extremely strict set of sale requirements when working there and expect you to complete them. If not you will be written up for it.
good,Typical day at Pep boys is always being on top of everything and giving every customer what they need. Super fun staff and great work environment including Pep express.
good,"It has been a stressful work environment with the assistant managers at the Aliso location, they can be nice but when the work load gets large, they stress and it often can be directed towards us and then it makes for an uncomfortable work environment. There are other coworkers there that do make it a better time there. So it is a give and take."
good,"Work with customer face to face to discuss, address and create a solution for the concerns about their vehicles. As well the environment  if face pace and need to be able to multitask"
good,"The lower level management staff tends to be easy to connect with and concerned about your well-being as an employee. However, should you ever need to advance a human resources concern to the corporate level, expect stonewalling and phone calls which seem to never be returned nor taken seriously. I exposed two co-workers, with the assistance of an assistant manager at my location, by providing documented proof that those two co-workers were stealing my commissions from work orders. Not only were no disciplinary actions taken by corporate, I was made to feel like I was the one who'd done something wrong."
good,"A lot of hustle and bustle, sweat, and oil. Customers are usually pretty easy going but there's always that one who ruins the groove. Overall its a great feeling to know you've helped keep someone's car on the road just a little bit longer due to your preventive maintenance."
good,Pep boys was a good way to support my family at the time. I am a family man. I need and will provide for my family doing whatever work allows it.
good,I've worked here for two years and it can be really fun. Its more about the people I work with that make it a good job. Our Pepboys is slow paced so most of our day is spent doing projects around the store. They pay very well I make more than any one else I know who works in retail.
good,"great place to pass time and work on cars. cars, music and fun. Decent start time and plenty of work to do include clean up, detailing, and parts delivery."
good,"Its  A great place to start, theirs team work and its very productive they do start at 10 an hr and theirs alot to learn and hard labor work"
good,pep boys was a fun job that let me explore the true job of running a shop and putting out reliable work. it is very hard to keep a name going when you cant control what techs and lube bay guys are hired to work under your name. this was the down fall when I worked at pep boys
good,Too many different ideas moving in too many directions to make a stable long lasting impact on market share. multiple CEO's over my time with the company and most SOP's don't last more than 6 months.
good,The only reason I worked here in 2011 was because I had a chance to be on the other side of an organizational takeover when Pep Boys bought the chain of 82 Big Ten tire stores
good,bad company to work for poor management long hours under paid poor working conditions no company discounts short staffed no advancement
good,Company was restructuring while I was there. They have just changed management style to resuscitate the business. The corporate head office has a very high turnover rate.
good,"A typical day working would consist of restocking shelves with products, providing customer service, working at the cash register and retrieving parts needed for the service department."
good,Write up work orders with appropriate prices for both parts and labor. Manage over under report constantly chasing credits form vendors. Manage payroll and scheduling for technicians employed at the center. I was satisfied helping out the customer and seeing satisfaction when they leave. Hardest part was dealing with certain customers and problems but the most rewarding was when I found a solution where we were both happy and the problem was resolved.
good,"Pep boys has thought me a lot about multi-tasking, the inner and outs of the car industry while working hand to hand with automotive dealers, insurance companies and other auto car parts company. I have manage the mechanics, technician, training staff while being in the top 10 in Long Island and top 5 in my district of Hicksville, long Island as a service advisor/ assistant manager."
good,The service was great. They always aim to please the customer but the pay was minimal and I didn't see a raise for the first 5 years! And when I did it was 9 cents!
good,"Very busy, lots of data logging, dealing with and honing skills on automotive problems."
good,typical work day is to come in and look over all store numbers. check the store training success. look in the system for any customer complaint. help train associate on job duties
good,"I loved my job at Pep Boys, I was just never satisfied with their choice of management. In the two and a half years I worked there, it seemed as if no one ever stayed in one spot."
good,"I did enjoy the people I worked with, however we were given titles of ""Fleet Managers"" but reality you were not able to use your management skills.  Everything had to go to corporate for any kind of decision.  I looked at this position as an outside salesman for the 21 stores I was responsible for.  The position was not challenging at all."
good,"Help automotive customers with all their vehicle needs, by utilizing and guiding a team of ASE certified"
good,Management is un experienced at my store. this makes my job especially difficult at times
good,I clock in and grab my van key. Then i gather my items i have to deliver. I get the items signed out by a manager. I load the van then I'm o the road until i finish my 3 store route.
good,Nice place to work if your not looking for a career.............
good,"Regular Job/Not Too Bad"
good,Lots of very technical procedures and heavy lifting. I learned some of the different types of transmissions. management was very easy going. i worked with my best friend side by side. The hardest part for me was replacing the transmission after it was rebuilt. I enjoyed the challenge.
good,No job security no advancement alot of favoritism bad managers who never worked on cars
good,Good place to work if you like cars. Plus you get good discounts. It was nice to always be able to get a hold of car parts.
good,"Pep boys was alright, one thing that's good is they have training modules to help you build your automotive knowledge. a day at work would be assisting customers with auto parts, answering questions, phone calls, cleaning the store, unloading truck and putting stock items away. some co-workers can be really lazy from what I've noticed that can get u fired. Other workers helped me joked around and just made it not feel like work. management was ok but kind of lax, not to much supervision they just sit in the office. It was a good first job! but not the best"
good,"Pep-Boys is not a bad company. I believe that out of all the car suppliers that Pep-Boys in the Cheapest with all there Products."
good,"Pep Boys isn't a bad place to work, but it isn't great either. They are open 7 days a week and somewhat late too (9 pm). That means you will be working past 5 pm most nights and work a lot of weekend hours too. We had to work every Satrday since it was the busiest day of the week. They did give us every other Sunday off though and would give me Saturday off, if I had something important to do. I liked the management and other employees that I worked with everyday. It is a great place to start your career in the automotive industry. Once you work there for about a year then you can probably qualify for and find a better job at a dealership in parts, or service. The dealership that wouldn't hire me before I worked at Pep Boys did hire me after I worked at Pep Boys for a year."
good,"I work Saturday to Tuesday, off on Wednesday and Friday. 8 am till 7 pm Monday and Tuesday, 9 am till 5 pm Sunday and 10 am till 7 pm Thursday. Co-workers come and go more then usual. The hardest part of my job is getting up in the morning when it's dark and coming home when it's dark. What i enjoy most about my job is that i get the satisfaction of helping people and fixing cars."
good,I work with different local automotive shops and help manage automotive hard part distrobution. The best part of my job is making sure each one of our clients is 100% satisfied with not only the quality of parts theyre recieving but the customer service. I stive myself in retaining the customers we do have and also expanding the business by recruiting new businesses to open an account. The only down side to my position is the lack of advancement and ability to provide for my family in a comfortable manner.
good,"Customer Service, Ad Changes, Sales, Store Tasks, Accounting Functions, Motivation of Sales Team. Learned how to maintain store with a minimum of man hours. Developed a good strong team and enjoyed my relationship with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was completing all tasks within the time frame. Large sales was the best part of the job."
good,Great place to start outbin the the automotive technician side. Wouldn't mine working for another store
good,great job to work for well going to school
good,Was only getting 20+ hours a week needed more hours. The management seemed like he had his hands full didnt have any time. Co workers didnt have the skills to make a good team that was the hardest part.
good,Was a good work environment. Hours were always changing. Work not always getting done right. I worked there for two weeks then put in my two week notice to work somewhere else
good,Everyday is learning experience. You think that you have something figured out and turns out that it was something that you never thought about. Always great to find out more ways to fix things.
good,"Spent 17 years with Pep Boys, most of those years were good.  The last three years were rocky.  Closing over one hundred stores in the United States.  Hard to stay positive."
good,"it is a great company with a lot of moving parts and is a great place to learn automotive repair and parts , great company to work for although training should be better"
good,"Not very organized and didn’t pay employees on time.nothing else to really say the money was good but the service to the employees wasn’t so good, need to improve in that department if they want to keep business there"
good,Nepotism and the lack of job advancement potential. Poor pay for management with little to no raises. Workplace culture is alright..............................
good,It a steady job. People I work with are fun and know their jobs. It can get repetitive at time doing oil changes and mounting tires all day for ten hours a day.
good,"Pep boys is a great place to get experience and training. As far as pay is concern, it is a joke for an entry level employee. It also very hard to get benefits and get promoted to full time. I would not recommend it as a full time job."
good,"No training, company is so large and growing every day. Not a person but a# corporate has in mind. Too many ways to loose the fairly small bonus possibility. Alot of work for the pay for a manager."
good,You're paid a low wage which isn't enough for the stress you're put under. Way to understaffed. The retail side was always a mess making it hard to find parts. The retail manager was unprofessional yelling at me while I was pregnant in front of customers because I put a customer on hold. Overall terrible place.
good,"Yeah I mean it's not a bad place to start working off if your young and into cars. But its really nothing more than that, unless you go to the auto servicing side."
good,"Fine until they were sold "
good,"It's a job no more no less I don't feel like it take a hike"
good,"still currently working here. so far nothing negative about this place!!! but, still seeking opportunity on the position as an automotive tech as my career."
good,"Pep boys is a good job for entry level technicians. The job is fast paced, and the learning curve is very easy once you get the hang of how thing roll there."
good,"Very cool place to work, mechanic work has always sought out to me and they were very inclined to help train me and even help me with ASE certifications."
good,"Very nice company to work for, worked here for 6+ years started as a driver & made my way up to a very well known commercial sales person. Unfortunately management in this company sucks & makes all their good employees leave & that is why they have people who have all these employees who have no clue what they're doing."
good,No comment  ... a mechanic damaged my truck and they were terrible on repairing it because I was a employee.. due to it they terminated me. And tried to cover up the hole incident ..Do not recommend the Lindenhurst store due to poor service managers..
good,"I did not think I would get this job because I had absolutely no experience with cars. I worked as a service writer, a cashier, and also the parts counter. The teach you everything you need to know and the system is self explanatory and so easy to use."
good,"Be consistant with the open door policy, empower associates to take care of customers. Upper management could actually spend quality time to coach and cultivate a strong culture in the company"
good,Great way to earn money but management can be a drag. Corporate is pretty stagnant about hiring new people so you’re liable to be stuck on your own. Advancement opportunities are scarce. Wouldn’t recommended this job for anyone just trying to make a quick buck
good,I was excited to start here but then after a few months pass it just became a repetition of nonsense and unmanageable headaches. They don't care for your safety.
good,"The company was bought a few years back and has been consistently changing ever sense.  In the DFW market probably 100 positions were eliminated and outsourced to a third party company. "
good,"Usually I would get in the middle of the day so I was usually swamped with work orders and had to do them quick for the customers waiting for me in the waiting area. I learned how to deal with very difficult customers and how to fill out work orders as well. The management is what was one of the bad things of the certain location I was at, they were rude complained and always found something to call you out in even if it was the smallest thing. Hardest part of the job was to have the customers not park in front of the bays and cause an accident because they were no careful. The best thing would be the employees I would work with on the cars, it made it very fun, time passed by quick and I would look forward to working with them daily."
good,Company has a strong mission that management sticks to very well. Stores are run efficiently and effectively to achieve best quality for customers and employees.
good,The sales targets were possible and you get some help reaching them. The pay was fair but there was no sales bonuses. I had a 9-5 so the schedule was good.
good,As an Auto Technician Pep Boys is a decent place to work.   Good service writers and Shop Managers are key to being able to make good money.   My experience was there was too much overturn with management to keep a stable income.   As soon as the Manager got great numbers they move on or the Corporation badgered them about meaningless nonsense and ran them off.
good,Pepboys isnt absolutely terrible but a lot of bad policies and too many people to contact and hoops to jump through to get anything done. The pay is decent but probably because they know you will have to earn it stressfully.
good,Pepboys was ok to work for it was a fun places when it was busy and by it being book time that we would get paid for they would give all the big jobs to their Master Tech and we would get all the little jobs which wasn’t fair but that’s the way some mechanic shop are .
good,"Here was where i had my first lessons about how to be a successful and productive manager."
good,I started as a bike builder at Christmas time and worked my way up to manager.  Company was fair by and large.  Worked typical retail hours including weekends.  At the time it was a better job for a twenty something.
good,Pep boys as a company wasn’t bad to work for. However the management they have is a joke. The manager had no idea how to manage people let alone do my job.
good,Full of customer involvement as well as leading/guiding the employees. After working here I have learned how to manage stress and unconfortable sistuations.
good,Very long hours for managers up to 70Hrs. per week. 
good,"This is your stereotypical corporate auto service facility. They have a mission statement of customer care first. This is not accurate, profit profit profit comes first second and third. Instead of focusing on taking care of customer needs they prefer to push the most profitable services"
good,basic auto retail store. fun to work at always interesting the team is amazing however no one really communicates with eachother . i am so sad i no longer work here
good,"I work as a parts delivery driver at the location in Ontario, it has its good days and bad ones. the problem is there is always so much traffic in the area, making fast deliveries can be a challenge. I also man the parts counter."
good,"decent place to work, not too much learning experience and a lot of down time, it fun to work with and dealing with customers. best thing is discount for parts and supplies."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Using different types of forklifts on daily basis picking items to order and loading onto truck. Picking and loading items in a quick, efficient, mistake free fashion."
good,"This was more of a fallback plan job. Didn't do much except sit in a cubicle, inserting some numbers. I would recommend, but mainly as a last resort. Nice people."
good,"Being a service writer, I meet and greet customers as they came in to have their vehicle serviced. Starting with the year maker and model of their vehicle."
good,good company to work for but the company is struggling to know its own I dentity.  Since the purchase through Ihcahn Automotive itis no longer the company i loved
good,Not a bad place to start your career as an entry level mechanic. Fair pace work.Ability to learn newer proper ways of servicing customer vehicles.It was ok
good,This is only a good place to work if you're a student or if you're looking for extra cash. Pay isn't enough to live off of and management doesn't seem to know what they're doing.
good,"Job was fine but didn't have heath insurance, it was a slow pace driving and bring up customers, have a okay discount but it was just 30 or 10 percent but company let me go because they no longer needed drivers."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers to assist with their needs.  Also enjoyed learning new things,  Enjoyed talking with customers and assisting with orders, special orders, inventory, maintained front customer service desk."
good,the work environment and coworker relations is decent most of the time. However the upper management group have no regard for the store level employees.
good,This is a car/automotive store where the mecanics work on cars and store has a lot of cool items for cars and parts to make the cars work better than most.
good,It was a decent job if you do not mind the slow pace of the environment. The upper management had no sense of urgency when it came down to training someone properly.
good,This company was ok to work for.  it was a relaxed environment and not as hectic as other companies.  Working for this company can help the entry-level employee about cars.
good,"it was mostly busy, sometimes dealing with difficult customers that didn't fully understand car mechanics and so on."
good,"I left company during reorganization, company reduce management staff in cost cutting move. Six months later company was sold.  The company continues to make cost cutting moves, staffing inside store to kept to a minimal hours, focus on core service business"
good,In terms of working experience Pep Boys was a fun place to work and I enjoyed working with the people I worked with same cannot be said for management since my employment has an issue management has changed and I have no doubt that it would be for the better of management remain the same place is fun management will be willing to work with you now instead of against you and will help you to complete any and all tasks instead of dumping all tasks on to other employees would recommend for somebody who is looking to work as much overtime as needed and is not afraid to work long nights early or long days well for the most part everyone can get along
good,Working with this company was great due to the fact that this was my first job after graduating High School.  I like working with all the employees and having the opportunity to meet different people.
good,"Preparation of Federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns and annual reports for multi-state consolidated group, research of Federal and state issues, including R&E credits and preparation of quarterly income tax provision under FAS109 and related financial statement disclosures."
good,Wish the computer systems were more up to date. Hard to find certain things needed when the system doesn't have the info. No tracking for parts on hold.
good,"Pepboys was my first job in the automotive business and pretty decent. Though the place was not good, the working experience was very good to learn from."
good,"I am a hard worker, and really enjoyed working for Justbeakes, but when Pepboys acquired  the company. Things changed , could never get fully staffed, so I feel it hindered the  store potential"
good,management was good easy going work place not enough work for me did not every make my 25 hr In a week to get my full pay that sucked and fellow tech would take all tickets in been  for there self
good,Pep Boys is a decent place to work for a new mechanic. There are definitely ways to advance if you are willing to put in the time. It's a great place to get experience.
good,Was a good job to get into the industry. Was long hours inconsistent with bonuses always found a way not to pay them out. Never got my vacation time very under staffed
good,"The co-workers made working there fun.  On the same token, you were constantly competing with them.  You get a base pay, then you get commission on the vehicles you worked on.  The managers overall were decent people and tried to be as amicable as possible.  But the District Manager put unrealistic expectations on all of us.  He would expect certain procedures to be done but wouldn't give us the proper tools required for the job and expected us to buy them."
good,Okay day to day.  Manager only wanted to make sure work got done. Easy work to me but there wasn't time to play.  Fast pace and keeps you busy.  No time for slacking.
good,It was easy for me to succeed there. If a person possesses good work ethic and sales-person-ship you can do well. I left because of choosing a career in the Navy.
good,"Good job overall. Needs an overhaul of personnel . Plenty of work ,not enough personnel/ management wanting to take responsibility for the task at hand."
good,"It is basically somewhere to start and learn about any car information. Learning about new things every day from both coworkers and customers. Ultimately, it is a good experience and a good job."
good,"Daily pre-cleaning, efficiently work on multiple cars at one time. Keeping appointments. I learned to be proactive. I helped manage the shop activity. Customer first culture. The hardest part is the pay. The most enjoyable part is helping people not just customers."
good,"Pep Boys is a decent place to start in the automotive retail business. The managers and coworkers were the best part of the job. Everybody knew the reality of working for Pep Boys, and we all got along with each other. The benefits were good, but the pay was terrible, especially after working there for a long time."
good,Work environment was great. Employees were all friendly and helpful. Learned alot from other technicians. Senior technicians are very willing to help one learn.
good,Short staffed with inconsistent leadership. If you can deal with rude customers and not fulfilling your job title you’ll be ok. I would never work here again.
good,the store itself is a good place to work and good job. the company it self has its fair share of issuses to have to deal with. the company got bought out few years ago and cut backs of differant types keeps hitting pay and hours
good,"Annual Inventory"
good,It was a fun enviroment to work in and a family oriented business. The pay rate is good and there are many opportunities to advance in the company in a short time.
good,"not a bad place to start your career. the atmosphere is laid back, people are great to work with. the only think is if your trying to make this career you would definetly need to work some where else. they dont offer any training on any new vehicle tech"
good,Help customer find what parts and other things they need. Keep the store clean and safe. Put product away when truck was delivered. Close the store at the end of the night.
good,"According to their website, Shop.com began as a catalogue comparison website, which allowed consumers to compare similar or identical items from a variety of different catalogues to see which product has the best price, shipping schedule, or warrant"
good,"Where to begin...  Upper management is all former STS throwbacks, with ZERO concept of a large retail environment.  Middle management is ill-experienced and rarely has ANY training in business development.  If you're an ASE certified technician, you're GUARANTEED to lose money on oil changes, tires, batteries, etc... Quite the insult of a new pay plan.  Make sure you keep HR's # handy...these folks LOVE to take advantage of their short-comings in adequate staffing.  Bottom line, it's a good start point for folks who are new to the business but, don't expect to actually LEARN anything positive, especially if this is your career choice."
good,Pep Boys was a great place to begin a career.  You can be eased into the transition of school to post gradation life.  However after a few years I am sure that you will find the move on and better your career.
good,Its a good place to get started I worked there while I was in school .  very understanding when going to school. the techs were willing to help when needed
good,"good place to work room for adavcment , ok money to start in some locatons. good management for the most partgood benefits  good culture and some down"
good,"Day starts before your clocked in bossing orders around expected to put away tire stock while fixing cars as they come in but when asked why its a mess still and they are not put away, working on cars like I was hired to wasn't the answer they want to hear, as they go back to the office to sit and complain"
good,pep boys has a good pay a little stresful but it has really good managment and coworkers it give you the oportunity to get a better position in your job
good,"The company overall was good, The hardest battle was career advancement and compensation, This is a place for high school kids, and people who want to see if they like the automotive industry"
good,great company to work for however the under pay the mechanics and expect you to be externally productive and the management staff were not so very great
good,I enjoy the company and the competing however I do not like empty promises. I was promised advancement but never received it even though I have the certifications. Managers have told me to figure it out on my own and I’ve tried every which way with no success
good,"great place to work for fun job  speed shop , auto parts , tire center ,all types of service foreign & domestic . if you have the need for speed & im behind the counter you will get b est service , great prices , profit on sales"
good,"•	Ensured on-time accurate deliveries to customers."
good,Good place to work. Nothing out of the ordinary........it's your typical customer service/retail type of job. If you need a job but not a career - this a good place.
good,good to learn the trade of a mechanic. working on all different kinds of vehicles. dissemble and re-assemble of parts. balancing and alignment for the wheels of cars.
good,Typical day working in customer service return merchandise and refunding money working with the public. I enjoy working with the public and the hardest thing was when the shipment of the stock truck would come in putting the shipment away would be all day process and maybe the next day. Working for Pep Boys I learned a lot about cars and the parts of cars
good,This job was a retail position while i was in between jobs. The manager i had was good but he retired while i was there. I did not have a manger after. i was reporting to a lead.
good,Pep boys has great potential in the industry but has never been able to convert its strength into a success.   This organization has gone through several management changes which has also impacted the organization.
good,"part sales ,automotive knowledge needed. interact with customers. quick pace, good working environment. decent stock of parts needed to sell. able to get time off as needed."
good,"It is sometimes a stressful place to work at most of the time as an"
good,If you like working on cars and have knowlage of cars it's a great place to wrk discounted auto parts..that was a plus and understanding s little more of how the cars work..the service department was awsome
good,"Departments do not work together. At times it feels as if they're working against each other. There is a lot of ""not my job"" mentality. Management is not approachable."
good,This was a good solid job opportunity for someone coming straight out of high school. It offered career moves to assistant manager or management positions with regional management positions available.
good,the job was steady work. the management could have used some improvement in certain areas. there could have been a few things to help improve certain conditions for employees.
good,Very pleasant professional work environment which allowed me to expand my financial experience in creative ways.  The introduction to financial modeling was invaluable.
good,"The Pep Boys is a low stress occupation that allows you to meet a variety of people a on daily basis. From ordinary people to auto mechanics, you do not know what types of people or problems that may present themselves on any given day."
good,The manager I had at Pep Boys was a very excellent one.  I typical day for me was to put up truck and help the customers.  The hardest part working there was dealing with the traffic getting to and from work.
good,I think I would have learned a lot more  if my contracts would have been extended. But it was up to my high school not Pep Boys. There is a lot of potential with this employer for someone who is trying to gain experience.
good,"Month, quarty and year-end closing is improved gradually"
good,"If there was better management and a slightly more relaxed atmosphere, this may be the perfect place to work.  Compensation for my services is the only thing that has really kept me here."
good,good place to work.  I work closing shift and it is tough to multi task but in the end the techs are great and people are always friendly.  Good place to start out in the automotive industry.
good,"Pep Boys sells automotive parts. They also service vehicles. If you like cars, then go ahead and work for them. If you do, the go ahead and do not apply"
good,Worked there during the Sept 11 terrorist act. Work was very slow. Working at a flat rate pay scale during slow times is not very profitable. The mechanics with the most time on the job received the most work.
good,"Doesn't pay very well. Management's stress puts more pressure on employees. Work load is unbalanced. Overall relaxed and easy work enviroment, just didn't feel like work was being appreciated or compensated enough."
good,"It has its good days and bad days."
good,I learned a lot about retail and also about the knowledge of cars and how to be a good salesmen. We met a lot of customers who appreciated our service.
good,The manage meet is good they always have something to do there very understanding willing to help pay is okay not very busy so you spend a lot of time cleaning n fixing the shelves
good,Overall this company needs better management. Upper management is so out of touch with lower management and lower management is often overworked due to lack of employees/ staffing.
good,no desire to return. do not feel i was treated fairly. no work reviews and essentially no raises in four years. favoritism shown to part time employees.
good,"the pay was not great , they start you off really cheap , the work load is stressful for the amount of pay  , so its nor really worth it, good job to start if you want to learn about parts and shops"
good,"This was the worst job that I had. First of all it was a sexist job. I worked around mostly messy men and they didn't know how to talk females. I don't know if it was because it was a auto center. I didn't like this job at all. I had to do everything,and I wasn't the only one working in the store, Yes I know I was a Supervisor but I would not recommend anyone working there."
good,"guaranteed hours, room for growth. company has been sold there are a lot of changes to come that no one knows what the future holds. Sometimes overworked and understaffed but manageable."
good,"Work with 5 other retired drivers that are pleasent to get along with . Job contains making delivies to customers in about a 25 mile radius ,also pulling orders and duing inventory ."
good,It's a fast pace environment and working there will teach you something new every day. I had a great experience I enjoyed working with the people there.
good,"I liked the job at first, but my manager would leave me alone with the shop most of the day and sales were difficult to maintain. Manager also sexually harrassed me and would come to work intoxicated."
good,"Fix multiple  cars through out the day. Maintain a clean and safe work bay. diagnosis vehicle repairs to service writer, then perform repairs approved by customer."
good,"Typically slow, not much excitement going on. "
good,Flexible hours that can work with your schedule if you are currently going to school or have another job. You also learn a lot about automotive parts and accessories.
good,Can be better as any other but gets me by so grateful. as always the real burden falls on the employees with good work ethics and the slackers slack off.
good,"Not a career field for myself.  Friendly staff, but not much training.  Need to be ready to deal with unhappy customers who are having car issues.  Great first job or part time job"
good,".It's a fun place to work, but pay as manager does not increase. As a manager i understand that i have to deal with difficult situations, but i sometimes wish i could have stayed as a normal sales associate."
good,"It can be easy to move up in the store, but that depends on where you start. When a higher position is available, hiring starts from within the company, so if management feels an employee is up to the job, they will hire from within the store before looking outside of the company"
good,"At Pep Boys, I had so much to learn rather than at Toyota. Pepboys I left because I did not get paid much and did not want to give me a raise or promote me."
good,"Typically at Pep Boy's by the time you showed up to work either early or for a later shift, there was guaranteed to be someone waiting for help. That may seem bad at first, but business was good and volume was what this place was known for. Only 5 service bays in this small shop yet somehow we pushed out nonstop work daily.  I learned how to deal with a fast paced environment and I believe because of my experience there I can work just about anywhere. The most difficult thing however was trying to fit in everyone that would come in on a given day. A couple of the bad reviews there had mentions of how people weren't able to get service because of how busy it was.  Management felt personal though somewhat lenient. The most enjoyable part was definitely besting a fellow advisor or being the top performer."
good,"Rebuilding calipers, cutting rotors, timing belts, water pumps, oil and filter changes."
good,"My personal experience with Pep-boys is bitter sweet. Overall a very professional environment, a great place to start for a beginning technician looking to get their foot in the door."
good,"Started out great, but working coming into the shop started getting slow after i reached the 2 year mark. And in a flat rate shop, that means if no cars come in, you no money comes in either."
good,good work environment decent management. good flow of work and parts usually on hand for quick turn around. shop and store well maintained
good,Good to work for as an entry level technician. Good for college students to get a little extra cash. The people are fun to work with and great helpers.
good,"lack of work did not learn much and management is okay at times, some co-workers complain too much and lack moral. The hardest part was of the job was enough work coming in."
good,"good company and good place, but very wire cause low hours to work, on winter low customer come to fix his car. old shop, old machines and old manager,"
good,"Good times, good people, this was a long tim ago so review cant be most up to date. Enjoyed my time working there as it helped get me through school."
good,"I was a sophomore engineering college student who loved working on cars and wanted some business and customer service experience in the same area. "
good,"I learned a lot from here, it was a good company, we all got along as a good team we helped each other when it was slow, clean the shop, i trained several new employes"
good,Working at Pep Boys was fun. I worked with one of my best friends so that was the best part. A typical day was 8 hours of making sure all the customers were taken care of appropriately. MY managers and coworkers were all fun. The hardest part was restocking day. Every Wednesday we had to restock with only 3-4 people.
good,"Repaired vehicles as they came in. Sold auto services. Business was a hit or miss on most days. I enjoyed the work but being dirty everyday was not so pleasant. Co-workers were great, helped each other out."
good,"Overall, a good place to work to advance as an automotive professional and sharpen your skills. Working on cars is a passion of mine, so that was the most rewarding part of working here. The politics and technicalities of dealing with management and other employees got frustrating and was probably the hardest part of working here. That, and the scheduling."
good,"Excellent pay with commissions, good working conditions, managers were really cool along with the coworkers, Not a fan of the nasty customers, was suppose to be promoted to mechanic but the ball was dropped by the managers and that never went through."
good,Currently going through a takeover.  The atmosphere is one of uncertainty. There is a new management team with some speculation that relocation is imminent.
good,"Working at Pep Boys consisted of a lot of customer relational skills. I worked with them on a daily basis discussing issues or concerns with their vehicles and then giving a recommendation on what should be done to help. I relied on the computer system daily to order parts when out of stock, or to compare pricing with our biggest competitors. All of my co-workers and I worked together as a team to get things done correctly and to ensure that each customer left happily and willing to come back again. I also shared my knowledge of auto parts and vehicular care products with the customers whenever they were unaware of what to use or why they should purchase a particular item. Although I would occasionally get a discruntled customer, I always enjoyed doing my best to make them feel comfortable and at ease knowing that their vehicle was in the hands of trusted professionals."
good,Started out as an installer. Job mainly revolves around tire and lube. Friendly and helpful environment. Questions will be answered if asked.
good,"It has the typical work from a day to day work . Influx of customers keep the work flowing and not just standing there. Some days there are barely no customers coming in the shop, then you're just standing there in the store. Management was okay. Co-workers were nice to meet and converse with ."
good,"ok place to work, not much trainging,but has a ok atmosphere. This job does require long hours for management. You work with limited staff, and have to be creative with your ability to sale"
good,"I worked at pep boys while they were in the process of buying out Big ten tires. The people i worked with were very nice, except for the management. They were terrible"
good,Although online orders was a terrible experience.They tried to tend to customer needs. Very fun place to work.Managers were very reliable . Area Manager was very helpful to employee needs
good,"The people I worked with are incredible. Tolerant and funny but with a lack of motivation to wish to succeed anymore than what's been given. I loved working with other employees and management. Management was somewhat tight because lack of workers (Pep Boys had laid off employees and looked to increase profit). Overall, the experience wasn't that great because of the lack of workers and company organization but the people I did work with made the situation slightly better."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be changing oil,lights,batteries, etc... on a vehicle,I learned a lot about vehicles and how to fix and change things when something is wrong,the management there was good I had good co-workers,the hardest part of the day was when I'm fixing a truck or suv,the most enjoyable part of the is when I'm cleaning to close shop...."
good,In general it is a good place to take your car if you don't have a place where to fix it. And if you are a do it yourself kind of guy the store has almost everything you need to take care of your car projects.
good,"Retail Manager for automotive parts and service provider. Full responsibility for sales, payroll, P&L, inventory and internal control, merchandising, and marketing."
good,"I've worked here for 17 years and the up and down pays have become a problem with the large increases in health care cost."
good,"Enjoyed the challenge of running a store that combined three facets of the automotive aftermarket, retail sales, commercial sales, and an automotive service department. Learned how to sell tires."
good,Pep Boys is a fine company to work for in that the people are nice and everyone tries to help each other. The general retail philosophy of the company was not up to industry standards and as such sales did not really improve over the last ten years. The company was recently sold to Bridgestone.
good,Customer service position with management responsibilities. I assisted customers with their automative needs by suggesting the prober parts to fix their vehicles.
good,"There are hundreds of hours of training materials available on nearly all aspects of automotive repair and terminology. The job does not require knowing about cars but is willing to teach a lot. Having useful information to pass on to customers can be rewarding."
good,Pepboys is a great part time job especially if you like cars. They are stocked with a lot more than it's competitors: AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts. If you are knowledgeable about cars and like helping resolve customer car issues then this is a good place to work.
good,"clock in work. unlock tool box and get straight to work if there is any on your hook. if there's not clean the shop until there is. "
good,"Very easy work, minimal lifting. Good customer service is a must with this company. Very flexible for high school and college students."
good,"a typical day at pep boys is a coming in and clocking in on time. repairing my day cleaning off my forklift/ cherry picker. getting the orders from inventory no if there is cycle count or checking reserves. "
good,I would arrive at work ready to take tickets for maintenance. I learned a great deal of from the guys there. management easily was a big problem with a blame game here and there. the hardest part was major maintenance problems. the most enjoyable was the fulfillment of a happy customer.
good,Wasnt the best place to have work done at the time but got bussier after i left couldnt flag enough hours due to lack of customers.
good,Great places to work with great people if you like hard work and heat this is the place for you . Missing working there with the team I had
good,working here is good. its all depend on your manager you are working with. you have your bad days and good ones. working here you will not have a personal life
good,"Typical day at the shop is, changing tires, oil and batteries. Management was cool coworkers are easy to get along with. Very fast paced environment."
good,"Dealing with angry customers is never fun. However, the weeks when you have a few grand in sales and take home a good commission, is pretty nice. It's hit or miss. Not a bad job, not a great job. You WILL get sick of doing oil changes."
good,"Involved with opening and closing of service center including cash handling and safe management."
good,Pep boys can be a good place to work if upper management did there job better. The stores make alot of money but need better guidance
good,"Pepboys has many opportunities for advancement."
good,Busy day at work . I have Learned more Service Advisor Technics. I also have Learned more Management Skills in the Auto Service department . Very  Reliable Techs on hand . Their is no hard part of my Job . I just do what need to be done. being apart of a Large Cooperation
good,"Overall this is a mediocre company to be with. While they offer plenty of training for employees, and even classes to attend, the employee is left to advance themselves within the company. While this may not be a bad thing, some may struggle with it. The job is quite stressful and wears quickly on you if you're not used to the conditions of a shop enviorment"
good,"Before I started this job, I didn't know anything about cars.  I was very thankful to learn the basics about cars.  Management needed a little work but other than that great place to work."
good,"A difficult place to work, both due to factors within and without.  Nobody is ever happy about having to go to the mechanic, and the stress from management above the store level to push sales pinches the employee between a rock and a hard place.  Coupled with shrinking pay the longer you are with company and trying to hire a new person at an insulting rate, retention is rare and turnover is terrible.  If it wasn't for the many folks working together to make the best of it, and the gratitude of those few customers that truly appreciate the help we give them, Pepboys would almost be intolerable to work for."
good,"Up selling standard oil change to get other service such as brake fluid flushes, transmission flush, or engine filter replacements. Learned how to do multiple posistion"
good,"enjoyed going to work everyday, days go by really fast when you enjoy working with your team and assisting customers. learned more about the automotive industry, became a better manager even was offered a promotion into field management."
good,"i learned to repair vehicles at a timely matter. coworker , and treated decent. flexible schedules, good hours, and close to home."
good,"Work is always busy, make sure customers come first. Assure all items are stocked and organized. Co-workers are always helpful and very hard working. I learned everything I need to know to work in this field. There is no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customer don't think twice about purchasing an item that is needed and has no limit in money."
good,mostly all customer that came in complained about pricing. Management was not the greatest. Everyone complained about work that was given
good,"Working at pep boys taught me a lot, from customer satisfaction and how to sale a recommended parts or tools. And how to fix basic problems on a vehicle."
good,"working with cowork and great teammember job site , help the customer with find the right part and happy customer with home with the part for the car ..."
good,"Greeted customers and helped them find the proper merchandise."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customer needs.  I've learned patience is a virtue.  The management was very relaxed.  My co-workers were helpful in getting through the day and completing tasks.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with situations involving unhappy people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning everything about cars.
good,It could have been a great experience but I was young and did not know certain things that I wished later I had said something. More needs to be done to keep customers happy and keep them coming    back.  Need to know that certain mangers did not care at all about employees and they would feel afraid to say anything and it could have been a better job if I had been able to talk to someone as a mentor or helper when you don't know who to report something too.
good,"very long days and hours"
good,"Pep Boys was my first job, very basic place to work, no stress or heavy work load. I learned about about the Automotive industry working here and other aspects of the work force. A typical day started out with clocking in and traveling to different locations dropping off parts to various car dealers and privately own automotive places. The delivery parts range in size and weight, some can be really heavy others light as a feather. The hardest part of the job is looking for certain parts in the store and finding some of the small automotive shops.  On the hot Fl summer days outside delivering parts can feel brutal at times."
good,"I worked for them for 5 years and only got a raise when I was promoted, which is the only reason I took the promotion, you can work there for 20 years and never receive a raise unless you are promoted. The employees dont know anything about cars, the service dept employees are there because they need a job, they dont care about anything else, they fix things that arent broken, and they arent truthfull about repairs to the customers."
good,"Not a very welcoming, and didn't encourage a team environment. Scheduling was a definite plus."
good,"A typical day at pep boys was always full of surprises, we would be either short handed with staff and have to pull your weight around helping in every position inside of the store. Most of the management was normally very understanding if something came up or if they would ask you to stay late if they needed help."
good,"A typical day at work I was responsible for activities included in running a retail automotive parts and service business. I learned a lot about sales and building a team. My manager taught me to be self sufficient and helped me to feel confident in my abilities. My co-workers were like family as I spent nearly as much time with them. The hardest part about the job was properly balancing projects, daily assignments and leadership as well as being a sales performer. I really enjoy customer service, it fills me with joy to help others."
good,Company went through allot of changes some good some not so good. New Owner really trying.
good,Great coworkers and management. Coworkers are team players and are willing to help.
good,"Spent most of my day stocking, doing inventory, merchandising as well as customer service."
good,Co workers and management were great. Great place for advancement.
good,"A typical day at Pep Boys consist of working with cars, trying to up sale other services to customers vehicles. What I learned was how to work in customers cars proficiently and delivery vehicles in a timely matter."
good,Great experience working here and learned alot as my first job in the business
good,"Company doesn't trust it employees cameras every where little chance for advancement .As a service advisor i made less than minimum wage plus 1percent commission this was supposed to motivate you to sell more why would you work harder to get 1penny out of every dollar you sold?"
good,"great job, great staff, as long as you work hard you will succeed"
good,"Interesting work environment for employees with automotive interests."
good,"Handled cash register,provided customer service. Required inventory,and general maintenance"
good,Learned a lot from direct management. Nice entry level job.
good,"Work on cars clean up when there is no vehciles in the shop"
good,"prepare to help customers, clean an stock store. help other co workers"
good,Not to bad a job as a service writer. You can learn customer service and learn about cars and customers
good,Pep Boys is a solid company with solid hard working people.  Opportunities for advancement are tough.
good,Great place to work for to gain experience. The company cap is low. Must be able to work fast pace as well.
good,being it was automotive/parts store it was always busy you never had a dull moment there and the managers and co-workers were really good people to communicate with.
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers with automotive car parts. As a woman I was out numbered by men. For the most part management was consistent. The hardest part of the job was remembering car parts, but once you grasped everything it was a decent job."
good,I do alot of computer work to get all of the orders ready for the day time workers to pick
good,loved my job all we needed was for the managers to care for there associates more
good,"Decent place to start a career, paid training, broad aray of positions available"
good,Overall it was a nice place to work and you  were able to meet some nice people who came in to get there vehicles serviced
good,Great group of people to work with and for. Customers were pleasent mostly. Sorry I left this job.
good,"A typical day here is assisting customers with purchases and encouraging them to apply for a credit card and extended warranties on certain products, using a POS System, stocking products on Truck Days. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers who insulted my intelligence because of my gender and the fact that I was working in an auto retail setting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction the customers received."
good,A typical day for me varies because I worked in multiple departments. I may not work the same department two days back to back. It's a pretty fast pace environment. I learned how to be a versatile worker by learning different departments. The management system was very affective. The co-workers are easy going people. Easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was unloading trailers by hand. The product can be heavy at times. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the chemistry with the co-workers.
good,"Answer phones and help walk-in customers. Look up parts and quote prices. If parts are sold write up tickets and deliver the parts. Responsible for inventory control on a daily basis. Work with managers and other associates to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of this job would be taking a store that isn't making money to being profitable. It takes time, but it's a lot of hard work. If I didn't like what I do I wouldn't have been there this long."
good,"pep boys is an all around good company. the management was okay.  a typical day at work consisted of coming in opening up the store,  preparing for the morning rush of vehicles.  i learned quite alot while at the company this includes expanding my knowledge of automotive repair.  the co-workers were amazing,  they were like a second family, while im no longer employed at the company i still hang out with my previous co-workers,  they were extremly patient when i first started helping when i needed assistance.  the hardest part of the job was being over worked and under paid,  some times we would pull a 12 hour day of non stop work with an under manned crew, at times there were up to 40+ vehicles and only two employees  . but the most enjoyable part would have to of been working with my previous co-workers."
good,I love working with the mechanics and customers. Sadly towards the end the company could not find someone to replace the previous manager.
good,"Worked in the parts department mostly. Would spend some time on the floor helping customers."
good,"if you wanna work somewhere where they barely give you hours and give the new guy more money, this is the place to work."
good,"Typical workday consists mostly of delivering auto parts to customer shops and garages, Driving sales and telemarketing over the phone. Co-workers are very nice and great to work with. Benefits aren't that great if your part time. Don't eran any PTO until 3 years of service, which I think is ridiculous. Not great pay for all the work involved and what we have to do. Overall an okay job with with great people to work with and not so great benefits and pay."
good,Lots of work in the store. Multi talented cashier and auto parts.
good,Give the customer what they ask for. Inventory stock. Have good customer service.
good,"Great starting job, you will expand your knowledge on automobiles."
good,"place is not well kept, meet lots of different people mostly men daily, managers usually stay in office all day so no help, zero security so lots of loss in revenue, lots of down time and long days"
good,"Cash handling from clock in to out"
good,good co-workers. had nice management and customers. close to good restaurants. on busline
good,working in retail is very rewarding as you get to deal with different people every day 
good,management was easy to get along with.  enjoyed co workers and work enviroment
good,it  was a great place to work u got dirty everyday but that was a part of the job. this is a nice job for someone that does not have any major bills to pay or does not have any children.
good,"•	Maintaining an accurate register count "
good,"Customer Service, cashier, planograms, parts, recalls, working closely with management"
good,"Mainting daily paperwork , Greeting customers with a positive attitude"
good,"must of the work done there are brakes, tires and alignments. I learned new things, in the automotive industry there is always something new to learn . like in any small or big corporation management is very important is the key to a successful business. Good communication , working as a team and a respectful environment, creates good relationship among co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when there is to much to do and not enough time to finished. The most enjoyable part of the job is when is accomplished and every body is happy."
good,good place to work it was hot that why i left the boss was very nice 
good,"This company is very very very hypocritical. Don't get me wrong though, its a great place to work and meet new people who love doing their job, but the company says one thing and then does another."
good,"A typical day depends on position, but most positions are commission based (including management) which makes the work environment very tough to be part of day in and day out. It is as you have to keep an eye on everything with your co-workers to make sure your getting your sales and on top of that keeping up with your customers to make them as happy as possible since most are not due to a broken down vehicle."
good,"Opening the store at 0800 I would first great the customers and listen to what type of work they requested be done to their vehicle. Then I would proceed to fill out a CSR (Customer Service Request form) and gather basic information about their vehicles, such as mileage, brand, make and model along with any other prevalent information (wear on tires,damage to vehicle etc.) Next, I would input customer information into the database and quote them for repairs or maintenance work that they wanted done to their vehicle. Upon agreement of the work, I would print out the paperwork with their request(s), have the customer sign and hand off the vehicle to a mechanic. I would inform the mechanic what the customer was coming in for today and get a estimate of time needed to complete the work. Furthermore, any issues that arose from working on the vehicle I would communicate from the mechanic to the customer and provide additional quotes on fixing those issues. This position required that I would be as independent as possible.I loved to work on cars."
good,like it says good dudes to work with and learn bad place because you could be the best at what you do and laid off an hour later
good,"As Sales manager i can tell you this was a very exited experience, fun people to work with and respectful costumers."
good,- Worked on cars
good,many high skilled mechanics willing to teach me different ways and styles to better my work
good,"Provided customer service for internal clients and over six hundred stores nationwide; Analyzed and troubleshooted various hardware and software issues associated with printers, dumb terminals, and AT&T (Globalyst 630) server. Utilized a problem management system (Remedy) for tracking, updating, and resolving problems; followed up with clients while informing of technical progress."
good,"i did general service which included oil changes, brake changes, tire services, and fuel and air filter changes"
good,"i really enjoyed my position as a service tech. customers relationship is a experience that is needed in this world. the only hardest parts of this job when things slow down. the most joy albout this job, you earn your pay and go home to your family."
good,Pricing and writing up a sales proprosal for a customers auto repair. Selling auto parts.
good,"Work days are always busy. From the start of the day to closing, you will never find yourself in a moment without work. Great or terrible management really depends on location as there are many different pepboys. Co-worker's attitudes and respect towards you also depends on locations. The hardest part of the job is also it's most rewarding part: Being constantly busy."
good,"Great experience relating to the automotive field. Great place to work while in school, flexible hours."
good,"The job was fun with working on cars and having a good atmosphere. But, the pay was very low."
good,"great place to work, management was friendly. Lots of favoritism"
good,"Started as a installer worked my way up to Technician , Learned alot and worked hard."
good,"Customers deserve fast, friendly and accurate service. I learned to be multi-functional while providing quality customer service."
good,"competition kills this company lost what made it great,untrained techs leading to continued mistakes and wrong diagnosis of automobiles,"
good,A good portion of my coworkers were incredibly knowledgeable however a handful I wouldn't let near my car. I really enjoyed this job and would have looked at long-term but I was severely underpaid. There is a commission/labor on top of a whooping $6.00/hour (in Texas at least) with a minimum hourly being minimum wage (making it $7.25/hour) in which I never made more.
good,The people there are very friendly and some are very hard workers. The Employees respect customers and treat them with respect.
good,"typical day at work would be fast paced, learning as i go along, the management was good, my coworkers were always there to help if needed, the hardest part of the job was leaving work because i enjoyed working on cars, the most enjoyable part was working on cars because that's my hobby."
good,"A typical work day is always about customer service. Greet, smile, with positive energy, and deliver sales. Most of my coworkers put in the weight of the job. Just some need a little more push with working as a team. I have learned parts, services that go along with fixing a vehicle. The biggest challenge part of the job is trying to get everyone to get along and gossip. The most enjoyable part about the job is about meeting new people and giving the best customer service there is."
good,Pepboys contain a group of employers that become a working family that provides the best customer service as possible.
good,was good working for this place just the manager had a favoriism for other associates and was not equal with others
good,"The only problem I had with Pep Boys was, the upper management was changing so frequently it led to constant changes in policy leading to the day to day work becoming more difficult."
good,PEPE BOYS CO. is just like fast food place for Automotive Industry. But the parts does not have any quality. PEP BOYS employees need good QC & CARE Training Program.
good,"Worked as a parts associate for almost 3 years. Schedules are somewhat flexible. Management may or may not treat employees well depending on their mood, but for the most part OK. Computers and point of sales systems are ridiculously outdated, very slow and at times unusable. The biggest drawback of this job is dealing with clueless customers who don't take the time to research simple solutions. Even though it's part of the job to help customers, it's necessary for everyone to have some common knowledge/sense about the cars they're driving. Overall made some good friends and connections working there."
good,"Busy All the time. Customers are rude. The Company wants to satisfy the customers, at the same time, they don't provide you the tools to do so.... You overworked. Get Frustrated all time. You have to Multi-Tasking and be able to work under pressure.  For the amount of work that need to be done, the Company really underpay"
good,Well it's a great company and one of the best. Its just the people who run it in southern California that are the problem. My former boss was with them 16 years and was gunna get fired for a comment between friends and a associate look at his phone and told her bff another manager something. I witnessed witnessed lose prevention fire good guys that just did nothing wrong and say they stole from
good,"I feel like its not good supervisor that this job. We work on holidays and dont get holidays pay. Just need a better job, than this. Pep Boys it no help and you working with slow people."
good,It's a great place to work but they dont ever settle to get into a trend. Things are forever changing and uncertain. They have had loads of talent in the past that they have just drained the life from some and leaving them feeling used rather than part of a team
good,"Typical work day is overloaded mornings due to customers making their own appointments not considering they have a clue of how many mechanics there will be. Late afternoon is too slow, just finishing the work you recommended to the customers until 5pm. After 5, you may be the only mechanic there and you will get slammed again. Also, you are supplying your own tools, so they should be paying more anyways."
good,"Good people to work with, Management seems okay, as a Mechanic, you're expected to stay past scheduled hours. No paid sick days, 401k available along with medical and dental. Overall a good place to start but not to build a career off of."
good,"Ok get treated unprofessional  it’s not worth it to be honest it’s better jobs that will make sure I’m good and treat me with respect they had me riding on equipment with no certification I asked over and over again still didn’t get it to much moving in different areas not enough work get sent home early restocking products I’m areas that are to full and falling behind the shelf’s the place need new management and team members. The job is ok the pay is not , we do not get a raise as promise in this company. The new hire get treated differently from the ones that been there for years."
good,"Phones, customer service, put up stock. I learned merchandising and inventory systems.Management was based on motivation by fear. Hardest part of the job was not being able to trust anyone. Best part was making customers satisfied."
good,"Undergoing changes in an effort to clear out the building for a potential sale.  Workers on edge whether their job is secure or not."
good,I would recommend working for PepBoys with the acknolagement that managment has an unrealistic expectation for sales. Managment could use work but fellow employees were helpful. Company could defiantly use more education on how to obtain high sales. Training and orientation  is very short. Employees could use more training on copreration protocols. Good work environment but no place to advance career wise.
good,"i thought the job was one of the best I've worked on in a number of years.I enjoyed the attention to detail,my supervisor demanded from his employees,making sure our equipment was up to standards.As well as giving you time off as needed."
good,"I Have nothing but good things to say about my experience working at pepboys. They allowed me to work a flexible schedule, in order to keep my home life in order.I needed time off for personal reasons they were always accommodating."
good,Product knowledge is a must! If you work on your own vehicles you should have a good head start. You must be able to interact well with customers and be able to listen to their needs.
good,"I liked the job,but I'm ready to move on to something else not as stressful. Closer to home.perhaps a better work environment. I would like to just move on."
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the store , helping customers,"
good,"Everyday consisted of constantly trying to find and up-sell services that many times the customer did not need, if you came in for a simple oil change you would leave with an estimate for over "
good,If you like working with cars and car parts this might be a good culture and place for you to learn. The turn over was high at times as is expected in some retail industry stores.
good,Very good people learned a lot and build a great friendship with people I would recommend people to work if they are looking to get into basic stuff n willing to learn n branch off to say they had the experience
good,I would control the store after the two other managers went home and i would take over the night shift. Pretty slow pace job and was easy to get down. Learned a lot about cars and all the parts it takes to fix them. Only challenge was inventory day every week placing heavy parts away and assisting customers.
good,"Highly varied work schedule."
good,Fast paced environment. Working at Pep Boys you have to be on top of things as far as keeping up with shop standards and knowing your product and technicians.
good,"I liked working here, like a lot of national chains, there can be good and bad managers. I really liked mine. I did not think that the pay scheme was fair to the employees. They paid under minimum wage per hour, +additional compensation for paying jobs completed."
good,"Work day starts at 7am review previous day sales compare in line with budget, update online trackers at 7:30 hold morning meeting to discuss sales, upcoming events and managing inventory. store opens at 8am ready to greet customers meet and exceed their needs."
good,Very bad culture with people looking to throw you under the bus as soon as they can to protect themselves. very cut throat culture! Its like going to prison everyday except you get to leave at the end of the day.
good,"Ok place to work, but salary is to low.  The techs that work there are ok at best.  There are some good techs, but few and far between.  Only holidays off are Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"my experience at pepboys was bitter sweet, I loved working with the people there, yet the management sucked and they were not really helpful. The manger would go for a cigarette break every hour and he would be gone for 30 mins every time. in that time I would have to deal with the customers, the register, and getting the parts for web orders or the loop pick up. I loved dealing with automotive questions, but the most stressful part was dealing with many customers while no one other helped me."
good,"I've worked here for just about 5 years, I've advanced throughout the company itself. Each location is different. You meet new people and learn different things. I've taken what each Manager has taught me and applied it to my own work ethnic. The people behind the titles are great people but I found some people were placed in the wrong positions."
good,"Some of the managers don't recognize your job."
good,"It's an easy to do and learn job. If you truly wanna learn a lot about sales and maintenance, this will be a decent place to start at. But... proceed with caution since management isn't really the best."
good,"It can be easy to move up in the store, but that depends on where you start. When a higher position is available, hiring starts from within the company, so if management feels an employee is up to the job, they will hire from within the store before looking outside of the company."
good,"The pepboys that i ran was one of the only profitable multimillion dollar location.Extremelly busy service dept. Which i have increased each month i was there, The company went thru a huge buyout to new ownership.Which made the location understaffed and pay cuts."
good,"A typical day at work consists of performing maintenance on vehicles. Management is decent. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on cars, cars and cars."
good,the location I was was at was very friendly but the management was horrible. but overall a great and friendly environment to work and grow in
good,"Really enjoyed working with my co-workers and dealing with new customers on a day to day basis. Also learning new things everyday about cars was very intriguing to me because I love being in and around cars, its what I love to d"
good,"If you work with the right guys, the job can be fun. However the pay and benefits are shameful for the responsibilities you are given. Its a door into the automotive world, but not much more than that."
good,Pepboys is the place for parts with new products in the store everyday. Service has ASe tech ready help all hour automotive needs.
good,"Overall, This place is a good place to get you're Career Start, That is about it. This is not a place to work for, for you're whole life. Years ago I might have said yes. If you're a seasoned Mechanic I don't recommend it. If you're fresh out of school I would say it's alright just build you're knowledge and get out. Management at my Store is Partially Horrible. Service Writers Constantly Ripping Customers off on the daily or you Put one thing on the work order and the customer is told something completely different or it's twisted to make it sound worse than it is. Overall Good for Short Term Not good for Long term."
good,Typical auto parts supplier that provides solutions to customer needs.Availability of many different types of products and services makes it convenient for customers. My involvement in company's operations was limited due to nature of my job.
good,"it was cool, until the new owners take over, everything that was beneficent to the employee went south. they start working on Sunday, stay open later too."
good,Great Automotive Culture. Fun and willing-to-help co-workers. Excellent Benefits. Opportunity for personal and career growth.
good,Pep Boys gives a chance to employees without experience to build their skills that allows them growth within the company. Only bad is the health benefits and compensation.
good,"Great coworkers, great place to learn, and not so bad customers for  retail. Wouldn't recommend for long term employment. Company has high goals with little reward. I feel bad for part timers no more then 27hrs a week."
good,"take and receive calls, helping costumers in store and on phone with car issues."
good,I loved this job. I have a great passion for cars and this job was the best for me. If they just paid me better i would still be working there right now. I have learned so much and absorbed all the information and i used it while helping customers.
good,"great employees, as in many others, it's not the company, but employees in upper management who is not considerate"
good,Working conditions are fair there are no benifits fo r parttime workers no schedualed brakes.There is no advancement avail.Immed. Management are good to work for .Hours are sched.On business and are varied.Vehicles are not kept in good condition mechanicly or is time given to keep them clean.
good,Good place to work unless your looking to make a career out of being a mechanic. The way your treated makes you want to quit if you could afford it.
good,"Good place to work, most people like it but dont love it because of real training.  Training all online."
good,Knowing about car parts is almost a must because a lot of people ask questions on car parts and mechanical problems. Must be able to deliver quickly and keep customer happy. They always want fast deliveries with everything they asked for. Driving was the majority of the work involved
good,This job was a very slow paced. We hardly had any customers come in and there wasn't very much to do. In this job I learned how to operate a cash register for the very first time. The management was laid back although the parts manager and the sales manger were bickering all the time. My co-workers were very friendly people and eager to help me learn more about the sales environment. The hardest part of my job was trying to get people to sign up for the rewards card while the most enjoyable part of my job was helping out customers look for what they needed.
good,"co workers were the worst part about this job, older mechanics tend to not take criticism well, regardless if your trying to help or not. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unrealistic expectations of going above and beyond while still completing tasks in a short time frame"
good,"I got to drive around Oceanside to drop off auto parts to customers, got to learn more about cars. I love the fact that to know the customers better. My manager at the time was very helpful and was always willing to teach my new things."
good,"A typical day at work at Pep Boys includes assisting customers in-store or on the phone, replenishing stock, and making sure the service technicians receives their parts to work on customers' vehicles.  The work environment is a fast-paced one, with a task always needing to be done.  Employees there usually share the same passion about cars and motorsports.  Management tends to be lenient, but is needing growth in disciplinary action.  The job is enjoyable when I am able to provide customers with a feeling of trust and comfort."
good,"this is the place where i learned stock, customer service and working  with the public. it was a good start for me."
good,"hardest part is doing 3-4 cars at a time because they had a appointment, teaching new workers that have no automotive skill."
good,any normal day at Pep boys is very fast  paced. The good thing is the faster you work the more you get paid. the bonus system is a good way to make more money. My position has given me skills that I could use in other jobs. the management is mostly very supportive and reward the hard working for there effort. The environment makes for the associates to be very close and friendly. The hardest part of the job is just getting up to pace with the productivity. The most enjoyable part of the job is incentive bonus at the end of the month.
good,Different vehicles from all makes and models would come in so you get to learn a lot about different vehicles.
good,"The co workers in the shop were great people made me happy to go work every day , this company is one that u can learn form if u just started learning about cars they will take in anyone.. cant make this company a career or u wont make no money here waste of your time"
good,You work on lots of cars in a big shop. Hardest part is dealing with customers and service writers when they get over whelmed.
good,Overall a good place to work if al you want is money from a career at the risk of losing your vlues as a human being
good,"Due to the age of the facilities, which are pretty well kept, space for the required equipment for service is limited. Space between work stations is insufficient."
good,worked with people that have something to prove
good,"Busy and always changing thats what was great and a pain at the same time. I learned a lot from the office manager, she was always willing to teach you anything she knew. Loved most of the people i worked wtih."
good,it's a great company to work for and offers great benefits. pay can be worth it if you move up in the company. Working as a sales lead it was a great way to gain experience with customer service and be able to help people find products and share my knowledge
good,"To be honest I loved working at pep boys, got to meet a lot of customers or employees. The down fall on working there was the pay rate. For the amount of work I did I didn’t get paid well."
good,"Clean organized shop, with attached parts store for quick repairs. Strong team with many many years of experience. While I worked there it was bought out and closing, went through many managers and lost the team."
good,Terrible pay minimum  wage they work you like a horse in order to get more pay and they don't give weekends off it's a good place to start if you want to get your foot in the door
good,Very good company to work for. Left the company to advance my career. the automotive business is very competitive and diversified which has some uncertainty.
good,Wide range of knowledge always learning new things.  Things consistently changing. Hours are great. Always promoting from within company before looking outside. Pay is good.
good,Good place to work if there was enough work flow I would still be there. Biweekly pay not bery substantial raises. But all in all not a bad place I would work there again
good,"Management need to start taking responsibility for their own bad business decisions. My store has changed managers at least five times in the eight months I have been back with the company. They're notorious for losing work orders and  not making sure the stock is put away. my shop looks like a tornado went through there. We have stock lying on the floor from at least four stock shipments ago. "
good,Just Brakes Was a Horrible Company to work for... They randomly changed pay rates And forced you to accept the pay cuts or be terminated... Lied to Customers and Always Overcharged (Glad Pep Boys Bought them out)
good,Great place to work and learn if you have the right mentor. Lot of hard working people at the store and district level. They were purchased a few years ago and they are changing substantially.
good,"I worked at the parts counter and register. I think their system could do for an upgrade. Once you learned the systems was not difficult to navigate. "
good,Useful job to help you get familiar with automotive parts. Fast paced environment. Must be able to deal with a rush of customers and able to multitask to allow faster service
good,"Pep Boys needs employees, so once you get hired, so long as you are at least decent as an employee, you won't have to worry about being fired so easily. The pay of course is not much for employees as I was paid minimum wage, I was quickly given increased responsibility at the store to appease me. A small, small raise. I had to go pretty hard however just to become a full time employee. As for the work environment, it is pretty easy. There aren't many employees so there is always stuff to do, consisting of the back stock room, putting away truck inventory, changing price tags in the store, putting up tires, fronting the shelves, putting up misplaced misc. items, all while having to maintain a good eye on customers to make sure you stay at a high level of customer service! There are occasional changes to how you are to answer the phone and there are random secret callers to check that you are following correct phone procedure. Overall, easy job that keeps you busy, and due to the lack of employees there is job security, but they are not easy to get good pay from unless you can negotiate well."
good,"I love the jobe but the hours wasn't the best at the time. Fun happy people to work with and conversat with , at Pep Boys. I left but its so much other thing to do there like trash man or being a tire man. You have to be ready to work on time every work day maybe even weekends"
good,Overall it wasn’t a bad company to work for. As a store manager you will responsible for every line of business in the store. Area director was a pretty nice guy and not bad to report to
good,Some days are full of work and others are slow and dead. Learned basic maintainence on vehicles. Good starter job. Must be at a busy store in order to advance.
good,Day to day average customer service job. Help customers with automotive repairs and or maintenance . Can be fast paced. Learned to manage and run a shop to meet company needs.
good,Great place to work good benefits just needs better pay for technician I was able to get a lot of Hands-On work check engine light codes diagnosing emission test passing
good,"Great company to get education and advancement, they really dedicate programs to get certifications and continue education. Individuals definitely learn so much if intentions are to continue to grow. Supervisors friendly. When things get to a point of being difficult theres always fellows who help. Nice being part of it."
good,"Company is very good to work for, with great benefits. Opportunities for advancement are great for technicians, not many advancement options once you reach management."
good,"Dealing with customers was the best part of daily life at Pep Boys. "
good,"Greeted customers as they entered the building. Answered phone calls within 3 rings, Performed visual inspection of a vehicle for additional suggestions for repair and based on mileage maintenance schedules.Obtained repair estimates from technicians and submitted estimates to customers for approval. Invoiced work orders for customer pay. Collected payment from customers. Open and closed store."
good,I think Pep Boys was on the verge of figuring out how to become a profitable place again but it was too little to late. After they were bought out they stopped the culture changing they were on.
good,An ok job but it was very demanding with little compensation for all the hours and days of work that I put in. I can't recommend working on a salary.
good,Good co workers and good work environment. Learned a lot about cars working here when I previously knew very little. They will pay for you to get ASE certified if that is something your interested in. They also like to promote from within. Only issue with my store is it is very outdate and on the small side compared to some of the other stores in the area. Sometimes customers can be very rude but overall most of them are friendly.
good,"Job isn't to difficult, they expect a lot out of you for the minimum pay. which i think is unfair. i learned a vast knowledge of car parts and what they do."
good,The workload was o.k. and it was a good place to learn. The management was lacking and the wages were too low. Having helpful coworkers made things a little nicer. Teamwork is always the way to go.
good,"A job that is based on the up sale with very little in commission offered for its employees. A job that depends on location, crew, mgt, and compassion. When all these items are in place a ok living can be made but take any of those items away and financial hardship awaits the employee. I was blessed to have a worked with a great team from director down to technicians but I knew of colleges who struggled."
good,Kept very busy. There was very little time to waste. I learned a lot about automobiles and their parts. Worked very well with all coworkers and helped them in their jobs as well. Gave great customer service to all my customers. I also helped out in other pepboys stores in the area. Was well liked by every one.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at PepBoys was the ""family-like"" staff and the ability to learn as much as possible about cars. I have worked alongside many mechanics and have learned an exponential amount of knowledge about the different ""systems"" in a car. I enjoyed my time being the manager as myself and my employees all worked as a team to help every customer and ensure that we hit our sales goals for the day and for the week."
good,I used to enjoy going to work. Now after being with the company 5 years I was over looked for a promotion 3 times. When I started I was told that the company promotes form within. The District Manager who does all of the interviews for the management positions. When I said I was looking at the position he told me that he would get back to me in a week for the interview. Three weeks latter he rehired someone that was in the system as a non-rehire-able. Then no one told me that they were not even going to interview me I found out the day the person that they rehired started work.
good,"I enjoy working for Pep Boys. Overall not bad. More staffing would help. There are some uncertainties, but as retail goes its been good. Area director and above seem to be questionable at moments."
good,"same as before, to many ownership changes, unstable work, corp makes way to many changes"
good,"I LOVE working in this store. The people there are amazing. I am an assistant commercial manager, and I have few duties that have been given to me, such as the commercial sales, the stores drivers, and our route trucks. I have also taken responsibilities upon myself, such as coming in early to unload our weekly truck, control our overflow inventory, help our parts manager with his responsibilities, and always help my fellow co-workers out any way I can. The only thing I strongly dislike is the way their corporate runs everything. I feel like they somewhat discriminate on people, for example, not promoting me to a full manager due to my age, even though we have haven't had a commercial manager since May of 2013, and everyone in the store feels like I should be promoted."
good,maintain customer vehicles. get hourly rate plus a labor hourly pay. Whether or not the service writers like you determines better or worse jobs.
good,"•	Maintaining an accurate register count "
good,"I liked the job when I first began. I met a lot of great people who I still go to visit often. As a cashier, there was little they taught me and I would not be able to go far in the company due to my knowledge and what I was being taught."
good,"This is a fun job and a great opportunity to learn and meet interesting people. Unfortunately, corporate will never respect you or treat you like a person."
good,I work for Pepboys for 5 years i moved up quickly from lube tech to Mechanic to tech but the work was not shared evenly with all the tech plus Pepboys switch everything around from the book time hrs to commission low commission at that.. so yea
good,it could have been better in terms of how they would pay there employees but its a cool as a working atmosphere for people starting as a mechanic or technician
good,Great staff. Always something to learn if your willing to ask questions. The hardest part of the job was driving other peoples cars when the car was a stick shift. I learned how to drive that on the job.
good,Processing tax returns and researching sales tax laws in various states.  Management of the staff had it challenges as the corporate office had a tendency to hire family members who lack the required skill set.
good,"When I first began working for the company I was very excited to start something new, even though it was a substantial pay decrease from my previous employer.  Changes to the compensation for many of the associates whom worked for me was the ultimate reason for my decision to leave the company."
good,"Left for personal reasons, just was laid back, easy work, management was fair, work was easy and hours were fair.... location was exceptional from where I live"
good,Great place to work and learn the automotive business. The hours can be a little long especially if have a family yet the benefits are good and there is great opportunity for advancements.
good,Love the company been with them going on 5 solid years seen lots of cars befriended lots of people and most impartanttl gained the trust of of customers
good,I was a service writer. I was able to learn a lot more about vehicles and how to maintain them. The managers were very patient with my training since I was not very knowledge about vehicles
good,"Infrastructure of the company needs to be revamped; however, given that the company was recently purchased by Carl Icahn, it shows room for great advancement in its field. Management is very enthusiastic about goals."
good,"I liked the management at Pep Boys but usually idle for 40% of the day. Too muck idle time makes me think there is not job security. "
good,I was trained very well from day one of my employment until the last day. I learned a lot in thee supervisory field. There were a lot of hard days and physically trying days but it just made the day go by faster. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers.
good,over all it was a good company to work for but they have a corporate mentality the preach about being there for there employees but they would prefer to terminate then help or keep there word the employees and customers made it fun the corporation however doesn't care about there employees as they claim to
good,A great way to interact with the public. Employees are great to work with.
good,I really enjoyed working there. I found the employees and supervisors were great people to work
good,"Checks and change a vehicle's fluids and makes general repairs when necessary.

good,Without the union it would be unbearable. Management seems to care but the all mighty dollar still rules
good,I love working in Pep Boys. Too bad won't give more opportunities for advancement to females.
good,"In my daily routine was to help customers with their automotive repairs and needs and ensure the right mechanic was given the job and make sure the repair was done correctly, along with organizing all daily paper work and keeping the shop safe and clean"
good,I pick orders for tires daily. Some tires are very big and heavy and some are small and light. I usually worked 4 hours a day and recieved a check bi-weekly. I wasn't getting paid enough or recieved enough hours to even maintain a comfortable lifestyle.
good,Job was demanding with constant change and little support Working with the customers was great. Won many awards for customer service.
good,Pep boys is an okay company for their full time employees but if looking for a part time position i would suggest other wise it is understaffed due to general management and regional management wanting more money. The part time employees receive no benefits and or pto.
good,"A typical day at work is very long. However I learned about parts on vehicles, I learned about tire compounds and much more other things. The hardest part of the job was doing my job at my own pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customers everyday respectfully. I would've never left the job. I just felt like I wasn't being appreciated for my work ethic."
good,"I love the people I work beside. They are my family"
good,"Diagnostic and repair of vehicles"
good,Began at 745 out of 759 and over a 6 month period created a great work environment and re organized this store location to be number one nationally an increase sales by 2.5 million dollars the first year. also worked as a area trainer for the district
good,I was with the company for a year. learn a lot of different thing had good training. Became the lead tech in the shop but was never promoted or giving a raise
good,The job was very interesting I got to met new people while gaining knowledge of vehicles. I think the hardest/ easiest thing about the jo was driving the whole shift other than that I really enjoyed working there.
good,"If you work with lazy people it will show. Things become askew, empty products are still on the shelves due to theft, and there are crates on the floor because people do not know how to put things away or do it at a snails pace."
good,"Taking in cars to be repair ,working with customers to solve there car problems, learned a lot about the repair process. can be very hectic.The hardest part of the job lot of walking and standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers solve their car troubles."
good,"fast paced "
good,Overall I learned a lot working for this company and was able to get promoted up three times and grow. I have nothing bad to say about this company. I would return and have life long ties to great folks I meet along my travels. My only con is managing for a company that doesn't pay their low level people that well. Work moral tends to be better when people you manage can make their ends meet and takes less motivation. Most people I worked with had a side hustle to make things work but it's great of students who need a flexible schedule.
good,"My day consist of customer service from all aspects and departments within my workplace. I strive to provide excellence in all departments such as but not limited to; Service, Retail, Parts and adminstratively."
good,High traffic store. alway on my feet working 1000 miles a minute. was able to move up in the company. Hard working co workers. got along with everyone and work as a team.
good,I enjoyed working at Pepboys . Iliked getting along wit the employees there . I had went back to apply there but never got a call from there . If I got a call back I would more likely work at there Pepboys
good,"productive, stayed busy with inventory, knowledge of parts, management was great, co- workers were great, hardest part was running different areas at the same time. enjoyable part was learning about vehicle parts."
good,"I learned that the customer is always right"
good,"collections, open & close work orders, inventory control, customer service, sales goals, scheduling, hiring employees, P & L reports"
good,Pepboys Auto is not a place that I would consider working at for anyone. It does not have advancement in this company. I have worked for this company for 1 year and nothing has happened. I do other peoples job including my own and do not get paid what it should be. I was flat out told I would not a get raise it was not going to happen.
good,"Pep Boys is a good place to learn the basics of being a mechanic. They were flexible with my school hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was getting to apply the knowledge I learned in school."
good,This position was a great way to start my work in the auto mechanics industry. Great way to learn how to deal with the public also.
good,"The environment was okay to work with, the people there didn't like to work, nor know anything about vehicles to help inform customers about a problem with there vehicle. The manager there was very picky and moody upon the day. He never liked any feed back from us."
good,"A typical day at work was either two ways really hectic or really slow, What I learned from pepboys is more about cars and the parts that go into making them, i also learned that a job is like a car it takes a lot of small parts to make a great car, The management was lacking to none I was a key holder but as far as the General Manager there was none, workplace culture was very laid back but yet stressful. The hardest part about the job was making sure that no one stole anything from the store only because there was only two people in the entire store and one had to stay up front while the other person had several different jobs, the most enjoyable part of the was helping customers find what they needed and also cleaning and organizing the store."
good,"Management is great to work with, computer systems less than adequate, seems to be created by people who have no knowledge of the automotive  industry. Not user friendly. Only chance for advancement is if someone quits, which happens frequently, and the typical pay scale is not conducive for retention."
good,"Easy going shop, super long hours, always room for overtime. Corporate doesn't care about anything but the money, no formal training, had to drive customers using my own vehicle."
good,pepboys has a slow turnout in customer because how there was treat before i believe that pay should be hourly and not flag hours when the shop is slow Mechanics is not making money to provide for there family  something need to change
good,Not for me. my location was very unorganized and unprofessional.  
good,"Minimum 10 hour days for managers."
good,"Develops social skills "
good,"Most of the time work is slow and easy. I learned a lot about cars that I did not know. The management cold have been better if there was more communicating, but overall this is not worth working here. Pep Boys do not appreciate their employers because I only got one raise just working their two years."
good,"I had a good time at work, I learned how to change a tire and change oil, I learned to work on a car by myself and work in a fast paced environment. my co workers were good to work with, we had a good time. my manager was okay, we really didn't see eye to eye much."
good,I enjoy working for Pep Boys and have had many good experiences with employees and coworkers in all levels of management and in different positions. Pep Boys used to be a place for advancement. Times have changed.
good,The other staff could have been friendlier but overall I liked working there.
good,"This job is very tiring it took alot of energy out of me. I was there from early morning, to late at night. I felt like a slave at this job."
good,"nothing i do is within the scope of my job description, a typical day can be extremely relaxed or it can be truly unsettling, a times what we offer is not in the best interest of the customer"
good,My service manager was great at helping us and doing his job. The parts guy was great also. The store manager was so-so. Would work for them again if I REALLY REALY needed a job.
good,I think it had a lot to do with the managers at the time not being sells driven or just didn't really know what was going on but great workers need people who want to sell up front and be honest with the customers
good,"A typical work day, assist customers with they questions and concerns about purchasing the right product. Management was a joy to work for."
good,"Pep boys was a really good place to learn and pick up more skills of the trade-craft of auto mechanics.The pep boys on lake mead and Jones was a slow shop, so there was a lots of down time, for painting racks and cleaning, with brief moments of group discussion on various topics.and even though work was sparse there was enough coming in the doors to learn from with the help of seasoned co-workers."
good,Co- workers were great management listens to employees. Not much advancement but secure job if you do what your supposed to do. 
good,"A regular day at work is a challenge because we sell auto parts and as a woman I have to learn what I though was not for me.I have learned about lots of parts for cars and I enjoy it. As of the management, they are very pro employee and responsibles. As a team member I like and prefer team work but if that is not the case well I'll just do what i got to do. I do not consider my jod being hard at all. I love giving excelent customer service wich helps me to enjoy my job even on a hard day."
good,"Usually clerical/customer service was the way of starting a day. You learn about the smallest details in a vehicle. You meet an array of people and customers soon become almost like friends because of the frequency of their visit to the store. Hardest part of the job is an unsatisfied customer. Although, the best part is that it is not a typical routine everyday."
good,Great coworkers. Great support. Some dull days but not some can be pretty crazy. Work is what you make it. It’s awesome when you can make someone’s day by getting them in on a busy day or finding a discount to help them out.
good,A fun place to work. Learn about car aspects products and deal with customers.  Seeing new faces everyday. If you are a people person and enjoy learning this place is it. i was a college student and it was flex for my schedule.
good,There was something new every day.there was never a dull moment at at pepboys.  I start as a sales representative then moved to manger position. I stayed there for 6 months
good,No A/C hot place to work during summer and management does not care.  Management just cares about numbers not their employees. Need a day off Thats a joke getting a day off you have to get on both  knees and beg.
good,"As with any management position, it is important to set work ethics for your employees.  A good balance between respect of others and portraying management requirements of the job.  The most enjoyable part of any job is success and I have been able to achieve target in sales every month I have been at this store when it had not reached target prior for several months.  The hardest part of this employment has to be the required hours of work with a weekly 65 to 70 hours with only one day off.  Over all, the people that I assist makes it all work it."
good,"Days were always busy considering that one person is expected to work as a cashier, parts counter salesman, sales support for the floor, and answer phones. You get used to it after a while. The management is okay. The retail management is great but the service management is disrespectful."
good,"A typical day was common for me to produce 130%. The hardest part of the job was never being recognized for my performance. I did enjoy working for the company for the most part. I learned how to perform in a fast paced environment. Management never gave me trouble other than not recognizing my performance. The hardest part of the job was that I wasn't earning any more compensation for my production that was over by 150% on a weekly regular. They received weekly, a day and a half of a workers standard production and never showed me any recognition. I never complained. But my coworkers and supervisors would hold me to a higher standard than other employees. Other than that It was my favorite job and i am thankful for the experience i received. I have no hard no hard feelings."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits for gearheads, and love interacting with people on a daily basis talking about things we have a passion for"
good,good people every day was different loved the difrence. pay was not the best but i made it work
good,"Schedules vary as in most retail, but add up to long hours. Working with customers can be challenging but enjoyable. The upper management does not work as directly with P&L management with the individual store management. The company has great products and potential, but viewed by most consumers as discount so second rate."
good,I'm really hands on and learn fast... I've more than i knew coming in and working with the people i work with. fun place to work at one of the best palces by far . my coworkers are easy going and are good to work around. management i ok could use a few upgrades but I can deal with! i love fixing cars and having people drive away happy. but i hate not having the proper shop equipment to not be able to do or finish a job that's needed.
good,"My daily chores included stocking, retail, helping customers locate what they needed, helping to keep facilities clean, and delivery of parts to local businesses.  This was a fast paced job requiring the ability to multitask. In this position I learned about various automotive parts, and how to better communicate with customers and management. Pepboys is an outstanding company to work for, requiring hard work from their employees, yet they were great at making this a good working experience."
good,typical day was working on cars on the floor. shop was very small. parts hardly were ready when working on cars. was cool that i got to work on a variety of cars that came into the shop
good,"I’m a germ believer if you pay your employees better you have quality work produced "
good,Handled cash and debit/credit card transactions efficiently and in a timely manner. Assisted customers with finding the products that want and assisted with resolving any issues or complaints and followed up to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,Pep Boys is a good place for entry level mechanics to work. The job was very educational when it came to different types of cars and trucks. Auto part retailers require a very high paced work force.
good,The only down side of PepBoys is the pay is to low. also to sell the customers service in the service department was impossible because you were never given the opportunity to be in that department. If you had an invoice at service department it was hard to keep up with it because you are not able to check up on it and the service people would change the invoice from your name to theirs. just so they can get the commission. not fair to other employees
good,"It's a good company to work for. I originally started as a driver, but also help out as a sales associate. Had to leave because of family situation.learned all about parts for cars and helped out many customers"
good,Great place to work at pay sucks after 5 year's I was making less than when I started because of the insurance family leave was good and death in the family
good,"i work PT, I like what I do for the most part, but like any job it has it's good days and bad days. there are days people will do what ever needs to be done, there are days where people fly off the handle when there car doesn't pass NYSI! "
good,"great coworkers , late hour shifts, worked only 4-5 hours a day and some days worked 8 hours.  very pleasant customers and work environment would recommend to friends"
good,"nothing really special at this job, i do feel for being a driver that a higher wage would make more sense as the duties required are not very easy......"
good,I enjoyed having the ability to assist customers with their vehicle related issues. The company has a great philosophy however not all members of management share an ethical approach to supporting that.
good,I use to love the company but due to poor management i have started to dislike this company very much. Without good management leaves low income on the service side of things. Job security is outstanding but without good management there's no room for opportunity's or a decent income.
good,"interacting with customers was different from day to day, interacting with service workers was fun, lots of busy times,"
good,"Its Not a bad company. It is not knowing if you will get flag hours "
good,"A typical morning will include running reports from the previous day in order to see what can be restocked or what inventory adjustments need to be done. From there, various projects can be done depending on the day: Price changes, planogram updates, monthly promotion set ups, unloading freight or anything else that needs to be done. The store is separated into three departments: Retail, Service, and Commercial; a lot of responsibility is put on Retail to hold up the store with no help from the other two departments. In fact, retail associates are also semi-responsible for helping Service and Commercial when they need it. Management is, however, left to be desired; fear tactics are used and often threatens yearly raises and hours when sales goals are not reached. This brings moral down and the coworkers are often down in spirits while on the clock."
good,"I worked at Pep Boys for almost a year, in the last few months the store got a set of terrible managers. These managers led me to quitting my job. The people I worked with are great I keep in contact with them because they became like a second family to me. Overall a great job, I loved the customers because they all had their own quirks and its great to see such a variety of people every day."
good,"my typical day at work included working at the cash register and filling out paper for customers who needed work on their car. I didn't gain much knowledge from this job pretty much the same experience from my previous job. the manager was good, a very nice and understanding person. However he did not want to change my schedule to my availability and I had to change it quite often. my co workers were also nice and taught me most of the stuff I needed to know. The hardest part was working the long hours even though I worked about 30 a week, the hard part was working nights. The most enjoyable part was helping customers in need and seeing there joyful faces when the job was done."
good,managment was always changing and employees were not displined  properly managment chose freinds not to displine the customers were nice and loved the job over all just think that store and managment needed some help
good,I've learned a lot here at pep boys. I learned how to have great customer service and be patient with people. My co workers are very friendly and hard working. Hardest part of the job is managing time to get things done in time because sometimes we get a little busy. Most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy and being able to have great team work with my co workers.
good,Learned a lot about cars here and made a lot of friends from this job. Most days it was a joy to come to work
good,It paid the bills but it wasnt real professional. I hope to never have to work there again
good,"worked 50hrs. a week, took care of service dept. had fun. hardest part was getting parts quickly for service dept. if we didn't have it. most enjoyable was our 12 bay shop doing more business than a 24 bat shop"
good,"Learned alot about selling tires and related sales such as road hazard warranty , valve stems and wheel balancing."
good,"I never expected to be in the auto industry or even retail business but it has paid off as I actually enjoy what I am doing. Being there for almost four years, I have learned a great deal and love helping people in any way I can. The best part is knowing that I am needed and appreciated by so many."
good,I was promoted very shortly when i was hired with the company i also came into the position with a strong customer service experience I am a people person and it allows me to meet a lot of wonderful people
good,As a lube tech it can be difficult. You work by yourself on vehicles and it is fairly fast paced. My management was amazing worked well with me. And looks for people wanting to learn and succeed. But co workers at that location were close minded negative all day and very verbal about it. I couldn’t handle that negativity it ruined my day before my day even started.
good,"Very successful team at the current location, with very successful results.  Management is there always when needed and get the any issues resolved in short time."
good,"this job is routine by nature and consists of general automotive care tasks. A normal day consists of oil changes,and tire changes as well as battery replacements."
good,"Days begin with merchandising truck shipments, dealing with customers, and solving their problems. Team Members are also required to support Service Department."
good,"My typical day involved all areas of responsibility related to the Service Department.  I managed the departments employees, customer satisfaction,  inventory, and work schedules."
good,Great place to work just the long hours. There are some good and some bad but they tend to work out. The store appearance is good. just need the correct people who know about cars and not hire anyone who has no experience at all
good,This job was physically demanding and was also customer service based in that you dealt directly with the customer while attending o their automotive needs.
good,"At Pep Boys, I was a sales associate and spent my days working with the customer to find the parts they needed, give them automotive advice, and schedule their appointments for vehicle service."
good,"store i worked at was high volume which meant there was always work to do, the pay wasn't what i expected or was promised at the time, was offered a position with Firestone and didn't think twice of the opportunity"
good,"Good group of dedicated coworkers.  Building is on the older side but is near the city and provides plenty of free parking,. Food trucks come a few times during the summer for lunch."
good,A good work expreience nice people all around good job nothing eles to say negitive about this job and postions.......................................
good,I worked here while I was attending Automotive school. It was great on the job experience while going to school. However after I graduated they could not take me on fulltime due to the economy crashes at that time.
good,A good place to work.  The job is for people who can handle high pressure from customers.  It is a place where car owners come to get repairs done on their vehicles expecting cheap repairs.
good,oversaw the daily operations of the store. Learned how to handle complaining customers. I was management. Good group of people to work with. Keeping people focused on there jobs.
good,"Only had one problem couldn’t take days off , when I chose to , for example I had to ask months in advance when taking a day off , and could choose to take off a day in advance."
good,They had faulty equipment at the time when I was wprking their andd the mechanics were nor ase certified. When the jack let lpose and crushed my hand inbetween a box truck and the ground that was it for me
good,"Personally I thought it was a good job. The pay was lacking in comparison to the responsibilities, but otherwise it was a beneficial experience. If it wasn’t for Pepboys and Autoplus I wouldn’t have the near 4 years of management experience."
good,"If you are a new tech with very little expiernce and want to build in the automotive industry, pepboys is a great place to start your career  and gather tools all in one."
good,I personally thought was a good place to work with and to make good friends. I would reccomend this as a good place to meet new people and learn new skills. Also good to get involved in automotive culture.
good,"Sit in on morning conference call. Open shop, clean if necessary from the previous day.  Manage inventory. Check/Confirm online scheduled appointments.  Begin day.  "
good,"good place to work while the time was given."
good,It was nice to work for a company that focused on its customers. When I was first hired on my manager gave me the choice of which shift I wanted and was very easy to work for. However the pay is for someone single or just starting out. Not a mid level career.
good,"They have a comprehensive web based training system and good corporate structure, allowing for a supportive foundation for an entry level automotive technician"
good,"This company has been around along time they know what the people want. Unfortunately, if you are hired to do a specific job that's all you will be doing. No room for advancement."
good,"I’ve been looking for my product at several places who didn’t have it, and stopped by Pep Boys due them being in the same shopping center I was already in and BAM they had it."
good,The mechanics in a shop can make you or break you. I was fortunate to work with a really good group of mechanics who were honest and hard working. Made work fun.
good,Had to work with 4 different stores to bust out Union. There was a constantly change of district mangers and are managers. Had to learn and adapt to different procedures from every new managers every body had a different way to do things. But its was ok because I am the type of the person that can adapt to anything
good,I would have liked to stay employed here but unfortunately the distribution center closed.I would think I would have been promoted here to higher levels of employment.
good,A typical day at work consists of fixing shelves and helping customers find parts that are needed for their cars. I learned how to manage the cashier and put things back in place. Sometimes you might even have to clean shelves when people are coming in to check up the store. The people are mostly nice and everyone gets along most times. The hardest part is having to be on your feet for a long time but if you got comfortable shoes you will get used to it. The most enjoyable feeling is when a customers needs are met and you make them happy.
good,constant work day. Meet lots of customers and learn something new everyday. Love troubleshooting different issues and making customers happy with my work
good,it had great management the staff were nice. the hardest part of the job was learning there was there way to do it. great job not that good of pay though.
good,Typical day is making the store look nice and clean and helping customers with what ever needs they may have. You learn a lot about cars and get to meet a lot of amazing people that come into the store.
good,"Work load fluctuates, and can become very fast paced amd stressful.  Not enough hourly support to help with the unloading of trucks resulting in delays in the service bays"
good,"The best part about working at PepBoys was working with one another. Everyone helped out, the manager didn't just give commands they www on the floor helping out during the day. there were friendship among the employee and enjoyed working with each other."
good,"This was once the leader in the non dealership automotive repair. Once the company was taken public, increasing the bottom line was paramount and above all. After MANY attempts, the company was finally, recently acquired. I left due to family medical issues. It appears that they may have righted the ship."
good,Great place to work. Much potential for growth. A company with history and staying power. Treats employees as assets and something to build upon. More opportunities coming in the future.
good,"This is a great place to learn.  Very goal orientented.  Ability to grow within the company.  Must be flexible with your hours, as they can be demanding."
good,Very funny place to work exept the pay is not very well.The work can be so slow you only get 500 every 2 weeks. They play favorites with work but some of the people there have family's too.
good,"you will learn alot and pick up new things everyday, all workers are very focused and determined to get the job done. very clean and organized work place"
good,Great Employees to work with. I learned a lot about vehicles. Assistant Manager was awesome. Service Manager needs more patience with new employees. It takes time to learn the process of a service writer.
good,"I was in charge of day to operations by the time i left employment here. I went from a service writer, to parts manager to then a store manager in a few short years."
good,"Very fast pace. Order parts,repair vehicles,order supplies, inventory, team leader and team player, customer complaints, corporate issues, customer service."
good,"not a great schedule, low pay and want to much from their employees. unrelated work tasks such as pest control with no spray provided. not a very good flexable working schedule no real personal life space such as dr visit time kids time and continuously will schedule you weekends even if you request them not to and cannot work them they do not care they will just tell you not to come in and cut your hours and you barely get any real hours to begin with."
good,"Currently the company has been purchased by Carl Icahn Enterprises and is going through restructuring.  A typical day at work used to be very busy, exciting with structure and processes.  This is no longer the case."
good,There was no micro-managing in this workplace. The hardest part of the job was having to wait for the customers to exit the stores so that the job could get done. The most enjoyable was that it was so fast paced that the day would go by really fast.
good,Had fun helping people with there problems and also try to help them figure out what problems they are having with there car or truck
good,"A good place where you can learn too many things and know nice customers who you can help them with all your gratitude."
good,"fun jobs, fast pace, inside store employees did not care about outside employees, hr department did not work well with automotive employees."
good,"The people and customers were at times a pain, however, I always felt like I was helping and knew that my fellow employees were good and honest guys."
good,Always had a great day at work. Fun all around. Staff was always willing to help out with daily tasks. Management was very rounded and understanding to the needs of the employees and customers.
good,at times the job would be easy but at times the job would be hard. other then that it was an okay job it helped pay the bills. it really helps you grow personally and grow.
good,Pep boys was actually my first paid job. I was hired as a cashier and really enjoyed it. I was able to interact with all the customers and basically make sure that their experience was the best every time.
good,"typical day oil changes, brake specials, etc."
good,"Learned and was given time to develop skills.  Management was very"
good,Sales and interacting with people on a daily basis. My people skills have improved greatly because of this job. Got to learn the selling process and also about working on cars. Enjoyed customer's leaving happy when we fixed their car.
good,A typical day at work was making sure all customers and businesses got every part they needed in a short time and providing excellent customer service to every customer who came through the door weather it be commercial accounts to normal retail customers just looking for oil/brakepads etc.
good,"Great job that keeps busy throughout the day. Interacting and meeting with various of different people, along with many networking opportunities."
good,"I was a driver for this company on a daily basis, and all their customers where nice and respectful, their management was ok but supportive."
good,"Constantly learning, can be busy. The only thing they need to improve on is their hours of scheduling, i lost about 15 hours just because they need to cut hours its not a good enough excuse to use for someone who has been working their for more than a year."
good,"Learned how to write service"
good,Great experience while I was in school.  I learned a lot before entering the job market after graduation.  I would recommend working here.
good,"•Provided professional, courteous, and detailed service to individuals and businesses in person and via phone"
good,great environment and place to be. managers are really nice and work with my schedule
good,"Working at pepboys is a great place to start at if you want to understand and persue a small taste of the automotive carrer. i have definetly learned many procedures and contents like service writing, techinition work, and specialising on automotive consaulting. my co-workers were all a joy and a pleasure to work with as well helpfull and responsive. despite all the fun and happy stuffs, the customers are the hardest, or the easiest parts of the job. this job requires you to give all of your attention to the customers request on the vehicle and using your personal, if not, your professional knowledge of automobiles to give them the best service possible. what i really enjoyed about this job is being able to work on the varieties of vehicles that come in every day and being able to share my passion and hobbie of automobiles to my clients, as well give them my out most best advices and expertese for the clients vehicles for maintnance and driving dynamics and habits."
good,I was fortunate to have gained great import experience working at Pep Boys.
good,Assist customers with auto parts. Stock and keep store clean.
good,Deliver parts to customer and order part for there car. Deliver special order.and pick up return parts
good,typical day would clock in and start to work on cars. the staff was also friendly
good,"Fun employees, nice, clean work place. Flexible schedule."
good,"Normally I just clean and maintain the store while handling the customers, no one day at Pepboys is ever the same as another. I learned how to have patience. The management is okay, a little unorganized but okay. I love my co-worker, they keep the day lively. The hardest part is the customers simply because some of them are absolutely terrible but the most enjoyable is that theres always something new going on."
good,"Working at Pep Boys - Manny, Moe, and Jack for two whole years has taught me many things about perseverance, diligence, and time management. With these three concepts in mind a typical day would consist of answering phones, taking parts orders, sweeping/mopping, taking care of the customer, ordering parts, and last but not least reverse logistics. All of these skills that I have acquired over those years have made me the hard worker I am to this day."
good,I love the atmosphere and the ability to grow within a company. I was able to better understand the requirements necessary to run and effective business
good,"Unloaded tire trucks and if there weren't enough trucks for the day, you were given the option to either go home or perform other work tasks"
good,"Lots of oil changes, and tires. Alignments, stud repair, shocks, brakes, tune-ups, and computer diagnostics. The store manager and assistant manager were awesome and so was the service asst. manager. The upper management wasn't so good and the service manager lacked skills. My co-workers were wonderful teachers and mentors. Dealing with bad customers. Learning something new."
good,"Pep Boys was a decent place to work. But when there was problems it was really hard to find someone to talk to that actually cared, but that is part of being a big business."
good,"Nice and friendly work environment, where I have learned a lot through the years.  When I started I was just a commercial parts driver and now I also backup the Commercial department manager."
good,pepboys was a good place to work i got to drive around a lot delivering parts to customers. i got to meet a lot of people i wasn't stuck behind the counter.
good,fixing shelves and ringing customers. finding the parts can be difficult
good,"great job for students ,car fanatics . job is decent pace hours are decent ."
good,"good place to work, gets busy on weekends, lots of potential to learn new things"
good,It was a great experience learning to work with customers and satisfiying their needs.
good,was pretty good place to work overall customers pretty much agreed on having the vehicles repaird due to decent prices
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers find the RIGHT parts for their cars. I've learned how to change tires and wiper blades, how to do an oil change and check a cars fluids. Management was amazing and so were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was ... nothing. The most enjoyable was helping an upset customer fix their car and see them smile when they leave."
good,I enjoyed working with SASR management. I worked with them as a temp placement employee taking new and assignments each week. I found them very easy to work with. There assignments were fulfilling for the most part. I also found the team leads to respect SASR employees more than any other temp laborers.
good,"A typical day consisted of changing oil, tires, brakes, batteries, wipers, bulbs, etc... I learned how to work on cars. The management was not bad at all they taught us a lot. I worked with some great mechanics that helped us out working on cars. The hardest part about this job was getting dirty for little pay. The best part was learning how to work on cars."
good,"i like this company mainly because i love cars, they have great benefits on parts"
good,This was a good place to work at as a college student. I really learned many things with this company. It gave me the opportunity to be able to develop my customer service skills.
good,good place to work over all did pretty much both mechanics and retail sides of the business and travel to other stores to assist them.
good,"Busy and then slow , advancement was going to take a while enjoyed this shop better  than other places I worked at ."
good,customer arrives with needed repairs or maintenance.  an inspection would be performed to show what any problems or concerns need to be addressed.  an estimate would be presented to customer for review before any work is performed.  it is a learning environment because no two vehicles are the same or treated the same.
good,"Delivered part to different locations threw out the city. Such as tire shops, dealer ships, and other pep boys. Had to make sure everything was signed and accounted leaving and returning to the store"
good,I love working with people that are helpful and give advice to help me while I work. The people that i work with tend to joke around but also gets the job done the rights way and on a timely manner.
good,A good place to work and learn as much as you can about cars. They made studies available to you. Low paying for what you were required to do. Not such great benefits.
good,While working at Pep Boys Auto I was initially placed in the front as a sales associate. This lead to me rapidly gaining customer service skills and being trained to understand various part of the automotive business
good,"They take their time to train you, the management is well organized, and the pay is not that bad. you will get the chance to grow in your position and you will undergo leadership training if you want to."
good,"Not a bad place to work, The Company would sell more, and keep current customers better, if it kept up with current inventory demands, and technology advances- still working with outdated early 2000 era computer systems and software."
good,"this was a pretty chill job, with occasional rushes in the afternoon. i didnt know much about cars and i survived but it would help greatly if you do know about cars."
good,Its fast pace and difficult at first but if you stick with it it will pay off. The culture there is fantastic although corporate management can be difficult the local management are the true VIPs.
good,"The job is a great place to learn how to deal with different people. The environment is fun and a gods place for personal growth. "
good,This company is an ok place to work. Corporate people are pretty incompetant. But I have learned that this is the case thru all corporations. Upper management do not understand the day to day operations and feel that they can look at a computer screen with numbers on it and that will tell them everything about the business. Anybody that has ever worked in a retail environment understand that this is not the case.
good,"It is a good way to grow the knowledge of an individual in the automobile field. "
good,Great employees and management. Was able to work on personal vehicle. Great experience overall. Recommend more communication between upper management and center manager.
good,"Good company to work for good benefits but long hours being a retailer open seven days a week, provide good training for their employees. The management is experienced and guide you through your Career."
good,Easy to deal with but the main problem was just the customers always trying to make you hurry a job when their are difficulties alon GB b the lines oh well good place though
good,If your starting off as a mechanic then this is a good place to work as a starter job in your trade. They work with your school schedule and good experience.
good,"Pep Boys to me was a great place to start in the Automotive Industry. You have different options that you can choose from and see if it is something you might like to do in the future. Also, gives you an idea what the car business is all about."
good,"A typical day a Pep Boys is chill"
good,"Overall pretty relaxed. They do have you do a lot of make work, nothing that is important but they hate to see you standing around. They want you busy every second of your shift"
good,"I like working here the management is good and my co workers are also good."
good,Good company to work for just starting out the pay could be a little better if you have a family NEED more gratified technicians and better incinitives for technicians
good,"Awesome place to work. very laid back enviroment, and managers are down to earth. of course they expect you to do your work but they give you a resonable time frsme to get it done."
good,Good work environment. Had continuing education in the ever expanding automotive industry. Would have enjoyed more advancement opportunities. Would have preferred to continue working.
good,"its a very laid back place to work, but need outside salesman to bring in new customers, and didn't. Too much competition in the area, so it hurt business."
good,"When Pepboys moved from hourly to flag rate I did not want to stay, cause then I will be loosing money and alot of hours that will not be clocked. The managers they hired knows nothing bout cars, how you suppose to sell something you never done."
good,Management needs improvement but overall environment is good and easy to pick up and fun to learn new things and the trainings are very helpful and a little better pay would be nice
good,"The only real issue I had was with the commission. Unless a customer paid their bill in full by the time your pay period was ending, you would be short a good amount of money because you did not get paid for the services you sold."
good,I like the people I work with & sometimes it's a bit crazy. You get to help customers fix their issues or help them another store messed up. Some are so nice.
good,"There was a good work environment, pretty laid back. I enjoyed working here because on busy days you have a lot to do and there are many different tasks to be done if you need a break from what you are doing."
good,theres is always work you will be busy always looking for people to move up. the people are very nice although customers can be a handful so perfection is a must in order for no headaches
good,i always learned to be fast and steady working there management was OK hard part of everyday was lifting heavy battery sets but very connected as a family.
good,This company was a great company to work for just not enough pay.  The people that I encountered were nice and helpful.  The pay scale could have been modified but never the less a good place to work.
good,"Gained a lot of knowledge about cars, from my experiences and customers experiences. Learned a lot generally from all over the store."
good,"Was a fast paced, rather intense job to work at with heavy lifting. However,  management was great  an cared about there employees. Had some of the longest days ive ever worked at this place."
good,A good company to work for. Lots of opportunities to grow in different segments of the business. Great ideas but little follow through.
good,"Really enjoy the people I work with, we work great together to execute company initiatives. Look forward to the success of the Pep Boys brand."
good,"everyday began with the typical cleaning of shelves and products."
good,"Working at Pep Boys, you can expect to learn a lot about car parts as well as how a car works internally. The environment is great as well as the people."
good,"a typical day was kind of different every day which was good, I learned inventory, vehicle knowledge, cashiering, and stocking"
good,Good group of people to work with.  This is a very organized company with experienced Teams leading the way.  The ability to advance is very limited but is possible.
good,Pepboys was one of the best jobs I ever had really good company to work for. A lot of people downed Pepboys and all the changes things change sometimes for the better sometimes for the worst. Wish them the very best on the road ahead journey
good,"This position was one that i had build into, it was delivery, and service writer, and then manager. "
good,did orders all day and took care of everything in the store . never got any help .
good,as a service writer training for retail management I get to learn every aspect of all in store employees from General manager down to parts sales. My sales commissions are kept low as my sales are hindered as I know how to do most every position in the store so I help others learn how to do their jobs and make sure the store is set up properly for daily operations.
good,You're held accountable to achieve results without the tools and resources required.  Leadership doesn't work with store level management to ensure units are successful.
good,"Good people not enough benefits, work hours are long and pay is minimal, great management"
good,"Somewhat laid back job. Co-workers and management were friendly, worked well with each other. Everyone was always on same page about what needed to get done."
good,"•	Developed and implemented long and short term goals for a 1.5+ million dollar operation for increase in sales and customer satisfaction "
good,If you have been in this business at all you understand the trials and tribulations that can come with it. I have worked for other automotive retailers in the past and I will say that Pep Boys vision is headed in the right direction on paper but not necessarily easily practiced in a real time situation with the amount of employees they will allow.
good,I got my start working on cars here and made some good friends. I wish I was there longer to further my career but better opportunities presented themselves.
good,"Pep boys is just like any auto parts retail store.  Management was great, hours were great, and great co worker."
good,good people short days rather not say good company no comment
good,"A typical day at work is waiting for cars to come in to the shop. Some days its really busy, some days its super slow. When they enter the shop we have a ticket that tells us what they want done and what suggestions we have for the customer. The people I work with are pretty awesome and really easy to get along with. The manager of the service department can be a really difficult person. He only does things to benefit him and no one else. He make salary and like other shops the managers stay there all day and help there employees. He comes and goes as he pleases and does nothing but sit around all day."
good,"Fast paced work environment, sometimes challenging, and also rewarding. Opportunity to increase your salary through commission based pay."
good,I first come in I clean up the shop then I start working on cars. I learned how to change oil and tires on different cars. My Boss was an ok guy doesnt give you a hard time. My co-workers are ok wasnt at the job long to really get to know them. The hardest thing was closing every night is. Learning how to do my job was fun
good,"good managers, my co-workers was good and knowledgeable,good training a very safe work environment , morning was busy helping customers very steady fast paced work place"
good,job was a good part time job i wish i could return but the store manager says otherwise
good,"It's a great place to get experience from, and I learned more than I expected. Everybody is friendly and helpful, and they assist you to keep pushing forward. Management want you to succeed."
good,"Not a bad company to work for u can move up in company, for Manager Position they will send u for training, I had a pretty good experience working there"
good,Overall the days at work can drag at my location as it can get slow at times. That being said the management is very understanding and accommodates my school schedule. I work with a great team of people so that always make my day go by better.
good,This is a great place to get in the door the real money is at the dealership level but this is a great job and great place to work  it’s is like any other corporate company it’s all about the bottom line but they have a good brand so it is not hard to hit there minimum bar
good,good work environment. management easy to get along with. enjoy working there. some of the employees are not very energetic. they do only what is required.
good,Upper management is very political on advancement. Its who you know in the company to move ahead. If they want you gone it will be done. Other than the political side. It is a excellent place to work under the right management. The manager determines the moral of the store.
good,"Techs do what they want, how they want, when they want. Some need bathroom etiquette, some need to get off the phone when at work, liquid lunches are NEVER acceptable, laziness is NOT an option. Servicing gang bangers before paying customers is a direct violation. When a service advisor has a service ticket and is off the day the customer pays, that same advisor should get full commission and not be removed just to benefit another advisor."
good,"Pep Boys is a good place to start a career in automotive for the inexperienced. However one must be serious about advancing if they wish to receive good compensation working with the company. Management is honest and fair, but the work life balance is shoddy at best."
good,"Pep boys is a good company but its hard to keep good technicians. You can get parts overnight sometimes the same day, repair services are fairly priced."
good,"I liked working there , the customers were fun to talk to, and the management team was nice. the pay was not really there and sometimes it was overwelming."
good,I've grown so much in the fourteen years that I have been with the company. A great upper management team that provides the ability to move up the latter of success.
good,"was a very good workplace it was nice, management wasnt the best , loved the learning experience. the people there were very nice and respectful. overall a good place to work"
good,"Great place to work, cost of living is extremely hard with a family. Down fall is technicians leave at 5pm which makes it hard for sales in the late evening shift."
good,The experience was delighted and the opportunity was grateful. I had a lot to look forward to and learned a lot. I had performed oil changes tire rotation and wheel balance.
good,overall great environment with excellent and friendly staff and customers! i enjoy most with helping customers and preventing people from stealing products.
good,"Supporting customer with information for repairs on their vehicles."
good,"What made Pep Boys different for me was the freedom management gave me to make decisions.  The bad things were the low pay, and the difficulty of advancing in a situation with constant turnover of mechanics and many questionable workers.  But if I were a young mechanic I would love working here, and I also love the idea of the combination of shop and store."
good,"In my case I liked the job position, but 15-20 hours weekly at their pay rate are for a ""living with parents"" person. Can't tell about Health Insurance, too expensive for my income. But have 401K, and pay your overtime and training."
good,"alright management, decent hours, decent pay, some coworkers were easy to work with others were more difficult, decent work environment, flexable hours, really flexable on getting paid time off or days off if needed"
good,"At the end of the day, it’s the experience and I he bond with ur team, stay Focus on getting ur job done and correctly with out anyone tricking u out ur position."
good,"More training should be offered to management."
good,"When started I had no car experience or knowledge, but the staff were kind and patience to teach those details about the job and the mechanics and techs were friendly to show the use and the details about any vehicle."
good,"A typical day at work is 10 hours that pass quickly due to Dailey tasks"
good,In side the store the people that you work with are incredible. The upper management team is difficult to work with because all they consider are the numbers coming out of the store and they do not come down and view what is happening within the stores themselves.
good,"This business is for people who like cars , talking about, and working on  cars, and  trucks ect.  Worked with friendly and knowledgeable people who liked their automobiles and  helping others who felt the same."
good,"Most days were self-scheduled and motivated."
good,Great place to work to start your Service Advisor career.  Great service experience and preparation for the dealership environment.  The company offers good training.
good,"Great first job! I learned a great deal by working in the retail side, but my manager could not transfer me to the shop side, which is where I really wanted to work. This is the reason I left the company."
good,good place to work - nice fast paced environment - allows the opportunity for growth and advancement. good management.  flexible with schedules to allow for life away from work
good,"When i worked here the manager was the best one ive had. He was a great guy he pushed everyone in a constructive way. He didn't mind getting dirty with the rest of us. The job its self was great. I loved being able to fix vehicles to ensure the safety of others through my work. The pay scale could be better. But, i liked working here very much."
good,"good company as long as you get a location that is not understaffed. Be prepared to work 7 days a week, open to close, if you do not ask for time off."
good,I enjoyed being a part of the team. If ur willing to go above and beyond then u will be noticed. Not very much of team played unfortunately.  Do have the chance to promote .
good,Work was only good due to my co works. Management expected us to do work during the day when no work was given at all. Also we never met are daily expectations as a shop.
good,Hectic work environment but i learned a lot about the automotive industry. Coworkers were helpful and good teachers when i needed them but the mechanics and the front desk had a strained relationship because of our two managers.
good,I have been with the company for 5 years and it is a great place to work. It has plenty of opportunity for growth if you are a hardworking and determined individual.
good,pep boys is a fast hard working area. workers are funny and interactive and know how to do their job very well and they are very loving and caring. well skilled.
good,"enjoyed helping others "
good,"Was in management for 12yrs and was great . but when upper management cant agree in what should be the priorities, the store manager is the one working extra hrs for the same pay. Its great company for kida out of high school while they keep going to school."
good,"if they listen to their employees more hired a better district manager things would run a lot smoother, there still a great place to work, if I ever needed the job I will go back there with no hesitation"
good,Just wish I could of became Service Manager was bypassed 6 times and I know I had the skills to do it. I love taking care of the customers and helping out with whatever needed to be done.
good,You can learn a lot for this place if you are willing to. This place values employees that have been there for a long time because it tends to be that management doesn't like to train new people and tries to heavily rely on veteran employees. Once you have gotten to the point of being a veteran the place is very easy and you become very self reliant.
good,"Working on cars is a big plus for me, and being a full time job is another plus. However, there is definitely much to improve upon. Management could be a little more understanding, and the pay could be better. The health insurance is actually decent."
good,"Small location, no store attached. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping costumers during difficult situations. I learn so much from this job experience and learn how to deal with situations under pressure. Which I thought would have been really difficult for me.
good,"open close store, 10-12 hr days"
good,"The staff are great to work with, I have enjoyed my time here, I have learned more about business operations.  I look forward to other en devours."
good,"A typical day here in the marketing department at Pep Boys is me receiving jobs of things to have created for the website such as billboards, web banners and more. I then do a job write up and give the information to the graphic designers who then create the job and put it through proofing where it gets approved. Once the job is approved and released I then send it to the e commerce team who then sends me a link and I make sure it looks good before it goes live on the website. I like the people that I work with and the management is very good. As long as we get our jobs done there are never any issues."
good,"A typical day at work for Just Brakes, was like Roadside assistance having that ability to help someone with complete car care. I have learned to fully inspect the vehicle to solve the problem. Management was great and time managed with repairs. The hardest part was getting parts delivered on time. The security was poor, had no security or cameras. Other than that the job was enjoyable."
good,Was lucky enough to help introduce the Speed Shop brand to the PepBoys Chain.  Was solely responsible for its success in my market.
good,"Productive and challenging work environment"
good,"It is a company that provides many skills which are useful for future jobs, however the pay is very low, and the benefits are also bad."
good,This place is a good company to work at. If you are willing to learn they will teach you about cars. You can learn more about the service side of cars while you work here.
good,"Delivered professional customer service to fulﬁll every customers needs. Maintained commercial orders, equipment deals and promoted sale events. Aimed for expected sales and margin goals daily ,weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Managed the credit limits, payments, equipment loans, for accounts and commercial registers. Upkeep on ﬂeet vehicles, ordering/ stocking merchandise and warehouse safety regulations. Inspired and developed a team of associates to exceed commercial sales and service operational goals, while keeping a positive and productive work environment."
good,"Pepboys will teach you the basic things about a wide variety on vehicles. Since they don't focus on only one brand, your automotive knowledge varies. Co-workers are great. Its a very good work environment. Managers really take care of the employees and they always have your back. they take the time to celebrate together like a family and really make people feel welcomed. teamwork is very important, and very necessary if you plan to be successful. If you are planning an automotive career, Pepboys is great place to start and learn."
good,"Fair compensation for management"
good,"A typical day starts out with opening the shop and waiting for the service advisers to bring work orders written up. We pull the in the vehicles and conduct a multi-point inspection of each vehicle to ascertain the overall condition based on the age and mileage. Making note of any serviceable areas needed and making the customers aware of such, if such was unbeknownst to them at the time and await their approval or disapproval of performing additional services. Sometimes the customer is unable to have additional services done to their cars because of time or money, or the lack of either, and we're more than happy to accommodate them with making an appointment for to come later and have the work done. The co-workers are individual people but on the job they're real team players always making themselves available to assist in anything. Even the managers aren't afraid to step in and turn a wrench if necessary."
good,Pep Boys automotive is a good place to work. There are a lot of good people that work at Pep Boys automotive. Pep Boys is a good company to work for.
good,"Help customers with questions, answer phone calls and charge customers.  Learned about car parts. Management is great people and co-workers was great to work with them. Hardest part was not having enough time to finish what we had to do.  Enjoyable was customers that I got to know and talk to."
good,"I normally would help customer with auto parts questions and recommending the right part for them and unload freight trucks of inventory bi-weekly. "
good,Long hours.  Work 6 days a week from open to close.  That's all I have to say about it
good,The company itself was a good place to work at; definitely do not regret working there. Cars will come in and whoever is there will do it and get paid for it.
good,"I started my automotive career with Pepboys. I was only a part time parts counter/ cashier. It was fun learning, and it was a great place to work. There was always something new happening."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Pep Boys. The Corporate Management sucked but on a store level it was fun. We were able to put our input into the daily running of the store, etc. We were rewarded for doing good, recognition is big for the company. Just beware of the quotas that you have to meet, if you don't you will lose your job."
good,place where you can get flexability have fun and meet angry customers
good,"Was a fun place to work at because had some young friends work with me, granted this was a while back and this place has changed a lot, most of the time mechanics are decent, but if they could sneak an extra hour on a job they would, of course it is maintenance required, but that didn't mean you had to get it right then"
good,just was a oil change and tire guy and put up tires when they came in off trucks
good,Great customers. Productive Workplace. Fair pay rate. Admirable personalities in employees.
good,"In an average day of work I would tend to the needs of all the customers that I helped, continuously front and face the store, take out the trash and other items, and sweep. I learned a lot of techniques about sales and marketing along with greatly advancing my customer service skill set. the management was great up until the last few months I was there, then things spiraled down hill. the hardest part of the job was explaining what everything was to customers who weren't familiar with what certain parts were, and how they functioned."
good,"it was a good job, bad managment. learned alot by working there and the people i worked with."
good,The ideals of the company has been lost within the everyday struggle for profit.
good,"Working with customers, greeting them, working with money and sales. Working with employees later becoming friends. Steady hours."
good,"A typical day working at PepBoys is always exciting because there are so many things that an employee can learn just by working there you first day. As a cashier, I learned a lot of important things to know about cars that I didn't even know before working there. I learned how to change and alternater, batter, air filter, windshield wiper, and head and tail lights. All of these things were very important to learn about especially as a cashier, since many customers are always asking every employee about their vehicles. The management is very outstanding because they were always around showing me how to work their computers and how to deal with handling special orders whenever they are not around or busy to do special orders. Since there are two managers working during the days shift, they seem to be very understanding and they are able to help out every employee there no matter how hard the days work may be for themselves as being managers. The co-workers are also very helpful because they would teach me thing that I woud need to know in order to make my job easier throughout the day. The hardest part of the job would be knowing how to return a product that has been purchased from another PepBoys Auto store. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking new items that the store would order and being an employee there, I would be the first to know about the new products that would come inside the store."
good,After spending years in Pepboys I have learned alot. Great company with good values.
good,"Opening the store and sometimes closing too all day dealing with customers and co-workers to acomplish with the company expectations; management really supportive and good skilled. It was not a hard part , it was just a job and the most enjoyable part, knowing people and accomplishing the customer needs to make them feel great"
good,"Pepboys is a great job if you are a student and need a schedule that works around your school, but I would not make it a career. On a typical day we are short handed and they are constantly cutting hours but require you to get the same amount of work done. The management is good at keeping up with their projects, but a lot of times they are doing the lower positions jobs because there are not enough employees in the store. It is fun to learn about cars and getting to know the customers, but you will never move up in this job unless somebody quits and they are desperate. No matter what position you are taking you will train for one or two days then you are thrown in and expected to get the job done. I've noticed that from when I started and it has been done to my fellow colleagues. If you are part time you do not get PTO or benefits until you have been there 3 years!"
good,"Productive place. Team work to get the bonuses on the month. Good team work and co-workers very respectful. The most enjoyable part was when working hard to reach the goal, and the hardest when there was not to much to do, or the orders went down"
good,A typical day at work is 11 to 12 hours a day but it is never a dull moment.
good,"As a General Manager, I am responsible for overseeing the day to day operations of Retail, commercial and service department and ensuring the successful customer experience."
good,Pep Boys has a gym and a good cafe on sight with plenty of parking. The culture was fun and inviting. Management was good at communicating with employees.
good,A company which believes in providing the best care and selling the correct parts the first time. Service department has seen its fair shake of come backs but that is in turn from the desperate need of employees.
good,"I liked working for pep boys, i would work there agian, some things i dont like is long hours and pressure to sell,but its like that everywhere ive worked in the auto industry, working for pep boys is like any other corporation its the same box different name on the box! If you can tolerate that its a good place to work"
good,"I was in the commercial department which is separate from regular retail, but I was encouraged to get to know and work in both areas."
good,"A typical work day at this establishment consisted of:"
good,"All the employees do the best they can to maintain a well taken care of safe environment. Their moto is ""nothing in this building is more valuable than your life and safety"". Everyday was a same task along with something new. I liked interacting with my peers when new assessments or ideas were made."
good,Customer service to each customer.  Must meet sales budget.  Open every day except christmas and thanks giving.  Plenty of things to do through out the day.
good,"Its not a bad place to work, but your given 20 things to do and the time to finish only half.  The lack of scheduled hours is crazy for the amount of stuff to be done."
good,"Great job to work at, very good managers, and work environment. The pay at one time very good but is currently not the same. They pay very low and do not give their employees what they are worth. I have 11 years in the automotive industry and 10 in management and I get paid pennies. The gas station up the street pays more than what I am being paid as a manager for this store."
good,"good place for a starting tech to move up in a very reputable company with skilled techs to help answer any question they may have, I enjoyed my time at pep boys and would recommend them to anyone."
good,"Working for Pep Boys was a rewarding  job and only left due to being reassigned by the military.  I started working as basic mechanic, and was moved to automotive sales were i worked for commission."
good,"I was studying when I worked here. They helped me balance with hours. I also was part time, but they gave me a lot of benefits within one year of working. I learned a lot."
good,"The job was great the only downfall was they hired to many people for the job with not enough vehicles to supply enough hours for us all, there was never a dull moment you always stayed working"
good,"Great place for a temporary job, staff is nice and gets along well. Manager is such a nice person and gets along with everyone. Is very understanding and helpful"
good,Cool job if your young and interested in cars. The overall job was easy and there was always ways to move up or change departments. You learn a lot about vehicles and can use it later in life.
good,I enjoyed working here. Good environment. Always smell like tires when you go home though. Make sure you enjoy stocking product. But it was a good job over all
good,Need improvement on something like cleaning up the work place customer improvements and things of that nature but overall is a good workplace mice benefits and good work partners
good,at first was a fun job had a boss who made people laugh but as the years went by it started to go down hill after my 1st boss left management got real strict and the fun went away. hardest part of the job is if you have back pain or leg and foot pain this job isn't for you cause your walking on steel grates or hard concrete floors for a better of 8 to 12 hours a day. enjoyable part with some of the employees you can goof around and try to make it fun but always watch your back. you learn to keep your mouth shut and try not to complain.As long as you do your job and do it right everything will go easy.
good,My time at Auto Plus was very greatful. I had a pleasure to work with some amazing people. The work environment can be stressful at times but other than that it’s great.
good,"i enjoyed working for just brakes, the experience at just brakes was one of the best experience I've ever had in my life. they at just brakes gave me the opportunity to become not only a shop foreman , but to become one of their center managers also. along with their family oriented philosophy. They took the time to train everyone in the company on how to diagnose and repair cars. They also took the time to train all and every managers how to manage and run day to day business. They train us on how to control parts cost, labor cost ,total expense and maximize gross profit to the bottom line. I would recommend Just brakes to any one looking for the opportunity to learn and advance with a highly competitive automotive company."
good,"I was a parts salesman and delivery driver."
good,It helped me shape my working habits. I learned how to quickly replace and/ repair tires and also easier ways to change oil and oil filters. Managers and service writers need better communication skills with shop technicians.
good,"My time at Pep boys has been great, the management knows what they are doing and the other workers are great team players. Corporate seemed to be the real stick in the mud about getting time off for family events or vacation. Also the corporate side of things do not seem to care about their employees on the side of pay and or scheduling to them either you come in or don't come back."
good,"pep boys is a good job, however the only way to make it a career is if you move into a store manager role.  store managers make between $65-90k  but you will need several years experience to obtain this."
good,Great work opportunity. Wonderful work team. Management was not all that great. Left company due to the poor management. Was with company over 1 year.
good,I loved working with pep boys I learned allot of new things that helped so much. Benefits couldve been better but you have to work with what you get right?
good,Management wasent very well at doing there job more of doing what they wanted too. Wasent much help when I would ask for help or advice of how to handle a situation.
good,Fun place to work with a great core of people that become your family.  Can be fast paced at times and you are constantly learning new things in a growing auto field.
good,"A lot of fun dealing with the people. Interacting with the customers."
good,"Great team to work with.  "
good,A good place to start and learn. A big plus if you're already knowledgeable. Fun working environment and great management in most stores
good,"Long Hours"
good,A typical day at this job was busy. Picking orders by store request is run on a time sheet. I drove forklifts and picked heavy car parts. to work there i would request that you have lots of energy and and know that you will be a busy bee.
good,"The team that my manager and I have built is incredible. Definitely the kind of team that enjoys their work but also knows that when things need  to be completed, they get done. The customers that we have built relationships with always leave feeling like they have received excellent customer service."
good,Good people work in the stores. Focus is on selling product to automotive repair shops and garages. The company is privately owed now and is expanding and hiring in new locations.
good,Just brakes was a great place to gain basic automotive knowledge and excellent sales training.  The high pressure however proved to be stressful at times and resulted in poor customer satisfaction
good,"Modest company to work for, potential to improve in the company is there. Most managers are great people to work with as well as other employees. The company is Nation wide with hundreds of stores everywhere.The company is very honest and a fair workplace with equal hiring opportunities. Great place to get your feet wet in the automotive industry."
good,"Pep Boys is a good place to work for."
good,I learned a lot at pep boys l learned how to deal with cash. I learned how to organize tires from sizes to brands. I learned how right service sheets and examine vehicles and give you a price how much it will cost to fix the vehicle. I aso learned how to invertory count and how restock items in its correct manner.
good,"Hardest part of the job was being able to get work. Rather, being able to sell work to be done on different vehicles."
good,"The job was great, Had an awesome management team, good group of coworkers, and they cared about their employee's. The hardest part about that job was leaving."
good,I enjoyed working there I learned a lot didn't know much about cars before I started working here I have a better knowledge about cars
good,"Because we were always short of people, there was always lots of overtime. We opened at 7 am and closed at 8 pm. Makes for a long day but the hours can really add up fast. The managers were nice to work for because they knew that they needed us. Treated us with respect."
good,The managers there wasn't the nicest but it helped me go to school and work at the same time. it gave me experience in cars and basic repairs. The crew was awesome is was very friendly in the shop. Everyone took their jobs seriously. I loved the range of vehicles i got to work on and got to be around.
good,"best part of the day is going home , good working team support learn from people everyday not enough time in the day to have it all done"
good,great job with great people and atmosphere but very low pay.
good,co workers were ok for the most part unless you were fighting for work on a particular day. mechanics paid by flat rate and hard to make your flat rate pay.
good,"performing services for customers. Responsible for Inventory stock par levels and reordering, customer complaints, product resets, ."
good,"Eleven hour days minimum, if you work in Las Vegas you'll have to deal with the heat during the summer,  most managers are a pleasure to work with but some aren't just not but they will mess with your pay and employment if the opportunity rises in which was what happened to me.  Over all though it's a good company with good people, that will teach you everything about cars.  The best thing about Just Brakes is they'll take the guys that know nothing about working on vehicles and give them a trade they can use for the rest of their lives."
good,"A typical day at Pep Boys would be coming in at 0800. Having the drivers check in the vehicles to make sure they will suitable for the road. Begin taking phone calls or calling local businesses to see if they had any needs for parts. Making sure our prices were competitive in such a large market while keeping delivery times as low as possible. Pull parts need to orders through commercial. parts to transfer to other stores, and walk in customers in all departments. Keep all employees under the scheduled hours and making sure everyone received their break no matter how busy. The most enjoyable part of this job was my customers."
good,Everyday is a new adventure help customers find correct parts and solutions to automotive problems.
good,I learned more about auto parts and accessory items used. Co-workers were great and management was friendly. They treated you as a valued worker.
good,"Nice company to work for initially, friendly employees and staff members. Corporate's constant changing to company policies and practices makes it difficult to stay on top of your game every week. Inventory system was sub-par and performed as such often times showing incorrect inventory numbers (if at all). Customers were friendly and nice, felt good being able to help people."
good,"A typical day at work would start with me clocking in and if there is a lot of customers already waiting for there car to be serviced, i would go right to work and start working on the car. If it isn't such a busy day i will clean the shop and make sure everything is where it needs to be and stocked. I've learned a lot about cars and how they run and about mechanics. I own a lot of tools now that were needed on the job. My management is very fair and understanding. My co-workers are from the age range of 40 years old to 19 years old and are great and fun group or men. We all work for the common goal of making pep boys more money and getting more customers by doing work properly and professionally. The hardest part of my job is frustrating cars that are hard to work on and complete and unloading many tires are from truck when shipment comes in and putting them all up on tire racks. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking and having fun with my co-workers."
good,"Great place to work, it being your typical corporate company its all about numbers"
good,Fast paced. No holidays off. Good people. very close for a corporation. great pay and bonuses
good,"Cashiering, customer service, parts look up, ordering, inventory and plan- o- grams"
good,Very fun starter job. Great hours with a energetic enviroment.
good,"Management lacks leadership skills, but overall a good place to work. Co-workers are well mannered and helpful."
good,"Everyone has a good upbeat personality and are always willing to help with questions and show how things are done. CEO comes to visit every so often, He is very nice and always gives little tips to help increase sales and new buisness."
good,As the store general manager I learned how to operate a buisness. How to treat employees was respect and teach them proper ways of conduct as to their job descresption. I had fun with associates doing this.
good,I enjoy building a good working relationship with my customer. I always learning how I can better help my customer with their needs. It is hard when I can't immediately help my customers to meet their needs. I always had good help from my co-workers and my management team.
good,your basic 9 to 5
good,"Enjoyed working here. The managers weren't jerks and even though we joked around a lot, we made sure work got done."
good,I really loved working for Pepboys as a service writer i had no prior expierence in the field but the employees were good to help and train my in the field of automotive care.
good,It takes alot of patience to work for pep boys..but of you like to learn this is the place..I have been working for pep boys for 7 years.  But no advancement has me looking elsewhere.
good,Small staff and many have tenure here so we work like a family and we take care of each other. The company offers many opportunities for growth and knowledge through online courses and new positions open frequently
good,"answered phones, looked up parts, retrieved parts for customers and ran the cash register, you do everything that  is required to operate the store, no divide of labor between sales people"
good,It is fun and relaxing to work there. Sometimes it is fast but most of the time it is slow. Managers are exceptionally fair. You also get employee discounts.
good,it's very easy if you already have experience the training was not very good it's freezing in winter and super hot in summer the pay is good but they give you a set schedule and then make u stay over anyways and still give you points off for leaving and make you work Saturdays
good,I was with this company for 10 years. It gave me the opportunity to grow and interact with different kind of people. The ability to learn about the automotive business.
good,Great people to work with. Manager is awesome. He is very knowledgeable and willing to teach. Benefits are great!!! PTO is earned and starts building up after being there for a while.
good,Things were always changing from the computer systems to the store set up. It was honestly a general place to work. The manager who hired me was a jerk but was replaced by a guy that was super flexible and very personable.
good,"For the store I was in was fun, friendly with some competition always learning new things, the only problem I can say is the area director he's so full of himself. Management is always something good to move up into a 401k plan is an option alot of business do not offer."
good,"I Was working 17 years at Pep Boys "
good,"The Arkansas store is a satellite store with very little connection to the rest of the corporation, which is shown when corporate visits. I worked 80- 100 hours a week and lost all of my non-work life"
good,"Come to work at 6:30am count your money from register open store get ready for day print out your appointments and get ready for them make sure you are going to have enough people to care for the amount of business you can take in for day. Learn how to deal with the corporation culture. Take care of 8 technicians, make schedule for the week, make sure that all of them have work for the day and make the goal for the day make sure we make it to the bank to make bank deposits. Make the job fun for everyone because we spend more time at work than we do at home. Hardest part of the job is when you have to deal with a dissatisfied customer and try to make him/her happy again."
good,I wasn't with pepboys too long to really have anything to say about them but during the time I was there I had a pretty good experience I liked the work environment and dealing with customers
good,Pepboys is a good company to work for and start off as well to learn how to drive electric pallet jacks and stand up reach forklifts. You can also learn how to load and unload trailers .
good,"As there is typically a small staff at pepboys, you get to know your coworkers quite well.  Depending on who you end up with, this can be a blessing or a curse.  If you do your job, you will usually not be micromanaged or harassed."
good,Specialty retail is much better than regular retail. The majority of the customers know what they want and I assist them in finding the solution to their problem
good,As a mechanic the pay isn't the best in the industry job security was good there aren't mass layoffs during end of year slow down you just have to adjust.
good,A typical day working a Pep Boys is easy and laid back. The people is fun to work with and very helpful. The hardest part about working at Pep Boys is when no one is in the store and there is nothing to do.
good,"I'm not to sure how the environment is now, when I left in 2015 it was a fun relaxed environment only thing was business was too slow so we were often left dragging the day along just to make our 8 hours. however management was top notch understandable and easy to get along with."
good,"Great place to work. odd hours ,7 day work week, almost no holidays off, challenging at times but rewarding if you have a hobby of cars and parts it is a place to work at."
good,"The day to day was very basic, nothing ever new happened. The computer system and communication needed work as well as team leader ship. Managers heart was in the right place but too many employees weren't led too well."
good,"I would have loved to continue working at pep boys but, i had to return to college. the pay was good for the work you do. and it was a good job that taught me a lot. i learned a lot about cars/parts very informational."
good,Pep boys is a good place to start your automotive career.  pay is good but very stressful corporate pushing for more and more sales. Always understaffed which puts more pressure and stress on us
good,Common goals between department to ensure customer had pleasant experience. Good communication between departments. A willingness from upper management to review/implement ideas from staff.
good,If the automotive world was not flat rate it would be a better environment.  Managers seemed to be a work in progress but always ended up good at job and fair.  Lots of advancement if want it.
good,Nice place to work. There has been great work/life balance. Management staff has been very positive. Good and safe work environment. Good place to work.
good,A great challenge every day.  enjoy solving complex issues with the motoring public and interfacing to find resolve and get the best job completed for their hard earned wages.
good,"As a Speedshop manager i was exposed to many opportunities. Conventions, events for marketing, people, and car culture. Management was really nice with opportunities to grow. The work was nicely balanced with life and the workload was not too heavy."
good,"Everybody is friendly, hard working."
good,Co workers welcomed me with kindness. Never thought I'd like retail but working in auto parts is better than clothing retail inv opinion. Definitely would recommend an applying if you need a job for the time being.
good,Decent place to work for those in school or starting out. Flexible with personal schedules and issues. Decent pay and hours although not consistent. Good crew of employees to work with as well.
good,"I have successfully worked for Pep Boys-Manny, Moe and Jack for close to 12 years. I was fortunate to work with very knowledgeable and competent managers and colleagues."
good,Management is outstanding at this facility. The service manager and the store manager are the best. Facility has been recently cleaned up and things moved around for easier working.
good,A typical day at work is comprised of meeting sales quotas and handling customer service related tasks in the service department. Service department also deals with fleet customers and often times business vehicles.
good,"I would walk around the store to see what area needed reorganizing and shocking. I enjoy helping customer find what their vehicle needed.."
good,"Got along with everybody even with supervisors, we had softball games after work and public affairs. Easy place to work for and the ability to learn a lot"
good,"Everyday is a different experience and the customer interaction is great, you get to help people in their time of need and also build a relationship along the way."
good,A day at Pepboys is always fun but very competitive with my team. We always want the best from each other and always have each others back. We someone needs help everyone on my team is willing to help. Love the energy and our customers. If the customers are happy then we have done our job.
good,Has good benefits and is a good place to work. enjoy the atmosphere and plenty of opportunities to advance. managers are approachable and helpful in addressing any needs or problems.

Co-workers at my particular store are quite enjoyable and friendly people to work with, for the most part. Hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what somebody needs if they don't actually know exactly what they need. Most enjoyable part is learning about cars."
good,My typical day at work would be my one on one interactions with my customers by going above and beyond to make them happy to not only take care of them but their cars as well. Also working side by side with my managers and learning management tasks to one day be given the opportunity to fill the same position myself. My coworkers have become my second family and we always work together as a team. The hardest part of the job is the decreasing of the hours given to work.

good,On a typical day it is very possible to stay busy and always find something to do.  I learned how to manage multiple things while staying on top of things that are pending.  Managers do there best to help the company and take care of clientele.  My co-workers like me and we get along good.  Hardest part of the job is servicing a vehicle in a timely manner without any inconvenience or problems.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and when a customer leaves smiling.

The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to learn more and more about cars and how to work on them.
good,"My typical day at work consists of me clocking in, checking out a vehicle and delivering parts to new and existing customers. Management is absolutely wonderful, I look at both my supervisors and co-workers as family. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with the other drivers on the road!

good,Pep Boys is a great place to work. The overall environment is fast-paced but there is a great work/life balance. Pay is comparable to other companies with similar roles. I would recommend Pep Boys as a place to work.
good,A typical day at work is riddled with task and customer service. Management is real open and easy to talk to. The most enjoyable time is when you have a satisfied customer. Also very frustrating when you can't help.

good,"I enjoy meeting people and learning new things. every day i learn something different about cars or a new word. Working at pepboys has been very interesting, I started out as a commercial driver and have been moved to commercial sales/driver"
good,"The workload fluctuated depending on the time of day and year. The work its self wasn't hard it just required standing for long periods of time and knowledge of how to work the register/ Point of Sale system. Besides balancing the register, I gained some experience with balancing their inventory system as I had to either add items or subtract them for the current count, process special orders, assist customers over the phone (transfer to apartment or address their concern) , ""sell"" their membership card to vasts amounts of people, and most importantly provide excellent customer service."

good,I have worked for Pep boys for about five years. I have met really good people that has helped me become a better individual at work and out of work. Working in a customer service oriented job you become a very good multi tasker. One moment you are greeting a customer later you are with a technician. One of the hardest parts of my job is when a part does not fit or something goes wrong.

good,clock in And get straight to work love my job had a great time interacting with customers and helping with all there problems they were having and finding everything and anything they needed wouldn't mind going to work for pep boys again
good,The environment is great but the pay is a little lacking. I have noticed that it is hard to keep quality staff due to non-competitive wages and benefits.

good,Its a great company to work for. Great place to advance but you have to be eager. Great benefits but pay is kinda low. I would recommend this company to family and friends.
good,"pepboys is a reputable auto company and a reliable employer to work for, however there are things that need improvement such as salary rates, employee affairs as well as business management between high pace work flow, the staff   and time management."
good,"At Pep boys, we always engage with customers everyday and try the best to help find what they need. Sometimes we have customers who are hard to deal, and the best way to deal with these customer is calming the customer and setting a friendly environment to talk to them.

good,my typical day is constantly helping customer locate parts and recommend products and part for automotive customers.
good,Pep Boys is a place where everybody is a team player as well excellent company with benefits.
good,"One of the most enjoyable retail experiences overall.I learned all the aspects of the business as far as what is customer service and how to deliver it.How to manage your PN&L and to properly coach your employees in order to attain that goal of being the best.The only negative is that there is no room for advancement, for the District Managers will just never retire in order to be considered for that position."
good,always a wide range of repairs that i could chalange myself with.
good,They teach you many thing especially if you don't know anything about car or how they work you will learn many things.
good,Very Busy and productive. Training is fair and very educational. Management is always available to teach new products and techniques
good,Picking orders and putting them in red totes and taking them to the docks to be shipped off.how to drive a  motorized pallet jack and front auto cart and looking up product on the computer and taking it to the location.working in the modular area.
good,"A typical day as a picker would be as soon as you get there you get your totes ready and sign into your vocalet, and after that pick each store and put the parts in the totes and when the picking for that store is complete put it on the converbelt and start your next store."
good,over all just brakes has its flaws so do i. but would really like to thank just brakes for allowing me to grow with the company in tell the markets crashed changing the way we all live our life's and do business with out my experience with just brakes i would not be ready for any thing that is put in front of me and my goals also thank them for the time they had invested in the customers needs and complaints and training involved with the job. it was very intensive and was not easy. never have i seen a company that invested so much and give as much as this company has given us all.
good,"Really fun got to met all kinds of new people, managment was great. secduling was always on point.going to work was cool."
good,"a typical day at work is fun because i get to do what i love doing and that is working on cars. At PepBoys i was being trained to be a Lube Technician but i also learn to how to brakes, timing belts and diagnostics. My co-workers were fun to work with, they loved training me."
good,"The people at Pepboys were amazing, I was working in retail but they decided to close all of retail in the state of Colorado. The company treated their employees as if they were customers."
good,"We would get many phone calls on a day to day basis, as well as having people ask us questions as to whats best for their car to maintain it longer. From checking to see what parts we have and if we did not have it in our store, we would refer the customer to another one of our stores to either get the part there or we would pick it up for them."
good,"When I started here all the techs were incredible, they took there time top teach and explained what everything was why it was critical to replace what's gonna happened if we dont. Not only did it helped me build my confidence when speaking to customers but it made me want to strive and learn more.  They also offer a apprenticeship program for anyone wanting top be a tech helps toy dance money and you still grey to be a full fledged mechanic."
good,"The job starts with 7 AM mornings. Walk in, get a cup of coffee, get all your tools polished (joking) and prepare yourself.. for a hoard of appointments and walk ins. This place is like the fast food of the mechanic shops. No, not just oil or transmission fluid exchanges. I'm talking front end work, alignments, brakes, A/C, suspension. You name it, we probably do it. Though it's usually busy, the service advisers are somehow able to keep the customers entertained with small talk or allowing them to let us keep the car overnight to work on and return in a day or two. The managers are very flexible as well. They understand that you have emergencies or just don't feel well and will allow you to take the day off as long as you come in another day to make up for the hours you missed or use your PTO(Paid Time Off). The things I enjoyed most about the job is that you learn something new everyday and there is always room for improvement on this things you can already do. The hardest part is that there is so much you can learn that it's hard to remember everything, but repetition is key to remembering."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Pep Boys.  My service manager was very friendly and most of my co-workers were easy to get along with.  I did only work there for two weeks because of scheduling issues and wish I could have made a career there.  It is unfortunate that that happened, but I do think this is a great place to work"
good,"Come in grab a ticket fill out ticket & get to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Pep Boys and I enjoyed a good relationship with the Master Tech there.  I gained a lot of experience in brakes and front end and suspension work; however I was averaging about 27 to 32 hours a week (flagged) and it just was not enough money for me.
good,"Although i was a bit immature during my employment there, the job wasn't half bad. majority of the headaches came from customers and not the company. managment at my particular store was great. however, their standard pay rate is kinda garbage."
good,Working at Pep Boys I learned a lot about cars and the prices of fixing them. It is a great place to start out in the work force because you get to deal with so many different people.
good,Growing company with great leadership. Company is going in the right direction and opening new stores. If you want to work for this company you can move up fast and run a market.
good,"A typical day usually starts off with a NCSI to do then a check engine diagnostic."
good,"Fun workplace, a lot of PTO, great people. The environment here was fun plenty of times and the people that we worked with all had great sense of humors which made bad days into good ones."

good,Very busy and productive and I serviced the counters like it had to be serviced for each customer.
good,"A typical day at Pep 'Boys was very busy all the time non-stop but over all of that i learned how to cope with all kinds of attitudes. My Manger was very easy going but at the same time he means business, My co-workers was very helpful and dependable and were all ways willing to help. The hardest part of the job was finding out what part goes on what car but after a while you get it. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people and also learning new stuff."

good,"Pep Boys is an interesting place to work. Management has been great to me! I only work ""part time"" to stay current on automotive technology. Having worked New Car Dealerships, high end repair shops, and even ""high end"" gas stations in the 90's downtown Chicago... this place is a little bit different. This is a mass retail type place. Not as clean as I'm accustomed to but I'm not a ""prima donna"" either. They pay well for Master Techs and pay you to get there. NO place I ever worked did that! They cover your ASE Registration,  your test time, (if you pass), hit you $500 on a 1st time pass of L1, and $250 to re-certify a L1! None of this you pay, then pass, then get reimbursed stuff. They want and pay the pros well."

Answered all calls promptly and in a professional manner. defused any problem or customer dissatisfaction in a orderly manner. Assisted the shop manager with all shop operations and procedures .The most enjoyable part of the job is while working together with the master mechanics i learned new information regarding similar customer concerns, vehicle parts, new technology. Got to see different models, always meet new people. created long lasting bonds for the company. the hardest part would be making sure your target the customer concern with the vehicle and make sure safety is always number one."
good,I really enjoyed working at Pep Boys. I started off as a driver and got moved up within 3 months to a CSA. I loved helping the customers in any way that  i could have.
good,this place is so cool and the people are terrific. not enough pay but it pays to know your stuff. so much happens in so little time.

good,Great atmosphere to learn love running my own shop going up against other stores to make my store the best on the area great co workers and the upper management probably the best I've worked for.
good,"Slow at first, but it gets busy on some days. Clean the store while we have time. Usually around 1-4 its our busiest times throughout the day. I usually help close the store, take out trash, front face the shelves, get the store ready for the next day."
good,"Fun, spontaneous, yet very professional work days.  The staff is great and willing to work together.   It has been a great learning experience."
good,"Amazing workplace, team work good experience. I am super happy to be part of the pep boys group, good salary and excellent benefits"

good,"I enjoyed working at Pepboys. The team there was very kind, and fun to be apart of. They treated me as their own when I entered my first job. I made one mistake from listening to a co-worker, and I accepted the consequences and learned my lesson. I just want another chance to work, and earn my living."
good,Just Brakes is no longer in business. It was okay when I worked there except that I worked 7 days a week 12 hour days (sometimes longer). Management didnt care about a work/personal life balance.
good,"help with customers needs ,learned to work in a team. some co-workers were very friendly.the management was ok. the hardest part was having people steal items from the store and not being able to do anything about it.the best part was meeting new customers and having them leave the store satisfied."
good,"Never a dull moment, always busy, production was upmost important. The more you did the more that came in. Was stressful at times but was fun to show customers what I could do."
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers. The hardest part was working in a male dominated environment. I would receive a merchandising package and work on setting up plans. On days when there were no special merchandising I maintained the stock on the shelves and worked the auto parts desk processing special orders, warranties, and returns. I learned a lot about automobile parts and was able to enjoy a discount on car parts and repairs."
good,"Setting promotional items up every month, doing plan-o-grams, working with 40 to 50 customers a day, pulling parts and tires, stocking shelves and tire racks, shipping and receiving, and cashiering, and working commercial sales. Wonderful and fun place to work. Great environment and okay pay. Management could use huge improvement. The managers at this store like to hide and then take credit for others work when the GM's arrive at store. I left Pep Boys on good terms and a great work ethic, but being degraded for my knowledge of vehicles, parts and products made it feel uncomfortable. From enjoying going to work to not wanting to work in an environment where you are out casted is not a professional work place."
good,I was able to maintain a regular schedule every day of each week.  Work day began at 8:00 am picking parts for delivery.  Sometimes had to carry heavy parts from storage to vehicle and than deliver to customer.

good,work has stock shelves and cleaning work interdependent become associate sales that successful  my jobs career that because in store at pep boys  this retail.

good,8 years is to long for me and my efforts. 8 years with very little raises over worked days and underpaid pay periods. We make minimum wage if our productivity is  because of slow business. I cant support a family with part time pay working full time hours.

good,Como patronos te enseñan lo básico para que puedas atender a los clientes y hacer las ventas

good,"I loved my time here, the company culture is the same as any other shop but the leadership and support given from other store managers and upper management is amazing. Almost anyone in the company no matter the position is just a phone call away."
good,Pep Boys is a place that is willing to give you a chance to learn on the job. They are customer oriented and the store is always very clean. they also try to keep stock of the main parts people need.
good,The Atmosphere can be fast paced and then trickle down to a crawl. the company recently got bought out and adds to confusion to every branch of Pep Boys internal structure. This adds to more work internally without customers. The employees are hard working and self sustaining while the managers can be laid back and carefree. I honestly like the workplace but under better management it could be so much more. Still highly recommend working here because its nice helping others who's vehicles needs help or repair.
good,"A typical work day consisted of helping 134 store's personal, with various skill levels, through different tasks in relationship to managing all aspects of daily business. The office staff was team oriented in providing, as well as, helped with hand off's within their departments. Clear, concise communication was a ""must.""

I'm extremely grateful for this knowledge as it has helped me beyond my employment with this company. Management was really nice to work with, and the other employees really helped me learn the ropes."
good,"The environment at pepboys is friendly. When I worked on cars and when there were problems I needed help to fix, the other mechanics would give me a hand. I did oil changes and tires. Occasionally if it got busy, my manager would hand me a starter or alternator to install."
good,It would only let me give a 5 star overall rating? It was a good high school job. Helped with scheduling around my school hours and school functions. Always gave me hours on weekends and after school hours. Helped line the pockets while attending school
good,"Everyday was pretty much little different, usually I come in and work on the cars that were listed under my name. I would usually perform a vehicle inspection and look at other things besides what the car need to tell the customer and keep them aware of their vehicle maintenance. I got along with all my co-workers, they were very nice and the master technician would show me tricks on how to work on cars. The hardest thing about this job was lifting up diesel truck tires, but i see it more as a good work out.

good,Working for Pep boys was grate. The employees were all good team players. We all got the job done when it came to receiving inventory to taking care of the customer. It was just time to move on for me.
good,Work hard. Play hard. Mostly work hard. You will gain plenty of experience but also thrown to the wolves. If you don't have common sense and basic knowledge of vehicles then you shouldn't work here. If the only thing you can do is change oil.. go to a quick lube place or you'll be finding a new job.
good,"They are very accommodating.  Some days are busier than others, we all work together if one has a bigger job to help out.  Management is good for the most part."

good,job was ok to work at but due to always having split days makes it hard to doing thing.  days off were no always on the same day.  had issues with my fellow advisors not being present at the desk to help customers and when brought to the supervisor attention little got done to fix that issue.
good,Working at pep boys was a good environment I learned a lot working there. i learned how to be a team player if any of my coworkers needed any assistance with something i should help them out and not just ignore it because it's is not part of my job. on the other hand that is the hardest part about working there having to stop what im doing to help some to there job but it is worth it to working as a team to help everyone's job run smoother.

good,I liked working here because I learned a lot about car and trucks. I liked helping customers in getting their parts or tires for their car or truck. I like Driving around town to deliever parts to auto shops around Tucson.
good,My experience with the tire and service department has been very educational as well as informative. It has given me a whole new take on this field. It had made me realize how much that we as people and drivers rely and have to put our trust into company such as this one. And with this company you come across many people from many different walks in life and it has made me feel good knowing that I have built customer report and have a clientele that trust me and know that I have their best interest at heart and that I have done all I can do to make sure their family and themselves are safe when they get behind the wheel of their vehicle.
good,I have worked here for a long time. Good place to work. It's been 17 years since I started here right out of high school. Just wanted resume out in case.
good,"Answered customers questions regarding products, prices and availability"
good,"If I wasn't being laid off, I would be staying with Just Brakes! Absolutely love my job and the people I work with. Couldn't ask for a better boss. Will miss Just Brakes"
good,Company good but they do not allow you to showcase your talents and in my opinion the management holds back talented men and women from advancement to ensure their own job security.
good,"A typical day at work is customer service, got to have the drive to be productive, multi task, hand over repair orders to technicians to perform repairs."
good,"You will experience a many thing working here."

good,"Great Company, managers are great,typical day of work is making sure people are helped the way they deserved, reat company to grow up."
good,"Everyday was a new day with either a new customer or the same customer. Not everyone that stops by looks for the same type of service. When customers walk in we always greet and immediately assist the customer. From the minute the customer walks in until the person walks out we make sure that the individual leaves the store content. Everyday was a new experience with an opportunity to learn whether it is assisting a customer or getting a task done. Management and coworkers are all willing to help one another with different tasks such as, assisting customers over the phone and in person as well as setting up appointments and maintaining the store in order. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to hear a sincere appreciation from customers. Hearing how helpful we can be is satisfying."

good,Great job for car enthusiasts who like to interact with customers who need help with their vehicles that don’t have the know how. Gained more knowledge from service technicians about parts and services.
good,"Most of the time you are helping customers, there is constantly a change in a planogram or a section in the parts room needs to be relabeled or something has to be shipped back to the warehouse. Sometimes prices are competitive and customers get frustrated about it."

I learned how to operate a forklift. The management was amazing, very friendly & honest. Co-workers were great as well. People who were there for a purpose & did what was required. The hardest part of the job was definitely the heavy lifting & constant kneeling. The learning experience was the best part for me. I feel like I can do a lot more with what they gave me."

good,"I have never been happier than when i was working with the team of guys at Pep Boys. They made me feel welcome, they treated everyone like a family. I was always excited to go to work and happy to see everyone. The relationships at work were something similar to that group of guys you love to go grab a beer with after a long day. The support and willingness to teach and learn together is incredible. There was a true sense of camaraderie that I don't think I will ever find again. I miss my old team. I have nothing but fond memories and great things to say about everyone and everything in regards to this environment."
good,"started out as an order picker working pulling orders from slots on a cherry picker"
good,job was very chill all you did was greet customers and help them find the part needed for the car. when not doing that we stocked the merchandise and helped our commercial accounts
good,All employees are helpful and management has an open door policy. There is always a briefing before the shift begins and safety is stressed. the H.R. department does an excellent job in keeping the employees morale high.
good,"Haven't been here long, but can already see why there are so many long-term employees here. The pace is less frantic, yet you can see daily progress being made. No sense of tension amongst coworkers."
good,"I worked for several different store in CO. The management at each store cared about their employees and treated them with respect. The work environment, overall, was more of a family environment than a work environment. We were all friends and truly cared for one another. The hardest part of the job was explaining to customers that, ""buy 3 get one free"" tires were through a rebate. No one reads the fine print and then they get mad at you. It was easy to learn very quickly that when talking to customers on the phone about the tires to make sure to say up front and clearly that the deal is good through a mail-in rebate. All in all, if I could, I would still be working for this company."
good,managers taught very well. Always stay busy with the customers and mechanics. Making sure everyone is happy. Sell the most you can and always stay positive. Very good workplace. Commission is really good.
good,"As a Service Manager, it was my responsibility to train all Service Advisors in all aspects of mechanics, and most importantly Customer Service and Sales. As a Technician, it was my responsibility to diagnose and repair a vehicle in the most productive manner. It was here that I learned just how important Customer Service is. If you have an unhappy customer, you will get very little, if anything from them. If you have a happy customer, they are more likely to have the repairs and service performed that are recommended, which results in positive sales. The workplace culture was productive and had a fun atmosphere. The hardest part of the the job was having to explain to a customer that one of my technicians misdiagnosed their vehicle, and that it was going to take more time to find the actual problem. It was then that I got involved with the technician, to train them on how to properly diagnose a problem with the vehicle. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we exceeded the customer's expectations, and they left with a smile on their face, and thanked us for our service."
good,"Good Place to work, excellent team work. Travelled to different stores in San Bernardino and Riverside county.  Met several managers with different managerial skills.  Encountered excellent team work with my assigned team."
good,"For an entry level technician, this was the best way to learn. They provided a lot of on the job training. Seasoned technicians to oversee our performance. Many opportunities for advancement.

good,"Even though I have numerous years service department experience as Advisor to Service Director. Pep Boys has many established procedures i agree with and some i don't. "

good,"The title pretty much says it all. The Annuity Product Specialist role is actually a Customer Service role. You're on the phone 8 hours a day, constantly criticized for how you could do better on the calls through reviews and not really given an opportunity to grow, with 0 flexibility or control over your own schedule. The division is currently under new management, which is terrible. Maybe things will go back to being normal, but the company's been going through non-stop restructuring for about 2 years now with no signs of slowing down."
