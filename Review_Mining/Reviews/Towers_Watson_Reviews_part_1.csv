rating,review
bad,All the care about is numbers.  how much money they make off of you and you are always getting points for every little thing.  That way you do not get a bonus. or stay off season
bad,Horrible culture terrible or lack of training ... expect no mistakes but yet no training to learn. No raises.  Not allowed to speak or work with peers.  If they think you are making friends with a co worker they actually move you
bad,"They DO NOT offer permanent positions for YEARS!! You can be working there for 5 years as a temporary employee. They treat employees awful. They do not accept Doctors notes, as someone who has a medical condition and needs accommodation my supervisor did not help one bit in trying to get me some accommodation. You are treated as a number and supervisors are down right rude and are very two-faced. Supervisors will go and tell one person one thing and then tell you another thing. They have an awful point system and you cannot go above a certain amount of points or else you get written up and have to be put on a ""60 day look back,"" you also get double points if you call out or leave early the day before or after a holiday. They really look down upon leaving early or calling out (even if you are sick), they also will not send you home unless you are sick, you literally have to throw up at your desk before they consider you ""sick enough"" to be sent home. Each department is treated differently even though they all have the same rules, some departments follow the rules closely and will write you up if you do the wrong thing and other departments could care less what you do. Supervisors are lazy and do not give adequate coachings or good feedback. You are just a number and unimportant to them. You are also dealing with senior citizens who can be very grumpy and disrespectful towards you as a rep and no one does anything about it. And communication between departments is awful you have one department tell the customer one thing and you have another department tell them something different,"
bad,"Willis is such a company where they don't value their employees at all.I had a mentor and a team leader who used to calculate the time that I used to take to use the washroom."
bad,"This company has gone to the trash bin. Last year the stress wasn't bad this year they under hired staff and that makes working here a nightmare.   They'll tell you there are 200 calls in queue then also tell you to make outbound calls between you incoming calls. They expect 100% on quality, 4.7 voice of the customer reviews, no missed days or time at all.  "
bad,"They bring you on to help with busy season but don't tell you that they are going to let you go either at the end of the season or if volume is not as high as expected. No benefits, very unprofessional and very very high turn over rate.not worth the time."
bad,"The worst place you could ever put yourself in if you are honest and hard working and want to work your way up by graft. This company thrives on naive, shallow mindless people who have never left the town, who bed and lie their way to promotion and a pay rise. No union and a HR that promotes bullying and emotionally threatening behaviour as standard from their management, who, generally could not run a market stall! Awful.  Save yourself the hassel and do not work at this den of corrupt, foul, employers. The grass IS greener on the other side!"
bad,"Willis Towers Watson has a lot of expectation, but they do not compensate for them. The management does not care about CSRs especially since it is a seasonal job that can go on for ever! To cheap to pay permanent employees! Supervisors are ok for the most part. Willis Towers Watson will try to get you to do more work, no compensation. I would only work here if I want to work for nothing!"
bad,It was so awful working here 😭                       trust me don't do it to yourself don't do it don't do it please don't do it this is an awful place to work it's so ghetto it is full of hating people you are going to absolutely hate the job and my boss was so horrible for secret Santa I got a 40 ounce into Reese's pieces
bad,"I am not pleased with working at Willis Towers Watson. I was hired as a customer service representative. Training is a cramming session for all the Medicare information you are required to know. Once on the floor and our of training, no assistance, supervisors don't assist as should no matter how irate customer is. I've also experienced doing things that does not fall within the guidelines of customer service, i.e. website troubleshoot, IT issues."
bad,I was fired for asking my lady that was in charge of my hours if she could complete them before the last bus left there and she didn't like that and so she had me fired
bad,Drama place messy supervisor and that’s all they worry about is who why and what this place is not a place to recommend to anyone y’all beware. Sorry not sorry
bad,"Training wasn’t at all the best training trained for a week on nothing that was specific to the actual job was thrown too the wolves they claim that there is always help and theres literally no help available once you’re on the phones due too low staffing on supervisors and work overload on supervisors, even their customers are fed up with they way the operate it’s sad, managers and supervisors aren’t supportive, they actually have the worse management team super rude aren’t understanding of circumstantial situations. I had an bereavement didn’t excuse my absences after I notified them. Month later had a medical condition too meds that made my feet swollen wouldn’t let me wear comfortable shoes basically told me to wear bigger shoes literally their words not mine they don’t care about employees"
bad,Ghetto and messy call center with rude and poor management. No job security and very sneaky managers that are not dependable or properly trained. Pay is well so they do compensate for the drama and stress of working there. Work is pretty easy and training is great.
bad,Bad company don't waste your time. They will spit you out as soon as AEP is over. Dead end job. I think there's nothing more I have to say. Have a nice day
bad,The company i work for does not provide insurance of any kind my boss does not care if you're sick or have issues at home your not allowed to miss work if not we get fired
bad,"This job is such a hostile work environment Incompetent managers with no real security for your job.  The work itself is fun, you help retirees enroll in healthcare or help them disburse their pension benefits. However the work environment is toxic and unhealthy. Really any place is going to be better."
bad,Depending on whether you're a client BA or a Data Services BA the daily routines and your focus of work can be slightly different.  What stays the same is that you're bombarded with 1000's of emails a day that you're expected to provided a response within the business day even if it's an empty response acknowledging that you've read it.  You're also bombarded with meetings and there is no work life balance when it comes to your clients' annual enrollment periods or if there are things that need to updated/fixed; basically no work/life balance period unless you're a favorite or a manager.  Even favored employees can get overworked because you're seen as valued.  Management doesn't listen even though they claim they do.  Changes don't happen even though they claim they will.
bad,"If you are looking for something while you transition to something better take it. Other than that run far far away! They hire you as a temporary employee and tell you that you have a chance to be permanent but there are people who have been waiting 3-4 years. Meanwhile as a temporary employee you have NO benefits at all only upto the u is for unpaid. The training is subpar it’s 2-3 weeks long in classroom with test. It is a call center so there is that drama, most of the supervisors are temporary also so no job security. The parking is horrible also. They will tell you the season is up in March but let you go in December and they will be waiting for you to walk in the building and let you do early. Also every year there is a bed bug sighting by an employee if you spot it they will send you home until you get your home checked they say but you will never be seen again. It’s an at will decision to let you go."
bad,"Incompetent managers with no real security for your job. They'll keep you as a contract worker to save them money. The work itself is fun, you help retirees enroll in healthcare or help them disburse their pension benefits. However the work environment is toxic and unhealthy. Really any place is going to be better."
bad,Great for any person new to the work field. Company includes a lot of training's to prepare you for the position. If you are familiar with Excel this job is great!
bad,no advancement unless you know the right people.......... Management makes horrible decisions with no input from the people the decisions will effect.
bad,Not the best company to work for. Slowly getting worse and worse. The culture is combative. They are slowly weeding out all the things that made it great at first.
bad,"Morale is low, no recognition for outstanding work., This is a call center environment.   workplace culture is not about the employees,.  Management is not turned in to what the employees think or fill."
bad,Call center is SD is badly run Pay is too low and call volume very high.  Center is poorly run and soo muckh office politics.  There needs to be better leadership in place and more resources for employees.  Culture is toxic.
bad,Management are very unfair to employees regarding performance evaluations with totalitarian approach to employees who they do not like on a personal level.  This is specially from management with racist attitude to someone with a different race. I do not trust any of the management making any fair and just decisions as to retain employees whom they claim are exemplary.
bad,"I wouldn't suggest anyone work for Via Benefits unless you're in need of a temporary job. Things may have changed since i was there but if not there are few chances to advance in the company or even receive fair pay for your work. What i mean is that i worked for the Via Benefits office in Texas and they have a practice of paying ""seasonal"" employees much less than their ""permanent"" counter parts for doing the exact same job. Even if you're ""seasonal"" and have higher metrics than a ""permanent"" person you make a fraction of what they do. I use the quotes around seasonal and permanent because there is no meaning in the terms other than an excuse to pay people less and not give them benefits. Your job will be constantly held over your head and they will threaten to fire you as a ""seasonal"" employee even if you stay for a full year or more. It's a good place to be if you don't plan on working there for long but don't look to this place as anything more than a quick fix. Regardless of what people tell you, get in and get out."
bad,"The overall job was good. From day to day, you never knew if you would be asked to go into meeting and when you walk away from your desk another manager come and pack up your things because you were being terminated."
bad,The workplace culture is militant in this job. There is hardly any work/life balance implemented in this position. You are reprimanded for being 2 min late.
bad,"I was harrassed and HR and Management ignored my complaints.  I was forced to quit due to a hostile work environment.  I was harrassed due to my color, religion, etc."
bad,I did not enjoy working there but this was before the company I worked for Extend health was bought out by towers Watson. i am not sure how things are since the takeover.
bad,"it was a job, nothing less nothing more be aware that OneExchange is very strict on everything and its policies are not normal usually there is a 3 strict each offense but that not so do something 3 times no matter what it is and your gone..."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Lousy training, trainers that could have a harassment suit filed against them. Unfriendly coworkers. Was told by a long time employee that they chew up temps and spit them out."
bad,They will bring you in and let you go. They did it to me twice. One week after letting 20 people go they are hiring again. I asked not to be blindsided and that is exactly what they did.
bad,"Bait and switch is what happened to me. The person who interviewed me and offered me the job was not my manager. I showed up on Day 1 and was told this is so in so your manager. Huh? "
bad,"the hardest part of the job is fitting in and learning all the new information on such a limited time, and when you do not get the information on time you can not continue working."
bad,"You are on your own. You manage yourself, there is NO training. After 3 months of being on line doing nothing, they tell you, you have now spent 3 months reading the knowledge bases for each and one of our 50 clients. Now go on the phone now."
bad,"They treat you like a herd of cattle.  Very poor training.  Unfairness all"
bad,The supervisors and higher ups were very rude they dont speak if you said good morning they barely want to assist with questions they say the most inappropriate things about the workers they were all around just a rude staff of people
bad,"They expect you to know everything quickly and you will get written up if you don’t know things. The supervisor  is extremely lackluster and oblivious as to how to assist the team. In fact, she prefers not to help at all and keep referring you to your resources and notes from the insufficient training you received  1 week prior. Yes one week of training and then you are required to test. You will have 2 attempts to test. If you fail testing, you will be prompted to Human Resources with your belongings and lead out of the building as in TERMINATED! There will be no time that can be missed during training, nesting, and 30 days on the call center floor. So many ppl have quit the moment they graduate from training due to amount of knowledge we should know to assist the retirees! You must have tough skin. It is not a diverse company. Majority are ghetto blacks! Several loud outbursts, cursing, confrontations, and a few were on the verge of fighting!! Dirty cubicle with stains, dirty chairs and desks! The list goes on don’t waste your precious time here unless you’re  only there until the job you want calls you!!"
bad,workwe here for several years the work increased but pay did not management is a joke they play buddy buddy to determine who will be kept as permanent ee. training was subpar at best.. there is no consistency with training everyday it's someone new. the atmosphere seems so tense.. my time here I learned a lot. but deff not a place you will retire from
bad,"Those jerks could have told me if I wasn't learning quickly enough to their standards. I was totally ""blindsided"" when I got the call on a Wednesday morning that I was ""let go."" I had as perfect attendance as one could... Early most every day, but even that from 40 miles away didn't matter and no one had the nerve to just tell me that I wasn't up to their standards or whatever the case. My family was suddenly and harshly left without so much as a word as to why I was let go... just a routine Wednesday morning (to them, but not for me & my family...just sad...)"
bad,"A typical day here is not that bad it's mainly phone calls that do not have a call handle time. Given that we only receive 10 minutes a day to use the bathroom, it can be stressful and potentially hazardous to the health of employees. There was an ongoing issue of bed bugs, and employees reporting their lunches being stolen out of the fridge."
bad,"You might be a top performer and be a very loyal employee, but the bottom line is you are ""seasonal"" so when push comes to shove they don't care about your contributions, they have numbers to meet, so you are a number on a piece of paper. Your assignment is ended. They will keep people as ""seasonal"" for years so they do not have to pay benefits or paid time off. It's a racket. My advice: get a job where you are treated as an asset, a respected employee instead of a ""temp"". Don't work here."
bad,"Negitive work environment"
bad,"I was hired on through a temp agency after an interview with the company. 3 weeks of training except the training is way too much at one time, and they don’t explain it well enough. After that, they basically throw you on the phones. How are you supposed to learn the process if you don’t know all the information? I feel so uncomfortable on the phones because I’m not even close to understanding all the things they “taught” us in training. The trainer basically just wanted to get the training over with as soon as possible. I will be leaving this company as soon as I can. If you are a temp interested in this company, please consider what I have said. Also, getting time off is the most pointlessly difficult process I have ever experienced."
bad,"I worked there for 5 years.  Was a full-time temp the entire time"
bad,I would not recommend working here as a long term position and there is no opportunity for growth. If you are looking for job security this isn't the place for you. They are constantly firing people and are also extremely understaffed. The amount of work you do does not equal the pay the benefits are terrible.
bad,"Management don’t care about their teams. Overworked and general unhappiness within certain departments. Not rewarded for work, but first to criticise. Consequently has lead to fast turn around of staff and operating on minimum numbers - the overhanging redundancies never even needed to happen in the end as people willing to go."
bad,"Do not apply for a position in the commercial insurance division.  Was not involved with other divisions, so cannot comment on theses.   The management will not help you succeed."
bad,"Promises made, promises broken. Bed bugs in the office. Poor communication. Arrogant managers. Poor training. They don't value their employees and you can be gone without any notice, not even a reason is given. Did I mention bed bugs in the office? Terribly unhappy job, no security whstsoever, and they don't like talking in the office."
bad,The worst place i have ever worked as managers were in a mix up could not make up their mind.  In terms manager was never there and could not decide how the project was going to be.
bad,The compensation does not match with the work you need to perform. Extremely low bonus you will get and high turnover rate which lead to huge workload. You may need to work til mid-night or 2am during peak season. Progression is slow. No many pros except the brand name. Senior Management does not value your performance and skills.
bad,If you want job security this wont be the place to go to. The management run things in such an unprofessional manor that it makes it quite hard to focus on work. There are changes almost every other week that you have to adjust to which makes work a little confusing.
bad,"The only reason I would return to WTW's OE is the fact they pay really well.  If you're not related to the ""power's that be,"" you have no job security"
bad,I would not recommend this company to any one who has their own mind and is black. You have to be dependent upon them. If you are black being independent is not recommended
bad,Terrible company changes hours on several basis. Nosey people at the job that report anything you do and management is a joke nobody knows nothing at all like is everyone clueless. No room for growth and management is rude.
bad,"The corporate HR function treats employees with such disregard. Most of the the HR leadership group are elitist who do not value the contributions of smart, hard working colleagues that do have Ivy League education. The head of diversity is ill-equipped and creates more problems than solves.i.equipped and"
bad,"Not a team effort at all, management tends to single out individuals rather than take accountability for a given project- this is a very thankless environment in which to work."
bad,"This place is modern day slavery.  Workload is too much for any human.  Management bows down to client and puts all the burden on the employees despite being unreasonable in ANY terms.  The whole operation is a blame game and if you’re not number one on your team, you’re head is on the chopping block.  They do NOT want to train.  They want you fully operational to all systems and industry day one.  If life’s success was measured on the number of hours required to work, you would be considered successful.  However, if you have a life outside of work this is NOT the place for you.  Does a good company ALWAYS have job postings like this place?  No."
bad,"Pressure to complete work without being able to take your lunch. Feeling overwhelmed everyday and lack of respect from managers. If you are able to avoid working here, please do so."
bad,"WTW is two multi-billion dollar companies that merged in 2016 - except they didn't. Almost three years later, there's still the Willis way, and the Towers Watson way (there are actually more, as other companies have also be acquired, but everyone seems to run their own show here).  That's a complete testament to this company's culture.  There is NO camaraderie, no compromise, no positive input.  No matter how hard you work, you are guaranteed to get beat up the next day, usually because someone sent an email to an upper management echelon, and then the beatings commenced all the way down the food chain.  Don't worry about an explanation.  Management will ask for one, but what they're really looking for is a scape goat.  It's all about the BLAME game at WTW.  By far the worst company I've ever worked for.  I had no idea a multi-billion dollar company could be run this poorly.  Stay away, unless your ego and confidence are ripe for a good bruising."
bad,"If you want commiserate compensation for your abilities, find another job. If you want to advance and grow, find another job. If you have family or good friends working in the company, you're golden! It does not matter how hard you work or how over qualified you are, Towers Watson is NOT the place for you."
bad,"Please understand this review is about Via Benefits a company purchased by Willis. Favoritism, black listing, micro management, and no raise after almost ten years"
bad,"Best part of the job came from the actual engagement with clients, understanding their needs and offering solutions. Hardest part of the job comes from management and co-workers being insecure, distrustful and micro-managing everything with deep fears of about loosing accounts creates unnecessary stress, and makes it extremely difficult to collaborate. Collaboration was further challenged with commission only employees and salaried employees failing to find a common ground that would ultimately benefit the client."
bad,"There was no guidance and i didnt understand my day to day functions as an employee and no one helped me. I was unbelievable, like it was a movie. Thank you"
bad,"Job is fine, however the management (the London based management responsible for my team) were awful. Bullies, brash, arrogant etc. I was bullied by the management to such an extent I had to leave without anything to go to."
bad,worked their for over 1 year and was dropped like a hat. I worked hard for this company and as soon as they had an opportunity they fired me. It was very surprising since I just returned from surgery.
bad,"Em termos salário e benefícios é o que faz com que muitos ainda estejam trabalhando na empresa. O ambiente de trabalho é desanimador, não temos perspectivas de crescimento, reconhecimento e oportunidades de crescimento ou novos desafios, a não ser que seja para tapar buracos ou em casos de emergências."
bad,"Its not a great place to work if your an introvert. And its not very ""diverse"" at my DC/VA location if you know what I mean. :-/"
bad,"Working environment is good. Management visibility is poor, to many policy's micro managing you and your career. Poor benefits. They will not fulfill any of your commitment's especially immigration commitments. H1-B job seekers be aware, this firm agrees quickly on sponsorship upon interviewing but when on board, they have the most time consuming immigration process I have came across in my whole career. Also this is not a place to be if you are looking to get your GC filed."
bad,"Sales job, high stress, high expectations and no commission super low bonus.  Via benefits does not give raises and no Pto and will never hire you. They suck don’t go"
bad,"Micro Management at its finest!  I have worked for (6) companies over the course of my career, and my experience with WTW was one of the worst career choices ever.  Within my first 30 days of employment, I received about 4 hours of systems training with team members and about 2 hours of training with the Team Lead.  MICRO-MANAGEMENT to the point of harassment. You better not be (1) minute late in the morning, back from break, lunch, etc. or it will be documented and reported.  Do not leave work (1) minute early or it will be recorded as an occurrence.  Each tardy is an occurrence.  Get (6) in a 12 month period and it is a written warning.  Management expected for you to be at your work area 15 minutes prior to your start time.  But do not clock in until your shift starts.  What?  Is that legal by Labor laws?  If you are late for ANY reason, you have to personally call Management and give a detailed explanation as to why.  Management will even discuss and disclose personal employee information with the team!  Highly unethical and unprofessional behavior.  Extreme backstabbing and complaining by employees and Management created an unbearably hostile and low morale work environment.  Most employees were like robots and rarely said a word except with their buddies.  Say more than Good Morning and it becomes a MAJOR issue for everyone.  Company promotes ethics, respect, teamwork, integrity, world-class training, work/life balance, etc. but NOT TRUE at least in Nashville. EVERYTHING is tracked and recorded.  I did encounter a few very nice employees in other departments.  Maybe my"
bad,"How do we provide clarity about what they are working toward and how it contributes to the success of the organization"

bad,"Gestão de Pessoas inexistente na organização. Colaboradores in loco abandonados e sem coordenação, sem desenvolvimento profissional."
bad,"Typical day was receiving calls from Medicaid Patients to get enrolled into their Medicare part B , and assist Patients with their HRA funding . Learned all the differences between the Medicare Programs as well as HRA accounts."
bad,"They Keep You Seasonal forever 32.5hr a week. Holidays off but without pay cause you are seasonal. You can be a top performer and still not be converted to permanent. They lie to you and never give you a time frame for conversion. They will string you along for years if you let them. I don't mind being seasonal but 32.5-35hrs a week is not sufficient for the cost of living at a pay of $15hr. You could make more at fast food doing a lot less,"
bad,Was told in training that if you make it through season that you would receive benefits that NEVER came for anyone. Change of supervisors all the time that have different rules. Very poor management. When man harassed women at the Tempe office of more then one person the company let that person stay on even after was brought to Human Resources. No room for growth and advancement even though they promise this.
bad,"The trainers there were not understanding, extremely judgmental & talked bad about the class they were training. HR gives you no chances to be successful & doesn't care about you as a person, only in it for the money & will fire you for almost anything & everything especially if you don't kiss up & shows no remorse."
bad,"Horrible supervisor.  Nasty attitude toward mostly everybody.  Expected you to know there systems without much training. Very verbally abusive. I was supposed to give apple support but only got a broken one."
bad,"The job was nice while it lasted, but it didn't last how I wanted it to, due to the horrible management. There were no benefits, you just got an hourly pay of 15$ an hour."
bad,Call Center has high turn over. Not what you think of the job.
bad,Managers played favoritisms. Employees are micro managed. It was a toxic work environment. They treated the temporary employee their worth was of no value.

bad,"The company hires Season workers with promise of the opportunity to become permanent. However there is no known matrix for determining who will receive a permanent offer. There are people that have been with the company for 3 years and are still seasonal with no PTO and no Health Benefits. And there are people that have been with the company for 3 months that are permanent with full benefits."
bad,"WTW gives good opportunities to people just getting started, however, they do not care about hard workers, you will put in 50-60 hour work weeks with no reward (i.e. they will not help to advance your career based upon hard work), but this does also depend what team you are put on. WTW does not provide competitive wages and incentives are nonexistent, and you are unlikely to get a raise. All in all it is a good place to get some experience, but if you want to advance in your career, this is not the place."

bad,"Working for Towers was good in the sense that it made me stronger and prepared me for my next position.  I learned a lot and feel that I was able to succeed in my other jobs because of the training I had at Towers.  The hardest part of the job was flexibility and knowing that there wasn't much room for growth, and if there was, we never really knew about it because no one ever told us or enabled us to grow."
bad,"Micromanaging intense department,which for me severely reduces motivation for productivity. Very little understanding of what your team might need to succeed. "
bad,"Loved the people I worked with but management is running the company in the ground. No value for employees, they make sure you know how replaceable you are. They continually hire questionable people who  steal customers financial information. "
bad,"Zero Collaboration, zero team environment, zero accountability or follow through. No advancement opportunities. A lot of talk and no action. Employees have been there 10+ years and refuse to evolve. No training"
bad,"Not horrible, but tons of cronyism. It's the kind of environment you would expect in a call center. The Willis Towers Watson office in Richardson, Texas is actually a smaller insurance call center called Via Benefits that was purchased by Towers Watson in 2012. Professionalism is rare, but you will find a little bit of everybody working there, so the job experience can be hit or miss. Be prepared to seriously kiss some butt if you want to get ahead on anything. Politics is everything here."
bad,"It is a good job for those who are seriously interested and dedicated in the financial/retirement industry. There is little room for promotion, although they  lead you to believe otherwise, and there are many issues with leadership and management. No HR on site as well for issue resolution."
bad,A typical day consisted of back to back calls with little to no knowledgeable support. Company culture was preached but not followed. It's all about who you know.
bad,No hay trato horizontal entre jefes y empleados y se rige por standares muy burocráticos que retrasan todo.

bad,"""Busy season"" seems to go on indefinitely. Only received a fraction of exam study hours promised in contract. No formal training program for analysts."
bad,"Pays below industry, lacks team-building activities to make a good work environment. If pay was up to standard would not be as bad. Office culture has declined greatly since I've been here."
bad,"The management here doesn't know how to handle things. specially the manager. they doesn't know how to balance things out specially on the work being brought down to the team. its like 1 man working on critical tasks more than he needs to work on a day. and efforts are not being notice due to small faction created within teams, and also high political issues are visible in this company."
bad,management dont really care much about employees and all they thing is their bonus at the end of the year
bad,Culture of workaholism is praised
bad,"Workforce Solutions controls EVERYTHING this company does and it's unfair for the employees who actually do their job. It's all about a point system, even if you get sent home in ambulance you get a point from Workforce! Its ridiculous. The job itself is easy but good luck having a life outside of work whether it's a life or death situation!"
bad,This is a seasonal position no matter what you're told during the hiring process.  Most coworkers were nice but floor supervisors were petty and extremely unprofessional.

bad,"Some of the people are really great to work with, but as soon as you mention that you want to grow it is as though you are being sabotaged for that desire. In order to move up, you have to know the right people and be willing to work overtime even though they promote having a healthy work life balance, which is false."
bad,contractors do not get clear goals recognized. Constant feedback from associates stating the extremely slow advancement process for employment advancement.
bad,They use you during open enrollments with mandatory overtime and then they lay you off 2 weeks before Christmas. There is no loyalty or sense of fairness towards you.
bad,"During training it seemed everything was being improvised on the spot. The training was absolutely irrelevant to the position in the most. After training there was supposed to be a ""nesting"" period of two weeks followed by another training, the nesting never happened. We were dropped straight into the floor with practically no guidance."
bad,"Some opportunities to learn new skills."
bad,"TW is full of brilliant consultants who are collaborative and easy to work with. Working in the Editorial group is another story. The Editorial director, who plans to retire in five years with full pension, wants to find the easiest way to do things rather than striving to do the best work. Her only worry is upsetting the apple cart. The culture of Editorial -- as well as Marketing overall -- is non-collaborative. Silos dominate the marketing team so much that every new project presents political hurdles that need to be overcome. In addition, rather than being a relatively flat place to work, as most lean organizations are these days, it's very hierarchical and therefore perilous to navigate for the un-anointed. Strangely, the Marketing director never collaborates with anyone on any projects. And the Editorial director takes every chance to undermine her underlings if they fail not to act like servile minions."
bad,"When I started at WTW, it was Willis of Florida.  They acquired HRH which was an easy integration with a great team in the benefits department coming over to join ours.  They did a great job in making fair adjustments in areas where there was a large discrepancy.  When Willis and Towers Watson came together, there were many large differences in the cultures between the two that never got settled while I was there.  Which is the main reason I moved to another employer along with my entire team."
bad,"Actuarial Service Center"
bad,"Management and coworkers were the only reason I stayed as long as I did. Everyone was very sweet and supportive."
bad,"working here was nice at first but unfortunately any information relayed from management to your  sup on the call floor can be quite old. legacy reps here receive bonus however new hires do not, maybe its to even out the pay for the two. who knows. trying to move up into an offline position can be quite hard. especially when one has worked here for 5 years that doesn't revolve around the call floor."
bad,"Not a lot of positions available to move up and develop ones' skill set. Easy to get to located downtown right off of bloor station. Not a great work life balance,"
bad,"As mentioned in many other reviews, the overwhelming negative at WTW is insular and egocentric leadership that makes decisions without consideration for employees.  Yes, there are always people being randomly fired without notice and everyone knows they could be next. No, the language put out by the firm on values and inclusion-diversity is not put into practice. The overwhelming positive is you'll connect with good people while trying to survive in an unhealthy work environment."
bad,"Under compensate current employees until they put in two weeks notice, then magically offer salary increases and leadership roles to try and make them stay. WTW management is resistant to constructive criticism and feedback. Exit interviews turn into debates (""Here's why you're wrong"" ) rather than learning experiences (""How can we do better?""). History of not promoting from within. Fun work environment, but a terrible place to grow a career."
bad,"I started at Willis Towers Watson out of college and found it to be a great environment for a young professional looking for experience. In addition to basic professional skills I had the unique opportunity to learn about Health and Welfare benefits and retirement plans. These skills have been essential to my life and providing advice to my family and friends. "
bad,"As far as day to day work goes this place is mildly tolerable. But there is zero communication between departments."
bad,"Not much room for advancement. You will start as contractor status first, and then maybe after a year they will offer you a full time position, but not guaranteed."
bad,"Willis Towers Watson is a dystopian workplace with producers that sell insurance policies at the bottom of the food chain, and moochers who have advanced up the food chain.  They don’t sell, produce, or bring in money for the company.  "
bad,"Typical day, when I finally got to take my 30 min lunch the cafeteria would be closed and this building does not have easy access to fast food.  Not enough time given to drive and pick something up and return within the time frame given."
bad,"They don't have a work/life balance. Kids get sick,not everyone has a support system. Being penalized for putting your kids first is horrible. Getting lied to about being rehired is not too nice either. A lot of theft was going on. Socials were being sold. There was a bedbug infestation going on. They were helpful at first, then said if you find them in your home or work area,it's your fault. I don't think so. Not if I didn't have them before I started with this company."
bad,"The company overall is very financially stable and successful but that's about all the positive feedback I can provide.  "
bad,"you go in knowing there's a real small chance you will stay longer than 6 months. It may not be sale based but there is still extra stuff that would make or break you and, in my opinion, was unnecessary."
bad,I’ve worked for the company for nearly 3 years. It was amazing when I first started. The people were positive and everyone was superior at doing their job. Now the management has been almost completely restored. The work is never ending with not the best people to speak to on the phones. The new management seem to hire anyone with a pulse and their not people oriented at all. The initial training is good but once you’re on the phones there will be nearly no help cause everyone is new at their roles. You should only work here if you desperately need a job. Starting pay is about $15an hour which is less than when I started
bad,"Currently a culture or false economy. The company fails, for the most part, to retain talent and motivate employees. "
bad,"WTW mgrs constantly say they don’t micromanage but that is exactly what they do.  They also always say move ahead, yet if you make a mistake they make you relive it multiple times."
bad,"Culture of the CSR department at WTW is largely determined by the company's decision to start everyone as contractors without benefits or a just wage. Variable contractor hours work for the company, not the employees. There is high turnover and CSRs did not seem to be valued by WTW. Opportunities for advancement out of the CSR or Benefits Specialist roles were nonexistent. LBGTQ and other diversity issues were shoved down the throats of conservative employees."
bad,This job had a lot of self developing tools that got me ready for other future endeavors. There were a lot of computer based training programs that will be useful in future employment. I worked here through a temp agency. The majority of the representatives were employed through temporary agencies. Some had been there over a year with no paid holidays or vacations. No incentives.
bad,"The company does not necessarily practice what they preach, i.e. they sell great advice to clients that they do not implement. Pay is sub-par, bonuses are most often not fully funded, and advancement is possible only if the right people like you. The best part of the job is the ability to work on interesting projects with interesting clients, to work autonomously and have complete flexibility (working from home, etc.). However, it is easy to be blacklisted there if you make one small mistake, or if leaders happen to not approve of your personality."
bad,"They only care about high level associates that make the company millions of dollars. Merged 3x the 9+ years I was employed. No room for advancement. Find loop holes to not pay you advancements and yearly raise. Management is untrained and unprofessional. All about who you know, hire a lot of high executive family members and referrals. Discrimination against people of color and women. OPEN Environment."
bad,"Work life balance was manageable at times"
bad,You get to pick your hours you want to work.  Doesn't pay out enough for the amount of work that is involved during the season.  They make a lot of money when the agent does not get compensated enough for their efforts.  Its a free insurance license but comes with a semi price of not getting full compensation for the work put in.  It should be much higher when you sell the carrier products.
bad,Not a great place to work if you want job security. Work was sent to Mumbai making Ipswich workers over worked and stressed.  People who worked there were vey pleasant though.
bad,The position itself was pretty typical of a call center. There were some stressful situations at times of high call volume. The team leads and management could be pretty hard to work with. They chose favorites. Hired through a temp agency and it was difficult to become a permanent employee. Also had a feel like they did not care for their employees as much because they were replaceable.
bad,"They will hire you into one job and one job only.  Very little opportunity for advancement because of limited staffing/hiring restrictions.  Year after year, TAS leadership will under hire for peak seasons and ask you to work 50 - 80 work weeks.  "
bad,Retention is really poor at Towers Watson. Projects tend to be repetitive and do not challenge one's thinking. Management at the Houston office is sterile and do not promote any office culture.
bad,I've been here 10 months and still haven't been hired on. That's 10 months worth of benefits and 401k and a pay raise I'll never see. It's absolutely outrageous that this large company is doing this to people. The turn around is insane so you'd think they'd hire me on if I've contracted that long with them and haven't left!
bad,"First, let me start with the people are great. They are friendly and encourage a good office environment. The health benefits are good as well. "
bad,"The job is great during the season, but they always remind you that your just a number and easily replaceable. Some supervisors there are great, others not so much. There seems to be a clique among them and if you don""t fall in that clique, you wont make it. If you ask a question you will get a different answer every time. When I started there they prided themselves in customer service and we were great then it became about numbers and not customer service, it went down hill from there. Busy during the season, somewhat slow in the off season.You do get plenty of time to do your training. The benefits are amazing if they make you full time. They usually keep everyone seasonal so they don""t have to give you benefits, and its hard to become full time. With the right supervisor you can go somewhere, but they change supervisors every 3 months so when the momentum is going good, they change it and its like starting over each time. They changed the name of the company 5 times if that tells you anything."
bad,As a new producer you will be set up for failure.  There is no leadership and no support in attending prospective client meetings.  Boss who also happens to be a producer stole prospective clients of mine and other producers for his own business and nothing was done about it.  You will not be able to succeed as a new producer here and its sad and disappointing for people with talent.
bad,Do not expect to be looked at uniquely or valued for your skills. You are expected to work like a cog in a machine. The management at Via Benefits is severely undereducated and ill prepared to manage the company.
bad,"Note this company is large and has many different areas of operational focus.  The below assessment is based on business operations only and not to product sales or insurance consulting areas.  I was at the company 17 years, which on the surface seems secure, but frequently had to change roles to account continuing downsizing  of positions and work from onshore locations to offshore locations as well as shifting of work from internal to external resources."
bad,"Horario algo flexible, suelen dar cursos de formación, se trabaja por objetivo y tanto el mobiliario como las oficinas son nuevas."
bad,"Poor management the management is bad at micromanaging people and gives no room for personal space, there is also very little room for advancement or any kind of bright future"
bad,"The talent reward syatem is quite biased."
bad,"I come from a true IT background  (JIRA, UML, SDLC, user stories, workflows, mockups, etc)...being a BA  here is not like my previous roles, it's more of a QA/data management role.  There's no organized approach to anything, you run for cover every day because you're constantly fixing issues, overwhelmed with deadlines & the project managers don't run interference between you & the client so that just adds to never ending nightmare.  The culture all depends on the client and the PM relationship.  Be prepared to work 55+ work week each week and it will become more during OE.  They believe in happy hour, which is good because you're gonna need a drink once you the place for the day.  Proceed with caution.  And, we just went through another merger, so who knows what's next.  The onboarding training sucks, it's 40 days worth of work crammed into 2 weeks and then you're on a client, so trying to complete your training while preparing for client meetings, etc., isn't going to happen."
bad,Very slow growth. No individual growth chances. No extra monetary benefits. No incentives. No promotions even after you perform extra ordinary. Lot of favouritism.
bad,"It was sad that all the efforts that I applied in getting my workstation set up and getting access to different platforms that the let me go. Supervisor was great and trainers did an outstanding job. My agency on the other hand was difficult. "
bad,Great Training program but not a good company for a career. It is a company that will work with you to get you through the training to fill in seats to meet there needs for the clients. The job is very unorganized and no where that you would go when looking for something long term.
bad,"Little work-life balance, however, different experiences in different offices/areas of the business"
bad,Very little understanding for work/life balance. Good benefits but raises and promotions are difficult to obtain. They like to have you do the next level job up without officially promoting or giving raise for new responsibilities.
bad,"A typical day at work begins with meetings of surprise assignments and finalization of audit reports to be submitted for scrutiny of supervisors. I learned a lot of banking operations and processes in my stint with this company."
bad,"I actually liked working here. However, the management here are non social people which makes it hard for a person such as myself. I did enjoy most of the staff here and worked with a lot of very good people. If you are a temp do not make paycheck plans as you can be let go at a drop of a dime. My advice .... don't talk to people."
bad,"Willis is a wonderful Company working under the right management. "
bad,"Visita de Clientes , Domine todo lo relacionado sobre beneficios,"
good,very interesting in which learning of the Chicago history. Many days are very busy and eventful other days are very slow. It is a seasonal job that works around tourist attraction.
good,I have nothing bad to say about WTW as I can not compare to other pension companies as I only worked at this one the work rate and training leaves alot to be desired at times and staffing levels are hard to work out HR are at a non existence level and all online if you have questions I enjoyed my time there but on a long term basis I do not believe would help a Career long term The Staff I found helpful and approachable but Management not so much I only worked in one department so can not say elsewhere.
good,The job was isolating and unrewarding.  Sat in cubicle for long eriods of time with no interaction.  There was low pay and merit increases are very low percentages.  Even with gooc Performance
good,"É uma empresa com potencial de crescimento se gerida por pessoas com visão sistêmica e de mercado, dispostos a se atualizarem e se prepararem para o novo."
good,"Come in to work gather all of my amenities (i.e., coffee, water/juice, food), get logged in to my work station, look over knowledgebase while waiting on calls. I learned a great deal about pensions and 401Ks. Some of management was cool as for others, they appeared cool and easy to come to during training but once we were out in the field things seemed pretty cold! The workplace culture was pretty uptight. The hardest part about the job was finding my own way to communicate the correct info to the participant's. The most enjoyable part about the job was, getting to know my peers in training class!"
good,"no opportunity for advancement in either administrative assistant division or office services division. Cultures vary from city to city. Some offices are suit and tie. Some are casual business attire. Good people, opportunity for fun culture, cold corporate management."
good,"I was working there as a contractor. Some of them did not have respect to us. I was a bad experience working over there. Luckily I got a Job at DOT and love this place and work here until I retire but unfortunately, there is no room for promotion that is the only reason I'm looking for another so that I can grow and learn more and more."
good,"The training somehwat prepared me to take phone calls. Most of my experience was gained on the phone. Working with the COBRA Department, the manager is a micro-manager. She nit picks at everything. People mostly stick to themselves or a small group of friends at work. Being on the phone becomes repetitive. People have been temps for years."
good,"Working on Amazon was great.. then I switched to commerica. The manager asked how we liked the knowledge base for that program. I answered honestly that it was hard to read. Ever since then my life at wtw was miserable. I couldn't advance despite doing a good job. My hours were cut. I was pulled into weekly meetings to tell me how terrible I was and when they ran out of logical reasons they just told me I was ""um"" twice on a 30min call and that was unacceptable. I eventually quit. The company itself is okay I guess but my second program was a joke. Be careful and make sure to kiss a lot of butt."
good,Tough environment for an outsider (someone with no Willis Towers Watson background) to come into and make an impact.  Peers lack leadership and communication skills.
good,This job is a great start for someone who wants more experience in a professional setting. Everyone worked together. I started off not knowing anything and have learned so much through the ongoing training and coaching.
good,"Manage and balance the daily finance invoice that were recieved. You must also make sure the rates, draft invoice and mark ups were correct and then complete a final invoice which would then go to the finance management team."
good,"Decent benefits, pension, work is engaging.  No work like balance, no matter what they tell you during the interview.  The recruiter I worked with was good, the process to start is laborious and complex."
good,"It was a pleasure working with Towers Watson.  I gained a lot of experience, just wish the department would've stayed.  "
good,WTW implemented a new internal pay policy. No pay increase with promotion or major increase of responsibilities within the company.  You are not guaranteed an increase in pay or bonus and have to compete with upper management's personal opinion on who should get a raise during annual budget discussions.  Major inequities in pay within the same job duties and internal promotions.
good,"The overall culture and compensation is better at Willis than you'll find at most other ben admin companies. However, work/life balance is not a real priority. If you live to work and are comfortable with that approach, then this might not be an issue for you but if you're looking to work to live, then you might want to find a position elsewhere."
good,"Good for freshers"
good,"temporary position during medicare enrollment season. helping senior citizens being dropped from employer sponsored medical insurance, satisfaction helping senior citizens"
good,"The merger with Towers Watson caused numerous deficits to the company and its culture. We lost 30+ people in two years, mostly because management asks for feedback but then there is no follow through and no support for those who ask."
good,"not so employee friendly management, not employee benefits, excess load of pressure from seniors managers, timing issue, overall bad management who make ledger of CSR but not follow in practically"
good,"Ambiente normal, mucho trabajo y muy sacrificado para poder compatibilizar tu vida personal."
good,"Great place to work for students are younger people. During open enrollment the environment can be intense. No benefits and hard to become a perm employee, but the perks are free coffee and or tea"
good,"Good working environment, but has lots of work load. People are fun to be with and very approachable. They give free lunch, and food rewards if you did a great job in your work."
good,Good employer for entry level person to start. Employee can gain experience from many different lines of business to further their career line. Drawback is low compensation/benefit level compared to industry competitors. Manage has high level of involvement with employee groups which can hinder on productivity levels.
good,"TW is in risk consulting. My work is about employee benefit schemes, My basic reason to change is to have a work life balance and also want to get a desirable pay as per my academics."
good,"A typical day would consist of starting a document or presentation from scratch, or editing an existing document."
good,"The work  is very repetitive. There are constant deadlines and they care far more about meeting them than anything else. "
good,"Waiting for calls took a long time, and mentally took a toll. If you got lucky with the right supervisor it's not a bad job, but if you get stuck with the wrong supervisor you will have a really bad experience."
good,"Willis Towers Watson is a fast paced company with little room for mistakes or down time. Generally, great people to work with and the leadership team has come a long way. If you're looking for experience, this is a great place to learn a lot quickly. If you're looking for work-life balance, this may not be the company for you."
good,"I originally had high hopes for this company, but it turned out to be just like any other. The managers are changed (quit, fired, on leave) so often, there's no real organization. There's only one way for me to advance, which is a career and job I do not want. It's impossible to get promoted or recognized here, and I constantly feel like the only time anyone in management remembers our role exists is if they do so in a negative light."
good,"Journées très longue et monitone."
good,"There is no room for advancement with the company, even if you have great attendance and work when scheduled.  The company is very clickish and does play favorites."
good,Little to no stability for incoming employees.  Leadership and management opportunities are few.  Performance is not an indicator of advancement.  Workplace morale dips due to lack of stability
good,"Not a great place to work, but not bad either:"
good,"Taking Inbound calls from Retirees exiting their companies group plans and being enrolled into individual Medicare plans with contracted Insurance companies , and helping to resolve and answer varying questions regarding their insurance policies and reimbursements. Also, making outbound calls to clients where necessary to inform them about developments on their policies."
good,Third party benefits administrator that brought my class on board with a promise of a 40 hour work week & then the last day of training told us it would only be 32.
good,The job was a good job but the goals set forth by the company are unrealistic.  More jobs for this position are going overseas.  Good environment to work in but Management is not the best
good,"The company sold the loan protection division and the new owner downsized us before the new start date. Other than that I enjoyed employment there, even though the pay was low and there was no room for advancement."
good,"Inconsistent expectations & policies"
good,"Willis Towers Watson is the company for you if you like working in an atmosphere of your co-workers (or yourself) being here one day and gone the next. "
good,Finance opportunities now minimal with offshore of positions from the US. Weak middle management in the Finance area. Benefits eroded after Willis merger perceived as a drag on Towers performance.
good,"The management should be much better for such a prestigious organisation. There is zero work life balance. "
good,"No work life balance.  Unrealistic expectations and workloads.  Work you put in isn't worth the pay.  When someone leaves, you inherit their work for long periods (months) before the open position will be filled."
good,Its a great company  who is growing fast. The atmosphere and environment is great as well.
good,I learned a lot about actuarial reserving. I also was able to pursue many opportunities in the software area that led to many unique projects and secondments away from my core functional area on a regular basis.
good,"I was impressed by the willingness of newer Managers to improve the culture in the company, However the culture is very political and some older senior people are serious blockers to this aspiration in my view"
good,People have spent six years working full-time but being called seasonal before they were made permanent. So no benefits. When they made a bunch of people permanent  those of us with less than 2 years we're kept on but as seasonal  workers. Again no benefits.Coworkers are great but don't expect anything from the company. The majority of new hires will be laid off in December after the annual enrollment period ends.
good,"No real room for improvement or growth as all hiring from outside was for promotions that were promised to current employees. Bad culture, lack of inclusion or training. Low pay, good benefits, terrible corporate culture."
good,Far too many teams that are not merged/do not work together. The benefits are quite generous but the work is very difficult due to internal politics and a split company
good,"Too many micro clicks in the management rank,.  HR ran unchecked unsupervised. The Then HR director was allowed to seek revenge on any one that complined about anything,  her boyfriend (not her Husband ) work under her and was protected no matter what violation occured. Employees were terminated to protect his infractions"
good,"Trabalho sob pressão. Fluxo de trabalho grande. "
good,Il contratto da stage è sfruttato più per smaltire la mole di lavoro che per formare il personale.
good,You are not compensated appropriately. You are expected to work over 40 hrs even though you aren't paid enough to. Great experience but would never work there again.
good,"One of the best companies to work if you are looking for flexibility and work life balance. "
good,"They typically only hire via contract and then look to convert contractors to associates. "
good,"during the ""season"" or in a ""campaign"" the work was steady and sometimes ""meaningful"".... basically we were there to ""assist"" the customer.   over time the objective was changed as the company was merged and merged again.   as I left it was going to become very ""callcenter"" like and require a lot of Outbound cold calling  to sell the ""customer"" an additional premiumed policy to add to the already expensive one they bought because they ""had"" to ."
good,Overall I would not focus on a career here. If job security is what you are looking for this is not the place. You can do an amazing job as far as productivity and still be laid off due to business needs.
good,"-There is extensive amount of learning to be done. They have state of the art technology, and as much computer based training as you can handle. "
good,"Willis Tower Watson is a great place to work. Willis Tower Watson being a broker, I had to handle the Clients as well as underwriter queries on daily basis as well as had to maintain their quarterly financial activities, keep a track on premiums cash loss, Preliminary Loss Advice and account."
good,OK if you just want a job and not a career. Not enough advancement opportunities. It's like most call centers although not as great a call volume. The popular ones get promoted. Very good in terms of inclusion though.
good,"Salary is good."
good,"Training was extensive and continuous."
good,Read the description before applying you have to get hired within before you get paid time off or vacation time you have to meet adherence which they are flexible about
good,Good opportunity to learn the benefits industry. The structure could have been better . They stretched their resources thin which made it difficult to balance service levels and client agreements
good,"Great place to learn about benefits and data management. Lots of hours, specially during annual enrollment. Training is not well done, not a lot of social interaction. You may work from home from time to time."
good,"Leadership is poor and lacking direction. Flexible work environment, but lazy colleagues are impossible to dump. It’s demoralizing at times to come in and deal with the day to day."
good,"It is a typical corporation with over 5,000 employees globally and about 250 in Stamford. There is no set seating, you work in an while environment. There was a new office dining room , with a txmv, refrigerators, free soda, coffee and teas of a variety."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with because they were like family but the job security is terrible and management doesn't care anything for their employees so the atmosphere is quite depressing because everyone knows they are dispensable and not valued at all.  They changed me to night shift suddenly after working there for 6 years on day shift which put me in a tough situation as a single parent and why I initially took the job in the first place.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and supervisors were down to earth and friendly in the department I worked in most of the years working there but just took a change for the worse in recent years which broke my heart.
good,Not much room for advancement with stability. The segment of the business located in Richardson TX is not a reflection of the overall culture of the company. This location needs stability for its employees. You work for years without becoming a permanent employee with benefits and it is the accepted status quo.
good,"Good atmosphere."
good,"Nice environment both inside and out. Access to workout facilities with a variety of places to eat. Overall a nice place to work, but the job is stressful."
good,Had a manager that was required to take management harassment classes by his boss. He was always on Facebook and was a micro-manager. It ended up being I was basically managing the department myself since no one wanted to approach him. Also he blocked three promotions for me because his answer was he did not want to loose a good employee. The last one I found out about the day I handed in my resignation.
good,Great company to work for. Customer service position is very rewarding in the end. Unfortunately the job starts off temporary with little chance to get a permanent position and advancement in the company.
good,I enjoyed and excelled at my responsibilities here.  Loved working under minimal supervision.  I was trusted and the leaders were confident that I would exceed all expectations
good,"I prefer not to write a reviewing concerning this company. By the hours are flexible however, the culture is absolutely horrible. "
good,Too much workload but it was fun working with the company. Enjoyed the quarterly activity and the people working and dealing with. There are alot of training being given to employees for development.
good,"The company pays decently with most positions offering a monthly bonus based on performance. However it takes a long time to advance in the company. It's all about who you know, not what you know. Which leads to very poor management. The biggest problem is that no one seems to be on the same page about work policies for employees or customers. No one seems to really know what's going on and is very inconsistent."
good,The merger has created a difficult work environment.  There needs to be better management and more leadership.  The company needs to focus on more team work versus each person working on there own.
good,"Company has merged, so many changes made that has ruined the office morale. Will have to bite your tongue half the day as you watch those that are less skilled than yourself climb up the ladder while you work twice as hard to go unnoticed. Have the ability to work this job from home however that is not an option unless you are a higher up. The company doesn't realize the work that the customer service department puts into the company and they are not flexible at all when it comes to work/life balance."
good,would never work there again. not a good experience for me. fired me and couldn't give a reason why. did not enjoy the job. was not organized. and i worked hard just to get fired
good,"Empresa Global líder no ramo porém, possui pouca experiência em gestão de pessoas."
good,"A typical day at work varies from very lax to very stressful as the work load is seasonal."
good,"There are high time commitment expectations for minimal compensation. Minimal raises and unfortunately, there are limited growth opportunities in some departments."
good,The company recently went through a merger which has created many challenges that the company will need to learn how to adapt to. There are still many areas of the business that need to be focused on as well as how to accommodate the new changes in structure.
good,"Se maneja un volumen muy alto de novedades que se deben solicitar a las compañias, adicionalmente las labores de contestacion de correos, generacion de nominas y demas son el diario vivir en la empresa, he avanzado mucho mas con los sistemas de office en especial con excel que es la herramienta mas util, me la llevo muy bien con mis  Jefes en una relacion laboral de respeto, la parte mas dificil es manejar la presion de los comerciales ya que ellos se les hace dificil entender las fechas pactadas para para la contestacion de las diferentes novedades, el manejo del cliente interno telefonico y depender de un tercero como es la compañia de seguros para la contestacion en los tiempos de respuesta exactos. Lo que mas me gusta es que aprendo cada dia dar lo mejor de mi en cualquier circunstancia de dificultad dando una solucion rapida a cualquiero solicitud."
good,Long hours and no overtime pay. However you learn a lot in whatever position you have and they do want people to move forward in their positions.
good,"Great for entry-level to gain experience. Good for now - not for growth. Good location in the center of Boston, in the prudential tower."
good,"Not enough push to advance within the company. Most advanced positions were filled from outside the company, which caused employee dissatisfaction. "
good,"Based in the Central London office, I was part of the HR Shared Services function, responsible for providing HR Administration support to the Recruitment team, Employee Relations, Compensation & Benefit and Global Assignment teams."
good,A good p-lace where you get a lot to learn. People in team are always there to help you out not just to tell how but also to tell you why to do it. The most enjoyable part of job was to spend time with my friends there who were also my colleagues and to achieve the targets so as to remain ahead of others.
good,A global company consisting mostly of benefits administrators.
good,"If you want to have a first hand experience on what was like to work,"
good,"One of the main problem at WTW is that matrix management doesn't work. Basically, WTW is great to provide best practices to customers, but they do not implement it internally which can be quite frustrating. Internal HR systems seem to date back the 1990s."
good,"The company underwent a merger 3 years ago and many systems and processes are still in a state of transition. On a positive note, they do allow great flexibility in allowing staff to work remotely."
good,"If you like constant change, little job security regardless of performance or seniority and thrive in an environment where innovative thinking is promoted yet systems in place cant support that culture because every support function from IT to Finance are offshore and outsourced, WTW is your place! "
good,"Typical 9-5 M-F office type job. Basically what you would expect at other offices as far as dress code & expected behavior. You will talk to a lot of irritable customers on the phone all day, but you will get some pleasant ones as well. Most of the supervisors don't know anything & will just recommend you chat a help desk when you need guidance because they don't know. There is a disconnect between management & reps."
good,"I love the smart and friendly people that work here. There are a lot of great resources you can rely on and it's a great place to learn. "
good,"The customer service position is seasonal. Nearing the end of the season, hundreds are laid off. Those that remain after the season still remain SEASONAL EMPLOYEES. Therefore, you still receive no benefits, raises, sick leave/PTO, etc. There are many people working here who have been ""seasonal"" for 2-3+ years. There is little opportunity to grow, there are occasional opportunities to move to different departments, but the pay & lack of benefits rarely change. They offer random opportunities for permanent positions, the employees selected for this is almost at random as well. I've heard stories from coworkers who have worked here for 3+ years and still no permanent offer, and stories of those who have worked for 1 year and received a permanent offer. I work along side some who make 14 an hour that have to work 5x harder to receive a ""bonus"" that would at least put their overall take home to 15 which is what I make. It's not fair. Although the pay is more than most call centers, WTW shows little interest in retaining or meeting the needs of their employees. Been here for almost a year, survived the season. In the almost year here, they continue to expect you to adjust, do more work, etc. with no raise or benefits."
good,"Good workplace to start a career, but in a long term it is not beneficial. Low rate of promotion and advancement, less opportunities, less salary, etc."
good,It was a great work environment but tedious. The rules and regulations are. Little harsh and hard to always uphold but that is how the provide white glove service
good,"Generally very good co-workers with collegial, collaborative culture, but often misguided, fickle management.  You better be happy with your starting salary because you're not going to move up much from there."
good,I enjoy helping people and feeling I've made a difference in there life. I receive inbound phone calls form retirees looking to select an insurance product to correspond with their medicare insurance. Most of the people I talked to have been on group plans for most of there lives and are very intimidated by the process. I feel a since of pride after I have helped someone and put there mind at ease and it it is a very satisfying feeling when you help someone make a difficult choice.
good,Help people sign up for the medical benefits through the employer. When  a company had a open time for signing up for benefits it would be very very busy.
good,"WFH option is a plus."
good,It is very difficult to advance within the company and now there is a new pay incentive that eliminated raises. You get a monthly incentive that can be altered so although you are working hard for it if management sees differently because of the number that incentive can be reduces to nothing.
good,"WTW is a highly competitive company culture. You are competing against your fellow employees, so there is not a lot of incentive to help you if it is needed."
good,"Seasonal benefit advisers get trained in early summer for the Medicare sales season.  There are many insurance company certifications to complete before the sales season starts, and this is a stressful period. Essentially all customers have health reimbursement accounts, which makes the selling of plans easier. People call during open enrollment, you assess needs, and get them into plans that will serve them well."
good,"It takes decades to move up when the starting pay for each position is below market value to begin with. The career advancement structure is set up to keep your pay below reasonable salaries. For example: Specialist 1 - Specialist 2, Analyst 1 - Analyst 2, and so on. After 5 years of climbing the ladder to Analyst 2, I realized I was on track to retire by age 427 at their pay increments. The positive aspects of the workplace include game room, easy work, decent benefits, and some fun people to work with. My advice... use this job as a resume builder and move on asap."
good,"The pay is very comparable to other companies and sometimes better depending on your department. "
good,"A typical day at work is a typical 9-5 and Monday to Friday."
good,it was a very nice place to work but they really need to do a background check of some of the people that  work there. Some where very unprofessional on the phone and people having to deal with gossip. They where playing a lot and being disrespectful on the phone.
good,"A lot of sitting. Managers cared about their employees more than most, but workforce management was difficult to work with, forcing me to leave. They did not accommodate part-time hours well. "
good,"The teams at Towers Watson are filled with high-performers.  You learn a lot from your colleagues and are able to take those skills with you.  "
good,"A worthwhile position for someone will in to be helpful to people of our aging population. "
good,"Learning experience provided the opportunity to learn and explore my caliber. Decent Management, co-workers now turned to lifetime friends."
good,"Good to start as new grads, provides systematic training to new hires. "
good,"Speak with retirees. Complete their enrollments. Its a good job, But stressful. Alot of the retirees don't like the process they have to go thru"
good,"The company is a great company to work for if you are beginning your career in the job market.  It doesn't however, have much room for growth."
good,"I learned a lot working at Towers Watson. I had excellent co-workers. "
good,"Have to stay late every day, and have to work past dinner time and sometimes on weekends"
good,"Best thing about Towers is the people. Great, smart, fun co-workers. Flexibility is great. You have the freedom to manage yourself and your work on a daily basis. No micro managing which is great. Management is very supportive. On the other hand it is a fast paced work environment to the extreme. The work can be very stressful and demanding. Long work days are expected. It may balance out if the pay and benefits were better. Pay does not compensate for the amount of responsibility and demands."
good,"Good team and friendly environment, mostly a place where you can explore the avenues available and diversify."
good,"Located in downtown Toronto, and right on a subway line. Very accessible. Some good restaurants in the area. The company has a wide variety of talents from different spheres."
good,The job focused on assisting retirees with finding an insurance plan that was offered from their company to ease their sense trepidation. The job was very data sensitive.
good,"Good company to work for. Good managers and co workers. much work. workplace culture, the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is to help the clients."
good,People are great but company not so good. They don't communicate with their employees ever well. If I had to go back there I would look farther before going back
good,"Temps had a competitive work environment. Felt led on at times about the opportunities available for those of us in temporary positions, unfortunately."
good,"It's nothing to write home about. People get fired without a real reason, it's based on team growth and scores and not the scores of each worker. Nothing is secure or consistent."
good,"Nice employer with reasonable pay, progression, company incentives and benefits. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Willis Americas the first 7 or 8 years of employment, however, once Towers Watson merged with Willis, the company became a very fast paced and stressful place to work, with a tremendous amount of turnover, due to overworked employees."
good,Depending on the team that you are on and the supervisor that you will have. To work as a team yes you can have a supervisor that will help or the supervisor will have a team member to help.
good,The position was only temporary but the experience was great. You got a chance to talk to people and assist them when they needed help. You also got a chance to enroll people.
good,Challenging environment post-merger of Willis and Towers Watson. Good environment to work and great work colleagues. Agile working helps work/life balance.
good,"A typical day in the beginning is training and doing modules to learn & refresh your knowledge about Medicare products.  After you are put on the phones, you help retirees who usually are losing their group coverage & need help enrolling in individual insurance plans.  This is rewarding to be able to help them through the process, but due to it being Medicare there are MANY many restrictions and guidelines you have to go by.  Calls are monitored for compliance. "
good,"I worked for this company through a temp agency. The people were amazing but I do not like call centers, just not my type of environment. Appears to be a great company if you're hired on."
good,"Indian office is more like a back office hence a lot of data work. "
good,"not able to provide information at this time. WTW is a great company, but offer no benefits until 6 months of working with them. and no over time is offered. and no PTO."
good,"I like my coworkers, most of them are very helpful and reliable, work load can be very heavy."
good,Good job overall just seasonal a job was the only thing I didn't like about this job overall it was a good job I liked the people we came together as a growth and great help
good,Give information to retirees about their retirement benefits and answer questions about plans they have. Check on reimbursements and make appointments to talk about other plans they may want.
good,"Thankful to have this position when I first arrived in San Diego from Illinois, through a recruiting agency, I was quickly thrown back into the health benefits arena for a couple of major companies for open enrollment season.  The training was fast-paced, but abbreviated for speed and necessity.  The managers were not overly friendly or accommodating and were micro-managers at best, very critical, eager to discipline, and not willing to help on most days.  The call center position left little room for advancement in to the consulting side of WTW, which is what I actually envisioned while I worked there.  This was disappointing as I realized there was no room for advancement and huge turnover within the organization.  I realized that my contract was not going to be extended beyond the end of open enrollment season, so I resigned my position shortly before the ultimate termination date and moved onto another role outside the organization."
good,"Work days are either very stressful or very boring. There is rarely a middle ground. Takes a while to learn material, don't feel like you get rewarded enough for it."
good,It was a decent job. My contract was ended because I was out sick too many days in a row. The pay was decent for the area. A lot better than most call centers offer.
good,Good company to work for insurance. A good to start as a fresher as there will be more exposure to it. There are different teams where you can work. New process TAS  is a good opportunity.
good,The company is great to work for. This is due to the flexibility the company allows for associates with conflicting schedules. I would recommend this company to people who are looking to have a decent work experience.
good,Seasonal job for medicare season. 100% Phone contact with customers from selected companies that are switching their health benefits for retirees to the open medicare markets. Many of the companies did offer funds for their retirees to make the transition.
good,"Worked at WTW for three and a half years.  I appreciate that I've been given the opportunity to take on new roles as I worked my way up from processing client tasks.  You do gain learning experience from working with well known clients and learning from talented team members (depending on the team you are assigned to...).  I can say I was able to obtain accomplishments from handling high volume, detailed client projects from start to finish.  However,  the workload can be VERY stressful during open enrollment, with little to no work life balance for the last few months of the year.  Since the merger, the reporting structure of the client teams has obviously changed, and reporting to a new ""manager"" in a different state I find takes out the personal relations of developing your role or ""career path"", especially if they don't work with you directly often or interact hands on with a specific client project.  I think this also divided the culture within the office.  Regarding pay, I've also taken on considerable responsibility with a level change, and not even a shift in my pay range - not cool.  "
good,"A typical day is very busy allocating and sending out casework on time. "
good,"Strategic Benefits Consultant/AVP experienced in leading and managing complex health and welfare benefit projects, serving as trusted strategic advisor for large/middle market employer clients. 25+ years of direct to employer consulting, relationship management, and analytic experience in benefits strategy, design & implementation, including ongoing support to employer human resources benefit directors & managers."
good,"It was a good job to get my start in the medicare market.  I learned a lot, but because the company change hand it was not a good place to start a career path."
good,a typical day at work is churning due diligence request and interacting with clients and learning and gathering updates and knowledge about policies and screening around the globe
good,"Empresa com benefícios excelentes, porém com uma estrutura de cargos e salários extremamente fragilizada e desorganizada."
good,"Pay's not great. It's a consulting firm, and it's got the standard consulting firm atmosphere. Some good people, some great, some not so great. You could do worse. Could do better."
good,Willis Towers Watson is a great company to work for if you can secure a full time permanent position. Most positions are seasonal at WTW and there is always the threat hanging over your head that you might not make it through the season.
good,"During my tenure I have worked various tasks for multiple client teams. I learned communication and assertiveness is necessary to establish proper professional and excellence. Management is willing to work with you at all causes. Workplace culture was friendly and collaborative, team effort. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple changes and urgency when deadlines approach. The most enjoyable part of the job is accessibility to knowledge team members."
good,"Leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. Willis Towers Watson has 40,000 employees serving more than 140 countries. The company designs and delivers solutions that manage risk, optimise benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals."
good,Excellent career opportunities and a supportive environment but poor work/life balance. Workload is intense and not for the faint hearted. There are a lot of experienced people who like things done a certain way making it hard to change but definitely not impossible.
good,"relaxed working environment, great people, answering calls. helping customers. seasonal work. no benefits until you are hired on as a permanent. call center"
good,Willis Towers Watson is a client focused company. I enjoyed the employees and some of the upper management. They strived for excellent but prefer to be permanent.
good,Great relationship among coworkers and they have parties often during the weekend. Supportive to actuarial exams taking and lots of interesting projects and learning opportunities.
good,"typical day was high call volume"
good,The company team was spread all over and management were very unaware of the projects. The PM and senior manager were horrible and software were very old technology.
good,"Great colleagues but lot of instability due to frequent mergers, management changes, no growth path for most employees. India operaitons not important for global leadership."
good,"The development office is flexible to a fault. Very little oversight. The pay isn't great for QA. If you are QA, you will likely be passed up because there's a huge problem with nepotism. If you are in the in-crowd, you'll advance. If you're not, you're screwed. That's why I left."
good,"I was actually hired by a company that Towers Watson purchased just before they merged with Willis. I was really not interested in the work that WTW had to offer me. Nothing against them, just a poor fit."
good,Too many mergers with other companies made working there challenging. The managerial staff is not great and there is little to no onboarding for a new position.
good,"There are a lot of nice people to work with. There is very little assistance onboarding to a new position. Overall, the company is good, but they have merged with other companies and things aren't as great as they used to be."
good,"There isn't much room to move up and you're stuck in your seat all day with a specific schedule.  You start out as a contractor and have no idea when you will have the chance to move to full time. As a contractor, you are not guaranteed any more than 30 hours. It's an okay filler job."
good,"The work environment is ever changing which caused a lot of stress, but soon it will be stable again. If you can handle constant change, this is a perfect place for you."
good,WTW is a great place which allows for flexibility in the work place.  they provide plenty of growth opportunity and has a diverse group to work with.   With the resent restructure it seems hard to adjust to the new day to day activities.
good,The IT department I worked at (there is more than one in the company) was highly disorganised with little idea how to deliver a project successfully. But the people were really nice.
good,"Interesting role with variation day to day. Management overall were supportive. Most enjoyable was the variation and the people. I learnt a lot about the different software that companies use and the different programmes used to make a successful business."
good,"Working as a CSR for WTW certainly has its benefits, especially if you are looking to leave the retail world. You have weekends off, usually home for dinner (minus mandatory meetings each quarter), you don't have to be on your feet for 8 hours a day, and you done have to worry about meeting a commission or selling to any goals. These are definitely things to be happy to have. "
good,"WTW is good for those seeking work life balance. However, on the compensation front it still lags. Rotational shift is something which can affect your health."
good,Typical job issues.  My position was seasonal so.....  Not micro-managed that's always a plus.  It was a good position to use for transition into a higher paying job.
good,"Day to day service of clients to help manage their employee benefits. This includes assisting with financial meetings, enrollment planning, certificate review, benchmark surveys and carrier negotiations."
good,"ambiente de trabajo bueno, puntual para el pago del salario"
good,"Relatively flat org structure makes it easy to find professional development opportunities, but this is offset by a lack of work-life balance, depending on which team you are on. Because it's client-driven work and you're evaluated on billable hours, there is a culture of being on-call to meet client demands and reach internal hours/sales goals. Some team leaders are better than others at maintaining a balance, but that seems to be the exception rather than the norm."
good,Claims Management is my passion. Working with Insurance company is best part of my career which also helps my personal development
good,"could be very busy at times. sat at computer all day. learned a lot about banking and investments, very interesting, but confusing at times, everything was different every day, time went super fast."
good,"With free coffee and sports center, hard to go wrong.  Best part of the job is the ability to own your day, while the most challenging would be the possibility of failing, even with 100% effort given."
good,"The company culture was very progressive, with approachable work stations and no private offices, but with the recent merger, management was in chaos."
good,Great place to begin a career. Provides a lot of initial training and learning opportunities in the healthcare consulting field. There are many new opportunities for employees due to the merger with Willis.
good,"Your work/life balance and job satisfaction depend on which department you work for."
good,"Open Branch, make deposits, make loans counsel and discuss with customers the reasons why they became delinquent. Come up with solutions that both the customer and the branch can agree on in order to get the customer current and up to date."
good,Decent work life balance.  Good Training Program. Friendly work environment.  Management is invested in the staff overall happiness and productivity.
good,"Responsible for data collection, analysis, validation and report generation; responsible for preparing/ customizing data collection tools/templates."
good,"Apart from routine work, we get option in team huddle to discuss about any problems, or any training requirements, achievements and some fun too. People are the best to work with."
good,"Management is great. They are always there to help you and answer your questions. Work-life balance is great as well. The turnover rate as a CSR is very high, so do not expect to make too many life long friends. "
good,"Thorough professional approach to projects"
good,"Very well known firm with great employee benefits that boost the value of your overall salary but very demanding.  Not a very good work/life balance and my team was extremely under resourced.  Working in the right area of the company would definitely have vast benefits and advancement options - unfortuately this was not an area I was working in, so despite the vast amount of knowledge and experience I have gained there is nowhere else for me to go and my family life was suffering as a result of the demanding work level"
good,"Worked on phones nonstop, was not allowed to leave desk unless bathroom emergency or for lunch. Not very good opportunity to get to know fellow employees. Management was kind and helpful."
good,A bit dry but an enjoyable workplace nonetheless. Good worklife balance and culture.
good,"My role is extrememly varied with a whole load of deadlines to prioritise and work to. I am mainly working off of email and I am juggling global diary management across all time zones, co-ordinating global business trips, conferences/briefings (internal & external) as well as other ad-hoc duties like data collections, survey management, monitoring client work, NDA's & general office management."
good,"Answering calls from people who are having issues navigating Employee Self Service Website, questions about their health or pension benefits, and expanding knowledge on ever-changing market. The management is focused on keeping our clients happy and maintaining low answer speeds."
good,You're assigned to individual client teams and everyone manages their own workload. The good thing is that you never know what you'll be asked to do next and how far you progress depends on which area you'd like to be working in.  My co-workers are quite friendly and helpful and everyone works hard.
good,"I manage and maintain High Density File Room for the OS department it’s my responsibility to enter new folders in the Opus iNet and maintain them on the shelves with all previously entered folders. I retrieve folders from Data Services and benefit data source groups and re file them in High Density File Room. I help clients with any questions they have pertaining to file room. I am the main contact for Iron Mountain actives I schedule pick ups for offsite storage, ordering supplies and call backs if clients need files back from Iron Mountain; this gets very busy during the end of the year a lot of archiving takes place at this time."
good,The hardest part for me was passing the am every week we had one you either had to make a 90 or above once you reach 5 failed Qms your out the door . I was so stressed at this job
good,"Money wise they pay fairly to all the employees. "
good,Very flexible when it comes to working from home and in the office. Not nearly enough pay for the expectations set for you.  People that work here are great for the most part.  High learning curve makes it a quick-paced work environment.
good,"I've worked for this company for almost 4 years now. In that time, I have been ""promoted"" once from hourly to salary. I have shown significant skills, education, determination, and willingness to further my own education yet I have been told numerous times that I need to do the tasks of the position above me and no such tasks have been offered. When I ask for tasks that could lead to a promotion, I am given excuse after excuse."
good,Its a great opportunity to grow from and prosper as well. Its patentionally a career builder as well. Its s diverse environment. Amazing people and great team work.
good,"I left Willis following the merger with Towers Watson.  The company was going through major changes at that time. Culturally, the company was undergoing a major transition following the merger."
good,"-Management identifies and appreciates valuable workers. "
good,"It was a stop job for myself. The staff and team were really nice, However, working in the call centre was probably not the best place to be if you want to be treated well as, with any call centre, your value is measured by how many minutes you are ready to take calls every day."
good,I learned immensely from my direct managers and was able to prove my ability to own projects from inception to completion. I left there with a newfound confidence and appreciation for hard work.
good,"Work can be very repetitive but the working environment is relaxed and only those with management responsibility tend to stay late. The company charge clients more than any other competitor but basic wage is low. They justify this by saying the bonus and benefits make up for it but most benefits aren't relevant to young people and the bonus calculation is not transparent. The company seem happy to train people up and watch them leave, then replace them with cheaper people. Good if you have no experience but staff retention is poor."
good,"This is indeed trenches rodeo when it comes to customer relations. Great experience. If you want to know how to manage expectations, emotional skill set, process improvement, collaborative teams, Towers watson is the place to be."
good,The environment is based around flexible working seasons. this company is great for people to advance but the starting positions are demoralizing and childish. No respect is given to the employee
good,"good job, limited progression, salary does not compare with competitors, benefits have decreased since merger, a lot of overtime is needed, the team events are great - especially at Christmas"
good,"I love the job, but the management spends so much time reviewing everything you do and less time than they should assisting with any issues that arise, but otherwise, I love it!"
good,"people seems to like it and don't leave. have known many people who stayed with wtw for over 10 years. if you come from insurance background, you will be able to find the way to stay here longer"
good,"Currently undergoing changes in stream lining service and brokering. This has been rather chaotic in the Tampa Service Center because of the constant changes, high workload coupled with service and placement requirements are not supported with proper systems and procedural training."
good,"It was a nice place to work and nice people at Willis Tower Watson. I worked hard very day to get a job done. I was a lucky to work this place. My contact expired this month, so I have looking for another job."
good,I enjoyed my temporary position with the company and learnt A LOT along the way. Training sessions are great and that's coming from someone that doesn't know anything about Pensions.
good,"I loved working here for the short time that I was there. My co-workers-AWESOME-Management- NOT SO GREAT! Micromanagement made it unbearable along with a sour disposition by the immediate manager in my department, and there was one coworker who had a crab in a barrel mentality.  Otherwise, it was a great company and a good job."
good,"It depends on individual how he plans your day as work pressure is there and sometimes you dont have anything."
good,"Had several amazing managers that had your back, provided development opportunities and cared about you as a person. A few managers should have only been individual contributors because they didn’t care about their teams. There’s also a lot of people who should retire already that are too involved in decision making and help keep things the status quo instead of becoming innovative."
good,Make sure to document your time; at times it feels as if they're micromanaging their employees.  It can be a stressful environment and rarely is anything done to improve the culture.
good,"it's similar to most call centers. messy, favoritism, and lies. you have to be a fool to lose the job or just have horrible attendance. it's easy to get hired and the pay cool"
good,Very Stressful company that is slow to hire and promote their contractors. Places high demands on its employees/contractors. Poor about communication.
good,"I enjoyed the busy environment. "
good,"Good culture and environment. "
good,Es una empresa que valora la satisfacción del cliente y trabaja con prolijidad y profesionalismo para brindar un óptimo servicio.
good,"I interned at Towers part time while taking classes. I didn't necessarily feel like I was contributing to the team at all time; a lot of the work I did is what I believe to be stereotypical intern work. That being said, I did have a couple projects that I enjoyed, and my coworkers were friendly and willing to help."
good,Towers Watson is a great company to work for but was at the time of my employment there plagued with poor computer systems which would make an already tedious - more frustrating. Long hours would eventually result.
good,Not a bad place to start your career. Managers provide instruction on how to achieve objectives and be successful. Not too many skills learned that translate into future roles.
good,"Very flexible work/home life, surrounded by other great developers. Lots of perks. Hardest part of the job was meetings, Most enjoyment working with my other team members, who were great."
good,Sometimes the work and life balance is bad. Sometimes you have to work on weekends due to client requirements and deadlines but all in all people are amazing and the work is interesting
good,Overall its a great place to work. People are really nice and generally good atmosphere with flexibility. My team manages a large fund which meant working under pressure most days.
good,"La aplicaciòn de las buenas pràcticas laborales es la virtud del area de Recursos Humanos en Willis Towers Watson, el respeto mutuo, y la transparencia complementan en resumen la gestiòn de RR HH."
good,"Need to improve systems and very orthodox culture to work, Not ready for changes, Work allocation is uneven, No quality team, Audit is done internally, Sharing of data with team members are not allowed, There is no way we are making associate competitive in open market. Need to be agent centric and not work like a school, appraisal is a as per accordance with manager likes and dislikes, No transparency in data sharing. Should be ISO certified and centralized data system, Every data is in Excel and no uniform format is being done, Different department work on different systems and not on one systems. This is only for Willis tower Watson"
good,"Learned customer service, relationship building skills, training. recruiting and benefits administration."
good,"The position is titled Seasonal Compensation Analyst. The job involves looking at payroll data (base salary, short term bonus, sales bonus) for Middle Management positions across multiple industries. Employee compensation is entered into our database and compared to market averages. Our clients then purchase these compensation surveys from us."
good,"Willis Towers Watson,. has been a great place to work with great people and compensation/benefits/vacation.  Processing certificates is challenging and some days difficult, but the management team are a wonderful group of people and always available to help"
good,"Management is overbearing and incredibly critical."
good,"I've worked at Willis Towers Watson's OneExchange for two almost two years in which I had different experiences in each season."
good,"I currently work at Willis Towers Watson and am a Lead Benefits Consultant and Project Manager in several projects assisting multinational companies develop global/cross-border solutions that meet the needs of both local and headquarter management in the design, establishment, financing, operation, oversight and monitoring of their compensation and benefits programs. I order to do this I work closely with Wills Towers Watson local offices in other geographies, as well as subject matter experts in other segments."
good,"WTW is a great place to work but it is seasonal. The training is excellent. The company provides license preparation and test, ongoing training continually. After you pass the test, you are hired. The company provides paid training and continual CE. The company also pays for licensing in other states and appointments for carriers"
good,"very slow job going in entry level. as long as you have some sort of knowledge with in/out calls, cold calls/transferring and helping clients over the phone (who can sometimes be very upset) you will do very well. Depending on your performance, they will give you more clients."
good,"There is always something to do. There is a bit of down time when the open enrollment for certain clients has ended, but the company does give you the opportunity to learn about other clients. You are never with one company all of the time. If you do your work well, you will move forward quickly."
good,The job is great to gain skills in the insurance field but they lay off every season instead on offering permanent positions. Then they want to request you back the next season. People have lives to live! No one can sit and wait 7-8 months for a call back.
good,Willis Towers Watson has the potential to be a great work environment. Needs more consistence in following guidelines and protocol. Expectations are set while undergoing training but not implemented or enforced on the floor.
good,Willis offered excellent training.  The Company culture is one of professionalism and Corporate growth.  They use top of the line programs and equipment in their offices.  The intranet has multiple excellent resources for information.
good,"This company offers good salarys, but there are limited Full time jobs, the rest are temporary and there is no job security, with that no benefits. I would recommend it if your only looking for a temporary job."
good,"The leadership day day by by day could of been sufficiently better. consider this was not a new company.  there could of better leadership within, especially when hiring back the second seasonal round of round of people who would of been willing to go back and wanted to go back"

Record keeping for IT deliveries. Railootoo (Rail ticketing Service) Looking after consumables and running of a number of on-site copiers / printers. Assisting in the Print Room as and when required.
good,"It’s a good company, however technical skills training are very limited and few. The company is focused more on consulting and is not invested much on technology skill upgrades for employees. The good with WTW are flexible benefits, flexible working arrangements as you can work from home once a week or during typhoons. Offices are located in BGC which is a good city to work in."
good,"Decent culture, nice people there, flexible hours, onsite canteen and Starbucks, salary poor for people outside of management but overall a decent place to work."
good,"Willis Towers Watson provides very thorough training for its call center representatives. It provided a lot of knowledge in regards to the functionality of employer sponsored benefits. However, 40 hours a week were not guaranteed and the schedule was inconsistent."
good,"The hardest part of my job was teaching the people faced to local carriers, the importance to have a good relationship with our clients and demonstrate the clients that we are the best in our job"
good,"	Creating Dashboards as per the requirements of the clients."
good,If you do your job effectively you will get a bonus. You will also better your chances of becoming full time as long as you come to work every day and be on time.
good,"Software Developer typical roles include customizing a proprietary .Net Application for Fortune 500 clients."
good,Die Ankündigung seine Arbeit gut im Rahmen der Arbeitszeit zu erledigen ist unrealistisch. Die Anforderungen und Erwartungen gehen weit drüber hinaus.
good,After 8 years I opted to secure improvement in my work life balance and resigned my position.  In the future I seek to become part of a vibrant team that serves puts clients ahead of corporation.
good,"I have learned a lot from working here - about Medicare, Health Reimbursement Arrangements, and the lack of quality employers treat their own retirees with (which is absolutely disgusting)."
good,Willis Towers Watson was a great experience. I learned and developed both technical as well personal skills. The San Francisco office works closely with offices on the East coast making deadlines challenging.
good,"On the phones, a typical call center. They give you nice pay for what you do. A lot of the rules are restrictive and their hiring process is a joke. It's a nice company to lose yourself in for a few months if need be."
good,I've learned so much at TW! The other business analysts I work with are a wealth of knowledge and provide much by way of support. The hardest part of this job was lack of training provided.
good,"Company is strong, global and diversified."
good,Working at Willis Towers Watson was a competitive and challenging work experience that I would recommend to anyone looking to be apart of a large company and participate in the healthcare industry.
good,"People are good"
good,"If you don't fit in with the click, you don't advance even if you are good at what you do."
good,"While the work was extremely stressful at times, it was great having awesome colleagues to provide support. My role required strong project management and communication skills and I could not have thrived without the support of my amazing coworkers."
good,"It depends on the role - if you are a consultant, i.e. working for a part of the company that is its core business, I think you will have a great career.  Working for any service department, e.g. HR, finance, IT etc. then regular merger activity has made these roles less appealing, as far as job security is concerned."
good,"Ahora mismo soy la única responsable de la centralita en la empresa. Me dedico a atender las llamadas, mails, visitas, reservar las salas de reuniones para que todo este bien organizado."
good,Answering inbound calls. Regarding annual enrollment. Assist Employees with enrolling into coverage or decline coverage.Solving problems that they needed help on.
good,My position was not sales related. I assisted the client-facing client service specialist. The volume of accounts and resultant paperwork to process was oppressive. Basically you trudge through your 100+ emails containing requests and FYIs.
good,This was a great place to intern and learn about the consulting field before fully getting involved. The work was very interesting and I felt that there was an impact that I was making.
good,The company has good benefits and a few perks.  Not a lot of advancement or monetary increases. The culture is cooperative and very professional.  Very nice office space to work in.  All office needs are supplied.  There is strong training and 2 annual reviews to let you know how you are meeting expectations and objectives.
good,"Large call center in Tempe, AZ handling mostly inbound calls from retiring employees transitioning from group insurance to Medicare.  Pay was on the lower end of call centers at $15 an hour.  This was a seasonal position  but a good work ethic and metrics can lead to a year round position."
good,Great company to work for.  The team I work on is very supportive and cohesive. The dress code is dress for your day.  Management is very encouraging and approachable.
good,"I learned a lot while there, good people who work there made the environment very friendly even for new employees. Work day is not too stressful, fair amount of work."
good,Mgmt is petty. Office drama throughout the entire call center and different departments. Management plays favorites and does not help growth. If someone is unmotivated they rather just fire the. Or keep them down then understanding the underlying issue and realizing its their fault for the lack of motivation.
good,"The best part of this job was the weekly pay. The hours are not as consistent, even if you request a certain time. The work environment can be relaxed, but can also be extremely busy with all of the phone calls. They give constructive criticism to help you improve on your calls and the training is thorough and easy to understand if you're paying attention. Unfortunately, if you are hired as a contractor, you can be doing all of the same work as the regular employees (sometimes more), but you do not get the same benefits or treatment. You can get let go at any given time, especially if they're not busy. It takes a long time for them to decide whether or not they can keep you on board as a regular associate, which stunts your growth within the company. It can be about 3+ years for you to get promoted, unless a lot of the team leads are quitting for better opportunities."
good,"Good place to work for freshers but not for experienced people as such, no great benefits as such available, worth being fr beginning years, HR not good"
good,"Workplace is an open setting and designed with a modern look.  "
good,"This is a good place to work, if you get the opportunity to become a permanent employee. Many positions start you as a temporary employee, and/or promotions are granted from within the company. They pay well but the benefits are sub-par. There isn't a high level of job security because the practice nepotism and favoritism. Everyone is always on their toes, worried they may be let go because, people are fired without notice or reason. One day you come to work and your security badge doesn't work. They pack your things carelessly in a box and mail them to you (or not). Management are all friends and in cahoots with each other (Think forming alliances for power and manipulation). There's a lot of pettiness and gossiping, and backstabbing, so beware! Employees are treated okay, with PTO , free food and drinks regularly, multiple office pantries, but that's all provided from corporate. The actual treatment you receive from superiors on-site boarders dehumanizing. Some people won't even look at you or use your name when speaking. HR may or may not help you."
good,"A typical day is speaking with customers all day reading disclaimers verbatim.  As, an Application Data Processor.  I enter information regarding applications for our customers.  I answer questions, if unable to assist customer conference in with the right department to make the customer feel comfortable, in most cases I stay on the line to assist."
good,"It was a nice place to work, however there was absolutely no job security and one day they basically laid everyone off after lying to us about it. Work wasnt too bad and training was nice. I would go back if I could."
good,"Because the company wants to reduce it's overhead in terms of real estate, employees get to work from home. This is a major benefit for most of the employees and managers especially those who's commute is longer than an hour by train. WTW does a great job of providing information and training to help employees succeed in their current roles but there is slim to no support for those employees who have demonstrated abilities that would qualify them for advancement. Managers have purposely held employees back from seeking roles within the company for personal reasons. Not much room or support for advancement."
good,"If you want to be a 9 to 5 type person, that is ok but you will not advance.  If you work hard, you might advance. Typical consulting envirnoment--be efficient, minimize errors, get in your billable hours."
good,very structured. not much room for advancement. Pay and benefits were good. Environment was very stifling. Company overcharged for many of its services.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are comfortable in you position.  While learning opportunities are plentiful, advancement can be a slower than desired."
good,"Each day is different and challenging, but goes by very quickly! Management pushes you to do your best work and learn as much as possible."
good,Good to start of your career but management must know to how to manage themselves. Knowledge transfer does not happen. Everyone is busy in pleasing the bosses.
good,"Interactive with multiple departments. Fluid policy changes and verbage with regards to direct customer scripting. ..Pleasant professionals to work near..Recent 6 months change in top local administration, suggests that more changes would be conducive for both customers and employees."
good,Company offered incentives to living will programs. i enjoyed a lot of these programs. Good 401k match and other benefits plans. It is a collaborative and multicultural work environment.
good,Uma empresa dinâmica e geradora de grandes oportunidades.
good,"great place to do work experience. definitely would consider working there after uni. however, didnt enjoy some of the things that i was learning. but very recommendable"
good,sehr nette Kollegen und auch hilfsbereit; umfangreiche Illusion in bAV
good,The company invests in the overall well-being of its colleagues / associates by supporting and sponsoring interests groups and wellness activities and programs.
good,"The office's friendly staff were the highlight of the experience at Willis Towers Watson. For entry-level employees, though, salary did not match the tradeoff in work-life balance that came with the job."
good,Good place to work. The pay could be better. Upward mobility could be difficult at times. The flexibility in work schedule is a plus with me. It's a good place to start a career.
good,"It is a nice place to work. Good work life balance. Great place to learn and expand your knowledge, Great team of people to work with. Currently undergoing a major change in management"
good,"I was hired as a temporary CSR for the fall enrollment. I liked that I could request very specific work times, although I often didn't get the shifts I asked for. Many reps, including myself, were on late shifts without alternation for months. The compensation was good, and benefits were offered, although for me, they were not affordable. This is a contracted position, so there wasn't any job security. Management was not great. Many of the team leads seemed annoyed to answer questions (besides one amazing, knowledgeable, helpful, and speedy team lead). The job culture was strange- there were a lot of work-inappropriate conversations that made the days uncomfortable. I was trained on one platform, then suddenly put on a very demanding client and had to relearn their healthcare plans. I left on good terms and was relieved to stop working there."
good,WTW is a great place to work.  It challenges me to do my best.  The most enjoyable park about my job is be able to put my own creativity into my work.
good,"Varied opportunities- mostly seasonal."
good,"O aprendizado e constante, pois hoje eu trabalho junto com Recurso Humanos, sendo assim a cada dia voce aprende situaçoes e trabalhos novos."
good,I loved my job at Willis Towers Watson. The only issue I had was that it was seasonal and the lay offs are not something with which I can build a solid stable foundation.
good,Its really a good company .Specially for female employees.Its an employee friendly company.Free lunches and sodexo food coupons.Working environment is good
good,A good place to work with a smart bunch of people who work there. Learning is great too and they carry out some really great work for their clients. Good balance.
good,Worked as a QA intern. Laid back work environment and friendly employees. Emphasis on working with a team in an agile environment. Professional and fun work environment.
good,"This is a good company to work for.  A fostering environment and promotes participation.  International company, so you interact with people around the globe."
good,"One Exchange is a fast paced environment during the AEP (Medicare  Annual Enrollment  Period).  When the season winds down the demand for seasonal employees also winds down.  The challenge is to maintain permanent status there."
good,Enjoyed helping the retirees with their health care needs. Did not enjoy the sitting all day long. Gained 20 pounds working two seasons.  Did not think the pay and bonus pay was all that great. Some managers were great and others not so good. Overall not a bad place to work as long as you know it is a seasonal position.
good,At Towers Watson I worked alongside my team leader who effectively taught me about the pensions industry as well as how to handle my own workload but to also work as a team. Frequent day courses to further my understanding of the industry were very educational.
good,It offers work life balance.  Not bad if you are looking for a settled life. Growth is slow. It takes time for getting promoted here. Company gives opportunity to showcase ur skills
good,Very smart people.  Good working environment.  Flexibility.  Compensation is competetive.  I really enjoyed working with the people there.  They are a joy to work with.
good,"I did an actuarial internship at Willis Towers Watson during the summer 2016. The program is very well-designed and supportive, and I had an amazing experience."
good,"I work with a lot of different people to ensure participants receive their pensions. I calculate the benefits, mail out the notices, confirm received paper work, and work with various banks to make sure payments were made. It is a great company, however, it is very quiet in the office and people don't talk to each other face to face."
good,"It's always a fast paced day with intense deadlines and demands working in the Real Estate Practice. I learn every day in the insurance industry. The Terrorism and Captive sectors are constantly emerging and must be kept up with. My team is the greatest group of people I ever had the pleasure to work with. Typical challenges working for a large global firm are difficult, but when a person can learn and achieve great success there is nothing more rewarding."
good,"Great place, with good work practices. I would recommend to anyone looking to get into the consulting business. I have had no issues"
good,"There is a spirit of team work, but you are also able to take ownership. The workload can be heavy, but you learn a lot very quickly, which adds to overall skills."
good,Everyone is nice. Systems very frequently malfunction. It's very hard dealing with benefits and listening to people's heartbreaking stories.
good,"My daily works included cooperating with MTRC administrators to assist the staff to do the survey by computer independently, monitoring the survey conducting atmosphere for objective results, and writing the report to the person-in-charge for the progress and giving significant suggestion"
good,"Answering switchboard, submitting food orders for meetings and assisting management by processing room reservations. I learned a great deal from Towers Watson for example I became very knowledgeable with the high call volume on the switchboard, placing food orders for the conference center through Aramark. Assisted my manager with maintaining food invoices and try to be cost effective when ordering food. My manager and assistant manager were extremely easy to get along with and we were like a little family. My co-workers were also extremely nice and we respected each other. The hardest part of the job was doing our yearly goals. At times it would be a bit of a challenge to think of a new goal for myself but after some brainstorming it would eventually work out. My department of co-workers was the best part of my job. They were friendly, caring and very supportive. They made it a very comfortable and positive environment to work in."
good,"Lockton is a great place to intern. The pay is not very competitive, but the work environment is a good learning experience on how full time workers spend their days in an office in Downtown Los Angeles. You are exposed to a wide variety of projects, as long as you continue to be available and ask for guidance."
good,I think management should be more transparent and honest when it comes to decisions that will affect employees.
good,"Good prospects and work ethic."
good,"Very eager to help you learn.  I did a lot of stuff at the job that involved learning and stuff.  I dont know why I have to submit this review twice, please stop requiring me to repeat myself indeed."
good,"Tijdelijk werk, dus vooral leerzaam. Was werkzaam via uitzendbureau."
good,People are all friendly and helpful. Emphasis on teamwork. Work together to ensure clients are getting paid out.
good,Learned about MS Outlook and SharePoint.
good,Good benefits and working conditions. I enjoyed working at this company.
good,Good company offering good benefits. Varied work role with chance to progress within the company.
good,"Great company to work for with lots of opportunities.  The work life balance could be better. There is an expectation that you will work long hours during the busy period, but teams tend to be under staffed year round causing work life balance to suffer."
good,"Excellent educational opportunities. Open seating with personal lockers. Wonderful, talented people to work with. All the latest in technology. Loved my job until RFP activity slowed to the point that my job position was eliminated."
good,They need to pay more and recognize great talent.  They also need to have paid time off.  They allow you to work from home which is good.  I love my shift 7-3:30pm.
good,My experience is based on trying to get regulatory change into the company and the balance between training staff and conducting business.  Still 10 years behind insurers and banks to understand what is really required.
good,"Good place to work,very talented people, but hard to move up and stuck in a legacy way of doing work.."
good,"The only way in to the service center is through a temporary agency. I began working for Willis Towers Watson in at the Pittsburgh branch. My experience there was amazing. The staff, and daily operations of the office always seemed to be on point. There seemed to be plenty of staff to assist, and enough work to go around. Not too much, and not too little. Fortunately, I was able to advance from a temporary staff member to a more full time role. At this time, Willis Towers Watson was expanding to Richardson, TX. along with Tempe AZ. I was able to relocate to the newly expanded Tempe AZ. location. Upon arrival the office was still under construction. Management in Tempe was clueless. After a few months there were several occasions where managers didn't know my name, and these were people I worked with closely. Overall the culture at Willis Towers Watson is one for people who work like machines. The company expresses little care for personal situations, and demands expectations are met regardless of what's happening to you."
good,It was a very challenging and rewarding inside sales position because the company focused on the quality of your consulting and not just achieving a sales quota each day.
good,"De modo geral trabalhar na Willis me trouxe maior conhecimento no ramo de seguros. Na equipe que eu estava não tinha grandes chances de crescimento e infelizmente lidávamos com o clássico só consegue que é amiguinho do chefe e por isso não havia companherismo, respeito , nem colaboração entre os membros da equipe, era cada um por si."
good,people are helpful
good,Willis ' culture was pervasive and was damaging the culture of Towers Watson.  Politics got in the way of doing what was right for the customer.  Still in flux.  Missing out on opportunities because to internally focused.
good,"Although they have a positive working environment it is difficult to obtain ""Permanent"" status. Many people work for 5+ Years without losing their ""Temporary"" status. That being said, their One Exchange (Medicare) branch is more focused on the well being of their participants/customers than any other for profit company I have come into contact with, or heard of."
good,"La cultura laboral está enfocada por todo el personal de la misma manera, hay un continuo apoyo entre compañeros y en momentos de estrés y dificultades hay  siempre compañeros para ayudarte. Estar a cargo de cuentas y clientes importantes hace esforzarte y dar llo mejor de ti, por lo que el aprendizaje adquirido es continuo."
good,"Oceniam firmę pozytywnie. W dziale Ubezpieczeń Osobowych mam określone codzienne obowiązki w zależności od danego okresu w miesiącu, dodatkowo bieżące zadania. Atmosfera w miejscu pracy jest pozytywna, kontakt z dyrekcją działu również."
good,"TW is a flat based organization meaning there is really no hierarchy or management which sometimes is great because you can get your work done and log off. On the flip side it creates a huge lack of communication when management doesn't have a thorough enough understanding of what their employees actually do on a daily basis, therefore making organizational based projects difficult or even impossible to complete."
good,"First thing the job environment is really very cool to work around. Peace of mind, only 8 hours working which is very best. Though the work burden is lil higher but the way the management handles things in very hazzel free. Work and life wise balance it is little difficult they should look in to the married womens need according to the work. Work from home option needs to be given. Second shift timings needs to b changed ."
good,This has been my first work after graduating. Work has provided challenges to me and exposed to the professional world. Challenges provided were significant.
good,"Good experience for an entry level job. Wasn't permitted to advance due to being so green to the industry. Only left due to this reason. Was a smaller brokerage at that time, which became WTW in acquisition."
good,Its like any other  call center job  ; you want to help the client on that one phone call. During the Open enrollment season 10/15-12/7  it gets extremely busy during that time but the day will go by  quickly.
good,The former Towers Perrin was a great place to work. After the company reorganized there many changes that were not conducive to the overall moral of the company.
good,I have been working for Willis for almost 7 years now. Have learnt a lot in this company. It has give me opportunities to develop myself. Also supportive line managers
good,"The company is more focused on shareholders than their employees. When I was working there, the work culture changed, the company took away benefits. I also learned that I was underpaid and the exam program is not as good as other companies. "
good,good place to work and flexible hours . work life balance is strictly implemented. Management is good but needs to be still improved .
good,"The work I did was incoming calls. Good supervisors, however the management I found to be lacking and little support after initial training period."
good,"WTW is now a large firm with many opportunities, but like most large companies suffers bureaucratic issues along with perhaps a higher staff turn over than most in some areas"
good,"This was an interim position so i was there for a short amount of time, but if you like doing busy work then this is the job for you."
good,Its a Nice Place to work and I enjoy the Knowledge they Provide in Medicare. Willis Towers Watson Is Amazing. The Application Data Input Specialist is responsible for the intake and processing of Medicare Enrollment applications. The Specialist works with the participant to accurately complete insurance applications while ensuring all government and insurance carrier compliance regulations are met.
good,"No two days are the same.  I work on various reports, presentations, billing and correspondence.  Periodically have receptionist responsibilities.  It's a nice variety of responsibilities."
good,I have had a great experience at Towers Watson.  I feel there are many opportunities for someone starting their career.  The work environment is great and I have made lasting friendships with my co-workers.  Work life balance is a struggle as is typical with most consulting firms.  I truly believe that Towers Watson is the market leader in pension consulting.  It is exciting to have access to intellectual capital from so many brilliant associates.
good,"As an intern, I was surprised at the level of responsibility and exposure provided to me. I was treated to be as much a part of the team as the permanent employees and was given a list of roughly 20 clients to liaise with, independently. Towers Watson values each employee and provides an environment of constant learning and opportunities of growth. Working on the client-front, every tomorrow was as challenging as required to keep monotony at bay."
good,"Good company to work for, great people, and they respect your culture and values."
good,"Willis Towers Watson has put a lot of time and effort to create an atmosphere and culture that helps bring the best out of their employees. They ask a lot from their associates, but reward those who work hard and put the time in"
good,Uma boa empresa com alguns aspectos a serem melhorados.
good,there was a good understanding that even though you had to work long hours people also had a family that was important to them personally so they understood if maybe you had to leave to watch a play or etc
good,Very good starting pay and point system but I went to another company and accepted a full time position because I was seasonal there.  The management was fair and always did something special for our team.
good,It's a great job and you learn so much. But it may be a little difficult to become a permanent employee. You can be seasonal for a long time there. But it's great.
good,"I have nothing negative to say about WTW - they gave me an opportunity out of university and I will be grateful for that. Management at WTW was always warm and understanding, work/life balance was fine - the job itself wasn't particularly challenging but still was an opportunity out of university."
good,"The company hires all employees through staffing agencies. Pay is considered competitive within the industry, but not for the metro area. Only pay increases are through advancement within the company. High turnover lack of pay increase and the company's dependence on staffing agencies."
good,"Healthcare plan doesn't compare to the market plan. No retirement plan offered. It is an excellent company to work for with global presence and over 30,000 employees. Proud to work in this company."
good,"It is a call center and during the open enrollment season, the phone rings constantly. Constantly moving desks. We didn't have enough Town Hall meetings with upper management. Initially, standards for hiring were almost non-existent.  But this was tightened up. I was there for just about 5 years. Not being able to advance was my biggest concern."
good,"I like working here, but it's a temporary position, I would like a permanent position, I'm very reliable,  work well with the public and learn quickly."
good,"The job was great, pay was average. It is seasonal unless offered a full time position. No benefits are required when seasonal, but you can get a monthly bonus."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Supervisor was good at giving time off for doctor visits and emergencies. Enjoyed working with clients help in them to assess their insurance needs. Enjoyed working with the different underwriters at the different companies getting my clients the best price for their insurance needs.
good,"Getting full-time status is very hard. Temporary employees do not qualify for most benefits. There are many employees that have worked for several years that have not been given full time status."
good,"There isn't much of an onboarding program for the company and you are kinda thrown into the deep end on stuff. They don't outline what is expected of you and it can really hurt you when the year end review comes around. Its busy work and you can learn a lot, but its hard to move up and excel more than others. And that's what they want, you to be better than others in order to advance. Great perks, flexible hours, nice people"
good,"Not that much growth for new employees,"
good,"Towers Watson is a great place to work at. If you are a peoples person than you will do great. As with an other job, you have your hectic days but overall its a decent job"
good,This is a workplace that has a lot to offer. Working with Willis helped me in learning things that I still use in my daily life. The co-employees were friendly and helped me out with my errands. But the stress-level was much as there was a lot of tasks to deal with. And the work used to pile up. Management tried to help but it was out-of-hand. Overall it was a good experience to work with Willis.
good,"Good place to start carrier , it what you make professional pay ok hours good and they're not strict unless you can't come to work on time you you'll be let go like any other job and they don't take excuses."
good,"I had the opportunity to work for a great team of folks.  The work environment and work load isn't bad.  There is heavy emphasis with work attendance which can make or break you as a contractor despite have great work quality.   Like in many corporate positions, there seems to be politically driven bias when pursuing other positions."
good,Long hours and best people in the world to work with. Company has changed over the years and hate I am no longer there. I have life long friends from this job.
good,"Fast paced yet a healthy competitive environment. In addition to working alongside with great peers, the management team was supportive and understanding,"
good,"always learning new things, very busy environment. Needed better team work between departments. Pretty healthy environment busy but not stressful. Non discrimantory"
good,Es una empresa que se encuentra en crecimiento y que se preocupa por realizar actividades que fomenten el buen ambiente laboral
good,"Fast paced environment. Quality rather than quantity emphasized in regards to inbound telephone calls. Company provided free beverages ie. coffee, tea, juice, soda etc  Good workplace environment and friendly co-workers."
good,"Challenging workplace with local and international clients and employees. With many benefits like: free taxi for OT rendered more than 3hrs, free fruits every Tuesday. With backup system not fully working for the team is so busy."
good,First call center and the teams do assist you a lot when you're stumped. Training on teaches you about the programs we use but not the actual interactions.
good,"Good management, environment, and culture. Rewarded for performing on the job. Great place to work helping medicare retirees and learn about Health Reimbursement accounts."
good,"While great with some things with its culture and how it takes care of its employees, Willis Towers Watson could do more to ensure employees will stay with them in the long run."
good,Willis Towers Watson is a growing company with immense opportunity to learn new skills. The remuneration is better as compared to others in the market and is based on your skills.
good,"Decent place to work. There is at least one activity per month that allows employees to socialize and feel appreciated, However, forcing temps to work for a year before being hired is unreasonable."
good,"Working at WillisTowers Watson, has been and environment of constant change. It needs a set of uniform policies that can be expanded company wide and not per division. Work life balance is good, atmosphere is good."
good,"Overall, great, dedicated colleagues and good work environment. Be prepared for high expectations and a wide range of duties requiring intermediate to advanced skills in MS Office and Adobe."
good,"I think cross skilling is very much effective and essential part in any field as it helps the employee to develop within himself. Also, helps the organisation to be cost effective."
good,"The company offers some great benefits,including a great pension and good flexible benefits. The working environment is very pleasant, hard working and productive."
good,"A great place to learn corporate environment and all the Microsoft package, office management, team training and the multiple softwares."
good,"Very work driven but good employee perks such as free coffee, tea, juice and soda.  Lots of employee engagement monthly outside of the office, however; needs to be more engagement with management and inter-team. Additional trainings and more structured training, i.e. can be improved."
good,"WTW es una empresa multinacional con grandes expectativas de crecimiento, donde se puede aprender mucho y conocer a grandes personas."
good,I enjoyed working here. Willis is a good option for married person as they get flexible shift timing. Overall a very good company
good,"Good management and co-workers.  "
good,"A typical day at work involves connecting with the customer. I greet and answer customer questions. While working at the Skydeck Gift Shop, I have learned that hard work really pays off because you can get promoted if you work hard enough. The co-workers are a pleasure to work with because we can learn from each other. The hardest part about the job would be the recovery of the store at times when there are large groups. However, the view of the city during the day or night makes working here enjoyable."
good,Working remotely for the most part I helped design surveys used by Fortune 500 HR departments.
good,Willis Towwrs Watson is a well know company and with a company size of more than 500 employees. Workplace is conducive and with worklife balance. With yearly sportsfest sponsored by the company.
good,"WTW is a great place to work for. The only problem is they don't offer benefits. Other than that, it's a place where u can grow as long as you apply yourself."
good,"It’s easy, diverse. Can be fast paced. The population is diverse. The point system is strict though and the supervisors are not helping all the time. Overall, I would recommend it"
good,Decent job with decent pay. It was a pretty well rounded job pretty regular. Nice people there and you must be a people person. You must have great communication skills and must get along with people. I do believe there’s a place for advancement but a lot of people go off loyalty and time spent with company.
good,"The work atmosphere is a bit stressful however the camaraderie with your peers makes up for it. It is a wonderful work environment where management really likes to help grow team bonding. However, the compensation is lacking. You are expected to work harder than you are compensated for. Another plus is great, affordable benefits and pension."
good,"That friends that I made here were wonderful. Everyone, with the exception of one or two managers, was a pleasure to work with. The workplace culture was very inclusive. I was challenged on a monthly basis to come up with something that would improve job productivity and efficiency."
good,Great opportunity for fresh graduate and for those PWD and PWA. they giving an opportunity to work and have a happy workplace and have a great team leader.
good,"This company is pretty good to work for. The benefits are a little lacking even though it’s a benefits outsourcing company. That said, the culture is good and they do offer a lot of extra little perks that makes it a great place to be."
good,Productive place to work. Strong culture for those starting out. Distinct business lines make it easy to Branch out one's knowledge base. Great place to build a career.
good,"What separated Willis Towers Watson from other employers was the team and managers I had the pleasure of working with and learning from over my tenure there. Work days were often busy, which meant they went fast, but our team was very committed, very strong and willing to help out when the workload was mounting and deadlines looming."
good,The instructor were great. they had patience and the greatest training skills.  They were always ready to answer your questions and aided in where to find the answers.  The work place was very relaxed and I got to work with some very nuce people. Management  was there when you needed them.
good,Company was great. Local office was toxic. There was a merger and the regional position I was working to earn went away. The growth path for me also went away.  I was then recruited to another opportunity.
good,"Nice location with a great view. Most enjoyable part of the position was my LOB, along with other staff I work with daily. The culture was laid back, and the dress code casual unless meeting with clients. The position I was in was cut. The salary was under the title and demographic guidelines recommended by Office Team, and Glassdoor."
good,"Pros:great company benefits with opportunities for growth"
good,"I loved being able to own a process and be curious to discover a way to make it better. It was something that I was able to be proud of. Bein apart of the Automatic Reimbursement process allowed me to know that I was making a difference in peoples lives by ensuring the data integrity that we were receiving was as accurate as possible. I learned to build relationships between teams, departments, and other companies. "
good,Great company to work for.  I'm leaving due to no growth or advancement opportunities within my own LOB (line of business).  Great culture with very professional group of people.
good,"I have a great manager and very good prospects for advancement, and I like my work.  But as a whole, the company culture is hierarchical and upper management seems to look down upon lower level workers. I don't feel a great sense of community at the organization level.  Salaries fair but not above average, benefits are below average."
good,"I had a typical work life at Willis, with day rotational shifts and usually had overtime working hours. I learned a lot about Insurance especially major in the transportation business - Marine (Hull and Cargo). The culture at Willis was good and positive."
good,"It's a great company once you get past the probationary contracting positions. Unfortunately, as a contractor, you get what is left for the shifts, if a contractor becomes an employee for WWW and you are in the shift you have worked, you will be changed if they want that shift."
good,gut:
good,"Excellent place to get feet wet in practice. Practice makes an effort to get team together and be familiar with practice and trends. Although some improvements in communications could be made, overall, great place to work."
good,"The USP of WTW is that they have encourage a work life balance. However the wages / salary are too low for the amount of work done."
good,"A good place to be if you want to be innovative and to work in a professional company. WTW is very professional and efficient. Management was good but may be too hands off, but you can always seek for your manager to be more hands on. Feels like you can take control of your career more here and WTW does a good job empowering you to do so."
good,"This organization thrives on quality workers and going the extra mile.  If you are someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment and is a good team player, this is the place for you.  Tough work-life balance though."
good,"Great work enviornment! It is a great company to begin a career with, and there are areas to improve. I have learned and grown with this company, and am ready to move forward and find my next challenge."
good,"I really love Willis Towers Watson OneExchange and love the supervisors and managers, however, the lack of Job Security is scary at times since once the season ends people start getting laid off. IT is very competitive and could be a lasting job but when you have a family to take care its a little scary since majority of positions are seasonal."
good,WTW is your typical consulting firm. Stressful billable hours based culture on the consulting side. More relaxed productivity based culture on the corporate side.
good,"Overall, WTW is a great company to work for.  There is a lot of opportunity for advancement once you get your foot in the door.  Working in an Operations division such as the Certificate Center is a good way to break into the commercial insurance industry, but the job is definitely challenging.  It is a fast paced, production environment with high standards of quality and timeliness that some find challenging to meet."
good,"You need to be a multi tasker."

good,This place pays gret. The bonus has went down for this year from 700 to 400 now 450 if you do HealthCare/ IFP/ Access. Employees are great just depends on who your around. Sometimes there are more chiefs than Indians. Do not go to IFP at the last minute because you will receive no training and will be thrown to the wolves.
good,Big multinational company with its pros and cons. Really nice co-workers and great team spirit. Truly global and international company.
good,A temporary job for two months.  Lots of communication between different people.  Hard sitting for eight hours a day with a low call volume though.  I wasn't on a busy client.
good,"TW is okay for entry level, I tried to move out of the call center and my new job was outsourced. If your okay with staying in the same dept and not much option for change this may be a good fit for you."
good,"Working for the Risk and Financial Services department was fun and rewarding. I was extremely happy to become involved in the invoice of client needs once services were rendered. Oracle database was the driving force of our billing concepts. "

good,Work with our cash application team on unapplied cash. Work with account directors and project managers on their active accounts to ensure accuracy. Verify contract terms.
good,I am enjoying working here as this is the best company I have worked so far and paying well.  Management is good and the exposure to connect with onshore is a very attractive part.
good,"Das Betriebsklima ist gut, die Kollegen sind nett. Natürlich gibt es hier und da auch immer etwas zu beanstanden, wie z.B. den/die ein oder andere(n) Vorgesetzte(n), aber im großen und ganzen bin ich mit meinem Arbeitgeber sehr zufrieden!"
good,Pay raises to start are very low. Barely beats the pay you get with overtime when you switch to salary. People are great there. How the keep ppl when the pay is lower is surprising. Fun place to work.
good,"I will keep all opinions to myself, can't trust people who comment on other people or organization when they are not present to defend themselves."
good,"Fast paced, team work type environment. "
good,"Overall good place to work, compensation not really competitive. You will learn a lot. A wealth of educated and experienced colleagues. Great flexibility, cool work/life balance. Would definitely recommend if you are entering into the professional realm (perhaps an intern), this would actually be above average for a career start."
good,"A good company with great potential. A lot of great things the company can bring to someone, as well as a lot of opportunities the company can grow in."
good,A lot of change in the company in structure.  At times it has been difficult to fully understand the end goal.  People are nice and the overall culture is good.  I enjoyed the work/life balance that was afforded me.
good,"You could do worse than WTW and you could do better. Some teams are phenomenal and would be 4/5 or 5/5 stars. Most aren't and that means that even if your team is amazing, you work with other people who are not great. Some of them are down right terrible."
good,It was a good job after high school. I learned a lot about customer service and computer skills.  I became more comfortable talking to new people.  It's an easy company to advance in and get better at your job.
good,"I've learned a lot during my time in the retirement practice and got exposure to different projects that helped augment my understanding of the industry. "
good,"In all fairness, I left Towers Watson before it became Willis Towers Watson, so I have not experienced work/life since the company was bought by English-based Willis.  It may be a very different company today."
good,"WTW is a great place to work mainly because of the people - everyone is very open regardless of level and willing to collaborate on projects. Workplace culture is mostly friendly, but the consulting environment does require you to put in long hours occasionally. Very flexible in terms of PTO, great benefits."
good,"The team and management structure was constantly in flux. The people I worked with were friendly and the environment was nice. However, the office was set up to be very micro-managed (i.e. half-cubes with one person looking over the shoulder of the person in-front of them."
good,Multinational company. Very policy led. Very thorough and supportive. Great benefits. Difficult application process. Opportunities to progress. Great Team
good,"Great colleagues, supportive leadership, nice office atmosphere, fun events, work is challenging and it gets busy - it’s not a 9-5,  you have to love what you do. remote work and flexible hours."
good,Excellent company to work for.  There is always something new to learn. One is never bored. Workplace atmosphere is collaborative and one can always find someone to reach out to for assistance.
good,"Awesome place to work!!! I learned very much working here. Team work is great!!!! I've had a positive experience here. Unfortunately, it's been difficult for me to transition into different roles- that's why I'm looking for an opportunity elsewhere.Able to meet and speak to many great individuals throughout my work day. Always giving having positive outlooks on the day."
good,"This job is very serious. There isn't much job security at first, however if you apply yourself and work hard, there is room for advancement. This company is growing rapidly with more and more positions available."
good,"Like a typical growing organization, WTW is trying to do a lot without aligning to one goal and objectives. This in turn is creating a lot of confusion and unrest amongst the people."
good,"Strong alignment t our values. Much focus on clients and businesses. Healthy lifestyle focus and flexible working hours, benefit employees with family members."
good,"Set up applications, read emails, take calls."
good,"Enjoyable, always changing, keeps you on your toes. Only true downside in my opinion is the ""seasonality"" of the work. being seasonal it makes it difficult to be hired on ""permanent"" and gain full benefits, even if you have been here for a few years you can still be considered temporary/seasonal. "
good,"I enjoy working with the people who they have hired. Everyone is very caring and fun. I have learned a lot about customer service, the insurance world, and how to manage my time. The hardest part of the job is being at my desk for 8-9 hours a day repeating the same thing over and over. The most enjoyable part is being able to help members understand their benefits and be able to get their claim issues resolved."
good,"For the most part this is a good place to work. The pay is nice, and it goes up each season you come back on. They try to keep it professional to a fault. Some times you may feel like a robot. Other times, like training, it can be fun."
good,I most valued the commitment to training employees to prepare them for the difficult customer service work required.  They level of commitment to their clients was excellent!
good,"Good work life balance good management, good working hours, pick u and drop facility is good, incentive are great. Convenient location close from station"
good,"I start with creating a ""To do list"" for the day and work accordingly to manage the tasks on time. I have learned how to manage my work with efficiency and effectively. We discuss our challenges with managers to ease the work. People are very friendly and helpful around the floor. There are times when we share our work to deliver the task on meet our TATs. Management is friendly professionally and personally too. We discuss our achievement and feedback every month to increase the quality of work we deliver. Hardest part of this job is shifts. However, we enjoy at fullest while working as we have fun activities on floor every month. Also, to encourage the employees we have rewards and reorganization sessions every month."
good,"Willis Towers Watson is great place to work. You will learn a lot about the healthcare world. Management in my experience was poor. There was no support and if you were really good at your job they would not let grow and move to another position. "
good,Great place to work with seasonal employees in all aspects of the benefits world. The company was great for promotions within each department. The training and guidance that was placed upon each associate in order to service the customers was beneficial and knowledgeable.
good,Willis is a good place to Work....Very few opportunities are given here to employees. Management are very helpful to their employees.
good,"In meiner jetzigen Tätigkeit unterstütze ich der Geschäftsleitung und das International Consulting Team bei Budgetplanung und Steuerung von Projekten. Ich bin unter anderem für die Projektabrechnungen, Rechnungsprüfung, Reisekostenabrechnung und Reisebuchungen zuständig. "
good,A dynamic workplace that stretches your abilities and encourages growth and development. Supportive colleagues too.
good,"Vey good company to work for however there is rare job advancement."
good,Empathetic managment and very nice people working in the office.
good,"Your workday started with reading and replying bunch of emails from internal team members from different offices all over the world and the external clients. How to manage big projects cross countries and work with people from different culture under tight timeline is challenging but exciting. The enjoyable part of the job is you will never be bored with the job as the clients is various from project from project; in the other side, this also required you to lean fast and be flexible and capable to solve problems. Fortunately, you are not working alone, most of the time, great team work will make all the challenges solved smoothly. Overall great work experience in Towers Watson."
good,I enjoyed going to work every day because of my co-workers. Everyone was always willing to stop what they are doing to help each other. We always had a team spirit type atmosphere in order to get the job done. It made for a very pleasant working experience.
good,"While I can only speak about the White Plains location, my time at Towers Watson has been fulfilling and productive. Unfortunately, advancement opportunities are few and far between, and the day-to-day work is rote and uninspiring."
good,"This employer provides excellent benefits  and pay, and also allow for the possibility to work from home."
good,"Very good experience overall. "
good,"As a former employee of the company, I do not feel that it is in my best interest to post information regarding my time spent there; I was there for ten plus years, so you can draw your own conclusions with this information."
good,"Entreprise ou les compétences individuelles sont reconnues et valorisées. "
good,"Emphasis on culture, inclusiveness and innovation.  If you enjoy working with a company where creative problem-solving is valued, then this is the company for you."
good,Nothing to share at this time thank you. No tips everyone will see what a great experience they have if they like the call center atmosphere. Maybe they will love it.
good,"Willis Towers Watson prides themselves on their successful, long time reputation and as a result runs a very strict operation that encompasses high security regulations. "
good,good training and lots of activities. fun art work. Good team spirit. team activities. Group activities. Lots of learning. Good for females with good salary package. Slow growth.
good,is great for seasonal jobs good starter job with good pay very professional and a friendly supervisor staff not as invested in teaching the agent better ways to do job but hey its seasonal
good,Overall good company to work for. Upper leadership doesn't always listen to lower level management and makes decisions without crucial input of those in the weeds.
good,I really enjoy working for such a nice company. Great place to work. Work from home in most departments. Lots of engagement. Opportunities to grow. Enjoyable.
good,"and/or health and welfare plans "
good,"Worked here for 6.5years and never felt like leaving this company, but had to due to relocation. Work life balance made up for slightly less remuneration compared to market."
good,"lovely place, lovely people, nice facilities, nice all round"
good,"Nice place to work, learned a lot about insurance and investments. Time went very quickly. Left when I moved to Cookeville. Very helpful co-workers, boss was understanding"

good,"Fun working environment"
good,The company went through severl changes while I worked there.
good,"Challenging work environment dealing with complex issues related to helping client employees (e.g., Amazon) choose benefits for the year. Unfortunately, a serious accident rendered me unable to continue with employment there."
good,Professional people. Good working environment. Closer to downtown Toronto. Good paying job. Lot of retirement benefits for permanent employees. chances of growth.
good,"great place to work. job can be a bit stressful dealing with retirees but the environment of the call enter itself was worth it. also slightly stressful as its labeled seasonal and most people are EOA'd at the end of open enrolment, fun activities, team building, luncheons, pay raises, tangible incentives ( I won a tablet once) monthly bonuses based on metrics. overall a good company to work, this was my first call center job and I lasted 3 years straight through. never EOA'd and made it to a permanent position."
good,"Great place to work ,excellent working culture and team ethos. Team grew rapidly in my time there but still felt like a tight knit team, all down very good management team."
good,"- client interaction form various industries"
good,"Great people with the added bonus of being around people who are willing to share knowledge and help out which is always a plus, a relaxed working environment to boot."
good,"The Denver office has a great team mentality, with a lot of laid back very bright individuals. The pace is high but the stress is usually kept pretty low through encouraging management and flexibility, so long as the work is getting done."
good,very laid back work place. poor management. Low call volume with really no call handle time.  Unexperienced supervisors and poor call center floor management. Very loud on floor and hot.
good,"Willis Towers and Watson as a whole is a little laid back in policies, but good work habits can be formed there. The company would still allowed your personality to shine through."
good,"Great Workplace, Great People"
good,"High volume of inbound calls, but you are adequately trained on each client you service. If you work hard, you can advance if you show interest in it."
good,"A great place for furthering your insurance career."
good,This was an enjoyable place to work. All of the staff and management were excellent to work with. They were always accommodating with scheduling for family obligations etc.
good,overall the environment was enjoyable. coworkers were nice. the system could use a bit of work. a very diverse environment with a very nice coffee machine.
good,"WTW gives you the opportunity to grow and contribute your skills in a meaningful way to help clients every day. You can consistently deliver outstanding work, and your skills improve regularly as a result. It can be very demanding but is well worth it depending on where you are in your career and life."
good,"I worked at WTW a couple of seasons back, and while i really enjoyed the people i worked with, i did not enjoy dealing with the customer base.I found it very difficult dealing with callers during the time i worked there, and i've worked in several Healthcare based call centers before.You really have to watch how you say things to an older demographic, which can make it somewhat difficult to communicate with callers. but if you can get past that hurdle, amazing place to work. No benefits for seasonal pay, but  consistent steady hours, and great work enviorment with both supervisors and other employees,"
good,Willis has great employees and plenty of space to grow. Laid back atmosphere. And a great team of people always willing to help. I would love to grow in the company and make it a career.
good,We have great learning and opportunities in willis. People are given additional tasks apart from their daily deliverables to enhance skills and individual development. There is a great work life balance.
good,"I learned how It is important to be clear on what I want to achieve in my professional career so I can take charge in reaching it and making your supervisor/ manager an accountability partner to receive the much needed boost and support."
good,"They provided excellent training, compensation and work enviorment. Paid for my insurance license. The problem is its seasonal work that starts in July and ends in December.  There is very little opportunity for full time employment. Although they do continue to rehire."
good,"WTW has very good people, but are understaffed at many positions making the environment very fast-paced and stressful.  Despite this, WTW has a strong management core.  Due to client demands, it seems that every task is a priority, which in effect means nothing is.  The most difficult aspect of the job is the overwhelming sense that you are always behind, regardless of the number of hours put in.  The most satisfying part of the job is the interaction with your peers.  Everyone is happy to help each other."
good,"Management is good. They give learning opportunity and willing to assist everyone."
good,Willis Towers Watson treats me well. I have been here for over 6 happy years and I find many aspects of it very rewarding. Open enrollments are definitely very busy days and management usually finds ways of rewarding the staff during this busy time.
good,Willis has had 3 mergers in the last 4 years creating many opportunities for jobs and upward movement. They are a forward thinking company that is willing to listen to their employees.
good,"This was my first job. Loved it because they were so used to training newbies. I was a temp for the Medicare season but while I was there I was constantly learning. The managements was always there to hear you out if you needed anything or had any questions. The office was lenient in a good way, smart casual but we were always informed if we needed to dress up a notch for client visits. The hardest part of my job was when having to break bad news. The best part of my job was always being thanked for my hard work at the end of every call, the elderly sometimes feel that they are taken for granted but as a trainee we're we taught that we were they're advocates."
good,Towers Watson was a good place to work and the people there were fantastic.  If I had anything negative to say about the place is their training could have been better.  Also the support.  If you had a question you asked it on Instant messenger.  That manager might be talking to five other people at the same time and you really did not know when she or he was talking to you.
good,"As an intern, I was expected to jump on any open projects with teams that needed the most help. The managers were very open to suggestions about making the program better and the company focuses on individual growth and team effort."
good,The company is going through the process of combining Willis and Towers Watson together.  While this has been going on for some time the culture has not been set yet.
good,The Work environment at Willis is one of the best I have ever been with. Schedule and work are consistent and fair. Opportunities were always give equally to every member of the service desk.
good,"Quick pace, good benefits with a generally respectful culture. Typical day for me include meetings, working on ""sprint tasks"" and cases. "
good,"One thing I did not like about this company was its a seasonal position,to be considered for a full time position you had to be there for over a year."
good,"I worked in office services, so it wasn't bad, but the analysts worked pretty hard and were always busy and under pressure to produce work for clients. They seemed to hire a lot of new grads from their internship program."
good,"Willis Towers Watson (WTW) is a good employer to work for with good benefits and perks for full time employees. The work here as a BA is intense, however you are also given the flexibility of working from home if needed."
good,"Willis Towers Watson offers excellent resources, technology and intellectual capital in support of serving their clients.  Top tier consulting firm, and a good place to work."
good,I started here in 1997 and was given a lot of room to grow and advance my career.  I was Mentored by a great Team Leader and Manager which lead to a great deal of professional growth for me.  When the market got bad the company execs. thought it best to sell off the IT side of the business every thing went downhill from there.
good,"This is a nice place to work, the managers work with you to better yourself at the company. Sometimes the clients get rambunctious but they train you on how to handle the upset client."
good,Willis Towers Watson is an organisation which provides good work life balance to all its employees.Beneficial to women as majority of employees are women - women friendly environment.
good,"A typical day at Willis Towers Watson required my colleagues and I to analyze and manipulate data from over 1000 fortune companies. I learned how to use Microsoft excel, outlook, and access extensively. Additionally, I was able to experience a closer look on how to work with clients in order to satisfy their experience with Willis Towers Watson. The management was very flexible as old interns, and current employees were always available to give helpful feedback. The workplace culture was full of employees that are a similar age to mine and everyone was able to get along well. The hardest part of the job was taking on big companies as analyzing their data took almost a full day of work. As well as, dealing with some clients on the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have flexible hours throughout the week. Whereas one day you could only squeeze in six hours, the next you were able to make up for that and work ten hours."
good,"High expectations, long hours, but really fun people to work with.  Flexible schedule, lots of perks like free coffee, popcorn, oatmeal, soda.  Small company feel at a large corporation."
good,"Responsible for local/global account management service with commercial lines services, such as endorsements, billing, marketing, placement, quoting, data entry, audits, policy checks, etc...."
good,Expanding organization with recent merger of consulting capabilities and brokerage capabilities of combined companies.  Unique opportunities for growth and talent development within majority of their areas of focus and practice specialties.  Very talented leadership and vision. Quality of culture to be determined with the combining of the two companies and their unique backgrounds.
good,My Overall experience with WTW is Great. I would say Management has always ensured to make WTW a Great place to work and from time to time taken employee feedback on ways in which they can improve on the facilities given.
good,"The job was stressful at times, due to retirees frustration transitioning into Medicare. It was also very rewarding being able to assist and help retirees and even help them save money with Supplemental and Prescription Drug plans that Medicare offers."
good,"Besides the attendance point system, this is one of the more lenient call center to work at. They book a food truck every other day and all shifts are M-F."
good,"If I wasn't relocating, I would absolutely stay in my present position.  I love my clients, I love the producer I work with, and feel that I work in a very rewarding position."
good,Great place to work. Location is in heart of Chicago. Lots of transportation options available. Fun and great place to get internship at and start the career.
good,Strong senior leadership sets the tone for culture of hard workers.  Many opportunities for advancement for those who know how to build strong relationships with their teams.

good,"Very good company to be associated with. "
good,There was always someone willing to help with a question or concern that someone had.  They also provided great lunch and bonuses.
good,"Personally enjoyed the team I worked for, however I did notice that managers were not that keen to help employees progress - they would much rather keep the employees to themselves! Very friendly and comfortable place to work though."
good,Towers Watson is a great firm to work for. People are really nice and they have a great firm culture which creates a good working environment.
good,Meeting different people and the call flows is great and very flexible with your time and how you handle different situations to assist you at all times
good,"Working at Towers Watson was like any job, a typical day at work. I've learned how to protect the brand by learning and exercising protocol."
good,"I enjoy everyone I work with and everyone is overly friendly (almost too friendly). I think where this job lost me was how everyone comes in as a contractor and they will extend your contract indefinitely in order to prevent making you a permanent employee.  This prevents you from getting a pay increase as well as benefits. "
good,"•	Creating a new change over schema on the production databases. Was involved in the Quality Assurance (QA) and the Enterprise Change Management (CM) as well."
good,"even though i only worked there as a intern for one semester, but i love the company culture"
good,"Provide administrative services for employers and additional associates with group insurance policies via inbound calls. Organize, explain and manage several employer based insurance programs. Review and explain benefits with customers and employers."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking responding to emails, checking in with Consultants to get an idea of their anticipated day. Attending meetings and working on various assigments and projects."
good,"I am the product owner of the Dependent Review Solutions team. This includes all operational, personnel, sales and financial aspects of this part of the organization. I work virtually and manage teams in Minneapolis, San Diego and Manila (Philippines). One of my favorite parts of this and any other position I have held is the day-to-day interactions with others. I enjoy leading teams and strategizing with all team members to improve processes, improve morale, make customer experiences even greater and increase quality."

good,I really enjoyed my time with WTW. The Management teams were awesome and they always made themselves available. I got along nicely with everyone. One of the best work experiences I’ve had. Would love to work for WTW again.
good,"A good place to work but you   must be willing to reach out to others to learn what needs to be done to be successful.  Great diverse staff and most people are really pleasant; however, the lack of staff equated for long work days."
good,Unfortunately I worked my up to Supervisor to be let go because of my managers incompetence in correcting my goals. I did the best I could with what I had.
good,At Willis Towers Watson I felt like my knowledge and education was a priority. The company puts a strong emphasis on training employees and giving them the time necessary to achieve certifications.
good,Good place to get customer service experience. It's a good job for young people just leaving high school or college. Perfect for anyone needing call center experience on their resume.
good,"The management is supportive of its employees and knows that we, as resources, are the best asset they have in the company.  There are activities that promote teamwork and making sure that employees know that they are appreciated(e.g. buffet lunch, coffee table sessions, service awards, etc)"
good,"good work atmosphere, helpful managers, supportive and approachable. employee friendly. opportunity to grow and learn at the entry level.overall a great place to work"
good,Willis has 8 hour shifts and work is BAU. As a Team Leader I see operational projects as well. It is trying to move and become a more technology friendly company and use ODP in the process operations.
good,Great Work place. company has strong values and goals. great employees who are willing to assist and share their own knowledge on the matter.  you learn a lot.
good,I have worked 3 Medicare Annual Enrollment Period seasons for this company.  Each year I learn something new.  My supervisors and colleagues were supportive.  I love working here.
good,I had a very long and productive career in WTW. The company truly lives up to its values and the people within are amazingly talented - it was always the people that kept me there - at all levels. The culture is about excellence and client service.
good,"Long hours, unfair initial promotions, promises that it is ""worth it"" eventually. There is plenty of opportunity to develop skills and chances to find what it is you'd like to do."
good,"Working as a consultant in Insurance Management Consulting. Participated in projects including:"
good,"I've only worked here for a short time but I like most of the people. Everyone is willing to help and talk. I'm leaving because of difference with my manager but am hoping to stay within the company."
good,"Nice Place to work.  I would recommend it to anyone entering the commercial insurance industry.  Good Benefits and work/life consideration.  As with any organization, there are areas of opportunity."
good,Work was usually able to be completed in an 8 hour day. I was given a lot of help by senior co-workers. The worst thing about the job was the pay by far either than that everything was great.
good,Good organization culture and work atmosphere. Co workers are good. Opportunity to learn about Compensation & Benefits practices. There should be more diversity
good,"Good company overall. You need to be in charge of you. Set boundaries that accommodate your work-life balance, but still allow you to put in some extra work when it's needed. Negotiate your salary before accepting a position. As the reward structure is not super flexible to bend for special cases. There can be a lot of opportunities if you are motivated for additional challenges. Those opportunities don't come with reward - the reward comes later."
good,"Towers Watson is a large consulting organization with a ""client first"" mentality that also offers flexibility and a range of career opportunities for employees. A typical day in the Communications practice includes a mix of emailing with internal and client teams to manage an average of 3-6 projects; and drafting or editing client deliverables ranging from content for company benefit websites, brochures, emails, posters/postcards, etc. While career advancement is mainly in the hands of individuals, senior leaders are typically supportive of your career goals and interests and developing your skills. While the cyclical workload can be frustrating (swamped during certain months, looking for work the next), the people and the collaborative environment make it a great place to work."
good,"great company to work for. no benefits tho........"
good,"Not a lot changes -- and changes always seem to take a long time.  All in all, a good company to work for."
good,"Professional, collaborative culture.  Senior Leaders truly care about employees and go out of their way to ensure the population is engaged."
good,"I enjoyed working here. it took 4 years to be hired permanently and receive benefits. Once this happened everything was great. I would still be working had I not had to move. "
good,"It was only a work-study job during my high school years, but it was a quiet environment to work on file scanning, calculations, doing benefit datas, refiling, and mailing & printing for Memorial Hermann and SYSCO."
good,Great place to work. Great support from managers and team. Company makes sure that you take all of your certifications and pay for your appointments. Customer service at it's best.
good,"1. i am working as an Account Manager of Chinese business in WTW,  my jobe is always connect with our clients and collect data and provide the most basic data materials to our head office for qoutation;"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning.I felt the leadership team was great as well. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections"
good,"My works usually start with workload management, after that I can work on with the task the entire day at my own pace. The workplace is very harmonious and most of my colleagues are friendly and easy to work with. I am working with UK clients and we communicate through email, chat and weekly call. Since we are working for UK clients we are working from 1pm to 10pm."
good,I started here to get a grip on the cost of living; it paid great! They paid for me to get my health and life insurance license and I worked FT hours at a competitive pay. I started as a benefit advisor and later stepped to customer service for a less stressful environment (in my opinion) during my pregnancy. The ONLY negative thing was they will hire you as a temporary employee and keep you in that status as long as they can before making you permanent. This was a problem for me because I needed health insurance to apply for nursing school and I just flat out needed insurance for myself.
good,Good place to work. The work environment is really good. Groomed myself in terms of presentations and public speaking because of Willis Towers Watson.
good,A very organized company where you can grow as an individual as well as become an exceptional employee. They offer a ton of training  classes through SharePoint. They meet your needs as an employer. They provide WFH possibilities in case of a family emergency.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my time at Towers Watson was the people. I had not only co-workers, but friends. The job varied day to day but was very motivating. Recognition was given when something was accomplished and I always felt appreciated."
good,"Being a Corporate risk and broking Analyst, our clients have high expectations on us, we work not just one process but more than one we are all cross-trained for business continuity it’s like 1 employee can be 3 persons because of 3 diffrent process the he or she knows,we do multitasking, we need to meet the targets in a day, management are very friendly and approachable, we do have “wacky wednesday and fun friday” where in an hour is alotted to have bonding with different games. Hardest part that i encounter was when you lack sleep in the morning but you have a lot of workloads to finish at night you have to take a lot of coffee to wake you up on the day where in you are assigned to be the multitasker where in you work your assigned tasks and the tasks of others too that needs help,as well you have to train your new teammates ,do the reporting,assigned task to your co workers. Sounds a lot but you can’t feel the stress because it’s just like your playing if you’re having fun and you love what you’re doing."
good,"The merger changed some things, but it used to be a great place to work.  Fast-paced with a learning environment.  We had an amazing reputation for really knowing our jobs and presenting well to our clients.  Awesome management and room to grow."
good,"Willis Towers Watson is a employee-focused company, given its background as an HR consulting firm. The benefits are excellent, and the work environment is both flexible and engaging."
good,"Much better than big 4 in terms of development and work life balance. People are friendly, there's always a great social scene. Flat structure, wouldn recommend"
good,"Working at Willis Towers Watson OneExchange was a great way for me to earn money fast. Working as an ADP wasn't stressful and training was adequate and easy to catch on to. I made some great friends and loved the positive, encouraging environment there!"
good,"Friendly people, cooperative work atmosphere. Supportive leadership. I've worked in 4 different groups and each one was better than the last. Workplace culture is very positive."
good,"I enjoy what I do. Managers are very helpful , respect others space , and involved. I enjoy that they work with my everyday schedule , over time is offered when necessary."
good,"Everyone is punctually and dynamic. A day of work starts with short catch-up then straight to working on daily tasks. "
good,"Typical day at work is answer phones and set up meetings for the conference rooms and order lunch if needed.  the workplace culture is very diverse. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great co workers, the hardest part is dealing with rude people."
good,"Typical day at work fast pace. Always learning new things. "
good,It's ok.  People are nice.  The computers and monitor setup is top notch.  The gym facilities in the workplace are ideal.  The multiple restaurants within walking distance make it convenient for lunches.
good,"It was a great company, with a great environment, just not much room for growth and lack of work. Which brings me here to find a new opportunity. Always looking for new experiences."
good,"On a typical day, I will lead client and internal calls to discuss system requirements, ongoing issues or future enhancements needed for a particular project. Internal calls are used to check the status on the team, status on project items and to mainly assess if we need a plan B. I've learned that using your resources is key to the role. Communication and documentation are the strongest values to be a successful business analyst. The hardest part of my job can be juggling 5 different projects but communicating and consistently documenting my status on project items definitely help. The most enjoyable part of my job is breaking the system! That way I know it's been tested."
good,Job was ok.  Not long enough assignment.  Management was cold.  A bit all over the place.  The pay was good considering little training.  I would work there again if giving the opportunity.
good,"No camaraderie, would not recommend this job, Easy location to get to. Not people focussed. Long hours. No support from management in performing tasks,"
good,"The work environment is awesome.  Great people to work with, flexibility with schedule.  The hardest part is when the season ends."
good,"The companies environment is awesome, the individuals that you work with are knowledgable, and the companies provides weekly pick me up snacks. Unfortunately, individual management is hit or miss. The manager on my team liked to micro-manage and provide negative feedback constantly."
good,"this call center was the easiest place ive worked at, before open enrollment the wait time in between calls was almost an hr, i would take about 6 calls a day, great schedule mon-fri with no nights. Calls would be mostly to set appointments for open enrollment season, to get their reimbursements phones or transfers to the insurance company. free coffee in the breakrooms. dowside was management, it's so bad. supervisors refuse to take sup calls which only makes the members angry, and if you had a question they would all give you different answers. also they had no benefits or PTO"
good,As my experience at Willis Towers Watson was not for long I enjoyed shadowing the staff there and found their work place culture was very professional.
good,"When I worked for Willis Towers Watson as a Customer Service, Funding, and Applications Customer Service Representative, every day was total fulfillment, Everyday was an opportunity to meet and exceed my customer's expectations."
good,"Great worklife balance , great people to work with, and great culture."
good,All we did was sit around and answer calls then collect the paycheck. the pay was good $900 at the most . it was very manageable when i was working there.
good,"Great place  to work. Very busy working days dealing with clients enquires via email or phone, very friendly and helpful team, right place to learn a lot about the industry"
good,"Learned a lot about Medicare. Great work life balance."
good,Very good company to work for. Relaxed environment. The employees are very knowlegdable of the insurance industry.  Can be very fast paced depending on the time of year.
good,"My stint in Willis Towers Watson has greatly enhanced my management and leadership skills. I worked with a great roster of individuals (Manual, Automation and Performance Testers). I was also given an opportunity to work in the UK in order to support our project deliverables. If given another opportunity, I would love to work for this organization again."
good,It was a good place to work but taking over 4 years to become permanent was not worth the pay or the rude customers I dealt with on  daily basis. Several customers are nice and thoughtful others just are not worth the stress they put on you to be a robot.
good,Very fast paced but friendly. A lot of job opportunities and great way to interact with other co workers. Very caring company and everyone always has a smile on their face.
good,"nice place to work in, lots of seasonal jobs, options to work in different positions through out the season, great leadership management, nice environment."
good,"Relaxed and Balanced work."
good,I loved working here. Everyone is always so friendly. They are constantly having competitions and it is fun to compete with your fellow coworkers. I honestly would stay here if they would offer more full time positions  instead of only seasonal. I have worked here two years in a row and have had a great time working for this company.
good,"As a fresher,I got the best platform to work in such a big organisation.Willis provides a good work environment and deserving employees with opportunities and awards."
good,Great place to work and has provided many opportunities for upward mobility. Gained much experience since starting 2 years ago. Formal training is lacking but hands-on training is abundant.
good,"The pay was good for this job. It was temp-to-hire. Make sure you are there everyday, they take attendance very serious. Also training process was cramped into a shorter period of time."
good,"Enrolling retires into Medical; Vison also Dental and Prescription plans; also setting up bank information into systems, creating accounts, calling multiple insurance providers for retires to make sure plans are sending the proper information; using multiple monitors 2-3 at time; also made sure retires got funding from former employer, and making sure retires received all Automatic Reimbursement that is owed to the retires each month."
good,Me gusta trabajar en equipo ya que es enriquecedor de esta manera podemos compartir nuestras experiencias con nuestros pares y jefes  aprender de los demás o de como salir del paso en situaciones un poco incomodas frente a los clientes.
good,The company is the absolute best to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I hated my job but I LOVED THE COMPANY. I cant say that I've loved any other employer as much as I loved Towers.
good,I enjoyed my time working there.  Great people.  Very friendly offices.  They motivate and enable staff to move forward and upward in the company.  Great benefits.
good,Good company that has evolved impressively over time. Good compensation package and good values. Lots of changes over the last few years with little visibility for associates in terms of career progression has become an issue.
good,"Met people from all over the world , made it a fun place to work, Cashiering, giving tours was a great job overall.."
good,"Great company to work for"
good,"Checking my emails and phone messages of my colleague."
good,"TW invests in their associates and believe in developing their talent. Collaboration with colleagues is highly valued. Work/Life balance is a focus, but can be difficult during times with tight deadlines."
good,"Towers Watson provided a challenging environment that required hard work, innovative thinking, and a commitment to excellence."
good,"With a changing business environment, as well as evolving HR related issues, Towers Watson has created a strong presence in the marketplace, and has developed and groomed professionals capable to take on those challenges moving forward."
good,Towers Watson is a very wonderful place to work. All the employees are eager to answer questions and establish new employees.
good,A good place to work..people are very Co- operative. The only thing in Willis is the work is not organised and an individual's day is not planned..  Also I am looking for a job which has a fix shift...
good,"Steady call flow"
good,Large broker with very sophisticated clients.  Professional environment full of growth opportunities and challenges.  Excellent co-workers always willing to help each other.
good,If your looking for a fun easy going environment to work. WTW is the place to work! Meet some really great people as well as enjoyed the work I was doing!
good,Company provides good benefits. Hours can be challenging but ability to work from helps to mitigate that issue. On-boarding could use an overhaul as there is no real training.
good,"Awesome management and team. "
good,"Excellent facilities with a flexible approach. Extremely busy role with variable travel expectations."
good,Not interested in providing feedback. I am no longer working for this company as management decided to reduced cost by outsourcing most of the production team in the US.
good,i love working here. the hardest part of the job is the closing shift.which is 8 pm. fun environment. things change a lot but that is pretty common. a place where you can help people.
good,"Nice, quiet place to work.  Colleagues were very nice. However, manager was remote and I felt like I didn't have an advocate.  Also, the office lacked energy due to the amount of people who worked from home."
good,Great place to work and a relaxed work environment. Management listens and is very supportive without micro-managing. Lots of work teams with an office space that encourages impromptu team teamings.
good,"I only worked a brief internship, so there was no compensation to speak of, but everyone at the company was insanely friendly and you could tell that this was a company that cares about its people. Anyone who works at WTW is a lucky person!"
good,Fun and professional place to work. Employees are friendly. The company looks out for their employees. I like the way they take the company encourages good health and take steps in have the employees participate in taking care of themselves.
good,"Worked here for nearly 2 years. Great company and wonderful people only thing lacking was benefits, they had some employees that had been loyal for 3-5 years who hadn't received any benefits yet so i decided to leave at 2 years"
good,"has peak seasons and slow seasons"
good,"I am proud to say I worked for Willis Towers Watson for more than 10 years and am honored to still have some good friends from there. My team and I were able to provide outstanding support to the HRBPs in the North America as well as contingency global support. Everyone genuinely cared about each other personally and worked together as a team. Additionally, the tasks were personally challenging and matched my career goals. I don't really see any harder part of my work as everyone was ready to cross train peer when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was training new team member. I felt like I was contributing to someone's career and giving back what was given to me."
good,"My experience at Willis Towers Watson was career changing."
good,"Quiet office, everyone focused on individual work. A lot of people work from home, hence interactions are very limited. However, everyone was nice and friendly."
good,"Working at WTW has been extremely rewarding throughout my time with the company, which I happily work for. In the 6 year period I've been with WTW, I've worked hard and gotten promotions nearly every year, with potential for very generous bonus payouts and yearly merit increases. The most enjoyable part of my job is working to assist our partners, participants and clients in achieving the goals we set, and by doing so ensure the firm maintains long lasting and fruitful partnerships for years to come."
good,Wish it was full time with benefits to up and down need steady income. They pick and choose there favorites they also have no top i sales to them everyone is equal

good,"A very professional organisation, one of the market leaders in the insurance broking space. There have been many changes post the recent merger with Towers Watson"
good,Willis Towers Watson is a Risk Consulting firm and does Actuarial business. We have an option of flexible working hours . Work culture is amicable and leaders are quite approachable.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Towers Watson as a .NET web application developer. Benefits are good, but more importantly you have a chance to work with some brilliant minds."
good,"High intensity and complicated work however it means you never get bored and the days fly by."
good,Workplace culture was strong with unlimited growth opportunity. A typical day at work was very fast past with project managing ongoing implementation solutions. Effective cohesive environment between all departments and stakeholders.
good,Much more professional and advanced compared to other firms I've worked for.  Take real good care of agents that produce and boot ones that don't....but only after retraining hasn't worked.  Seems to be in transition but has a lot to offer.
good,Higher management was very pleasant and helpful in furthing my professional career. There is a constant and productive work-flow in the office that communicates well with one another.
good,Answered incoming calls and provided consultative sales for Medicare eligible participants. Made outbound calls to prospective participants. Enjoyed helping participants choose plans by asking specific questions.  Fast paced culture answering calls. Hardest part of the job was following strict company & Medicare regulations during each call.  Calls are monitored and graded for accuracy.
good,"Uma das maiores consultoria do mundo, visa o espirito de equipe e do alto grau de qualidade do trabalho a ser entregue ao cliente. Tive uma excelente gestora e minha equipe era maravilhosa."

good,"Call volume was very high at some points with not a lot of help"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Towers Watson and, more importantly, I learned a lot.  The job I was employed for was not one that I wanted to spend my life doing, but the skills and knowledge that I acquired while working at Towers Watson will serve me for the rest of my career."
good,No review as such. A great place to work along with fun factors and also workoholic environment. Its an example of perfect balance between fun and work related stuff.
good,I loved working there... The only problem is that no benefits are offered unless you are chosen to be permanent.  Some of my co-workers were working there 18 months or more with no benefits because they were still considered temp.
good,Employees worked as a team to collectively complete the task. Flexible work schedule. Good compensation and benefits. Most enjoyable job of my career.
good,"The work performed and level of professionalism are very high."

good,"The experience working at the Mount Laurel office was good. Management did their job, the office was nice, co workers were friendly, and it was really relaxed."

good,"WTW ist ein Arbeitgeber mit sehr guter Unternehmenskultur. Hier werden die Werte wirklich gelebt. Das internationale Umfeld ist spannend und die Kollegen haben untereinander einen sehr wertschätzenden Umgang. "
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and outstanding people. Flexible hours and work schedules are available. Work from home options also exist as needed.
good,"The company as a whole is great. The mergers really flipped the place upside down and for a moment things were very confusing and work atmosphere was bleak. Now, after a few months things are turning around. More opportunities are coming in for full time permanent placement and work-from-home opportunities as well."
good,"The depts. I work in are made up of mostly older employees, but WTW could definitely use the input and energy that younger people bring. The insurance industry needs a facelift."
good,People are nice. Culture as well. I love working woth the people and the company offers a lot of benefits and healthy life style. They also have different organizations to work with in your extra time.
good,"Excellent people products and service. I was their project manager for 4+ years, working with a variety of infrastructure and vendor implementation projects."
good,It was a good place to work. Unfortunately I was terminated due to medical problems that occurred before I acquired sick leave past ninety days. I would recommend working here.
good,"Great place to work. Not to much stress when taking back to back calls. It was a pension company that took part in offering previous employees from various companies and option to take part in cashing out their pension early, verses waiting until retirement age."
good,Typical day was being at my desk answering phone and using multi programs on 3 different screens. I learned a lot about Pensions and it was great to assist elderly with questions and concerns.
good,Towers Watson provided a very beneficial training course for new hires. I quickly learned the proper regulations for receiving calls and assisting retirees with their enrollment into Medicare. The company is constantly changing but works to include its employees in their decision making. There are many opportunities to move up and my managers were constantly working to meet their goals set for us as a team.
good,This is a great company. I enjoyed working for Towers Watson. The staff was polite and truly professional.  They truly care about their staff.
good,"I had the opportunity to be employed by this great company for nearly 5 years. The culture, standards and building itself are all 5 start. My employment ended unfortunately, due to a merger and subsequent bout of layoffs. I would definitely work here again. I have only good things to say about Towers Watson. The knowledge and relationships that I gained here are priceless."

good,"Empresa com oportunidade de crescimento, visando a valorização dos colaboradores"
good,"If you want to get started in medicare insurance sales they will pay to get you licensed. Overall a very nice environment, though it is seasonal unless you hit the numbers to go permanent."
good,"Great place to learn all about Medicare insurance and the benefits. The different types of health insurance available, and  what types of insurance the companies offer."
good,"Working with elderly to assist with health insurance, there are no call requirements such as calls per hour, etc...but they expect you follow call flow perfectly and want first call resolution. They have a really great training program and team overall, the only reason I left was because it was too far for me to work."
good,WTW is a great company.  They always strive to do the right thing. I really enjoy working there and they also have a good work life balance.  They allow people to work remotely and are very supportive.
good,WTW is a great place to work. The call center environment can be demanding however WTW knows how to make their employees work day more pleasurable. Overtime is not mandatory but it is definitely great when you need some extra money. Management doesn't bother you unless you're not doing your part. The hardest part is when clients/customers called with questions that take longer to research.
good,"If you have the ability to converse with elderly participants on the phone and make sure their needs come first, this is the job for you. It is considered seasonal however, if you're at the top, you have the chance of being put on permanently or requested to work the their sister company."
good,"I had a great experience working at Willis Towers Watson. Assisting people find the answers to very complicated questions was strangely satisfying in this position, They didn't have any benefits, as you are considered a seasonal employee (or at least the people I talked with at my work place were) but had a clear progression and process for hiring directly and permanently, which did have benefits! The team I worked with was very LGBT+ friendly and welcoming, as was the rest of the office. There are company policies for helping transgender folks transition within the company, even if you are only seasonal! It outlines the responsibilities of both the transitioning person and their supervisors, and their supervisor above them. Very thorough and respectful company, I felt like a priority while I worked with them."
good,"I've greatly enjoyed my experience at Willis Towers Watson, I enjoy my direct management structure. I feel they can be behind on pay if you move to a more challenging role."
good,"WTW is a great place to work. They care about their employees and compensate them well."
good,Great experience at Willis Towers Watson.  I've grown a lot in my professional career during my time here and will be forever grateful.  A true client-first culture.
good,"I really enjoy working environment here. Everyone is so nice and professional. HQ and Benefit are good to employee, like good medical program to take care of family, etc. It's just too many rules in this company so it's not east to get promoted but I understand that's how it run the global coportation."
good,"Was in charge of processing West Region tasks within the allotted SLAs. Worked several adhoc projects for several Client Managers in those offices. The workload goes in surges on overwhelming busy to slow, the work culture is laid back and fun as long as you get your work done. My particular manager was great, but I get along with most anyone. Career advancement is possible but is definitely hard here. benefits are definitely good though,."
good,A perfect place to work with amazing team members and spectacular leaders. Excellent values across the company. The company values every individual's opinion.
good,This is the best job I have ever had. The job is very laid back and flexible. I enjoyed working there. my supervisors were easy to talk to. It is easy to climb the ladder at Willis Towers Watson.
good,The people working are very friendly and interactive. There is no bias between individuals. The management takes care of their employees and offers them the perfect work life balance.
good,"Typical day was spent managing the office facilities mailbox to coordinate all requests for office services, covering reception, planning meetings, and training. Management focused on  that productivity from the departments that generated revenue. Workplace culture was very professional and traditional setting.  Summer picnic and holiday parties were times for employees unwind and interact with staff from other departments."
good,"WTW is one of the best companies I have ever come across. The respect and value at workplace is outstanding."
good,I have learned the skills to be a great leader from working with Towers Watson (now Willis Towers Watson) and I am forever grateful for the leadership and co-workers. Great environment.
good,"The people I worked here were very driven, working together as a team, helped each other out."
good,"I was hired on for Annual Enrollment 2015. I learned new skills during training, on the job training, and throughout my daily routine. My typical day at work was non-stop and I loved it. During Annual Enrollment I received hundreds of calls from employees of our clients. The types of calls I handled were to enroll the employee in benefits, payroll issues, online portal support, and Health & Welfare plan knowlege. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a Death notification call. These calls are tough, you must have compassion and sympathy for those are talking to, they just lost a loved one and have to call in to ask questions regarding the deceases' life insurance. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I spoke with, the relationship with my co-workers/Managers, and our state-of-the-art facility."
good,"Typical day: routine, easy going."
good,"when the season started it was intense in regards to call volume."
good,"Very Good and Nice environment, No Toxic, very friendly and kind people. I learned to be confident in different works don't be doubt in your opinion and works"
good,"I love how this company does allow you to learn about different things and departments as well as allowing you to actually work without being watched constantly. My supervisor often have a coaching session that allows me to provide feedback and address any concerns you may have. I hated that my department didn't have a continuing incentive program. It's nice to be in a company in which you're not policed on thoughts, dress, hair--to be treated as an adult and trusted to work."
good,I started working in this company in 2013 since then I grow and gained a lot of knowledge. They give equal opportunity and there core values are being practiced. I love working on this company.
good,"Willis Towers Watson is a company that talks the talk and walks the walk too.  As a benefits consulting firm, it often lives by what it preaches meaning the benefits reflect much of the current advice it gives clients. There is a strong emphasis on choice both in health and retirement core benefits as well as optional benefits. Similarly, the company has a strong emphasis on workplace wellbeing with a good effort at inclusion. Like most professional services firms, it encourages flexible working hours including the ability to work from home. Additionally, the marketing department has a good work-life balance. I would highly recommend working here. My only complaint is that certain semi-urban offices don't have free or subsidized parking, which is likely not a problem in suburban settings."
good,WTW provides a very friendly atmosphere to work as well as learn. I have learned a lot about things I didn't know about previously. Also got to work with some cool technologies and tools while working on various projects
good,"Best part are the people. I learned so much and was able to grow significantly as en employee and manager. Great culture, lots of opportunity for training and education."
good,"Best job I've had in the Cities thus far! Outstanding management; They were sure to not only tell you where you need improvement but also tell you where you excel. Great work environment; Located in the Normandale Business Park, there were plenty of restaurants to choose from including a cafeteria. There was a daycare center for employees with children, the entire aesthetic of the place was very nice... comfortable.

Two thumbs and two big toes up in my book!"

The higher-up's often stressed how much they appreciate their interns, which I thought was nice since not many interns at other companies receive such notable recognition. This position involves analyzing data on a day to day basis which can be boring for some people with a lot of energy, but you do get to speak with clients and occasionally meet with coworkers on your ""team""--so your days are always busy.
