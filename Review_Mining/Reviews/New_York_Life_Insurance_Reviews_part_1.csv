rating,review
bad,"New York Life is number 1, everything else is a line of lies!"
bad,"New York Life is an excellent, Fortune 100 company with a nearly perfect COMDEX score. Their ethics are superior and the overall culture of the company is outstanding. The San Diego office is a disaster with inept, sadistic management. It's a horrible place to work."
bad,"Unethical working environment, bad corporate culture, lack of support and understanding from management for work-life balance. Environment is full of hostility and retaliation if you do something wrong, no coaching and management lack of managing skills."
bad,"No support from management, lack of honesty and integrity "
bad,"There was a lot of discouragement and unfairness working in my department. The people who worked really hard would not be compensated. The people who was barely even around would get promotions one after another while others don't get anything. You work hard and they will make sure not to promote you just so you have to work even harder to think you would even get promoted. I learned that management only cares about their bonuses. The top higher up once got really angry at the team and held a meeting & the exact words was, ""I did not reach my goals because of all of you"". Having leadership stating that just means you are selfish, doesn't understand team effort nor how to take care of your team. Also it was mentioned, :if you don't want to be here, you can leave."" So people were leaving left and right yet management got ANGRY at that. Why so angry when you TOLD us to do so? Too funny and ironic. Well, there's always karma! Good luck to whoever ends up there."
bad,Typical sales job with emphasis on selling policies. Salary is 100% commision based. Difficult job to do if you don't know people to contact. Insurance sales is not a good field to start in after relocating to a new city.
bad,"The partners here are terrible. They think they are better than everyone else in the office. They insult people on the basis of race and they inspect everyone’s work to see what is there contribution. "
bad,"Often the story is stronger than the outcome. They"
bad,"No Money, they take 75% of the annual premium and leave you the rest. Underwriting process takes 2-3 months for even the best and healthiest prospects."
bad,It’s a pyramid scheme. Don’t do it unless you love cold calls. They’ll tell you there’s no cold calls but that’s all there is besides selling to friends and family. The managers are terrible. The trainers don’t care.
bad,"commission based only. Bad management. a lot of driving. If your clients cancel policies, the company will make you pay for that. Eventually, you will run out of friends to sell to"
bad,"Review of working with NYL any typical day at work is extremely stressful. What you will learn is that the management and other workers there are very RUDE and ignorant. The workplace culture is offensive, ill-mannered and impolite. The hardest part of the job is handling disrespectful customers. The most enjoyable part of the day when you get off work."
bad,Almost no support in beginning career and is a very stressful high turnover environment hated every moment and was constantly in a pressure situation to sign new clients even if it didn't fit their exact needs.
bad,"Not a great place to work. No work, live balance. Constant turn over in staff. A few good people, I hope they have turned it around from I have left. People stay for the great benefits."
bad,Not many people survive here. If you can make a living here you are in a good place. But 9 people out of 10 do not make it here past three years. The position is all salary and it is tough to make a living by calling on friends and relatives.
bad,100% commission and no real way to make sales other then cold calls or selling friends and family. Life insurance sales is about tuff as it can get and you better have a ton of connections because NYLife isn’t going to help.
bad,"You are told that as a business owner you can make your own schedule and all purchases will be a tax write off at the end of the year. Unfortunately, your ideal schedule becomes 6 or 7 -12 hour days per week and since they contract you as a W2 employee you cannot write your expenses off. They require you attend trainings 5 days a week and pay for your overhead costs monthly all while being 100% comission based. Overall, the support from management varies and is inconsistent as associates who hit their goals for 2 years are offered a management position regardless of management experience. Think long and hard before accepting a job with this company as your clients become their's if you leave or quit. That includes family or friends who you are asked to load into their client database during orientation."
bad,"Don't do it if you are not already established in the business world.  Misrepresentation of the job is how I began, spent money on a specific computer, and wasted hours of travel, foot effort, and conversation for nothing.  It is all about the quotas."
bad,"I came from a finanacial background on Wall Street and was excited to be working for a company with a strong sense of fiduciary responsibility. I was excited to be back in a corporate environment, in a ""white collar environment"" so to speak."
bad,"Supervisor  is a bully, who verbally abuse employees. She prays on her subordinates. Terrible  behavior. Employees  are not give training  for roles they are ask to do. Hence when done, they are rudely handled by the supervisor. This create a cut throat culture in the office. With employees rolling their eyes at each other."
bad,"As far as the insurance producer role..... unless you are extremely good at selling, I advise finding a job with guaranteed income. Otherwise, best of luck in being able to generate a living wage. I was mislead into joining this company, being told compensation was guaranteed. This is not the case. I would never work for this company again."
bad,"Compensation is made to confuse even the senior management. They hire anyone and have no salary, 100% commission, and force you to sell their proprietary overpriced products and pay you substantially less than any other companies. They own your book of business but recruit saying you're ""in business for yourself"". But if you leave they keep 100% of your clients and have new, inexperienced agents call your clients repeatedly. All focus is on first year commissions and driving proprietary core product sales, always placing management goals and priorities above their clients best interests. I found this to be a problem. It was ceryainly a major factor in leaving the company. I tried to always serve my clients best interests but they would make blanket recommendations of their own products no matter the client situation or circumstances, just to maximize commissions and management pay, with no regard for clients specific needs or goals. I would stay away. There are numerous better opportunities when you really get to understand the business"
bad,A typical day at work was busy. I learned to be reach out to business around the area. Poor management. Great workplace culture. Commission based was the hardest part of the job.
bad,"I recommend you have a second source of income before you start a career as an agent with New York Life. You must have over 200 people you can talk to about life insurance to get started.  it is called a project 200.  The average salary is $30,000 a year if you can make it.  it is commission based only!! you will get help in your first three years, bur it is ONLY if you get a certain amount of commission per month to be eligible. Training is moved from a curriculum based to sales tactics that change from month to month.  very inconsistent with training.  you will be on your own if you want to make it,  I recommend finding an established agent yo mentor you that has YOUR best interest of succeeding in the industry over their interest."
bad,"I was there 2 months and already could see that this wasn't a fit for me."
bad,"Unfortunately selling life insurance and a vicious cycle, where the agents come through in bunches and the management gets what they can out of the agent and then fires them. The cycle continues with the constant stream of new hires, who sell to their family and friends and then get cut, to make room for the next set of agents."
bad,"COMMIISSION SALES ONLY"
bad,If you have a large book of business and a heft saving that can carry you through a time when you may be making little or no pay then this job might be right for you if not then stear clear
bad,"Hi, welcome to New York Life.  How about we get you started with no salary, and use your network to push our product.  We'll start with trying to make you sell life insurance to your friends and family, then move on the attractive world of cold calls.  Sounds enticing right?  Well if that's not enough, did I mention the attrition rate?  Yeah, a lot of you won't make it.  In fact more than half will be gone within a year...."
bad,"Very cutthroat place to work"
bad,"This is not a real job. There is no salary, it is commission sales only. They sign you on in ""temporary"" contract capacity, then once you have made enough sales, they bring you in full time (contract). They expect you to exploit your personal contacts (warm market) and yourself to help meet the quota. The often make you work with another agent and split the commission. Then they make you attend useless ""training"" by people that have fake degrees from this totally bogus American College of Financial Services. This place isn't a real school, you just pay a few thousand dollars and read the material, take the test as many times as you need to pass, then you get some letters to put at the end of your name on your card. Long story short, I can't believe this business model is legal. They take everything from you and give you nothing. They expect you to give up your time and money in return for building their company. Its a despicable business."
bad,"New York Life Ins. Co. lacks in attracting quality talent due to the lack of management skills from upper management. Upper management is unaware of how to handle regular day-to-day work, and puts the fault on others."
bad,commission only and yet you get a W-2 and are not allowed to do any other job. If the job is commission only then I should be allowed to work a second job. Manager stole my first commission which was roughly about 25% or $700 from the first sale.
bad,"I trusted the managing partner to advise me honestly! Mislead when I took the job and during the job! Health insurance was $750 per month and a total joke. It's every man for himself. No culture to speak of in the office or between Agents! Favoritism, sexism and nepotism."
bad,"To put it eloquently, I was promised a feast but only got to famine. "
bad,Survivor of the fittest. No help or guidance.  Very hard to succeed. The culture is to everybody for themselves and no real sense of corporation. Benefits are also lacking
bad,"The office I worked for had no real training, I had no sales experience and they convinced me I would be great for the position, but once I started they just sent me out there on my own with no idea what I was doing."
bad,no support by management- insurance for the healthy; insurance for the wealthy only. no one to go on calls with you. I  never tell someone to work for this company. they train you but give you zero leads.
bad,"NYL is sadly just an overall poor company to work for. The company promises bonuses to employees but never delivers, nor do they give pay raises. Wages were very meager to say the least. Management was extremely unprofessional. Coworkers were awesome made the job tolerable. Company flat-out lies to their customers and has a lot of unfair business practices that will no doubt one day cause a huge lawsuit played out in the media for all to see. Truly, this is the place to work if you need a paycheck by any means necessary. Don’t expect bonuses, pay raises, to be respected , or to be treated as a human being by NYL. Expect to be told to lie to customers."
bad,"Zero direction. Waste of time and money. Will have tp sell to family and friends, and the training is terrible. The training is just a seminar of people talking about themselves."
bad,"I was an agent at New York Life, San Francisco GO, from May, 2014 - October 2015. I was impressed with some parts of the company and saddened by many other parts."
bad,It was stressful and required you to be able to do more than what was listed on the initial job application. Would not recommend at all. Also was a temp
bad,"This is one of the largest cult-esque scams in the country. Both fellow agents and managers will actively attempt to undercut you and put you down at any available opportunity. Sometimes to get a leg up by putting you down, sometimes for sadistic pleasure, sometimes out of pure habit."
bad,I learned a lot and enjoyed the competitive and colleageal atmosphere.  I followed the advised plan to sell insurance and didn't make enough to succeed.  It's a fine company
bad,insurance companies are notoriously known for throwing newly hired persons on the ceiling and waiting to see who sticks. Do not work here. It may be a good stepping stone.
bad,"Sales, no leads just encouraging you to hound your personal contacts to buy insurance. Great if you want people to ignore your calls."
bad,These jobs should be salary and commission. zit requires too much work just to make on e sale. Its a good company to have life insurance with but to work for not so much
bad,"Company is full of nepotism.  The opportunities for advancement for minorities and women are minimal.  Human Resources protects management. Whenever employees seek guidance from Human Resources, there is retaliation."
bad,"Not Good, better time and place and it could have possibly worked out. Bosses were not much of a help, besides telling you go network and go out to other places."
bad,My time there was not what I thought. They made sound so easy and did not give the support you needed to be successful. many hours I worked with no pay. Many times I went out in the field to make a sale and no sale. Put many miles on my car for nothing. Went to many events for nothing. way from my family for nothing.
bad,"I am a very hard worker and really put my all into this company and received close to nothing in return for my time and effort. Management is shady and can not be trusted. I truly felt that this company as well as the staff in general did not have my best interest at heart. I ended up getting completely screwed over during my transition out of the company by one of the only people I trusted most, which was one of the ""Partners"" of the company. Needless to say, I am glad I got out when I did."
bad,"Most of the time, chances are that you'll be scouted at job fairs and locals events. They present themselves as a financial company with high standards for their employees, so when they offer you an ""interview"" right away, no wonder you're astonished."
bad,"Look else where within the financial services industry to build a practuce. The management painted a picture of you making lots of money. Evening making council, I still barely made ends meat. Very poor mentorship in this general office."
bad,"No management, no guidance, just wanted you to call your friends and family and make them buy life insurance.  Cold call out of phone books and old leads."
bad,Very toxic culture with a heavy focus on sales to meet quotas.There were too many meetings. Management used fear and bullying as motivation. Just a really poor work environment.
bad,"If you have the means to not get paid, and an EXTENSIVE network of friends and family, this could work for you. I couldn't hack it walking up to strangers asking for money. IF you are comfortable with that, by all means, this could work for you."
bad,"It is a job for beginners, students, or the elderly, and you can not rely on it to pay your bills. In addition, there is a lot of training on sales, language, etc. It requires more than 12 hours a day of hard work and determination, and most times, results are unsatisfactory."
bad,"This job is terrible. There is a 95% turnover rate in the first year.  I made it two years and it was all fresh faces all the time.  You will badger your friends and family to buy bad insurance products from you until no one will hang out with you or return your calls.  Going out and pitching to strangers gets even more frustrating and that's when most people quit, leaving NYL with a few life insurance policies their friends and families bought out of pity."
bad,"Stuck in the 1950s Managerial-wise.  Reviews based on bell curve, employees stuck in specific rating levels, even if undeserved. Top Management managed through fear and intimidation."
bad,This is not a real job they hire a new class every few weeks get them to sell there friends and family and keep the business when they leave.The managing partner is the only one making real money.
bad,"I would have wanted a better internship. It was sales. trying to get you to find people to sell life insurance to, like your own family members quickly before the internship was over."
bad,"Commission only work for a fortune 100 company should be easy. The reality is if you dont come from wealth working for New York Life is not for you. You will not have the funds to sustain yourself while you grow your business, neither will you have the connections to grow your business."
bad,"I have been working for new York life since December 1st, it is now april 6th and I still have yet to be paid. I have been selling policies and not getting paid for it."
bad,"Poor management skills, unable to lead a team properly. Unethical work environment with lack of guidelines. More professionalism required, and a proper evaluation of some of the partners should be performed."
bad,"This position is 100% commission, not for the weak. "
bad,This company wanted you to provide your entire personal and professional contact list and mine them for insurance sales. There was NO compensation except for commission.
bad,It was difficult to learn by simply watching and not getting the reinforcement of your  manager on  what was taught in seminars and when your manager was more focused on helping her son a New York Life Employee with being successful and using those she hired to boost her income and not really managing and training them.
bad,"I was excited about working with New York Life and it was exciting. After a year working there, I was very disappointed since it was based on commission.  I decided after one in half years I needed a job with a paycheck.  I am a very hard worker and willing to learn what is given to me."
bad,Worst environment I ever worked in.  Really weird clique-ish culture like a bad high school movie.  Very behind technology wise and happy to stay that way.
bad,Terrible place to work.  Its essentially a corporate multi level marketing firm.  Long hours and stressful days waiting on commissions that often are received a month or two after the initial sale.
bad,"Simply, the company exploits the education and work ethic of dedicated and hard working people by promising an opportunity and salary that will not come."
bad,"they paid only when you made sales, but this part is acceptable since this is something you would expect from many insurance companies and sales industry. But they did charge me for like using company desk designated to me. When I left them, they did not terminated my contract so they could charge more money from me. It took me time to address this issue and nobody should work for place that willing to charge you instead of pay you. Hopefully situation got better since 2010"
bad,"Unfortunately, the company worked you and did not compensate you for it.  We were discouraged from entering our overtime hours and led to believe if you claimed your overtime it would appear unfavorable to management.  Management did not care if there was a blizzard outside, you were expected to stay and finish whatever it was that we were working on.  Although the hours were 9-5, you were expected to be at your desk at 8:45 am and not ever leave before 6:00 pm, with no overtime pay.  I was not an exempt employee."
bad,"The biggest problem is that they claim to have the best training in the industry. This, unfortunately, is limited to product training. They don't actually teach people how to sell anything and then your manager will yell at you for not being amazing at sales out of the gate. You end up selling to friends and family early on and feeling guilty about it for years to come."
bad,You are left to dry solo. This business of having a mentor helping you out is a joke. No help or guidance what so ever. My boss is awesome but at the end of the day its a numbers game that is at your expense
bad,"they promised thing that was never delivered, commission was never completed I need to look my own client and was very stressful to work under press-ion."
bad,After months of studying products and following directions expect little to NO PAY.  One can only expect to receive an income if enough policies are sold or if appointed to a managing partner wanting to mentor a novice.  Many bright people leave after a month or two.  Those who have an existing list of clients from a previous career in sales or mentored by an experienced agent within their team survive.
bad,"The Management is Horrible.  They have old managers that have been working for the company for 20 -30 years that are set in their ways and don't have a clue how to treat new hires. They gossip and talk about people all the time with no one to oversee what they are doing to the company morale."
bad,Cut through no help is given. They cast you out into the wild and almost none survive. It is terrible for so many reasons. People come and go faster then Normandy beach
bad,Typical day begins with classes or meeting.  After that it is up to you on how you would like to spend you time.  Usually would go out to places or events to meet clients.  Hardest part was that it was a commission based job
bad,Telephone cold calling to obtain customers to purchase life insurance.  Long hours and 100% commission based.  Needed stable income and benefits to provide for my family.
bad,Working at New York Life is very stressful for very little money. You will be treated as number not as human being. Everything is about bringing money to them.
bad,"Run away if this company contacts you. They are all lies. They take advantage of people and lie to them.  Make you think you can earn six figures while you won't make anything."
bad,"Very bad management team who don't support and back up your team. Very unprofessional and under skilled and unethical to work with. Management does not stand to support for the team benefit and care to balance work/life for employees. In addition, manager does not show good example and role model for the employees."
bad,"Heard a lot about the company leading financial company in the industry. Disappointed by the way management approached helping clients, basic focus was getting a commission. Always an incentive to sell clients additional insurance. Just not the way I wanted to approach helping people. Primerica is a much better company all around. Disappointing to write anything negative about any company. Know a lot of people who left the company after I had."
bad,Horrendous work environment. 1 bad manager left and got replaced by someone even worse due to a poll they had with corporate. Employees treated poorly
bad,"They start using you while you are still in the interview process. "
bad,"Run as fast as you can.  Dishonest, liers.  They trick people into thinking they are being interviewed for a job.  Actually, they are just getting you into their office to try to sell life insurance you and your friends and family.  All they do is scheme to get sales.  Eventually, they run you off and keep your clients that they never paid you a commission for selling to them."
bad,"I had a horrible experience with this company. First I was deceived into working for them and had to pay back 3,000 for a charge back and wasn't happy at all...I would not work for this company. They were recruiting anyone because it is low retention. Commission based job."
bad,"Day to day work, conducting meetings, resolving user's issue. Participating in meetings for cross module to discuses issue related to other consultant. For example Stock Transport order."
bad,great deal of attention to career development of upper management and associates. especially if you are an actuary.  everyone else is left out.  yet the company claims to care about developing its employees.  not true
bad,Unfortunately you are worth more dead than you are alive - sign up today before it's too late.  They'll get what they deserver - you take care of your own or you are worthless. Great people work there management is in need of professional services though.
bad,"Company is outsourcing or ""co-sourcing"" and are laying people off left and right meanwhile if you check their career site they're hiring all the time."
bad,"don't want to say anything....Just wasn't happy with Company did a good job always worked very hard but don't want to talk about my experience with them....They weren't very good ......."
bad,I made one of the best decision of my life to Join New york Life. I got several awards and recognition. I have done the right thing for my family and my Career Advancement. I made $72000 which was $22000 more than my previous Job as a school Director. i am very Happy. I strongly recommend everybody who wants a career to give it a shot. Be open minded. Nothing to Loose.
bad,"You need to have a lot of money saved up to begin this job. You are unlikely to receive a paycheck for several weeks. You have to go through training  and then prey on your closest friends and family to buy from you. There are no leads provided to you, just pray that your friends and family will buy life insurance from you and that they will give you referrals to their friends and family. "
bad,Terrible experience I wouldnt recommend it. They will sell you a dream and you get your friends life insurance and that's about it. You can't help the people who actually need the life insurance because of their strict underwriting and that hurts after a while. Although those people could have taken better care of themselves before deciding to get life insurance.
bad,it only depends on what market you gathered in if you have the chance to do what you want and advance within the company.  i think that it is an overall good company but the company as a whole is money hungry and makes you think of the banking industry in a way that is not healthy.
bad,"Everyone has an entrepreneurial spirit. However sales is sales. You cannot sugarcoat the fact that you are hustling for your next meal. I came into the company because I was desperate for experience in the financial field. I wanted to try it out and if things did not work out I could at least have something to throw on my resume."
bad,"Promises were not kept.  Hostile environment. Had to pay $69 for training materials."
bad,No room for error and many people who work at this new york life especially have no heart. Alot of them are more concerned with making money than giving people the best possible life insurance for their money.
bad,New York sells a great product that can help families plan for the future.  The company was great to work for and I loved the freedom.  But the commission pay was a lot to adjust to as a fairly new agent.
bad,"You are expected to create your own book of business without any help. Unless you are buddy,buddy with the management, you don;t get any ""bones"" thrown at you. They only  provide you with leads, if you are in ""their"" circle of friends.  You are told that the company doesn't like to micro manage, but that's only because all the management team  does is micro-manage! They tell you they are going to pay training allowance, but make it impossible to obtain.  You can work 40 hours in one week and not get paid. And you are forced to go to their mandatory meeting with out pay."
bad,"New York Life had a lot of promises, none of which were kept. My manager was not only rude to me on a daily basis, he provided no critical feedback. He refused to listen to calls I made, or help me solicit. He then blamed me for poor results, claiming I wasn't following the scripts. Ultimately I was bribed into making a deal I was uncomfortable with, which is costing me a ton of money. The manager still works at the office. "
bad,"I have a decent sales background within the financial industry, when I looked up NY Life they were listed as the number one insurance company to work for, so I figured let go and apply.  On my first interview I was told I would never have to worry about high pressure sales pitches, leads the typically things a company looking for a sales force says.  The main thing that caught my attention was they said they had a great sales process but they didn't get into much detail about it, they did go into grave detail about how I get paid, which of course would raise a eyebrow to anyone looking to advance in life."
bad,leared everyday new things. worked under great management team and co-workers.
bad,work environment was ok sometimes could be hostle. Manager didn't want to hear bad news. Were un willing to retrain.
bad,"If you like not making money, driving 100 miles on Monday's to hear a delusional megalomaniac babble about breakthroughs, and having partners tell you about how much money they make while they are not paying their bills, then New York Life Boston General Office is the career for you."
bad,"Horrible managers who have no phone experience, back-to-back calls and micromanagement, upset elderly customers, nasty co-workers."
bad,everything management tells you is scripted! All to suck you in. Trainer and management not helpful. You get all leads on your own.
bad,Prospecting families and friends is not how I would like to do business.
bad,Management does not care about your success or failure in the business. You are just another body to fill a seat in their office....
bad,I worked at NYL at the Westwood office. I was
bad,"No Wages, No compensation. No rewards, nothing. Working here was the worst time of my life. Hardest part is knowing that you will get paid zero dollars for getting up every morning and going to work for this company. No money for transportation, no money for food no money for phone calls... nothing."
bad,Get paid when people buy a plan but if they stop paying for policy and it lapses you owe the company. Gotta chase down clients to ensure they pay. Not fun at all.
bad,"Managers have no ideas how to run the groups. The staffs always take the blames and credits are always belong to the mangers. Also, some of their buildings in NYC are old and dirty. Especially the one on East 27th St, there were rats running around in the lunch room. Countless overtime for no reasons."
bad,"long story short. If you're thinking about becoming an agent or advisor for New York Life, know some really rich people that you know personally that you can sell to. If you don't, then you will not make it."
bad,Awful place to work. you have to fight to get paid. My managing partner refused to pay me and breached my contract. I had to use outside methods to get the money that was owed to me.
bad,"Insurance sales is a difficult profession; besides the rejection you face, and the constant chasing after potential prospects, getting someone to agree to a meeting and then sign a contract is a daunting task. Yet, it can be done and has been so for a quite some time and very successfully by a lot of individuals. New york Life, however, may not be your best vehicle. The company charges you for events that they brand; whether you rstanding in the mall trying to convince people to provide their information or a minor league baseball game or a islander game or a simple child protection and safety event you set up, it all cost you money! There is no base, you only get paid if someone actually gets the rating you presented and then agree's to pay. You genuinely don't control the rating they'll get, sooo, even if you find a comfortable price, you may be way off depending on what the underwriters come back with, which means more back and forth. The actual process of underwriting someone takes literally weeks. This coupled with the fact that your driving around on your own dime, coming to ""mandatory meetings"", staying till all hours of the nights doing phone clinics and showing up early for classes adds to the pressure to make sales. But if that weren't enough, you have to pay for internet access, copier fee's, technology support cost on your own laptop you bring to the company and oh yea all the misc, fee's and due's you have to come out of pocket for, all before even securing a sale. you pay your own insurance, business cards, mail-outs, pretty much everything and yet your a ""captive"
bad,Working in customer service for NYL was one of the most depressing job experiences I've had. The management was inept and did not encourage or support the staff. Everyone was miserable and seemed to accept that as status quo.
bad,"Like the *vast* majority of hires there, I actually *lost* thousands of dollars working there in gas and expenses. They charge you for everything, from materials to your bullpen desk (after 6 months). Their marketing strategy is called an 'rms 200', where they have you mass spam your friends and family for business. Then it's on to scam mail and cold calls. Let me repeat, the job costs more money than you'll make. It is the worst scam Ihave ever been a part of"
bad,They made false promises to open Office locally nothing happened in three years . Explanation for compensation was not clear at all. Left my job for all false and lying compensations .
bad,"Stay away from the company, it is the worst place to work. The benefits are great but you die a little everyday by staying here. Things are changing all the time and the quality team is a joke."
bad,"When I was recruited, I wasn't told the truth about what was expected of me to become successful. Aside from the seemingly never ending ""training sessions"" you are then required to prospect for clients. I wasn't given any leads or very much help to do get any. "
bad,"Did not match my higher level ethics, honesty, fairness. Management only interested in the bottom line. Found the training we were giving in one particular area was not backed up by any written documented procedure manual."
bad,"Extremely high pressure sales. Managing partner shows favoritism only to those he thinks will be high producers. Other than those, you don't see him or hear from him."
bad,"Less than two percent retention rate, should give a good indication of how many employees survive. Poor pay compared to other industry leaders. Hard goals to reach every month."
bad,"If you like every minute of your day managed down to the last second and managers who come down on you without doing the job themselves apply here. If your manager criticizes you and you ask for advice of how they handled the situation and they hav nothing to give you know your in trouble. "
bad,"The agent I worked for was very abusive towards her employees, often belittling them and insulting them. She was very unprofessional within her office but professional towards her clients. I felt she did not uphold New York Life's beliefs and often overcharged her clients for services. She also fires certain staff every 6 months. Only certain positions though, not all. All in all I would not recommend this employer."
bad,"Management made it clear that you are production piece in their wheel house. They also made it a point to market products to clients that would make NYL and them more money and really not benefit the client."
bad,"Working at NYL is 100% commission no matter what they tell you. You only get paid after selling life insurance or annuities. However even when you sell life insurance you don't know when you will be paid. You have to wait until the medical examiner sets up a meeting with the client, and for them to pass their exam to get fully paid. If you are advanced any of the money up front, and they fail the medical then you have to pay back the money to NYL! Management's communication with employees is terrible, when you ask about getting paid you'll get different answers from different people. Selling life insurance is a very competitive and stressful job, especially since its all commission."
bad,"Initially your impression may be great. They swoon you with some impressive numbers, all the potential possibilities, the flexibility and anything else you want to hear. But as time goes on you'll begin to notice some faults. Poor communication. Misuse of email from staff (duplicate emails and emails that could have been communicated in more efficient ways) Then the disorienting programs and antiquated ways of thinking begin to pop up. Picture 5 Silos that are all fed the same information, but you're required to manually put it in to each one. Their CRM has terrible support, lack of basic functionality, and the phrase ""they're working on it"" that is echoed repeatedly by everyone. This may have been a fantastic company to work for 30 years ago, but if you're at all a modern person you'll likely struggle. If you don't care about your image as a person and don't care to come across as someone professional then give it a shot. Want to know what others think? Go to the three most popular professional networking groups in your area and see how many NYL agents you can find. Then ask other professionals what their opinions are of the agents, company, and management."
bad,"I had a horrible experience with this company. They must pay a lot of money for damage control because this organization looks good on paper but they have a lack of empathy. It's very stressful and they don't have a wellness program. I would think they have one, being that the customers are verbal abusive as well as the agents. There's also closet racists."
bad,"If you want to work in an environment where agents do everything they can to undermine each other, go through ridiculous amounts of training and meetings your first 2 years and be pressured to sell to your family and friends, apply to be an agent. Otherwise, you'd be better off working at WalMart."
bad,"If you like to work for little or nothing ONLY be compensated if a sale goes through then NYL is the place for you. My manager was sneaky and lied to us about certain aspects of the job before we were hired, I have nothing but bad things to say about working there, Them taking on new hires is a ploy to get a list of new list 200 peoples names and number  in their ""project 200"" thats their way of free prospecting and  if you don't make it (90% don't) then they have a list of all your friends and family they can harass to buy insurance."
bad,The company's endorsement of alternative lifestyles erased my initial enthusiasm.I enjoyed interacting with different people and the freedom concomitant with setting my own schedule.
bad,"they hire anyone with a pulse...... i spent 6 years as an agent....make over 6 figures for 3 of the years...... management was horrible.....they gave horrible advise, told me numerous lies....all to pad their pockets. when u need help ur on your own."
bad,"They hype up and tell you all is possible, but do not tell you how much money you will end up spending before making money."
bad,"Would not recommend working at this establishment. Constantly struggling to get applications approved. Then if they did get approved, it could take months to get paid."
bad,If you don't already have a wide array of contacts that are ready and willing to help you out. Their compensation is terrible and they really don't care if their employees stick around for more than 6-12 months
bad,I toiled for two years outperforming my peers and watching the revolving door of new hires before I finally left for greener pastures with the possibility of earning a living. A very difficult place to make enough money to survive.
bad,My direct manager did not know how to manage people. In addition to my job duties I was assigned work that should have been completed by my manager. Leads and management took the credit for the work that I did.
bad,"The training is awesome. Depending on people for your living is very unstabil.Support is given to the priveledged. Others work very hard, with a little luck sqeeze by until  they fall or become established, More people fail at this oppotunity than succeed. They rent you a work space and do not give a dime or a book of business to assist you.The business modal  it built only for the success of NYL and not its agents.It is a white priveledge inviroment."
bad,Avoid as much as possible. Not worth the stress or the headaches. Not very organized. No true project or product management. Making it up as they go along. I was harassed and descriminated against.
bad,"I joined the company and enjoyed a good deal of success.  However, if you dont build your clientele to a certain level in the first 36 months you contract will not be renewed."
bad,Unfortunately my manger was much of the reason I left New York Life. He was unexperienced and very untruthful. Salary was unpredictable. Trainers were a positive.
bad,"I wrote over 10 apps and they were turned down due to economic, medical or weight requirements.  It wasn't the lack of effort but the guidelines to qualify were super restrictive."
bad,"If you are a splendid natural salesperson who needs no help selling Insurance to friends and family this might be a great job.  If you are not, you won't get any help ."
bad,"I did not last for more than a month. I would report every morning around 8:30 and not go home until after 6-7pm. The hardest part of the job was the feeling in the morning where I know I will not get paid a single dollar for all the work I will do during the day. "
bad,"New York Life might be one of the biggest names in financial services, but it is also one of the sleaziest. They claim to have great training, but they don’t care about clients and have no integrity. On top of it all, managers will encourage you to use shady business practices. As an added negative, they will show up late to big appointments, fail to properly qualify clients, and cost you deals."
bad,"I was charged monthly fees for copy paper, desk, ink, errors and omissions insurance while trying to establish my own business."
bad,The benefits are horrible. There is no sense of direction or leadership.  No professionalism.   You aren't motivated by leadership.  There is no sense of loyalty or trust amongst the employees or executives.  The company culture and mindset is dated and out of touch with current trending mindset and work environments.
bad,"The staff manager is so far up his corporate boss butt he does NOT go to bat for employees when they have any problems. He also talks behinds each admins back when they take time off causing pettiness and  alliances to be formed between the women he over sees. This office is painful to work in. No one is happy except staff manager who loves causing evryone to hate each other. "
bad,I felt as though working here was a scam. It was a way for the company to get me to reach out to my friends and family only and get them to sign up for life insurance. They actually never paid me for the time I did work.
bad,Not a great place to work unless you like to play the politics game in order to advance.  Hard work and dedication are not valued here.  Management does not display any loyalty.
bad,"They throw you into the deep end with no help, they want you do sign up all friends in family, once you do that they dont care for they have what they want."
bad,The Tampa AARP operations is one of the worst places to work.  The culture is extremely toxic.  Turn over is very high for new employees including their management team.  Most people are looking for a new job opportunity after 6 months.
bad,"Interesting place to work."
bad,"I took this job with the knowledge that there would be 3 years of educational training, but that was not the case.  They simply wanted you to master certain skills and continued to work on the same things week after week.  The only education I got out of my tenure there was the continuing education classes I took on my own time."
bad,"They throw people to the wolves and impose quotas. For me, I was discouraged from re-obtaining my Series 7,65,63 to write different types of business. "
bad,The management lies to you to lure you in...Then they send you a bill for it...
bad,"NYL may be one of the big insurance companies, but watch out for the culture in the general offices... especially, in Horsham, PA! ... The managers recruit you very heavily; and the one that recruited me used manipulations by misrepresentation and half-truths."
bad,I believe this is more a job for someone who does not like to work very much or very hard. The company does not help you with a book of business. You have to sell before you can be considered as an employee for the company. Altho they say it is a salary + commission wage it is not. It is strictly commission with little incentive your first year with the percentages decreasing per year. For someone looking for a more stable 9-5 job this is not for you.
bad,"If you are new and trying to break into the business do not work for New York Life. All I have to say is chargebacks. People in this economy will not pay long term for insurance. No benefits to help you run your business. Everything is on you. No gas, no cell phone, no cpu, nothing. You will spend all your money back in your business and long term nothing. Plus its hard to get a case approved."
bad,"After college I was recruited and decided to give it a try.I have been an agent with New York Life for 2 years now, and have recently decided to look for opportunties elsewhere. If you are experienced, cut throat, and want to make a life long career out of sales, then this might be a good fit for you. Otherwise, I have seen 9 out of 10 agents fail. You need to have at least 6 months worth of personal and business expenses saved up before starting this job as there is no compensation other than your comissions. They do not provide you with leads, but instead urge you to kick start your business by selling to your friends, family, and neighbors. They encourage a ""you need to spend money to make money"" philosophy, and your value to the company, regardless of money or time invested, is only equivalent to your current monthly performance. As soon as you are hired, management will set you free to work on your own, while they continue to recruit more agents. If you have trouble, which my experience has shown every agent to experience some trouble, they pair you up with a senior agent. So not only are you barely making comissions, you are now having to share the few sales you close."
bad,"Very hard to maintain a life outside of this 100% commission position. Prospecting daily, monthly goals to reach numbers, Early days and Long nights. Wouldnt recommend this position"
bad,New York Life does not provide adequate support initially to get started. You need to pay for everything including your phone and photocopies. It is very difficult to succeed there in a 100% commission position.
bad,They don't tell you that your contract is only six months to start and if you don't sell the required amount of premium they cancel it with no warning and don't pay you for the policies you wrote.
bad,"I thought this would be my 'forever' company where I could retire from. This particular boss is KNOWN to be demeaning and condescending but this is not only accepted but somehow condoned.  She brags about what a 'crabby' boss she is (her words) but it's accepted even by the SVP of the department (who will protect her assistant when this boss picks on her and badgers her) - be very careful about such a small department when the other 2 employees talk about a boss behind her back, smile to her face, but laugh at her childish and deplorable behavior. I was so disappointed! I'm sure there are other departments that have better people but my experience (and others based on the high turnover) was not what the face of the company portrays."
bad,"There is potential for a lot of success, but be educated on the products your selling, and be mindful of the relationships you are putting at risk by pitching insurance products. Driving from appointment to appointment will add up, especially if the return isn't there. Because you are commission only, there is no guarantee that your bills are paid, and they have strict rules regarding having additional employment (no part time jobs) and college courses in progress (you can only take one class during the semester and they will know). Your life will be New York Life, and you should be prepared."
bad,"NYL is a great place to work at if you are seeking a commission based position or business opportunity. On every hiring ad on indeed, they say an amount of a salary - that is not true, at least not a new hire - maybe 2 years in the company doing your consistent sales quota's.  NYL does not offer a salary or hourly pay position. That is false advertisement. Sure, they interview you just to see if you have a valid social and clear background - in reality, anyone that has those qualifications can work with NYL. They train you and show you there business model - so if you walk in to there interviewing you are already hired; in a way and if you have a life/health license with some financial services experience that's an instant hire - but only for commission. I guess the company is great for growth and learning. Don't let them trick you in offering you a salary off the bat."
bad,Didn't receive management support when working in the field.
bad,"The training was awful. They took you in, sent you to classes and then you were on your own. I had no idea what I was doing. They want you to get all your friends and family signed up, then your training ends. Extremely high turn over rate in our office. They had us calling from the phone book to try and set up appointments."
bad,"In the interview it was one thing and actual work another"
bad,"had a bad year due to illness,  then found out  that I needed to take a leave of absence in order for  my 3 mo. illness to be considered in being nonproductive  if I don't  meet my goal, in which I am  trying very hard to reach, they are going to take away my benefits my life ins. and my residuals.  Not very happy with management and  corporate."
bad,"Stay Away, NYL does not value the employee. Company culture is gone, co-workers are timid and afraid to lose their job. Good luck getting support India."
bad,"While some may enjoy a job where they can get paid and do nothing, I personally  do not.  I literally did absolutely nothing for 8 1/2 hours. I got hired to do data entry/administrative work specific, but was told by management they didnt have time to train me but instead they hired someone else a week later and trained them on the job I got hired to do. They are very bias at the location in which I worked."
bad,"This was probably the worst place I have ever worked at.  Managers are mean bullies and unprofessional.  The best way to describe the work environment is to compare it to dealing with school yard bullies that have not better to do then to pick on and gossip about employees that's not consider in the inner circle."
bad,"Not a good company to work for. Not rewarding at all. You work endlessly to hit your sales goals. For the amount of effort,  energy and time you put into this company. You get compensated very little"
bad,"Nice job environment, the compensation does not reflect what the management tells you. The career advancement is very difficult."
bad,"there are fees that in the intterview didnt say you.  Once you signed contract  with them tthe company raise those fees."
bad,"Full benefits are offered to employees. No base pay. Strictly commissions with some bonuses. If you are looking for a place to build your own book of business then this is a great place to start. But beware .. there are quotas to hit, if you don’t hit your quotas then you are gone and guess what, they keep your clients you prospected for? Not for everybody. Worse employment decision I have ever made."
bad,"compensation is horrible and at $75 a term life policy, i would have to sell hundreds a month as opposed to two to survive.  cold calling and paying for leads will bleed you dry and make you go insane"
bad,"Budget cuts cause you to work the jobs that 3 people should. Noone knows the job and nothing is documented, all training is done from different people by word of mouth."
bad,Slow moving dinosaur.  Certain members of senior leadership are racist.  They take care of the people who have been there for over 20 years but have no issue throwing out new people.
bad,"Your friends and family become prospects, no paid salary so it is feast or famine for most agents, no leads provided by company, you are expected to network on your own and cover all expenses of doing so in hopes of selling a policy"
bad,"Management is poor. There is no direct career path and they speak on developing something each year , but no work or progress has been made. When you ask questions about your career growth there is no clear answer and the buck is passed for someone else to answer the question, but nobody has an intelligent or honest answer"
bad,In order to be successful in this role you have to dedicate long hours for first 3-4 years. This role is commission only. Benefits are great but very expensive.
bad,There is not much room for advancement.  They lied to us day 1 and they lie to their elderly customers to get a buck.  This is not the work place for me.
bad,I went to my first interview and was told i would have the support of staff to help with obtaining clients and leads. At the second interview i was told i would be on my own to find my own clients. I had spent 3 weeks now working with this company only to find out that i have to pay for my office space and nothing is offered on return. The tools they gave to find leads are free to everyone and mostly just lead to the use of facebook and linkdin. Very sorry i wasted my time with the company.
bad,"The first full year there I reached the council position there and although my gross commission was $50,000 my net salary for the year was closer to $20,000. The reason I left was due to my spouses illness and death. I had to care for prior to her death and I couldn't leave her alone. The human resources department cut my health coverage when my spouse was on her death bed. All the supervisors and the managing partner fought for my status to remain an agent with full benefits. The company didn't follow the American Disability act. I just didn't want to fight it in any way and left the company after over 3 years there."
bad,"Selling insurance the training is GREAT. some of the managers are helpful. Some managers all ways offers empty gesture"" let me know what I can do for you or let me know how I can help you"" when you ask them for help they pass you on to another agent who is looking for half or all the comm."
bad,"This company is probably great for agents who tow the line but for employees it's like the living with the KGB. No one speaks honestly for fear of reprisal. Huge egos abound because the only thing that matters at NYL is if you've worked there for a long time. I've seen operations managers completely mess up licensing and forge signatures but since they had tenure? Not fired. Zone management is all about their titles and that's it. They are robots spewing canned rhetoric. Good pay, but you will earn it. I could not stomach the hypocrisy..."
bad,"Strong heritage and reputation for doing good for their clients. The power of the name carries alot of weight  when you have conversations,may even keep people on the line or open a door or two."
bad,"Overhead put me into debt, run like a pyramid scheme, took forever to get paid, bullsh*t admin fees that weren’t disclosed upon hiring, I don’t know what else to say other than don’t work here and embarrass yourself in front of friends and family because that’s basically what they make you do... you get to sell a product that nobody is looking for and it alienates your friends and family"
bad,"I had a horrible experience with management. The current president of the Long Island likes to have these lengthy weekly meetings on several days. Completely nonproductive. They spent a lot of money in advertising and fancy offices and their Agents, at least ones at the bottom of the food chain suffer, they promise an expense allowance that I never got and training allowance, which is ok, but it is not a salary... It's like they have all controls over you but no ownership of the other social and legal factors such as paying your taxes, when due, only if they choose to do so...Managers get a cut of what you make, plus salary, pension match free, 401k and expense allowance... But when something bad happens, your manager is far from helping... Not a good place to work in my eyes..."
bad,I was recruited right out of college and was sped through the hiring and training process and my ability to produce suffered. there is a ton of room for advancement if you can survive. management was a mixed bag mostly unfit and lacked leadership.
bad,"100% commission based job. Maybe 1 out 50 agents really attain success(mild success). Most agents are gone within a couple weeks, maybe a month. I was given misinformation about products which led to upset clients. I realized some success in the first 2 years, but was advised to use some ""creative"" sales in order to get there. You pay for a cube you don't use, a phone you never use, and well everything else is out of your own pocket. I ended up digging myself into debt when the market dried up, as hundreds of agents before me did as well."
bad,"Not accepted the day I walked in the door. Very clique like environment. If you are not someone's friend you are basically on your own. Managers hold grudges and pick favorites. Don't appreciate effort or hard work unless you are friends. In house benefits like having a gym on campus are only as good when you allow employees time to use it. Very rude and curt like people. If you are a person who is kind and works to be inclusive of everyone, this is not the place you want to be."
bad,"They have a lot of meeting that are very helpful but once you have gone through your family and friends. they do nothing to help you get more people. They told me that I would have a salary for three years of $75,000 a year and as my commission go up the salary would go down so I would make at least $75,000 a year. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN !"
bad,New York Life is currently outsourcing it's IT department. They are currently replacing workers in their IT department as soon as their replacements are trained.
bad,hours were great but being straight commission in this industry was tough. I was only there for 6 months
bad,"I believe in the overall product offered by NYL. Unfortunately, the local management was not helpful in guiding or grooming talent. The manager was more about himself than he was about grooming incoming talent. He has since been relocated and overall, I would recommend NYL's product."
bad,"culture of company offensive "
bad,"I love sales and am a very competitive individual. I can handle this type of work load. I did not like talking to people about death and being prepared when they die. I tried to schedule a time to sit down with acting GM for about a week, while not actively attending training. Instead GM got annoyed with me and terminated my contract effective immediately. Apparently, according to them, I signed something stating that if my contract is terminated before my commissions are paid....... they keep the money I earned while using my gas and time to travel around town - honestly nice people - until you are counting on them to keep a roof over your head"
bad,"Everyone needs life insurance as part of a  balanced portfolio, but it is not an easy or fun sell. Make sure your family buys your policies because that is how you start your book of business. It really isn't fun."
bad,"I was initially told by the recruiter that this job entailed 90% Finance and 10% insurance if worked that way and got my required licenses. This is because she knew what I wanted to hear. The reality of things, 90% Insurance and 10% (if that at all) Finance."
bad,I earned that pure cold calling and 99% rejection ratio are not for me. NYL and others like it have very low retention due to the nature of the work. I can't say that they are better or worse than others of their ilk.
bad,"This company is not good to work for. The goals are unreasonable, and the management does not assist properly in meeting those goals. The management usually boasts about their accomplishments insurance."
bad,They say if you can make 2 new client appointments for 2.5 weeks ahead you will make a lot of money. Well thats fine in the first few months but then when you run into a road block they turn a blind eye on you.
bad,This is not a job. its a business and one needs to accept everything that come with running a business in order to get into this field.
bad,Great company to work for if you are part of the Old Guard.  The overall NYL office culture is one of underwhelming performers who are afraid to take risks.
bad,"It's a tough job, unless you are experienced in financial services and have extensive experience building a book of business I would recommend you look elsewhere. That being said it is a very easy place to get a job at and it looks really good on a resume. Ultimately, it will be less expensive than an advanced degree and look just as good to future employers."
bad,"I was intended to be an intern while in college, got roped into a full time job. They expected the same from me as a part time college student as full time agents."
bad,"Manager was awesome. Really great to work for, cared, and was great with training. The worst part about NY Life is its commission based. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the type of worker you are."
bad,"NYL has undergone a Transformation where most of the internal support functions have been and are being outsourced to external companies."
bad,"Poor upper management creates low office morale. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of good, talented people lost. Call center is ruled with fear in it's employees. Excessive favortism, neopotism (relations under different names, even working in same department, same team). Poor HR in policies & procedures. Written warnings/final warnings not properly issued or managed-set up for failure is rampant. But New York Life likes to look good from the outside, but someone needs to start taking a look on the inside. New York Life itself is a reputable company, but AARP operations in Tampa, FL is not the Best Workplace in the bay area. Management does not put in a good fight on behalf of their subordinates, very two faced, back stabbing environment. Beware!"
bad,Great company with awesome products but it's strictly commission based. I wasn't informed of a lot of things up front during the interview process and it took a good while before I finally got paid. Don't go into this unless you have extra income to live on.
bad,My manager chose to lead his team the wrong way by instructing us to do as he said not as he did and he did not lead by example. Management was unapproachable and cold when asked questions on their knowledge of how to improve in certain areas of the job.
bad,"Did not learn anything at this job. "
bad,"I tried to bring RWD (Responsive Web Design) into NYL back in 2014."
bad,"There is a stigma that will attach to you, and it makes it difficult to connect with family and friends without ostrization. Maybe it’s for you, but it wasn’t for me."
bad,"There is certainly opportunity to grow and succeed in the company, if you are willing to put up with years of below-standard pay and constantly jumping through hoops."
bad,"This job is clearly not for anyone who is in any way shy about bothering strangers or generally on the shy side at all. You won't make any money at all without being very much a ""people person"""
bad,They just want your friends and family and they don't care whether or not you make money. If you make a sale and they cancel their policy in a year you have to pay that money back.
bad,Typical office environment.  Commission based so you got out what you put in.
bad,"Company is very successful"
bad,"Micro Managed to death.....24/7 text messages, e mails, business plans....all good to have....however, you are constantly watched and they tell you that they are ""Helping You Run Your Own Business"" while their paychecks get bigger as you pad them and get nickel and dimed for everything....they don't tell you when you get hired and sign an 80 page contract.....you will get charged for the following...."
bad,"You have to be very uninformed for you to fall for that trap . Nothing but set you up with lies . Very disappointed about myself to fall for that , I am not sure why"
bad,"Did not enjoy working for this company. The only thing they care about is money. If we did not produce they left you in the dark. In the end, the mission was to make the management richer than they already were."
bad,"New York Life is a massive company with very little advancement for older adults.  I a young person has the guts to stick it out, he or she may make it in this financial world."
bad,"Only goal was to make as much money for the managers as possible."
bad,"A very successful and dedicated Financial advisor. I strived to give prudent financial management, high-quality products, and impeccable service. Helped clients develop a sound, long-term financial strategy to achieve their financial goals using a comprehensive array of financial products and services, including life insurance, investments, annuities, and mutual funds."
bad,"NY Life provided no leads, and had more experienced agents go out on my leads- and take half of any commission I earned.  Turnover rate was very high, people being hired and leaving on a daily basis."
bad,"Limited advancement opportunities."
bad,"NYL fails to retain managers and agents due to the company's inability to promote a healthy sales environment in order to build employee satisfaction. Prospecting for clients takes time and effort, the sales incentive and agent compensation plan at NYL does not provide sufficient income in exchange for the time and effort put in by the agent/employee for the first and second year in production. The commission structure and renewal GRID is to complicated to understand. Not enough team building promoted at the branch level."
bad,"Prefer to remain ""professionally objective"""
bad,Mistakes of other organizations fail to be considered when decisions are made.  Foresaking the foundation element both is IT and sales has become a baseline for this company.
bad,"Poor managers, lack of career advancement and definitely no way to sharpen or develop skills... very big on nepotism.  They want to nickel and dime u and not pay."
bad,"There is a lot of work to do but taking off would probably reflect badly on your productivity. There aren't many permanent positions available so don't even bother applying here internally. Its a very repetitive boring job, nothing really to look forward to. There's nothing hard about this job its just tedious work that no one really wants to do."
bad,Only 100% commission based living. Selling Life and Health Insurance in my primary year in the industry here was way too complex and difficult to feed a family.  Bad structure for new agents coming in. Only built for veteran agents.
bad,"Management lied to agents, didn't know how to calculate compound interest, encouraged dishonesty to clients, lied to clients and then bragged about it during training."
bad,hard to advance and earn money. everything is commission based no work hours poor management. Good opportunity for a beginner in the insurance field. very far from home
bad,"Stressful place to work due to commission based pay. Most contracts with New York Life do not let you have another source of income and you cannot sell any other products from other companies until after 3 years of being with the company. That makes it difficult to work there because you are limited on products to offer to the client and not all clients want the products offered with New York Life. Also, the premiums on those policies are much higher than other companies so other companies have a higher advantage."
bad,"Initially, the position was very interesting and a lot of support from colleagues.  After restructuring, our new managers were sales people, not consultative or planning people.  They did not understand what we did and tried to fit everything into a sales package, which is generally a very sophomoric way to approach wealth and business succession planning.  Most enjoyable part of job was working with other attorneys who were experienced and loved discussing projects."
bad,Too much finger pointing and dysfunctional environment.  Hard to succeed if you aren't an agent.  Agent's are allow to abuse staff as long as you're a big producer.
bad,"Was hired with the expectation of being trained with product knowledge."
bad,"People are numbers. Managers are sharks. To work with them you need to be able to sell your sold to the devil. I was convinced by recruiters that they wanted me for financial services profiling, but they only needed me for selling financial products."
bad,It is really hard if you have no family around to be your clients to help get your business off the ground. a lot of cold calling as a result.
bad,"You definitely need financial security before accepting this job. Very difficult if you don't sell and there is no income for that week. I love when I do have someone realize the need for life insurance. But not everyone thinks that way, unfortunately. I wish NEW YORK LIFE provided commission to get you through those rough weeks. But not to take advantage of it either."
bad,"It was a very educational job, I did learn about the financial industry which I did not learn in school. I felt like a number with very little motivation and assistance from managing partner (not all partners were alike) Some partners were very helpful in planning a case for presentation."
bad,Building a book of business is a challenge that needs to be met with a plan and business capital to give you time to implement the plan. New York Life has a great product training program. They also attempt to give you the sales skills to prosper. Unfortunately the name flow of new prospects is a challenge that I was not able to master.
bad,On average only 20% make a living.  They go through a lot of people every couple of months.  You can make a lot if you have a lot of contracts.  You need to go to training a few days every week that you are not paid for.
bad,"Started out very excited. If you are new to industry there are no leads to grow your sales, You are on your own and expected to handover all of your leads. Their idea of help is to teach you how to network. Lots of work for several months until you hopefully trigger then provided some pay. Unfortunately now a ""burn and churn"" mentality."
bad,Very tough business to get started in. They will rely on your close family and friends for the first couple of years in order to get you sales. It is a strange hierarchy for sure.
bad,"My supervisor wasn't interested in my developing my career only in enhancing his. Since I had minimal support until my last couple of weeks, I got another position elsewhere."
bad,You have to have money to pay to get leads through mailings or events. Constantly work leads and make sure you have saving to live off because it could take months to make a sale.
bad,The people are great. But the training is not so good. The product is great but the teaching is terrible. They expect for you to generate a ton of business upon coming aboard but don’t show you how it should be done. They are very knowledgeable on their products but don’t train you to apply what they teach you. If you ha e a lot going on you might want to wait to have time and money in place to take on a career like this.
bad,"The company hardly listens to any complaints you make about anything, whether it be working conditions or other coworkers. There was little ability to move further in the company, as well as no incentive to move further as they always hired from outside of the company instead of offering promotions, as well as a very small pay increase and raises were never to be mentioned."
bad,NYL was a terrible employer for me. Months after quitting I am still receiving payments from them because they miscalculate commissions.
bad,It is a sales position and they ask you to gather sales lead among your family and friends who are from the Latin community.
bad,"A typical day at work will have mandatory overtime (especially Monday or 1st of the month) so first things first is to go into work a couple hours before the schedule I chose. Go into work, load 15 different programs (and multiples of some of those), and have the systems ready to use before I can clock in. (First 10 minutes of your time are FREE!). The work is actually part of the job I enjoy. The customers can sometimes be difficult, but rarely unreasonable. I will typically answer between 50-90 phone calls resolving billing issues mostly in a typical day. Although the program only offers 3 types of insurance, I have been able to learn a lot about the inner and outer workings of insurance."
bad,This is not an innovative company but the sales team is great. 
bad,There is no work life balance and long days and hours with no pay.  If you elect to become an agent its best suited for someone who can go a long time without pay.
bad,Multiple attempts to try and provide structure and incentives to new employees.  Most of the early training was wasted on management trying   to appeal to materialistic goals for the newcomers.  As time passed intimidation became more the norm.  On the positive there were some management people who extended a helping hand and 'hit the streets' with newcomers and helped with their presentations and solicitations. New York Life's products are expensive but they are well structured.
bad,"The main reason I continue to work here is because the pay is decent and this job helps pay the bills. This company is racially divided and not all colleagues are treated failry. They're at risk of losing lots of good workers due to negligent managers, office politics and due to a conniving and morally bankrupt culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about life insurance, answering calls and speaking with different types of customers. Multiple customers and potential customers have voiced their frustrations about being harassed by agents and reps constantly trying to sell insurance to them after declining the services. It has the potential to be better, but at the rate we're going not much will change. Not all money is worth it."
bad,"The pay and incentives are very good if you have a book to bring over or are an extremely good prospector. The onsite middle office people (greater NY) are very responsive. "
bad,"Supervisor has her own agenda without regard to diligent workers, only detrimental input upon review. When leaving was not understanding of why I would leave when there was never any positive input for the work I did."
bad,There business model is outdated for the current marketplace. If you don't have connections to affluent people you will not do well. Also the training is limited as well as the product offerings
bad,"Work life is a strong point.  Advancement is terrible. Management is terrible.  Everyone is self centered and only worry about themselves.  Layoff’s happened. Knowledge walked out the door.  Layoffs are coming, more knowledge leaving.  Consultants do not have any idea on the depth of the data and the interrelations with multiple forms of data. H.R. and senior leaders appear to be far removed from the daily work."
bad,Management needs major help.  Many unethical practices being conducted.  Favoritism is off the charts.  Managing Partner only takes care of those he personally recruited.  The Development Manager is wet behind the ears.  Knows little to absolutely nothing at all.
bad,paid on commission only so you need to be task oriented and willing to go out and make the work for yourself. very little help from management if you are unable to produce.
bad,"Never understood their business model, commissions are low for life insurance at 50%, partners and management must get huge overrides on you for this low of a payout.  Many join management after only a year or two in business which tells me they could not make it in this business themselves. Those who can ""do"" those who can't ""teach"". Training is good when experienced partners teach, otherwise not so much when a person with only a year or so in the business. Also charge for access to NYLIFE portal, phone, marketing, printing, copying etc. I can understand some of the charges but some are nickel and dime and it appears to me that NYL makes money off of the agents by requiring you to pay for these services. If you have no experience this may be the place for you otherwise I would go for a higher payout for your work. Most life companies pay 80% or more. Do not build a book of business here as all management has access to your book and is not afraid to call on your clients. On more than one occasion I received a call from a fellow agent saying ""I happened to run in to blank"" and he said he wants to do some business with me. I said really, my brother in law wants to do business with you ?  If you really want to build a business don't waste your time here. It is hard work and if you want to be rewarded for it... go independent."
bad,"Lots of cold calling, and tring to get through to people about financial products that they were not terribly interested in. A difficult sell. Lots of information available but New York Life actually charges you for your cubicle and phone line."
bad,"Working with a new department for a company is not easy. The ""new"" department is just an extended branch from the same three. Top executives want to came seem like this is a ""new"" and exciting department but it is not. There is a lack of knowledge in management, micromanaging, new changes with out notification, and  no true departmental goals. It is a very dated and conservative environment."
bad,"The co-workers at the company on a typical day were good folks to work with, your learned from each other and supported each other durning the course of the day."
bad,"This can't really be considered a job, they will hire just about anyone with a bachelor's degree and make them promises that they can't keep. "
bad,its key to find a good partner who will work and shape you. Otherwise you are on your own. you make your own hours
bad,"A typical day at work consists of answering complaints of people who do not know where these complaints should be directed. 6 years ago I learned Assembler in a 10 week class, rarely used it in an actual work environment, 6 months ago I was enrolled in a Java class which was great and I loved learning Java, I have yet to use it in the work environment and began coding with it on my free time to stay relatively sharp.  My team members are excellent and we work well together, my manager is counting the days (less than 3 years) to her retirement and has yet to demonstrate any management skill other than setting up meetings.  The hardest part of the job is getting access to new environments so that we can actually develop new systems, while I understand that security is a serious concern, the amount of forms we have to fill out to gain access is absurd and unnecessary. The most enjoyable part of the job is shutting down my computer everyday."
bad,"I worked at New York Life for four years. Let me state that prior to my resignation, I met all my goals. I sought out opportunities, which gave me quite a large number of clients. However, they were not the ""big ticket"" clients, who won the monthly praises with awards and pats on the back."
bad,"The company underpays and overworks their employees.  Talented workers rush for the exits because of the low pay, hard work, and very little room for advancement.  The company claims a good work/life balance but reality is quite the opposite.   The majority that have stayed are a miserable incompetent bunch."
bad,"Good job for someone who likeS talking on the phone all day. Not very diverse, when I worked there. Little to no backing of employees by management. Heavy phone contact  with misogynistic callers."
bad,"Full commission , you must be hungry for money, work independent and be agressive in approaching people. You must find places where to sell life insurance."
bad,"You are expected to sell policies to family and friends. They recruit saying that they will provide warm leads, however I never saw any being given to anyone. Your are required to sell a certain number of policies to become a 'full time"" agent, and when you do your health benefits start and you begin paying for them immediately. Every month that you do not have sales your premium account is debited for the cost of benefits. You are also required to pay for your desk phone and desk 'fee'. Training partners will collect a 'split' of your commissions."
bad,"Only compensation structure is commission only. The required work attire is expensive. You're required to attend training sessions, but are only compensated for training sessions when, and if, you sell their products. Management solely blames agents effort even though they're trying to sell a product that isn't tangible and the prospective client is required by law to buy. Business is highly regulated and technical furthering the difficulty to sell their products."
bad,"working there means running your own business without a lot of support. I don't feel that that's what I wanted to do. I feel that if I'm doing all the hard work alone and getting paid like I have a lot of partners, something doesn't feel right"
bad,"The business model is to sell insurance policies to all of your immediate friends and family. They will guilt-trip you into doing it, and will tell you that if you care about them you should sell them insurance. Then inevitably you will run out of people whose relationship with you can be leveraged into a sale, and you will leave because they don't pay a salary"
bad,"Working at NYL had its up and downs, the job paid well for what they were asking for. The job was very basic and did not require a lot of thinking. If you like repetitiveness then this is the job for you. I noticed that in order to progress within the dept you had to know who to be nice to. You are just a number here. The hardest part of the job is being there all day doing the same exact thing. The most enjoyable part would have to be the hour lunches."
bad,The hours are long and the compensation is based on sales.  Within your first year you are 80% likely to fail.  Basically a pyramid scheme but legal because it's within one company and the compensation can be great.  Managers are only looking to attain more staff in order to grow their own salaries.  You are required to provide 200 names of family and friends in order to start your sales portfolio.  Very cutthroat.
bad,"Senior Leaders have and continue to drive health of overall business in to the ground."
bad,"Be advised that this is a very high turnover industry and they are always hiring as a way to generate leads.  Once you've sold their products to your friends and family, they will throw you out like a Kleenex.  Do some people end up being very high producers? Yes, but they are the exception and not the rule.  Not to mention the products sold are bad.  They want you to sell permanent life insurance to everyone, when it isn't suitable for everyone, as it is the most profitable product they sell.  They will NOT pay for your licenses, but will only reimburse you for them."
bad,"There was no help in generating leads - it is 100% on the agent to create your own book of business. 15 hours a week was mandatory meetings, continuing education and no time spent in the field."
bad,"depends on your warm market"
bad,"When it comes down to it, this is purely a sales job.  You'll be forced to hound your friends and family as potential clients and soon you'll be known as that insurance guy everyone wants to avoid."
bad,"You have to enjoy sales to like this job, if you are not a sales person than this is not the life for you, they will want you to go after the people you know since that is the easiest place to start."
bad,"You are pretty much on your own after the training is done. You have to go out and find people to sell product to. The turnover rate is tremendous. you try to find people with experience to learn from, then they leave."
bad,very independent job. no office bace or hour pay. a car is a must to make appointments and deliver policies. pros: ability to create a face to face client base. offers courses through the NYL university.
bad,Very hard to get ahead in this business.  If you know a lot of wealthy people the job is for you.  You make your own hours and it's basically like your your own time management boss
bad,"Everything that was promised was not followed through on. Unless you are living at home for free and have no bills OR are very wealthy and can afford to invest your money BEFORE ever getting paid by this company and can risk your paycheck getting reversed and owing the company A LOT of money, this may not be the best choice for you. On average, it will take about 6 months to see any ""pay check"". They promise benefits but this is only if you have people that want to sign up for an Insurance product and submit payent and have money in the bank to pay for your own benefits. This is a self funded, self initiated business. Not only are expected to devote your day to ""Training"" you are also expected to drum up business all while NOT getting paid to do so."
bad,Working for NYL as an insurance agent/ Financial Services Prof is very challenging. You are only paid commissions and have to find all of your own clients and generate your own leads.
bad,"It used to be a great company to work for.  The benefits were good, the pay was too, there was actually a ladder to climb.  Most of the employees had been with the company for 30-40 years.  They got rid of those folks in the last few years and now the turn over rate is out of control."
bad,The idea of creating a fearful scenario for a client and then provide the insurance solution was repulsive.
bad,"This was a non paid internship, I learned skills and knowledge of life insurance industry."
bad,If you are looking for a company that provides good benefits this is not the one. The health insurance is not good.  You are also charged for everything that is provided.  You pay for office space and everything that accompanies your business.
bad,Laid off 1000 people in 5 months. Blatantly lied to 100 of us saying our jobs we're safe only to be laid off 30 days later. I wouldn't trust a word. anyone of the folks over sa
bad,This position is strictly commissioned based there is no base pay and they lead you on that you are going to make right from the start. They do not give you hands on training. Cold calling off of your friends list in order to get new potential clients
bad,I passed my exam but never was compensated. It turned into a very competitive cold atmosphere. After such a stressful interview process I expected more but got less.
bad,"The culture at this company is made of the stuff you read about in a community college course as an example of poor leadership. Micromanagement, harassment, and bullying were common during my time at the Lakewood/Cleveland location. This was a terrible experience for me earlier on in my professional career. The only reason to stay was for the decent pay and tuition reimbursement."
bad,"Easy money, the late shift was terrible with late calls, changing policy and procedures on a daily basis. Poor uneducated unprofessional management. High turnover, so called background check but no drug test, but lots of employees high while working.. Very montinus. Same thing every day all day long. Good benefits, but dont get sick...."
bad,Excellent company for the clients but not for the employees/agents.Lack of leadership from the management team. Turn over a lot. Good products and reputation in the Industry
bad,"No leads, had to contact personal contacts.  Had to purchase any tools . Hadn’t received any pay in 2 months, no benefits or reimbursement. Not a good fit."
bad,"Work here if you want to be part of a turn and burn culture that will only treat you like a production number.  The Partners (glorified titles for management) will push you and have you do things they aren't willing to do themselves.  They get paid off the sales you make, and they keep struggling agents around just in the hopes they make 1 sale, because they will get paid off that.  The office pretends to be professional but "
bad,Keep your day job because you will not make any money selling insurance for a couple of years. If you are anything less than a shark things will not work out.
bad,"New York Life Insurance wasn't the job for me. It was a temporary position and there was no room for advancement. I wish that I could've stayed. A typical day would include me checking the mail for the agents that  was working under and then either making business cards or data entry in Excel. It was very slow paced and while I did appreciate the experience, it wasn't meant to be."
bad,"It's sales, so every man for himself. My office was extremely competitive. The only kind of encouragement offered by the Managing Partner was contests to beat other agents at sales. For some people, that's fun and exciting. For many, that gets old real fast."
bad,"I was only a temp there not a full time employee, so this review is based on that:"
bad,My team members were great. I did not like the leadership.  I like team work that is what make the dream work but that did not happened with leadership in New York Life in Atlanta
bad,"If you don't have a market of people who are willing to buy from you or an aggressive active sales mentality chances are very slim that you will be successful.  There is zero base salary and the only payment you receive is on commissions which you must give back if the client cancels or policies lapse for any reason. If you are in a room with 100 people, chances are 1 year later 80% or more of those people will already be gone."
bad,Call in and discuss your plan for the day with managment. Work place is very stressful and demanding. Very high turnover. The hardest part of the job is phone clinic. Cold calling on businesses and homeowners.
bad,this was for a policy holder so i am unable to give a 100 percent accurate view she was well taken care of i think maybe i would have given you a higher star program but i was a home health aide only.  The money i was given was only for my grandmother and i only took it because i needed to feed my children but it was an honor taking care of my loved one and i did so with all good care.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working for New York Life (AARP call center division) were the volunteer opportunities and off-site mixers with co-workers. When I was hired, there was supposed to be a ""work-life balance"", yet every week for over a year and a half there would be mandatory overtime and you would not always be able to choose where that would fit into your schedule. The hardest part of the job was undergoing some form of ""training"" for one day and then being thrown into a skill queue once every three months and being expected to remember obscure bits and pieces that were not your main everyday job. The schedule was all over the place and after I fought tooth and nail to get promoted with performance awards, I tripped and sprained my ankle and missed two days of work. Two days of work being missed is what will get you put on attendance discipline within a 6 month rolling period. The morning I was supposed to get promoted I didn't even know, but had team members congratulating me, only to be told later by my manager that because of the absences- his manager would not be able to promote me, even knowing the circumstances and having the note from the hospital. Most effort ever wasted in my life. If you want to go somewhere and be looked at as a number and have decent benefits/competitive pay, then it's okay. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. As you could imagine, I took a position the following week with a different company."
bad,"I would not recommend this as a profession.  The industry is too cut throat for any decent and educated individual.  If honesty is vital to you, pass this type of job by."
bad,"disappointing experience. came in as an intern and was disappointed by culture, management and the personnel. left after a few months because it was not where i wanted to be"
bad,It's a sales job where you have to work with people who are already in your network. It is usually uncomfortable and unsuccessful so as a result most people fail at this job. People with large networks can make a lot of money and the sky's the limit. This job is not for younger people with few friends who actually have money to spend.
bad,"If you are fresh out of college, and looking to strike it big then don't choose New York Life. They'll squeeze you for every lead that you have then they'll dispose of you."
bad,I worked as an insurance agent.  I really enjoyed working here.  The job was laid back.  If you know the right people you can get them to do business with you and make a lot of money
bad,They non stop talk about how great their training is. Yet my first appoitment by myself I had at least nine mistakes. The don't help you and they don't care
bad,It's a good company and they provide great solutions for the client.They are a company that is respectable and noteworthy and deserving of its reputation.
bad,"Pleasant work environment with friendly staff."
bad,"Reviewing document to clear policies"
bad,"Could have been a very long career, but management made promises and never delivered.  If they told you that you needed to ABC and you would get XYZ, after you did ABC they would tell you that you also needed to ABCDEFGHI in order to XYZ."
bad,"The business is busy, supporting sales agents.  The office is small and many of the people there are friendly, but in order to ""game"" the system.  New people are trained by the ""It takes a village"" without any structure.  The legacy staff can get away with coming in late and passing off work they don't want to do because the office manager wants to be friends and doesn't know how to treat everyone fairly.  No professionalism and no guidance for anyone new."
bad,"-The compensation for New York Life agents is 100% COMMISSION, despite what you may be told during an interview. There is zero guaranteed compensation. The monthly ""training allowance"" for an agent is only paid to them during months in which the agent is able to earn at or above a minimum dollar amount of commission (That amount can be difficult to reach). During an interview, however, you will likely be told that the training allowance is guaranteed each month."
bad,It used to be a great place to work for - not anymore. Very slow moving and cumbersome bureaucracy. Low morale. Senior management does not have a clue.
bad,Recruited people to become financial planners. Provided onsite human resources employee relations guidance.
bad,"My day starts with reviewing all of my emails to stay current with everchanging requests and events. I then turn to all the medical records that I have received to review them immediately, just in case I need to order more information. Every case is different so I learn the cause and effect of several different medical conditions. My co-workers are great, the most enjoyable part of my job are my agents. They are a joy to work with and the mutual respect that we have for one another is beyond just an 9-5. Hardest part is the micromanaging and managment that has become a very stressful part of the environment. "
bad,Another sales job offering just commission. It's life insurance! Need I say more?
bad,"Nice company and good training program. Not easy when comes to sales, but if you can make it, there is great potentials."
bad,"NY Life had a 100% commission pay structure and Agents were responsible for many fees, i.e., phone, desk space, basic office supplies. Extremely high turnover which added to much dissatisfaction amongst both current and former employees."
bad,"It is a nice company, with good mission and vision. In general is a good place for peopel with sales expirience, for people without expirience in sales it will be dissapointing."
bad,Typical life insurance company that will hire almost anyone to chew up their friends and family contacts. If you do not have a huge network to rely on to provide clients you will struggle
bad,It was an extremely fast paced work environment and a lot was expected of the employees. The pay and benefits were good and I didn't dread going to work.
bad,This is not your 9-5 consistent income. The objective here is that you’re trying to SELL to the people you already know. You’re selling life insurance and you will be owning your own business but partnering with NYLIFE. This may be something for you if you put your blood sweat and tears into this. They try to sell you this position as best as possible. Anything you say they try to flip it to make it seem like this job is golden. Take some advice from me.. do your research before coming here
bad,"The company benefits are good.  The coworkers are good.  The 401k is amazing.  The management is terrible.  It is a private company, so there is little with regard to checks and balances as compared to a public company.  As a result, management has run amok. It appears major strategic decisions change with little more than a whim."
bad,"The philosophy is if no one buys from you  are literally ousted one is expected to work tirelessly recruit every member or your family to create some kind of momentum."
bad,It's an ok place to work if you are in the call center and have no family. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are in school as well. Scheduling is inconsistent and always an issue
bad,"I’ve worked for many companies and they are by far the worst.  Do not work here, work at McDonald’s they pay more and have much better benefits.  Everything is policy and procedure, one step out of line and you’ll know IMMEDIATELY"
bad,I felt like the recruiters were really scraping the bottom of the barrel with recruits. One guy seriously looked like they found him on the street. I always felt like I was always pushed to be an annoying person when I was out - I couldn't just live my life - we were constantly fighting to stay at this company and I don't even know why I stayed as long as I did. I think I was chasing the possibility of making six figures in my first year. Its highly unlikely.
bad,"If you're a person who is comfortable working with a commission based job, but offers a potential lucrative future and the opportunity to meet variety of people from different career backgrounds, then this is the career for you."
bad,Used to be a good company to work for. Now like many other US companies everything is being outsourced. Huge changing of the guard has taken place and they are in major cost cutting mode.
bad,"Work is very static daily once settled in. Same projects in and out. Management might make promises about assisting with advancement on your career path, but it never tends to go anywhere as every time they hire from outside the company over several team members who were more than qualified and had worked there for many years. Good for solid work, but not for advancement."
bad,"Not proud to work here as I used to be.  Overrun with consultants and poor management.  They would rather hire consultants than teach loyal, capable, employees and promote from within."
bad,You made your own hours which was convenient but you there was no base pay.  So if you didn't sell anything then you didn't you get paid which was one of the reasons that I left.  I needed something that had some more stability.  I was coming right out of college and I needed a job that guaranteed a paycheck.
bad,"managers play favorite. Also, if you do not continuously go out and find clients, no one cares at all. You also pay for parking every day you go to the office and they bad mouth you if you don't like it.  They hype up the marketing they help you do...but it does not really help. They will bait you in by saying you get 650 bucks a week salary. It's all commission so don't fall for it. There aren't any leads and if there is a rare few to give out....they'll give it to the favorites."
bad,NYL is downsizing ans shipping work offshore. Employees that have been here the longest are being terminated. Technology work is being shipped to India.
bad,Wouldn't recommend.  All commission and no leads.  A lot of turnover.  Maybe 2% are still there after 3 years.  Do give required training for enhanced commission for first 3 years.Those few that make it can do well.
bad,"If you like not having any free time and only thinking about work, this is the place for you to work at! Constant grind and huge turnover rates. Try somewhere else first if you want to be in finance."
bad,No advancement they show favortism. They pay more than alot of jobs in the area. I worked here almost four years still on the phones even though I have proved that I do a great job.
bad,"As a sales agent, I depended my entire salary on commission so you are only paid on what you bring in.  However, they don't really give you any help or tools to be successful.  They tell you to go to your friends and family to bring in business and rely on referral from them.  However, once you are past your inner circle, it is very difficult.  I must say though if you are able to generate a lot of business, you can be very well compensated for it.  The company just doesn't give you much help in leads or anything like that."
bad,Older employees are being eliminated in favor of offshore and younger workers. Management mindset changes often without regard to older experienced workers.
bad,It was tough to start working at New York Life considering that the position I held was all commission. You need to live at home with mom and dad or have a spouse that can support your bills until you get the business going.
bad,"The closest office that provides agent support is 2+30 hr away.  Frequently, required meetings or classes are scheduled at very inopportune times and for little more than an hour in length.  Thus, 7 hours are spent, essentially an entire day to participate in a one hour event.  Management flexes some but provides little to no support or compensation for the detached personnel."
bad,"Good people.  Strong brand, solid company.   Very unrealistic expectations and demands placed on agents, which make it extremely difficult to sell.  I would think twice before accepting a position at this company, unless you are able to sustain yourself financially for several years comfortably with little income."
bad,"Busy in meeting and follow up weekly status meeting with managers."
bad,"I am going to be brutally honest, starting with the Cons:"
bad,"Salary is based on commission, No salary. Sales are really tough"
bad,"I learned a lot about life insurance. Management for me was mixed. There are some good managers with NY LIfe and there are some bad managers. If you show effort, they will help to a certain extent. However, this is a business. My co-workers were great. I still keep in touch with most of them to this day. They are your best support group. Hardest part of the job is keeping a positive mental attitude. You will work like you never worked before to prospect for potential clients. Remember you do not get paid unless you get a check and a signed application. I was the only agent from my class of 6 to survive more than 2 years."
bad,If you are looking for flexibility then this is the place for you. If you love sales then this is the place for you. Time management is a must working for this company.
bad,"NYL is a company with great benefits for the employee. Unfortunately, it has a highly political corporate culture which makes your work life extremely difficult."
bad,"If you're good at sales then it's worth the shot.  Other then that I would strongly consider other options.  You do have potential to make a lot of money, so that is what intrigues people. Only 1 out of 7 people make it 3 years."
bad,No base pay. Similar to a pyramid or MLM. No work life balance. You work hard but often times will not reap the reward. There was no job shadowing and you are pretty much on your own other than in classes one day a week for a couple hours.
bad,I learned very quickly that I would be on my own.  The training program is great except they don't pay you anything unless you start selling insurance.
bad,"You are a captive agent and are paid only on commission. You have to tap your warm market (family and friends) and if that does not get you a good footing, then you are likely not to generate enough income to continue there."
bad,"This is a company to avoid at all costs whether you are an employee or potential client.  They will try to shovel the average person into products that have long lock in periods so your assets are no longer liquid.  The agent who solicits you will most likely be gone within 6 months, but you will be stuck with a multi-year or lifetime contract that will incur significant losses to get out of.  As an employee you can expect them to nickel and dime you to death, while offering no salary, but commission only.  Also, they will be very aggressive about you selling to friends and family and mining your personal connections so they can solicit them after they let you go.  As a client, you can expect an inexperienced advisor who is being pushed by a ""partner"" (glorified recruiter) to sell any and everything, regardless of if it's the best fit for you.  Most of the newer agents have zero experience, and turnover is close to 90% per year."
bad,They treat you like a number. It's in their company culture. They make you feel like you are helping the client but in reality you treat them as if they are commission.
bad,This is not a job fit for everyone. The main goal to succeed in this job is to have contacts always available to contact. Referrals also help with achieving success.
bad,"Work culture was great, but the management was a little shaky and skeptical. Compensation isn't worth it in my opinion. Also compensation looks great, but much of it comes with difficult stipulations to achieve it."
bad,"Day to day pace is slow, which is nice, but there are challenges in doing tech work for a non-tech company. Probably the same story with all such companies."
bad,"Truth be told, the percentage of agents who succeed and move on to year 2 is very low . Maybe 6%. Yes, earning capacity has no limit, but actual income earned is low. 100% prospecting and finding clients is on the agent. You are expected to sign up yourself and family members to meet required production numbers.  In a sense you are your own boss, so being diligent and regimented with your work time is a must. "
bad,"Overall the management at the company is terrible.  There is division between the VPs, they do not work together, rather they fight amongst themselves - do not care for their employees they are merely pawns in their play.  "
bad,"The best and most immediate way to be successful at New York Life would be to have a spouse or parent that was successful at New York Life."
bad,"I learned that very few people make money in commission only life insurance.  Plus, they needed to do significantly more mentoring and less classwork."
bad,"word games are played to try and make you think you are earning a training salary, when in reality it is a performance based stipend."
bad,"This is a life changing and great opportunity for the right person.  The most difficult aspect is overcoming the perception of a ""sales person"" and encouraging people to let them know you want to help them, more than sell to them."
bad,"New York Life is going through many changes, most that are not good for the company or employees.  They are in the process of outsourcing all of IT, to companies with questionable skill sets."
bad,"New York Life is a very old school, New York City style corporation.  There isn't a lot of family value in the office, it's mostly about sales numbers and growth.  The management is very good at manipulating their results through the old school business tactics of fear and intimidation."
bad,"The company is very ethical, risk adverse and SLOW to make any meaningful changes. Great for a life insurance company and since life insurance is not a target for more innovative solutions, they can survive for many years with the lack of visionary leaders.  They are run like a small village and how you get along with your neighbors is more important than getting things done. Villages tend to run on gossip and not data..."
bad,The boys network is alive and well. Not all the managers are fair. Some are good but I never worked for a great one. If you show up early and are willing to work non stop for 24/7 you will do well.
bad,"There are many job opportunities. Good benefits. I had the misfortune of having worked for a very overbearing, critical manager."
bad,"Once you get in the door you can never get out. You are compensated fairly and will usually get a promotion, deserved or not, if you threaten to quit. The big quote is ""play the game"". So if you like the whole ""play the game"" idea then this company is for you. If you don't want to give 200%, work 60 hour weeks and step all over everyone else for your personal benefit, then this company is not for you. The good part is, it's nearly impossible to get fired."
bad,"Try to partner with other people. it's difficult to succeed on your own."
bad,"One of the worst managers I have ever had was"
bad,"The commission structure makes it very difficult for many to make it long-term in this industry.  It can be quite lucrative, but it is also very stressful.  I could no longer ride the wave of inconsistency."
bad,"Unless you have big book of business, it is really hard. Lots of cold calling, and the percentige is really low. They don't pay any salary. all based on commission."
bad,"In the morning they would put us in a class 3 times a week for an hour and a half learning the different products that we can sell to consumers."
bad,"They will say anything to you to get you through the door. Ambiguous onboarding and arbitrary salaries are advertised to entice. It is self paced, however the more you do does not actually equate to more money due to the nature of this business. managers do work actively with you because the more money you make the more money they make."
bad,"Good Company with good products, Hardly any training or help from management to make it. Purely commission job in a tough industry."
bad,"its all on you to make money. theres isnt any hourly pay just all commission. my manager was great to try and help build my business which makes him more money too. Get ready to harass your friends to meet with you, cold call any number you come across, go knock on strangers doors. was told ""if you have trouble making a sale, just talk to your friends with a couple hundred thousand dollars saved up"""
bad,Very cliquish.  Old boys' club type of environment.  Not a friendly culture.
bad,loved dealing with the customers- Phones started ringing at 8 am and did not stop. No break between calls to update notes etc. Difficult to find help from management when needed. Stress level higher than I have seen in my whole career. Learned a lot about insurance and occasionally free lunches for mandatory overtime. Loved most of my co-workers.
bad,"When I started I was hungry to learn about the products, strategies, process, how to best help people, and how to build my business. But I only got bits and pieces of those. They said there was no need to wait until I learned all that, I could just start selling."
bad,"Place is Not For Everyone... "
bad,"I believe this company used to be much better to work for.  There is a lot of work, only 45 minute lunch breaks, and the pay is on the low side.  Any good worker will get frustrated working here and will eventually look to leave.  Management has their heads in the clouds."
bad,"I learned during the short six weeks with New York Life that insurance is NOT the field I would like to pursue a career in for the rest of my life. "
bad,"Longevity for those that have been there for a long time, that's it. Great experience for leaning about different policies to purchase for self."
bad,It was a basic office clerical assistant job where you write letters and schedule appointments
bad,Needs thorough training program and better management that is in closer contact with the employees. Young supervisors try to intimidate younger applicants.
bad,"They were all about just getting new employee's entire ""warm market"" insurance and/or investments and  really didn't care for my personal advancement."
bad,Hunter  gatherer  commission only.  High level bureaucracy. Top producers rewarded.  Training spotty products  ok but  underwriting rigid seems to cherry pick
bad,Selling life insurance is challenging.  You need to have specific skills and connections to be successful.  Definitely not a job suitable for everyone.
bad,"I started as a contact to hire. I was out performing coworkers with 10+ years of experience. Midway through my contract we were notified there was going to be some outsourcing. After this news my training abruptly halted and I do not have the opportunity to be hired full time, even though I am still out-performing coworkers."
bad,Software architecture was poor and existing team was not interested in improving it.  It was difficult to find satisfaction in maintenance on this application.
bad,Difficult career for most but can be extremely rewarding. Make your own schedule and set your own meetings. It is a good life balance but stressful knowing when you may get paid next.
bad,"In my opinion, it was a good old boy atmosphere and lots of favoritism.  If you love sports you get ahead. I was not impressed with management nor the pay scale.  The company wasn't for me."
bad,All money you receive is commission and finding clients costs more money than actually making a sale. I do not recommend working at this company. Especially if you don't like being an entrepreneur
bad,"NYL Outsource their entire workforce and only hires consultants now.  It used to be a dynamic, and fun workplace, however, over the years that changed."
bad,"A typical work day is go to the office at 9:00Am, look for leads, cold call people or your natural market, try to get an appointment set, do marketing events on weekends and network during weekdays.  If you sell anything, you make 50% of commission of total commission, 25% paid up-front, then the other 25% once policy is delivered.  If client cancels within the 1st year, commission is pro-rated and agent has to pay back the money to the company he/she worked hard for.  You must pay with more work or you must send a check back payable to the company for the balance.  Management will give you pep talks each Monday to stay motivated and lots of the classes are boring and repetitive due to the high turnover on their employee retention."
bad,"It was easy work, everyone is very respectful "
bad,"Learned how to recruit Financial Advisors on commission based roles."
bad,Insurance agents is a very hard job to make a living at if you start as a mature older person.  It takes years to build up you book of business and surviving on commission only is very hard if not impossible.
bad,"Investments are financially sound, the company swindles it's own agents and most people work like common con-artists"
bad,"It was nice because I learned Quick Books, invoicing and how large scale printing is done."
bad,"I began my insurance/retirement planning career in 2009, one of the worst economic climates. I dedicated 2 years to building a client base and while I was one of the top performers within the new hire group, I did not make enough money through straight commission to continue. I later learned that it takes at least 5 years to build a respectable book of business."
bad,Not for everyone. Good for those starting out their career.
bad,No leads are provided.  All sales must be produced by the agent.  This is the hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed working with people and explaining the benefits of life insurance and annuities.
bad,"The 3 of us that was hired by our previous boss, who scouted us to New York Life had no idea what she was getting us all into.  Although New York Life might be a good company but our start up agency had no real support from the home office.  The 3 staff that was hired on had to go to Fullerton branch for extensive 6 months training.  Basically, we were learning what 12 people do on a daily basis."
bad,"I took a chance on this job knowing it was going to be extremely difficult and 100% commission based.  A typical day consisted of making phone calls, following up with existing clients, scheduling appointments, explaining benefits, etc.  I learned that starting a business in sales from scratch with no existing clients is very difficult.  I also learned a great deal about my own sales skills as well as retirement, investment, and insurance information.  Management was great, no complaints at all.  Especially with partners and training.  The hardest part of the job was just getting the potential client to keep an appointment.  The most enjoyable part was being able to work with people on serious problems that they face and help with solutions to those problems."
bad,No base salary and you must prospect your friends and family for sales and leads.
bad,"Though they will not admit it, New York Life wants you to sell their insurance products as a solution for everything. Obvious you say, but I find it hard to get behing selling a whole life policy, as an example, for a client to save for their childs college education. I don't think anything is wrong with life insurance, but it is not the answer for anything and everything. They will say you can sell what you want, but the way everything is taught and structured, they want the insurance sale as every solution."
bad,racist environment and only connections will get you the promotion. Traditional values are dying faster than anything. Good luck to the company.
bad,"Its simple if you work hard you play hard, but when clients drop policies you will get a reversal and the company will take their money back, meaning that if you made 5 thousand off a client and he drops the policy you will go negative 5 thousand, chances are if you dont hustle it you will starve. It is a great company and they will drill that in your head, but its not the only company. I left because I found a better opportunity with a Trillion dollar company. They will tell you what you want to hear, and if you go this route just be sure to ask about Reversals and lapse ratios, because they are big at NYL."
bad,"You will need a lot of contacts before entering this field. Management is great, but to be successful be prepared to give up all evenings and weekends"
bad,"New York Life is a great company. Their training programs are top-notch and there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. However, if you have no natural market, its a very tough job with not a lot of assistance during admin work."
bad,"Flexible personal managed hours under direct supervision and mentorship.  Continuous marketing education and learning was key, is extremely challenging and may be overwhelming for those who are just beginning their business as a producer.  Has the potential for high income earning if a large amount of time is invested outside personal comfort zone."
bad,"For the most part you control your day other than mandatory training, with lots of cold calling and canvasing. For the first three years you really need to hustle that means working nights and weekends. NYL provides all the training you need, and there is a lot to learn. Management is always looking out for you, but don’t be fooled their also out for themselves. Your peers are just like you trying to make money and doing whatever they can to make it, most of the time you’re going to want to work with someone else, it makes the day’s weeks, and months go by easier. The most difficult part of the job is finding clients to go and see, let’s face it no one wants to take about death and your selling life insurance. If you’re making sales the money and job are great, but if you’re not it could be the worst job you ever had. On top of that you have to pay for almost everything, cubical or office, phone, internet, fax, copier. So if you haven’t made any sales you can end up owing them money."
bad,"Ok all life insurance jobs are full commission which means no money until you sell a policy. Also when you start not only is it hard to sell in the beginning, you also need to sell five policies before you get your first check. You always need to find people to will set meetings with to discuss their financial which is incredibly important for most people but all are resistant. All this means you grind for at least a full year toca year and a half. After year two if you make it that far it gets much easier."
bad,"Very nice company to work"
good,"-Manager who was resigned as did not meet company standards for being a manager"
good,If you don't speak English as a second language you have no chance of making it there if your an Afro-American.The training is top notch. It's a fast pace business so you see lots of people coming in and leaving.
good,There was very little guidance or mentoring. Never having been in this industry I found this to be a great disappointment. Especially since I had two of my direct supervisors leave the company in less than 4 months from each other. I would sit at my desk and spend most of my day prospecting by phone with no coaching or advising at all. There was no way to know if I was doing anything good. Unfortunately this is a strictly commission only job and I could not afford to wait for commission checks since I have a family to provide for.
good,Do go to grater new York office.I learned a lot there but management and salary was not secure.  I learned a lot there but management and salary are b.
good,"The company is painted as the best company to work for and being number 1 in the industry. In reality, they are well beyond conservative in their underwriting process. More often than not, applicants are rated or declined. this makes it difficult to gain referrals, generate business and retain a consistent book of business.  You are expected to commit 60-80 hours per week in prospecting in order to deliver 6 paid cases each month.  This is not as easy as it is portrayed during career orientation or in new org meetings.  "
good,"-great training"
good,"There will be months you don’t make an income, policies are canceled &your commission will be reversed. You will owe commissions . Have 6+mos savings."
good,Always some mandatory meeting to go to no help in growing your business just meetings. Started off with excited  and happy to be there. quickly found out that it is more about who you know and how lucky you get to make it there.
good,"The hardest part of my job is inconsistency. Most enjoyable part is that I keep extremely busy & learning something new every day, due to the inconsistency."
good,This job is solely designed to help you pay your bills. Youhave to be ready for a fast paced working enviornment. If you have a child this is not the place where you can have a work life balance.
good,"Flexibility is the # 1 benefit. However, it is necessary to work 7 days per week (that includes weekends and evenings) to build a book of business in the 1st year, at least. "
good,You are on your own and get limited help from others. Employee turn over is high. 
good,"Training is excellent for financial planning, life insurance, and retirement. You can schedule personal time. Hardest part of the job is getting clients. It is rewarding when you do get to help people."
good,There is great support and training specially the first 3 years.  Then it’s a hunt or die career. If you are ok with endless prospecting then you can give it a try.
good,"My position at New York Life was to help outsource work to Mexico and India. It was a few month job that I did while looking for more permanent work. I wouldn't consider the work not fun, but it was very mundane and the person running the show I believe did not have the best technical expertise."
good,It was a very one sided job in the sense that they only looked at number of calls and meetings but not at the idea of really helping people who needed life insurance rather it was a numbers game
good,"As always, a successful company is managed with good people. My experience is isolated as I was involved with one manager. My dissatisfaction lies solely with the individual who hired me. New York Life (NYL) is an excellent company with much needed and important products. Sadly, my experience was tainted because of the lack of training or support from my manager.  "
good,"As with any job the management is key to success.  Don't listen to the hiring person, but speak with current and former employees"
good,"NYL has a very low retention rate, due to the poor training for new hires.  As a new hire, I felt that my potential was not cultivated by the management.  The products are adequate.  The culture at NYL is to bring people on board who are looking to be independent financial professional business people."
good,"A typical day would be getting leads"
good,Took this job after leaving Combined Life Ins! Had to prospect and pay for alot of lists out of pocket and underwriting guidelines for New York Life were very strict and hard to get policies issued!
good,"Good company, but many employees being let go. Most here are very worried about job security."
good,"NYL is a great company to work for, just not the people. Great opportunity to advance, if, it becomes available. They will sponsor you for education if u don’t have a degree for it. Management team is a hit and miss, as with other jobs. You’d be lucky to have a team who really cares about your work ethics. This company does not hire often because the people working there have been in the company for such a long time, there’s really not much openings. If u have staff that has been there for years, definitely there’s not much advancements for u to grow. And, they are stubborn. Their ways has been set."
good,"Without quality leads, this position is almost impossible for someone who is new to town. With E&0 insurance, office costs and appointment fees, you have to be active to make a living."
good,"Interviewed for a position called ""Recruiting Assistant"" and was told that my title would actually be ""Director of Recruiting"". Fancy! And a really nice title to boot! "
good,"I've had nothing but great experiences with New York Life. I would recommend this company to anyone interested. my problem was with my direct manager who didn't train, played favoritism and did not live up to his recruitment promises."
good,Still using outdated programs from the 1980's. Most ideas while encouraged are never taken serious or moved forward. Management tends to have favorites. Good benefits and work-life balance
good,"NYL charges potential salespeople hundreds of dollars for their training materials and then lets them try to earn commissions. The company tries to get everyone in the organization to get into sales, including the clerical support staff. Most people who go into sales here become frustrated and leave, as the success rate is low."
good,"very stressful environment, unable to learn effectively, told to do one thing by one person then another by someone else. I didn't know the CEO. Our primary office in Des Moines seemed to know about the behaviors of our owner but did nothing about it due to the fact that sales were productive even though turnover of assistants was EXTREMELY high in our office."
good,"At the end of the day, like any big company, NYL too only looked out for themselves and their client. Employees play a big role to the success of a company's mission but I never felt that value coming from management. I felt at any time they could let me go - and in the end, via a mass outsourcing I was laid off. Very disappointing!"
good,"Inconsistent with management style,  careless managers,  favoritism and there's never room for improvement,  promotions suck  85%  promotions are only lateral moves."
good,"The company has a well-earned reputation for excellence. However the company has a culture that is not well explained to outsiders and is only learned of through the school of hard-knocks, rather than through proper preparation by company partners and leadership. "
good,"Released an entire department of eBusiness personnel to offshore the process.  Fired workers of 30+ years tenure however not one manger was released.  "
good,"NYL has a lack of consistent leadership and poor culture that resonates of blame, inconsistency, and constantly shifting direction. This culture and fear based leadership environment makes it difficult for team leaders to grow, thrive, and be their best at their role so that they can succeed."
good,It was transition job after I was hired at Prudential. The management was very poor and inadequate. My time there was short lived and I received a better opportunity with Chase.
good,"New York life was and still is a great old insurance company!. I worked as a temp in the claims dept settling insurance claims and other compensation. Worked with the lawyers and answer phones."
good,"I could not do this as a full time career. I worked part time and enjoyed the interaction with the people but was not a fan of all the cold calling that was involved. However, great company overall"
good,"NYL is not a bad company overall, they provide you with one week training, management tries to provide lot of knowledge regarding the business, however, unless you have a great network of people who are willing to buy from you, and refer you to their friend and family, you won't succeed. This job is 24/7, making called calls, walk up to random people, attending events to meet people, and YOU PAY FOR EVERYTHING OUT OF POCKET (tolls, gas, events, lunches with potential clients, etc.) They do not provide you with any leads. They do tell you that you make your own schedule, and work whenever you want, but you work ONLY FOR COMMISSIONS so it's hard just to work whenever and from wherever you want."
good,"great training program, long hours, hard work. no wifi and you get to make your own schedule. selling life insurance is a challenging business, if you got what it takes it will require long work hours."
good,"Early morning meetings, no salary all commission. All marketing you have to do. You have to get your own book of business, soliciting friends and family members. Only few will make it in that business. Very long hours door to door knocking."
good,"If you are good in sales then there is a chance you will succeed here. However, the vast majority of people quit within the first year due to the difficulty of actually making ends meet. High risk, high reward job."
good,"This is sales & commission , clearly this was an opportunity make a lot of $$$ or flop. There is no in between with NYlife. the deal is if you are not keeping your monthly quota , you sign the resigned slip & good with your future. It was tight but life is like that sometime. Enjoyable part is meeting people making a lots of money & the hardest part is getting them to by a product & stop supporting it. = to charge back"
good,"If you are new to the industry, they have extensive training to get you going on the right path.  But you have to be dedicated to do the work."
good,Typical day is normal. The projects are interesting but travel is required between various locations.
good,Hard to balance home life with most appointments made in the evening.
good,"I love my job. I would love to see a few changes. However, patience is virtue."
good,Thanks bro I’ll call you tomorrow afternoon and see if there’s anything else that we need for you guys and I will wanna go to the store and get the stuff for you and your family for dinner and then I’ll let you know what time I’ll be there.
good,this is self employer job if yuo have the ability to work by yourself and do not have bill responsibility is a good place to work but for a single mother who need to pay rent and suply a family not is a job for you
good,Overall good company but could use better management and compensation package. Could get better at advancing your career to one that truly uses your skills and experience.
good,"Stressful and quota driven and not for agents without leads resources. The training is long and mandatory and the walk and talks process is not an unsuccessful challenge. Pressured to sign friends and family and split commission on all of the initial triggering amounts  "
good,Office position and required to do everything due to a small staff with the handling of many insurance agents requests. Its a good experience for someone finishing college.
good,"Commision only job, sell you a pipe dream, would be a good job if they provided you with a steady income with peace at mind. Its not in your hands but the consumers  hands to decide on you getting paid or not.  Oh and you have to pay for your cube space, telephone and printer etc. every month you are paying to be there"
good,"In order to be successful at New York Life, you need to have a large base of friends, family, acquaintances, etc. in order to have plenty of people to call for prospecting.  NYL does not approve of nor do they supply leads, so you're on your own.For some people, that works great, for others, it doesn't."
good,Its a good place to work if you do not have a family and can spend all day there. they do have good incetive for the employees and always try to keep them happy
good,"New York Life is the premier life insurance company in the United States.  They have a long and proud history of supporting communities across the United States.  "
good,"If you have a network of wealthy friends this may work out for you. However, it is solely commission based and that makes the job very stressful to constantly depending on making sales."
good,Typical day is making hundreds of cold calls to solicit product sales.  For every 100-200 cold calls your lucky to get 1 person to sell to.  Management makes team members compete against each other which causes team members to be cut throat.  No access to work with experienced advisers.  You learn from inexperienced co-workers.
good,I was a contracted employee. My job was to really just organize the paperwork and provide ways to bring in new customers. Very nice company and people just not a place I could see myself staying.
good,"Agents call and disrespect the call center representatives"
good,"Great place to intern, could not see myself employed but learned a lot and gained experience. Workplace culture was very fun and open all of the time."
good,"Company paid training was a perk, which lead to increased knowledge in the work place.  monitoring the LAN/WAN environment for the corporate network. Rotating shifts was one of the difficulties of the job. My co-workers were knowledgeable, professional and team oriented. Learned a great deal about F5, DNS, DHCP and emerging technologies as well as customer facing applications. IP management experience was greatly enhanced due to use of IPAM and  INFOBLOX tools."
good,"A typical day is coming to the office on Mondays for meeting first thing in the morning, Making my appointments with my clients to make a presentation about the products that New York Life has and how it would help their family in the event of their demise,"
good,"Has changed significantly in the last few years, from a beneficent, proud-to-be-here employer to a keep-your-head-down, ""what shoe is going to drop next"" environment. As others have observed, continual staff cuts (latest one announced will basically outsource most of IT, cutting 2,000 jobs). Employee population has basically broken into two groups, grizzled veterans who are reworking their financials so they can retire as soon as possible, and young new recruits who are struggling to determine what they've gotten themselves into."
good,"Management seems to be able to do whatever they want with no consequences. Especially if they've been at the company for a long time. The people I work with are great, we're like one big family.  The compensation is good but only for those who have been around a long time. They've recently hired new VP's who have now changed everything and the pay increases are no longer that good. Getting an promotion is unheard of now. The benefits though are great. 7 weeks vacation."
good,be expected to call all your friends and family. they pay is only a match to what you earn first and they only really care about selling life insurance.
good,"Sit in a cube, print reports showing daily requirements that need to be reviewed. There are no activities that promote interaction with others. Management non-approachable, closed doors most of the time. Co-workers are great, when you can find time to actually talk to them. Atmosphere is like a library, sometimes hard to stay awake. Best part of job is job security, there is so much work to be done."
good,"When I started here they emphasized on starting my own business, but they wanted everything to go their way. The management team plays favorites. If you are producing your their best friend, but if you are not producing then you are the lowest of the lows and you get treated like dirt. Compensation package was great, but that is all that is positive about them."
good,"Provided high quality bank teller functions including sales, and customer service. Compiled perfect record of daily cash balancing. Informed customers of bank products, referred customers to designated personnel, and responded to inquiries regarding account status."
good,"This is a great career opportunity with limitless income possibilities.  That being said this is a 'sink or swim' industry.  Individuals with a strong warm market or a strong business plan to attack a target market they either have connections or experience do the best.  Most agents don't last more than a year.  "
good,"Overall, I had a good experience at New York Life.  I was lucky to have worked with few great managers who shaped my accounting career, though they were actuaries.  I made great friends who impact my life daily and taught me about life, survival, accounting and finance.  I am eternally grateful."
good,"If you have a bunch of people to sell insurance is great, otherwise, it doesn't pay at all."
good,"People will be more successful at this company if they come with a book of business already in the financial arena and are able to be financially supported by someone else while they put in the first three years."
good,"When I started at New York Life in 2011, there was tremendous focus on leadership development and accountability. In the last two years, that cultural mindset has been abandoned. Leadership has shifted from servant to self-serving, role clarity is non-existent to the point where no one is willing to make decisions (let alone be accountable for them), and bad leadership is habitually rewarded (I know of a VP who squandered her annual budget by May, so of course she was promoted to a C-level position in a strategic P&L business unit). While the compensation is excellent, it is a pair of golden handcuffs - there are very few opportunities for advancement in the current structure, and since a majority of work is outsourced, it's hard to keep your skills current. Go here for the experience, but keep looking, and don't plan to stay for more than a year."
good,"I worked contract for 1 1/2 yrs with promise to hire permenant after 6mos. Then Management started saying the money is not in the Budget."
good,"It's who you know, not what you know.......  management protects their favorites.........   HR department is blind and useless........................"
good,New York life is a good company to work for but it is a very strenuous job it requires a lot of cold calling and mailed advertisment. I was not too satisfied with the company because it is all commission based and you have make a minimum annual salary or you will be but on probation or even lose your job.
good,"Arrived early for training, learned lots, felt micro managed, workplace culture was diverse, hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a steady salary. I was on commission and received monthly expenses.The most enjoyable part was being able to set my own schedule."
good,Zero collaboration between teams and more drama than anyone working on a commission only basis should have time for.  Products are good and the company is strong though.
good,Commision based.  A lot of prospecting.  Long hours.  Able to make your own hours.  A lot of time spent in classroom instruction.  NYL will sponsor you for licenses.
good,New York Life hires everybody that applies and they hope a few will stick. The training is only based on what they want. They don't listen to what you want for your career.
good,NO WORK LIFE BALANCE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 8 TO 10  MONTHS IN SAVING WHEN YOU START.Manager are good try to teach you. not much culture just sells pressure. Hardest part of job is when they take back commissions if customer don't pay there policy.People who work there made work enjoyable.
good,Daily work is a mix of meetings and reporting updates. Most difficult part is obtaining reporting data in a timely manner.Various departments tend to work in silos limiting knowledge sharring
good,New York Life is a great company when it comes to its products but not so much for it's employees.  Management will lead you to believe that you are there to help educate potential clients but the money is all they really care about.
good,We have had a few leaders take over for the HR department in the 8 years that I have been here.  Each leadership change came with a new culture and style specific to the leader.  I believe that in oder to thrive here you need to be ok with change.
good,"New York Life is a very reputable company, it just was not the right fit for someone like myself that was just starting out in the Insurance industry."
good,"NYLife used to be a great company to work for.When I left it had become a company that prided itself on ""transition"". What that meant was you never know if you will have a job tomorrow."
good,"They throw you into ""creating your own business"" without the proper training. They expect you to build your business knowing nothing and train while you build your business."
good,"Projects take forever to complete, many people just collecting a pay check."
good,"New York Life's Motto is sell, sell, sell - primarily geared towards younger agents. NYL has a strong brand name in the market place."
good,Not a bad place to work but the company is an insurance company and makes it difficult for agents to become a financial advisor because the company prefers to to keep the focus on insurance sales.
good,"You will never advance unless you are the ""chosen"" one.  Its not what you know its who you know.  Yes pay is good but you need to work your behind off for it and if you are not kissing butt, you will never advance.  Management makes promises that they never keep nor do they mean it.  HR doesn't care about the average employee.  They are solely for upper management.  This place is a joke, almost like high school, the popular crowd has options while the others just try to survive."
good,"The hardest part of the job was leaving friends. The Manager didn't have the expertise to manage from two states, even as I did the job without supervision. I made them uncomfortable in my role. All went well and I ended training their personnel of 3 on my job. I wish they had explored the possibility that there are people in the world that don't necessarily need someone looking over there shoulder to do their work,"
good,the most stressful work even you make substantial money. working in life insurance on 100% commission need forehand financial security to move with confidence.
good,There were many individuals that took the time to help explain the process.  They took it upon themselves to be mentors.  The support staff was very efficient in their day to day processes
good,Worked all the time with no base pay. fhasldhifsldkfnaslkdjflsdknfasldfnaslndfalskdfnas;ldkfnaslkdna
good,"•	Perform duties related to claim settlement to include prepare form letters, request policy report and distribute mail and faxes."
good,The atmosphere of the company is very positive but they take forever to pay you.  The training in the company is very extensive.
good,"New York Life is a reputable company.  However, during my assignment, the work environment was very tense."
good,"This was a position dependent on soliciting insurance clients. This sales position paid 100 percent commission and this was the hardest part of the job, the time it takes to have the clients to support my financial need."
good,The definition of a high pressure sales environment. You'll learn a lot about permanent life insurance products.
good,It was a good job and  learned a lot and had a lot of responsibilities
good,My typical day would be meeting with my team members and go through the requirements for the day. What I learned by working at NYL is that you should stay true to yourself. Management often felt the pressures from senior leaders which often made them changes views.
good,Must be comfortable with being paid through commission primarily. Overall a positive work experience.
good,Was not a warm market for me personally. Immense daily push for sales.
good,It is a good place to work for people who have enough customer base to generate sales constantly.
good,"It was very hostile working environment. The manager at the time was the son of a senior employee and played favoritism amongst employees. "
good,Fun place at times but good look with career development. You're stuck on the phones. A lot of fun activities and day off opportunities. A lot of giving back to the community.
good,It was an okay place to work.  There was a lot of red tape and change is extremely slow.  Decisions on running the company is left to top management. Not a progressive place to work.
good,"Horrible management in a good company...people leave their managers, not the jobs...they need to relook at who is hired for the top roles...it’s all just one big boys club with no chance for any advancement if you are a female."
good,"not only is the position commission only, but you personally pay for tech support, marketing, licenses, etc.  there were some new management transition issues where things that were promised didn't happen."
good,"New York Life churns through people using a meat grinder philosophy.  There is no salary.  All the costs of building your book of business are your responsibility.  However, if you want to go someplace else, you give up all your trails.  New York Life also encourages new agents to sell products that lock customers in, so if you do leave, you can't take those customers with you.  Their payment grid is NOT competitive with other companies.  Also, they expect to control every part of your business regarding compliance and communications.  They expect you to use their social media monitoring software, their service desk for encrypting your computers, and their CRM platform, so they have a digital copy of all your contacts and leads that they can claim if you leave.  Management is made up of agents who were successful enough to stop prospecting, but mediocre enough to not be able to build any more business.  Essentially, they become desk riders and collect a salary because they don't want to prospect anymore.  They expect you to go out and write a lot of business so they get a bonus.  This place is only good for using as a stepping stone and quickly getting your insurance and securities licenses since they pay for them.  Once you have them, you should quickly leave."
good,"Nice people, good coworkers, depending on the manger, good management.  Need to advocate for yourself.  Good working environment.  Terrible commute to Jersey City if not local."
good,"Our department was almost always understaffed, so management would constantly push to get more out of workers. Managers definitely will listen to and implement your ideas, but only if there are no resources required. The pay and benefits are decent, but not amazing."
good,Selling and presenting portfolios for investing and financial insurance needs. Took and passed Series 6 and other State of Texas insurance tests to sell insurance and financial investment products.
good,"They bring you in and tell you about how great their training program is. They make it sound like you get a paid salary as you get started building your book of business, WRONG. It is 100% commission. It is feast or famine. Highs are high and lows are very low. Not for the faint of heart. Not suggested if you are looking for any steady income."
good,"Need to inherit a book of business.  If you don't have someone to bring you in, the likelihood of your being successful is pretty slim.  You need someone to throw you some work."
good,"commission only. no set salary, just percentages of your sales. if you're former military or older and know a bunch of people, you might be ok. if you're young or just out of college, you're screwed."
good,Great benefits but lacks open communication. People to do things the way they know how and don't adjust to change. There isn't room for growth as they state.
good,"Need a minimum of 3 - 5 years to survive and create a client base."
good,"At New York Life I learned a lot about how to approach people and control a conversation, and they developed my interpersonal skills, but overall it was not worth the time because there was no guaranteed pay."
good,"I thought that this place would be one of the best places to work.  I must say in the first year it was great. Mandatory overtime became over bearing and continues to be.  I noticed that it started becoming a cut throat environment. People began doing what ever it takes to get to a another position. It was then I realized that you have to become a messy person to elevate, or have to know the right person. Working hard to get where you want to be went out the window. The supervisors do not care about your career path/growth, they just care about meeting  numbers."
good,"New York Life claims to be an inclusive company, it’s really not. Management gives the impression that they want you to succeed, but it’s really the same as most other big companies, it’s who you know and who’s butt you have to kiss to succeed. Too bad."
good,Processing positions are like working on an assembly line. Management does not change and people end up quitting their manager. Promotions are few and far between.
good,"I learned a lot about myself as a professional in the sales industry.  While I love what was revealed, I did not enjoy the hostility of sales.  The hardest, yet most rewarding job...the ability to empower and change lives.  Sales is a numbers game, if you're not selling...doesn't matter how much you love what you do....no production = no job."
good,"Fast pace,  great pay and benefits. Tremendouse volunteer opportunities.  Great campus for  diversity.  There  are not as many opportunities for advancement as there once were."
good,"I was very young when I got hired for this job, and found my boss to be very demanding! He hated being in the office, and made sure I set so many appointments for him, as to accomplish his goal. He was rude, loud, and overbearing, but, I suppose that was just his personality."
good,"Training is provides annually.  Many resources and tools to continue education and learning. "
good,"A typical day is everyday.  Same sit down and not many if any changes. I learned a lot about team work and how essential it is in that work enviroment. "
good,"Spent the entire day either on the phones trying to set appointments, or meeting with prospective clients trying to sell insurance or investment products."
good,"Financial services has a 18% stick rate on professionals.  Management in the industry has a 5% stick rate."
good,"You need to ""trigger"", otherwise you're nothing there. Better working for yourself instead!"
good,It's an okay company to work for.  It's a lot of hard work and you are on your own.  You must build your own business and the training is not that great.
good,"Have not seen much training. It's a sales job, so you paycheck will be determined on how much you sell. If you are a good sales person - this is a job for you. If sales are your weakness you will quit within one or two months."
good,We learned most aspects of NYL insurance and Tech Support for Nation Wide Support of all Agents. We as tech support were not told our jobs would be outsourced out of state to pay lower wages and have some of us train those individuals.
good,As a first level entry job they really make you see how much work is needed to prospect clients.  No leads were ever given but a yellow book and your circle of influence.  Although this challenge makes you stronger and gives you the opportunity to face first hand the sales industry.
good,A person's income is variable. It's not for the faint of heart. It's great if you have a two-income household or if you're single. There is great income potential.
good,"This company was great, but not for me. I loved helping people, but didn't like chasing people. So not for me what else can I say."
good,"good pay and benefits. Hard to attain new skillset to further your career. Co - workers are great and benefits are good. My life work life balance was not balanced. Too many projects for one person, hard to get help."
good,Decent place to work.  Good sense of team work among employees.  Good technology that links all the different company locations together.
good,Better have a good referral base and network to start with or you may starve. No base pay but great incentive and bonuses to sell in your first year.
good,Overall I had a great run with the company and the earning potential was tremendous but the clients are the company if you choose to leave. You have to build your own leads and you can get burnt out if not working efficiently.
good,"I worked there for a short time as  temporary staffing to help assist with an influx on new client. The hours were long and I have a great opportunity for over-time. I worked closely with an office team of about 35 people and this is wear I first learned records filling. This job ended after only a few months, it was a good experience and time there helped me to learn new and needed skills."
good,"Awesome employee environment and good management! Typical day would be answering emails and phone calls, then event planning and research as well as daily meeting with agents."
good,"Life Insurance agent where I would generate business through prospecting in events or seminars or cold calling. Consulting with clients on their finances."
good,I learned valuable strategies and knowledge that will help me further my career.
good,I really loved New York Life as a company but there are certain departments that are just mismanaged and run by people who make very poor decisions.
good,"Work is what you make of it at New York Life. The most successful people are the ones who can connect with anyone they interact with and leave an impression. The hardest part of the job is that it is sales; I believe I am helping people, but some people do not see it that way. I've come a long way my one year with NYLife, and there is always more to learn for those who are willing to put themselves out there."
good,Complete application input for annuities department. Answer inquires from agent in regards to their pending annuity claims for their clients. Notify insurance agents when a claim will be denied. Process different information for pending annuities. I learned how to operate different systems within the company. The co-workers were nice and helpful. I enjoyed the constant load of work.
good,"not what I was expecting.  very small, individually managed groups.  not terribly professional"
good,"Its ok, not room for advancement. Too many personal relationships"
good,Definitely a challenging experience. You can be successful but have to work very hard. Good training as compared to the industry. Client acquisition is easily the most challenging aspect of the job. 
good,It's a tough only commission job right out of college. Most of the products that make the agent the most money require a market with sufficient funds to spend. I personally liked my team/manager a lot. But with no salary it is non-stop stress and difficult to do things i.e. buy a car on only commission.
good,Unfortunately the Management is terrible. People in these leadership positions don't help set a path with you for growth. It's odd to find that people in management carry on with no sense of leadership or professionality. Great amount of time off.
good,Initially you must attend many classes and meetings. After successfully closing many sales and hitting certain criteria more flexibility is available.
good,In a typical day there are 50-75 calls taken by each rep. I've become much better at multi-tasking. There are times when you will have to reach out to a different department due to management being unavailable for separate reasons. The work culture is divided. Some reps are on one side of the building while others are on the other side divided by walls and conference rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to learn new skills as well as develop my skills.
good,"I worked here for three years for investment and insurance. Company is so large that many company rule provided differently by different manager. If you go to a good team, you will have a great career, if you go to the wrong team, only you can do is to quit asap. Some of managers cheat on agents and stole agents' achievement. No further career guidance they can provide"
good,Great for recent college graduates.  Not the place for seasoned career vets.  Great place to learn and get your feet wet.  Not the best for new opportunities or advancement.
good,"this company prides itself in long term legacy as a mutual insurance business, and that core comes before other aspirations to innovate and evolve the culture"
good,"I enjoyed being a life insurance agent for 3 years, it was a fun and eye opening experience. It is a great way to test your limits and get out of your comfort zone. "
good,Too much emphasis on obtainging new agents regardless of qualifications. Very aggressive with employees and unreasonabe goals to meet. Very hard to hire due to commission based salary and incentives.
good,"Not impressed with how everything, such as having access to the printers/copiers, phones, desk, etc... had a monthly cost associated with it."
good,They do a great job of showing you all of the people who have made in this industry and tell you how they were just like you. But the longer I worked there the more I realized it a less to do with how hard you work and more to do with how many independently rich people you have close to you in your life.
good,"Management has a hard time communicating with each other and their employees. Things could run much smoother than it currently is. The work is not hard at all, but tedious."
good,"As an agent starting out, lots of training but minimal leads shared.  High turnover of new hires and the established agents never retired, they had it good; clients, easy street and work load."
good,Typical work day: Call everyone you know. Try to meet anyone you see and build a relationship as fast as possible. The clock is ticking. If you make a sale DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY. I say this because if a client cancels their policy a month later or even a week later NYL will come back for that money you earned!! If you can survive this process for 5 years then NYL IS FOR YOU! and you will survive but...the pressures never leave of always Eating what you kill.
good,"Solid company, good financials.  However, not all departments had the best leadership.  We were always told that our manager's manager would do skip interviews with each of us and that never happened, there were favorites and there was one person in particular who made the environment sub-optimal."
good,"The training is excellent for agents. The benefits are good for agents too, pension, 401k, health and dental are also included. Long hours are expected each week."
good,"Family and friends will run out, so you will need to build a market from zero.  As much as the bar of entry is low to start,making it a viable business is far and few in between."
good,"The company used to be an excellent place to work. I made may friends at work, but the culture changed to negative after 911. The company began to decentralize out of New York City into Westchester, NY, Georgia, and outsource many of its positions to India. When I retired I was doing the work of three people, and not being compensated for it. Management was squeezing us dry while terminating departments, and laying off its oldest employees first."
good,It definitely was a hustle as is any sales job. Life was dependent on commissions. Lots of getting in front of people. Must be persuasive. Lots of time away from family.
good,"Management continuity and support was somewhat lacking, and compensation based solely on quota-based commissions which made our working life stressful."
good,"i prefer not to provide this info. I have not been there long enough to adequatly provide an opinion. The culture is hard, and the sales initially are to personal leads"
good,"If you're willing to work for 100% commission, it's a very nice office and most of the people are very nice & helpful.Perhaps after working 80 hours per week (mostly cold-calling) for 3-5 years, you can make a nice living."
good,"Phone calls and meetings are a mandatory part of your day."
good,"Working at New York Life offers great flexibility. However, you must be able to find your own leads and market. Training is great and the people are great. Pay is 100% commission. If you have a case declined or your client cancels their policy, you are expected to pay back your commission. A lot of the time it feels like you are working for free b/c you spend time looking for leads, talking to potential clients, making phone calls, and training with no pay unless you write a case and it gets approved. This job can turn into a great career for the right person, but I saw more people leave than stay."
good,"Better products and compensation, but you need a natural market that has money and willing to refer you from the start. Other prospecting methods taught take a lot of time and most agents give up/lack of follow up and it goes nowhere. Managers are definitely willing to help, but again your success is absolutely pre-determined by the networking you've done up to the time you start."
good,"The opportunities for growth in this firm is limitless. If you want to go from agent to managing partner, there's a clear cut path to follow. The Development Managers, Trainers, and Partners at the company go above and beyond to help the agents succeed.  You do run as your own business; you find your own markets and generate your own leads. It's not your typical standard 9-5 job, you need to put in the hours, work weekends to make salary. It's a commission-based job, so if you don't work, you don't get paid."
good,"Great training"
good,"I would not recommend it if this is your only source of income."
good,"I feel prideful to work at New York life insurance. The company embraces a diverse and inclusive work inviroment. Pension,401k, and life insurance are phenomenal! Management needs lots of work. No room for career advancement."
good,Environment full of sales and meeting numbers. The Partner (your boss) that i had to report to was full of greed and not helpful. Provided training that was extremely helpful and you can succeed in this environment if you receive the right partner and if sales is what you want.
good,"As a representative at New York Life there is not much room for growth.  In my location, there were people who held the same job position and title for 30 years.  Not once were they promoted or offered any type of advancement, despite being good workers. For a multi-billion dollar company the pay was low and the raises were few and far between.  Despite heavy workloads, there was little recognition for a job well done."
good,"Not family oriented and could spend more time developing their leaders aligned with new approaches, new theories, methodologies and contemporary issues."
good,"you get to meet great people at nyl but the overall scheme of company doesn't coinside with the people and skills that are there. i have learned that if a company is stumped by its technology you need to move on, because the outside world of technology will."
good,"When I began my career with the company, there was an employee designation called ""New York Lifers"".  This was indicative of those who served for remarkable periods of time, often in excess of 20 or 30. I personally knew of more than a few who counted NYL as the first and last employer of their professional careers."
good,"Clean family environment with fitness center and weekly activities, "
good,"New York Life is a good company, but make sure you understand the reality of what the job will look like when  you get there. You have to want to sell insurance, since the compensation incentives pushes you to focus heavily on that part of your business. If you're willing to drink the cool aid, you can absolutely be successful. "
good,My experience was a very good one for 30 of the 32 years I was there.    The people were phenomenal as was the salary and benefits.   I learned a lot on the job with regard to technology.
good,"very hard work, can be very successful if you are willing to invest the time. Management are pretty good, enjoy the flexibility. co-worker are joy to work with"
good,"Expect to spend spare time learning in order to get basic licensing and learn products."
good,"NY life is a great firm, but enter into this with your eyes wide open.   Unless you have a wealthy social circle, expect to make very little early on.  Also, nothing is given to you at NY life.  Computer, desk, services and support all paid by you!  If you have financial support outside the firm (I.e. A Spouse with a good job) be ready for many years early in at a low salary.  And don't fool yourself, this is a 12 hour day, 6 day a week commission job!"
good,"Fair-minded managers, who go out of their way to help employees, but in closing other call centers in other states, employees here are buried in a multi-tasking glut of work. The Corporation has a ridiculously low call-time average (the amount of time you're supposed to complete answering client's questions). Employees are expected to process policy payments and other work while simultaneously fielding calls. More often than not, we would receive another call from a client who was pushed off the phone by other co-workers desperate to maintain their CTA (call-time average)."
good,"New York Life Insurance Company does a great job in training newly-hired agents in the class room, but they don't provide a significant level of support as these agents begin working in the field (no sales leads provided and very few manager-attended sales calls)."
good,"Be prepared not to see much from your initial work investment.  It is a meat grinder.  If you can make it, it is the best company to make it with."
good,"The company is a very good company to represent.  Underwriting potential clients was rather difficult.  Also, prospecting for potential clients is extremely difficult.  The company provides NO assistance with prospecting to new agents."
good,New York Life is a very strong and reputable company but along with any other commission based job it is tough to make it in this career.
good,"This was a great opportunity but I failed in my responsibility to constantly generate qualified prospects to do business with. It is a very marketing/prospecting heavy environment. The training I received was great but I was unable to afford marketing systems that would have lead to my success. If I had a large network of professional contacts to work with, or the marketing knowledge I have now I may never have left. The management was very supportive, there are always people available to help answer questions, the office was nice, the people were great. If I was a better salesman/prospector this would have been a great fit for me."
good,It's ok. Has changed a lot since I started working here in 2006. The work culture is very different now and a lot of politics involved.
good,"* Job ladder has few rungs. If you don't want a lateral move then this is not the place for you because that is the only movement in your career you likely will see. "
good,The company as a whole is great but minimal advancement and local management are Micromanagers
good,"New York Life is a great company.  Depends on the department and the manager you work for, you get treated very well and respectful.  As a full-time employee, you have the ability to apply for the same or different position throughout the company in different departments.  It's a very professional and productive environment."
good,"Typical day consists of inbound calls from Policy Holders requesting payment information or to make payments, policy changes, rate quotes, rarely ever received any rude customers, although the occasional ""confused"" caller isn't unheard of. Member Services (which I work in) doesn't consist of too much paperwork, the calls can be overwhelming at times in terms of volume and management requiring that you keep ""ACW"" or After Call Work at a minimum.... can get stressful. I learned a great deal about the life insurance industry and how it works at New York Life and was sent to get my Life Insurance and Annuities License by NYL on their tab (Perk). I learned a great deal about office politics and how they really work, seems more a popularity contest when it comes to meeting needs or requesting something from management. Personally I don't intermingle with co-workers very much as it seems like a high-school setting and is formed of ""cliques"". The hardest part of the job is dealing with the popularity contests and knowing if you aren't one of the ""popular kids"" you probably won't make it far. Regardless of your stats (I am constantly in the top 10 percentile of the call center, meaning I am a top ranking representative) and receive awards month after month, management hardly acknowledges me. HR doesn't seem to have an interest or care in the world in regards to genuine problems that exist within the organization in regards to real health concerns in the building due to mold in some areas (these are complaints made by other employees not my own), my own complaints are treated as childish"
good,Constant pressure to perform.  Sales and numbers driven.  Management all came from the field so most of them lack sophistication.
good,"during a typical work day i would be on the phone setting appointments for the week, then following up on them."
good,New York Life Human Resources works off of various systems. The need to consolidate information into one up to date system is evident.
good,Values as a family oriented company has changed. Although profitable always looking to cut something or someone.
good,Must work hard to be successful. Not what it was made out to be.
good,"Although it is a good company that provides quality training, it is hard to maintain a steady income in such a ""up and down"" industry. There are opportunities to make a reasonable income, but it is very difficult as there is so much direct competition from inside the company."
good,They get you on as a part of the team but then you have to pay for certifications that they will reimburse you for later but you do t have any income the whole time your going through this process. It took me a month or two to pass my certification. This is a no salary job so it’s feast or famine
good,"In order to do well at NYL, you must go beyond the skills of a basic insurance agent. Management pushes you to push insurance products based on their override and bonus structure and less interested with regard to investing in your holistic practice on a long term position."
good,Very challenging career! I thought for sure this is what I wanted to do. I wasn't prepared to handle the emotional rejection of the career. Management was helpful but they can't change the fact that you have to contact everyone you know to sell life insurance.
good,"Culture is dependent on managers and partners. went through 3 managing partners while I was there. Every time the rules changed."
good,"You are micromanaged all the time, you’re doing the work of 3-4 people and expected to complete those tasks daily, yet paid the same. The manager was more concerned about gossip and looks. The manager did not know what they were doing and when brought to upper managements attention, they’d make excuses such as ‘there’s a lot on their plate or procedures are always changing.’ HR has received multiple complaints about the managers, yet NOTHING was done... during my time at New York Life, 7 temps quit ."
good,Good office atmosphere. Fun work culture. Commission & production  based compensation. Good experience with the insurance industry and while gaining more knowledge on the financial markets.
good,"Opportunities for growth is available. Building your business is the greatest challenge. For Life coverage products, pre-qualification to get an approved policy holds a very high bar for the company standards. Individuals I was able to meet & greet, staying within HIPPA compliance, there are many persons unable to get an application approved, simply can not afford to maintain an active policy."
good,"You need to get clients on your own or team with somebody but it's all up to you. YOU look for your clients, they don't come to you."
good,"They keep hiring and rotating other people, instead of helping the ones that are struggling in the company. Great product to sell but not enough support if you find yourself struggling. Don't believe everything they say."
good,The position I held was challenging in that I had to balance doing the work given and not being bored by my atmosphere. I wish it gave me more chances to be creative with my work.
good,Family like culture but things are slow to change. There are too many legacy employees that are not performing as well as they should which creates roadblocks for those who are eager to make a change and work.
good,"On Monday and Tuesday I have training.  Tuesdays I do one-on-one meeting with my boss and go over my workflow, cases, and potential clients I intend to meet with during the week.  Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I am usually out on the field meeting with prospective clients or doing events to gather leads.  "
good,"Entrepreneurial fast paced environment. Weekly training, management potential with a non stop work ethic. Hardest part of role is if you do not put effort forth you receive no compensation. Most gratifying part of the job is meeting new people and putting a portfolio together  benefiting them and there families."
good,"...and the problem is finding out what you need to do. Being an agent is like running your own business: there are no work hours, just hours to work. You will be living and breathing New York Life until you hit your stride, which will take a few years. The knowledge aspect of the training is great and very well done; the marketing and selling is dependent on the person. Management is hit or miss depending on your manager (as with most places). Turnover is very HIGH, expect to see maybe 3 or 4 people stick with it in your training class of about 30 or so. Tough for the every day person, but if you have the skills to do it, it is very rewarding."
good,"Enjoyed learning a new business and position, but this was only a contract job, felt like it could have grown into a permanent one, but position will be eventually handled through another office outside of the state."
good,"First year, spend 50 percent of your time in training.  "
good,"Great company, Great products, Great training, Great Benefits"
good,"New York Life Insurance is one of the best insurance companies in the industry.  It is a great place to get started and maintain a career if you can build a successful business.  Life insurance is a hard sale, but it can be accomplished."
good,"NYL has the best atmosphere for training and developing new agents getting into the financial industry. The products are outstanding , however, the corporate mindset contradicts the""independent "" agent structure."
good,"Great place to start but not stay for the long-term due to limited upward opportunities available, regardless of the position you held. Preference is taken to hire externally rather than promote internally."
good,"Aggressive insurance sales efforts are expected daily.   You don't sell...you don't earn a wage.   Not for everyone...some agents do very well in this climate.  These agents are usually doing very well financially but some opt not to be part of the higher level management staff.  Only disadvantage here is that for those high"
good,"Great name in the industry, made it easier to make sales, but the underwriting was unfair.   They declined 80% of the applications that I submitted.  Some of the applicants were very healthy !"
good,"Work day was from 8:00 - 6:30 or 7:00."
good,"Great company and management, but no salary as its only commission based. If you don't make enough sales per week, this could hurt you, especially if you have a family to look after."
good,"If you are looking for a steady but slow job, New York Life is the place for you. If you are looking for vision and innovation you will not find it here. To their defense, they are an extremely successful insurance company for that reason."
good,"Business and management were helpful and available, however the colleagues created a cut throat environment. Was not able to concentrate on my business and financial portion of business was outdated in technology and financial products and strategies available"
good,"A commission-only job is not for the faint of heart.  I found cold-calling demoralizing and difficult, and never could drum up enough business to keep the lights on at home.  If they promise you a great lead system and clients, don't believe it.  They'll train you day and night, but you have to do all the heavy lifting.  And even then it may not be enough.  The people who excel do so because they have an extensive built-in network or are willing to hit the pavement/phones 16 hours a day."
good,"Initial Training is the best in the industry."
good,"Compensation was 95% commission; which is very tough to sustain, especially if you are new to the region and/or do not have a fully established network you can tap into."
good,"NYL was fully commission based so if you didn't produce then you didn't receive any pay. You did receive a ""training allowance"" however that was also based off your production."
good,"Great company! If someone is interested in having a career in Life Insurance sales, as well as the other products offered, this is the place to do it.  I think the last straw for me was a 3am text from my manager.  I think this would have been a different experience if I started there when I was in my 20's."
good,"This business is not for the faint of heart, but the reward is peace of mind that I was able to provide for myself. Coincidentally, for others who love their families they were able to benefit as well."
good,The work was pretty competitive but some managers were not so great and the atmosphere changed throughout the years. Manager in my department was so mean and cruel
good,"A typical day at work involved building relationships with Agents, Underwriters, and peers.  I learned a great deal from this position after leaving 10 years of retail management.  The workplace culture was very poor.  The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate in a healthy manner with the manager.  The most enjoyable part was getting difficult policies issued for Agents, particularly for their Council and Year End goals or New Organization Agents trying to make a go of their careers."
good,"Though it is possible to do well if you have a series 63 and 7 licensing, it not, you can work yourself to death and not make a dime.  Management is not as knowledgeable as one would expect.  I found myself having to work all day and go on appointments in the evening.  too many odd hours. and not enough support or compensation"
good,"Management was terrible, they would call off more than they would show up. the pay was terrible for all the work we had to do. We were only allowed 10 mins lunch break before they would start deducting from our pay"
good,The management style was not good.  They did a lot of conference calls to a manager when we lost our manager.  This made it hard to communicate on what management wanted in order to produce the product.
good,I believe in the products and services but i cant be the one to sell them. the pressure to just survive was very high and while the education you receive is much it takes a while to get off the ground
good,My manager was not helpful and full of empty promises of high commissions and showing me how to do everything.  Always broke his appointments with me and had no incentive to come to close a sale b/c he wasn't compensated with any portion of the commission split.
good,"I was placed here as an intern through the IT Program Year Up. I learned the basics of Quality Assurance, basic helpdesk tips, and the basics of Corporate America."
good,"The lure for this company is the pension. If you are in New York there are tons of opportunities. If you are in Cleveland or another location it becomes apparent that you are a backup for the home office in New York. You will be given many speeches on ""It's what you make of the opportunity.""  Sometimes there is not an opportunity. Very little chance of advancement for an African-American male. I am not big on using a crutch or excuses. If you are a hard worker you will succeed. But a large number of African-American males don't last at this company, or are temporary employees who are not offered a permanent position. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern."
good,I spent 26 plus years working at New York Life.  The Company holds true to their Corporate Mission Statement and really takes care of their employees.
good,Overall New York Life is a great company with a  almost perfect history. However this industry is strictly  commission based despite how many billions the company brings in a year.
good,Great place to work.  The pay structure could be better if you got paid for what you did instead of taking courses and being promoted that way.  People are promoted because of who they know not what they know.
good,Great place to get good financial skills and training. Fantastic development team. Lots of educational materials and product knowledge training.I highly recommend for some one just getting out of college.
good,"This was a part time position as I was looking for full time employment "
good,"This is a sales job. If you are an elite seller you will do quite well. I had excellent months and dry months, these deals do not move as quickly as other sales might. Training is limited."
good,"Extraordinary amount of training requirements. Very fast paced, established routines that make or break your success.  Follow the plan.  Top Manager is outstanding.  Co-workers are competitors, therefore, the sub-culture is understandable. Hardest part of the job is not earning a paycheck.  Helping families was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I gained countless experience at New York Life Insurance Company.  I obtained my Life and Health License. I was trained in sales, determining financial need, product knowledge, prospecting, and the insurance business as a whole.  I learned the process of obtaining clients all the way through to delivering a policy."
good,A good company to work for that does a lot for the surrounding communities and has a great work life balance; if you like a fast paced environment then you should look elsewhere; loved the half day Friday policy in the summer time
good,"Until the outsourcing, it was a great place to work.  The culture of the company has drastically changed negatively, due to remoteness of how the business is now conducted. Work Life balance is a positive, which has so far been preserved."
good,Good products. I just wish the company agents can recruit so they can increase their income greatly. That is all I can say.
good,this company yas great benefits the management isn't too great good company for advancement opportunity the locations is near the airport
good,"Overall, New York Life is a good Company to work for but there is there was little room for advancement and they went through lay offs every year that I was there."
good,I was able to build my own team of sales associates that were hard working and ethical.  Good company to work for with a very strong training program.
good,"Strong company and will pay nice if you outperform expectations, takes a lot of hard work, networking, phoning and experience to take off running. Very tough with individuals who have no or little experience and extremely tough at a young age (20's)."
good,It was a professional environment to work in. There were lots of costs associated with having a presence there. I met a lot of nice people wanting to accomplish the same thing that I wanted to.
good,"It used to be a great to work at, but in the last couple of years has changed a lot. Also they are outsourcing all of IT. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them"
good,"I handled a lot of phone calls on a daily basis of individuals who wanted to know information or see what they can get out of their 401K. Due to the fact that I am Bi-Lingual, I also had to deal with Spanish speaking clients in my everyday work. I learned a lot about what a retirement plan is for and how essential it is to save money for one's future. I enjoyed learning about stocks and bonds, but more importantly I learned how to have patience with customers over the phone. I believe that the most enjoyable part was working with a unique group of individuals that had to deal with the same issues I had to deal with everyday."
good,Build business with warm market leads such as family and friends. The team provided much support but I personally did not agree with the approach of selling services to clients without a second meeting.
good,Very strong company with good products. Too many charges for tools to function correctly in your job.
good,The job is tough.  You sell a product that people do not want.  It is a roller coaster every day.  Management spews a lot of BS.  I would only recommend this to someone who does not have a family and can endure months of no pay.
good,"- very productive "
good,"If you are self-motivated and looking to start your career, New York Life provides an excellent opportunity."
good,"take inbound calls, up to 100 calls per day"
good,"hardest part of the job is prospecting. My manager is not that supportive and helpful. "
good,"A very strong company with extensive training and support, but there is no base salary. You rely on doing business with clients you find yourself to get paid. Some personalities thrive in this type of environment and there is potential for great success, but it is not for everyone."
good,"Management and training were excellent, at first."
good,"This job is very fast paced and you will need to learn a little something from each dept to fully help the customer. You need to be on your toes and ready to go when you sit down at your desk. Management is not that flexible so you need to plan your outside life and family accordingly. The Call Center is just that a call center that takes hundreds of calls a day! Very exhausting!!! The company itself has great benefits but the promotion process can take forever given the fact that most people have been there for so long it may take 10 years or more to get a great spot, so be prepared to wait!  Overall it is a great company to work for because of the pay, benefits and overall integrity of the company itself. You will learn lots of valuable information that can be used for years to come."
good,"Typical days were contacting 25 people face to face and 25 by phone. By contact you had to ask them for an appointment or otherwise speak to them about the type of work you could do for them.  We were also required to meet at the office for training, reviews, and administrative work.  This usually translated into six or seven sales hours and two or three administrative hours.  (Sales and administrative time did not include drive time). "
good,"inbound call for people who received an application of life insurance"
good,"People are generally good people at this company and work hard.  Senior management is a mixed bag, some strong leaders, some not so strong.  Culture is a bit of a mess right now, company going through continual reorganizations."
good,"Over the past 6 years, I have seen a complete diminishing of the company values and culture for employees."
good,Gained much experience about fixed and variable annuities.
good,"Nice people to work with, Good pay and compensation"
good,"Not impressed at any level and I was there for 5 years! The managers and staff know their comp and they try to maximize it at any expanse. Everyone is there for themselves and there is no culture or synergy. There are a lot of large Ego’s for a company that controls less than 2% of the Minnesota market share. So, to sum it up there is other chooses of companies to look at because anyone of them will hire you as long as you can pass the screen pop tests (which are easy)."
good,"A typical day consist of prospecting, meeting with potential clients and phoning to set appointments. I learned that this is not necessarily the career choice I would pick if I had it to do over. Co-workers are great people and are just trying to make a living and the most important part of the job was helping people with something that most of us take for granted on a daily basis. Life insurance and financial planning"
good,"Great classes and very insightful. I did not have 200 people to sell. Only had half that amount, which did not work out. I passed the classes without any problem."
good,"Its a different company than it use to be. "
good,"On the phone, meeting clients, prospecting, coffees, lunch, social functions, learning new products, servicing current clients, helping new agents, and just signing people up for life insurance."
good,"There's always plenty of work to be done. People at the office are kind and helpful. Benefits are good, reasonable and we get good coverage. Flexibility to work out of multiple locations."
good,"It is a commission based (Pay ) which means you get paid for each sale you make.  The position comes with lots of training. Work environment is very impressive, but everyone is very busy. Leads are not given to you so you end up do cold calls."
good,"Great Place to work a lot to offer "
good,"If you’re connected to a lot of people you can do well. If you don’t know a wide range of people, it will be hard to make a living. The Des Moines market is very saturated."
good,Working sales it was a Monday through Friday postion with one Saturday a month. Hours were very weird. 10 hours on Monday and one late day a week. I think managment was a little too much and were always down your throat. Coworkers were the best part of the day.
good,I was there for 2 years. I got my licenses and learned that they get you in with dreams of big money. When you start look around the room 8 out of 10 won’t be there in a year. You leverage your lifelong relationships to try to build a business. In reality the company will appreciate any business you did when you leave. If you don’t have hundreds of family and friends who need planning then look elsewhere.
good,It's an okay starter job. Benefits and time off are aceeptable. They do offer some good perks that other companies no longer offer. There are different rules for the call enter deparment compared to other departments.
good,"During the workday, I took on a majority of the task an assistant would partake in. This included answering emails and phone calls, reaching out to potential clients, and scanning and filing documents."
good,"Very respectful company, want there too long but my advisors were great to work for.Company has been around over 100 years and has helped many families with their financial and insurance needs."
good,Paychecks are unknown and are dependent on others completing their job task. It is not as easy as making a sale and getting paid. The job is 100% based on prospecting clients.
good,"The insurance game is a grind everyday. New York Life offers great training to get into the financial services field, however it is on you to keep your job activity up. Some hours required in office on a weekly basis but the rest of the time you are to be finding new clients and building relationships. Lots of extra time is needed to prospect clients and do presentations. Hours vary based on activity"
good,i learned lots of things here  but still n other hand its commission based job and i wa looking something fixed so i don't have to woory about my bills.
good,"You get what you out in the industry. Make sure you have a healthy pipeline. Set the precedence with you partner, get everything in writing. Take no verbal agreement"
good,wasn't the best place to work but it was not the worst. The guidelines got stricter by the year and was eventually almost impossible to meet your goals for the month. they did sometimes have meetings that they made as fun as possible and the pay for the stress was pretty comparable. They would overwhelm you sometimes but they rewarded when they could.
good,"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. I don't have anything to say. I worked through a temp agency and New York Life treats temps different than their regular employees."
good,"While New York Life is a nice company to work for, the department I found myself in was not typical. The lunch periods were shorter, paid holidays were reduced, and the management was untrained and inept. In large companies it is critical to realize that there can be significant differences in departmental cultures and without strong HO oversight these differences can diminish the effectiveness of the organization's HCM retention, engagement and development strategies."
good,A very reputable company to work for.  The company is known for their longevity and number of years in the business.  It is the number one mutual company with over $25 Billion in surplus.
good,"Training is great and you make your own schedule. It is a commission only job, however, and the slow months are hard to bare. It's a very competitive market so great job if you are well connected with the right people."
good,Difficult job for first few years with no salary and without a current financial book of business. Spend a lot of time training but expected to have appointments every day.
good,The job as a whole was a good experience.  I personally struggled with the fact that they expect you to source your personal catalog of friends and family in order to drive business for them.
good,Hours weren’t great and some of the management was inconsistent with the rules. Typical day includes back to back calls can be stressful........ decent place to work
good,"As a contractor, work is limited to specific skill set of instructional design. It challenging to find opportunities to have a strong impact.  Work is fine...learning something new every day.  Company is willing to be very flexible with my schedules.  Some managers are awesome."
good,"A fast paced environment, received valuable training that would cost a great deal of money elsewhere.  The hardest part of the job is working strictly for commissions, no paid vacation or sick time."
good,A good place to work to pay your Bill's. Get in and out though. It seem like a good environment at first but then it fades out fast. Management is fake new.
good,"Company has a good corporate culture, however the demand of sales pressure can be intense. The benefits are pretty expensive as well. The recruitment process is a bit misleading as well."
good,"good culture, but as a small section of the company, AMN was a little separated from the bigger company. Also, the company is very oriented toward captive agent business."
good,"Good work/life balance, flexible schedule, great management. Good job to learn face to face sales and client interaction. Commission only... pay is sometimes unpredictable."
good,I really enjoyed this position and it gave me some great experience as an undergrad. You will get what you put into this job. You need to be very driven and a self starter to succeed.
good,"Good company. Nice people and coworkers. Work/life balance is acceptable. Working conditions were acceptable. "
good,Commission position.  Heavily reliant on your ability to bring an existing network of clients or to go out and network heavily for leads.  Training is improving.
good,"Make sure that whoever you report to, helps you! This company is more sink or swim than any of the other life insurance companies I've worked at."
good,It was great working at New York Life Insurance.  New York pride themselves on training there agents in a very regulated industry.  When you have been trained by New York Life you are ready for the field to be the best.
good,"I developed a way to bring in prospects/Clients, that helped me be at the top 10% in New York Life.  I was paid very well, much more than I made as a Major in the National Guard.  "
good,"Self generates sales 100%."
good,"Great training, great individuals, lots of learning moments and the back office support staff are awesome.  Glad I had this experience, taught me a lot."
good,To be patient enough to see the fruits of your work pay off 3 yrs later is tough. The work i did was very rewarding. Knowing the impact that we could have in ones family.
good,100% commission.  Good training though.  You're required to create your own leads and book of business from scratch.  A lot of hoops to jump through just to get started.
good,"This was only a contract job basis but it was never a place I wanted to be. Not a great culture here, very gloomy and boring. Management was very uptight and left no room for joking around while moving equipment."
good,"Worked as a Consultant at New York Life."
good,LAs ventajas de trabajar como asesor es que eres dueño de tu tiempo y puedes planear tu dia. Tus resultados van directamente con el trabajo que haces. Lo unico malo es la falta de respeto de algunos clientes para tu tiempo y cancelar citas en el ultimo momento o que simplemente no se presentan.
good,"Finance/Accounting Team was relatively small since the parent organization has many centralized functions in New York City.  Since it  was small, the team felt more like family."
good,It was a challenging experience. I was not there that long so I do not what to be biased. I enjoyed the flexibility but you do have to be a go getter to make money since it is commissioned base
good,I had to put applications together. Answering phones. emailing scanning making copies filing making the boss coffee cleaning emptying the trash running errands to post office and other places.
good,Position income potential is extremely variable dependent on sales or lack thereof.  Being solely a commission based position your income is only limited by the amount of sales you close.
good,"Very micromanaged, low wage compensation in comparison fir customer service work. Need to be more competitive with salary and vacation time. Employees are great."
good,"A Typical Day:"
good,"This company offers its agents a great support system. They offer a full time staff of managers and trainers willing to help you reach your sales goals. Depending on your type of contract, you may be 100% commission which can make it hard for those with little sales experience and who do not develop a strong network for referrals and flow of clients."
good,"Very professional place to work, but if you must pay bills every month  you can not count with this job, because this is a commission job. It means you must have some save money."
good,"Meetings"
good,"Seems like a typical office job, complete with mundane work and frustrating managers. For the most part the job is simple and it's better then nothing."
good,"No salary!  You better be REALLY good at selling insurance etc! or you will have little income and washout."
good,It's a place with very reasonable hours. People are generally polite to each other. The multi boutique structure can cause some issues between the company and the boutiques.
good,"I ran my own business in my own home for New York Life. They had lots of training, I had to travel one hour to get there each way. "
good,This was a commission only job that required you to make a living while trying to build a business.  I was brought in to take over a retiring agent's book of business but it didn't work for him (80) and did not want to give it up.
good,"I was an agent for 2 years. I enjoyed the work itself, but finding clients is challenging in the beginning. There's freedom in your day and you learn good financial information. People are supportive in the company"
good,"Fantastic employees, the management team could have been greatly improved.  The direction from management was constantly changing with goals and initiatives."
good,Why do I have to do this? Is this really important? This job out-sourced my job Over-Seas. There is nothing to tell and I dont think this is important to what I'm trying to do. Which is to find another job.
good,They really do try to take care of their employees.  They do have times of mandatory overtime but they will also buy the employees lunch or snacks to keep them energized and in good spirits.
good,It's been nearly five years since I worked there so I don't feel comfortable writing a review. Everything I ranked the company on was based on my experience. Things may have well changed.
good,"I worked for this company close to twenty years ago so its hard for me to review something so far back.  It was like any other investment company, the more you put in the more you get out."
good,I am not going to respond to this question at this time.  There were some internal issues at the Milwaukee location and I do not have an opinion that I wish to express on these matters.
good,Good company to work for if you are looking for a long-term career.  I left because I wanted a change after being in the annuity market for over 35 years.
good,"Good company, too much managerial fluctuation. You could come and go as you wanted but that is a doubled edged sword. Some nice people to work with but also some not so nice ones as well."
good,No base salary and tons of meetings and had to travel and not get paid for it. Not enough training and they throw you to the wolves right away. I would not recommend working here.
good,"I am not cut out for direct-to-the-individual sales.  If you are and are ok selling an intangible product, New York Life may be for you.  Most of what you learn are sales scripts."
good,"The company is an individual life insurance company.  I did enjoy what I did.  Your are on call 24 x 7   which was ok for me, since I am high energy type of person."
good,"This is a very stressful job. Unless you have a big network of people, this job is not for you! You have to put so much times and efforts to survive in this business. Now a day, there are so many companies competing with each other."
good,Did a summer internship and the staff I worked with were friendly. I got to see different things and learned how everything worked together. Overall good experience.
good,It all depends on the managing partner. Some are great and some are not so good. Overall it’s a good company to work and great benefits. All I can say is good luck.
good,There was sufficient support to succeed. Training was very good. Accountability was good. There was sufficient support to succeed. Training was very good. New York Life is a company you can write your future but percent commissions were higher than like competitors
good,I love the job just got pregnant and got to sick to continue to work. Very fast paced but is easy to pick up on the job requirements. Great management to help with any questions that I had.
good,You are basically building your own business if you join as an agent. You get what you put into it and have to learn to overcome disappointment. If you can build you own practice then you can work there for the rest of your life.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I was given the tools to learn and opportunity to study and achieve licensing. The hardest part of the job is prospecting and getting clients of your own.
good,"More innovation and less debate needed across all teams.  They have it right when it comes to talent, but the talent needs to be able to perform.  Great middle-management."
good,"Not much to say about NYL. It was an average company, average work, and average environment. Nothing exciting about it, but nothing really to complain about except that they move your job to different states or areas like crazy."
good,"I am relatively too new to really be able to make any comments about the company of job. I am still learning however, If I had to say something, so far so good."
good,Good company overall. Need to revise the way employees advance in company. Great parties and town hall meetings. Not sure why this review is requiring so many characters!
good,decent place to work but not much room for advancement which resulted in my leaving and moving to another company.  the management was pretty good and the employees I worked with every day were great.   I had not left if there was more opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"Overall good experience. Great office, the staff is very supportive and helpful. Management helps you in any way they can but most of the work is on you. Only the strong survive!!"
good,New York Life is a good company but is highly regulated due to the nature of the insurance business. This presents many challenges in terms of getting the marketing tools needed to perform your job.
good,good place to work.. work life balance.  moving towards open workspace concepts. open communication with your manager.  I have had a good career at New York Life as the PMO solutions delivery and Support Manager.  I feel that I am looking for a growth opportunity that they do not have available at this time.
good,Please make sure you understand what you are getting into before you take a job like this.  It would probably worked better for me if I had taken this job at a younger age.
good,"A great place to work for and flexible on schedule. People there are very nice and helpful. If you like a laid back work environment and have your flexibility, it is great to work here."
good,My immediate supervisor was not helpful or compassionate in any way. The pay for the job that I was doing was no where near enough for the amount of knowledge that was required as well as the amount of responsibility that was expected.
good,This is a great place to work depending on where you work.  The company culture differs greatly between departments.  Additionally they are staffing changes like most other US companies and this can also be a factor in how work is done.
good,Compenstation can be complicated but it's a great job for those who want to be in charge of their own schedule. Lots of learning which is great but can be overwhelming at times.
good,There are making changes in positive direction to move in the 21st century.  I personally need a change.  I don't feel challenged in my position and not supported by my manager who does not have time for me.
good,"Not very professional."
good,NYL is a very fast paced call center.  You will take many calls daily.  You will have to process many different tasks for the clients.  It can be stressful.
good,"The company structure is misleading, when it comes to new insurance sales agents. The risk is solely on the 1099 employee, and the firm does not take any of the risk."
good,Work environment was stressful due to monthly sales numbers to meet.  I enjoyed educating and meeting families that required Life insurance.  The senior management was not helpful.  They played favorites.  My personal manager responsible for training me was personable and mentored me.
good,Very nice place to work. Workplace balance for the majority of the company is very good and they have a great maternity leave program.  Flexible work schedule.
good,"Talked with agents all day.  Updated the life insurance policies.  "
good,"It's a great job if you can stomach working on commission based salary. The commission can be rewarding if you sell insurance to affluent people. However, the chances of coming across affluent people is slim. Don't expect financial security."
good,"company is great to you when they hire you fro the first three months, they give you good training, and directions, but after 3 moths they leave you out on your own"
good,comparable to other companies in the industry. Nice company and they will help you grow. this business can change your life with hard work and determination
good,"A great place to get hand on training on selling life insurance, retirement plans, college funding etc."
good,Main purpose of the position is to assist potential clients with their financial needs whether they are an existing client or a new one.  Range from investments to life/health insurance.  Gives one a sense of helping people in the greatest time of need
good,"The company continues outsourcing IT jobs. If you look for IT jobs, this is not your company. The work life balance is gone, the company culture has been changed."
good,"Overall good company. Great staff, very family oriented environment. Benefits are pretty awesome as well. Unfortunately, they will let you go no matter how long you've been with the company if there's a discrepancy on your background check. The same thing that was on my background check when I started was the same thing I was let go for 5 years later."
good,"Relaxing work environment; minimal stress. Great work/life balance. Poor compensation. Management is involved, and cares, about the work the staff performs."
good,"Good benefits, challenging atmosphere. Most enjoyable part of job is to provide clients with financial guidance. Management style is entrepreneurial."
good,Challenging and fun place to work environment. Company has expanded into diffrent customer's sectors to provide insurance and investment products. A Company you Keep.
good,Hardest part of the job is issues with the application when deploying. I learned a new technology for for application purpose and learn in depth knowledge of my technology.
good,"I was proud to work for this company for many years, but I changed my opinion in the last two years, when the company started the Outsourcing process for IT technology."
good,"It's a fun place to work. It used to be a better work place. Recently, many benefits were cut due to the company down size."
good,Good company with nice work life balance but they followed like other companies to outsource the IT jobs otherwise its good environment and the management is good too. They have gym and other wellness care facilities in the building that's very convenient. Cafeteria Is also in the building which is the best part you don't have to drive around during lunch looking for the best place..
good,Good place to work if you don't need income urgently. You will have to save up until you get a large enough client base. No Salary you only work off commission
good,"A typical day at work includes, data entry, customer service, and completeting various quality control reports.  I am responsible for case management."
good,"I work on all kinds of conditions, I work very well with my coworkers and assist them when needed. Great in completing my project quota’s and assignments. I get great reviews from the customer on completing my task. If a task is too difficult I have no problems in asking for help or assistance. My goal is accomplishing all my task or project before the end of day."
good,Training is top notch and the partners do care about you succeeding. The type of work is not for everyone though. You can work with target markets that you feel comfortable with but anything can happen between application to finally getting a policy.
good,"El Dorado Chevrolet was a fantastic place to work. Only one thing about it however, it was still the car business!!!"
good,I am a current agent at New York Life.  Life work balance is one of the best perks of the job.  The job is commission based however so it is difficult if you do not know many high net worth individuals.
good,"I enjoy this job because I still feel like I am helping people. I am protecting their futures. I have learned the value of extreme dedication and hard work, the kind that only goes with a commission only job. The most challenging part of this job is finding clients. Your work doesn't come to you, you have to find it."
good,"New York Life is a US-based international financial services company, offering a diverse range of insurance and investment products that meet the needs and goals of our customers. It helps the customers to achieve the peace of mind that comes with planning for lifetime financial security. It is also a leading supplier of group benefits and group retirement and savings plans in Canada, helping employers to protect their employees."

good,"Results driven business leader providing innovative management on all facets of technology solutions including; project management, budgeting, solution definition and delivery.  "
good,"The company has a great work / life balance by allowing employees to work from home 2 days each week. However, the culture is such that a lot of animosity exist between racial groups from different cultures. This creates a hostile environment where you will not get any assistance from some employees of a different culture and this hinders team work and a team spirit."
good,"Being selected as an agent with New York Life Insurance based in Waltham, Ma was overall a favorable experience. "
good,"A typical work day begins at 6am, opening the incoming mail deliveries that are 5 per each day. The mail consist of all type of claims and checks to be process, scanned and indexed to the many other departments in a timely matter. Each co-worker in each department must work together to make sure all work is done before the shift is over. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the clients and having co-workers that are fun to work with and always willing to lend a hand to make sure all work is completed."
good,"Hired for a years assignment - worked four months and they let EVERYONE go"
good,"Loved the training received, but your are made to feel inferior if you aren't producing. What's really lacking is a great mentorship program."
good,"Data entry of new life policies."
good,This is a fun place to work since everyone making money and most of the time they are happy.  Working with happy environment is great and keep you going
good,"Not a lot to say, but there is generous time off/paid holidays, generally a workload and the people who work there are mostly friendly and willing to help you out."
good,This company worked with high dollar claims and had a high call volume. I worked with several customer resolutions and  benefit disputes. Due to the atmosphere there was a high level of accountability.
good,Great opportunity to learn the fitness industry....  Nice place to work though long hours and very little pay....  Low advancement...
good,I feel within the last five years with the company it be came a very interesting organization to work for.  It became  all about the company and not the personally grow and development of all employees. The enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learn from them and with them.
good,Fast-paced office with multiple tight deadlines.  Supportive and encouraging management.  Flexibility and enthusiasm in the face of challenges are crucial as priorities and client needs rapidly change.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning from diverse group of colleagues.
good,"Company is very appreciative of the work which I do, however not willing to compensate. Comparable positions within other companies offer a better salary."
good,It was great to meet and educate individual regarding the benefit of having life insurance for themselves and their families.
good,I enjoy the work i do from a helping clients standpoint.I've learned a lot and i am grateful. I wish there was some type of base provided or less reversals impact n commissions paid.
good,"Mostly independent day, after a meeting or training. My day was scheduled by myself; my compensation was based my efforts and performance. Support was provided by the management to help me with my performance and it was good. But no longer do I see it a good position for a minority / immigrant due to lack of market and chance for advancement."
good,"Provide excellent Training and opportunities to grow, good work environment to learn and grow in the company, but its all commission, no salary."
good,"NYL is a great place to work in and amazing environment. Although is a lonely career, other agents are very welcoming and supportive."
good,"Call volume is predicted each morning"
good,"Your time is closley watched. Schedule changes on a daily basis you never have a set lunch, no room for advancement.  They pay more than the other companies with the same job description."
good,"Excellent Training program. 100% commission position, need at least six months of savings prior to entering. There is no Salary for training, license, testing etc.  Many unpaid mandatory meetings. You are really an employee, not operating your own business."
good,Great place to work. Its fun and their are always new and interesting things to learn. The best part of my job is that I get to help people plan for their future.
good,"This job was not for me,  I did not enjoy about talking about death to clients.  Being a life insurance agent this is something you must become comfortable with in order to succeed.  I also did not like having to do cold call sales on the phone every day.  The thing I did like was their detailed training they provide once you start."
good,"•Prepare monthly and quarterly trial balance for review"
good,"There is no hand-holding within the ranks of New York Life. Your fate is truly in your own hands.  The environment is VERY professional, formal, and prestigious... Company lacks youthful employees.  "
good,High call volume participant service center. Great co-workers.
good,"At New York Life Insurance Company a typical day consists of a morning review of your last week and planning your current week. Then phone calls for the morning and later in the afternoon around 50 Dials and making appointments for people in your natural market. My manager will help me at the beginning of an appointment to review what questions I should ask and how I should present."
good,Work life balance is great here. Having an entrepreneurial spirit is highly recommended. Typical day at work involves client relationship building. I learned that it is important to mange up. Hardest part of my job is delegating. The most enjoyable part of my job is training others.
good,Inbound call center. Few opportunities for advancement. Was able to create and establish a good client base for investments and insurance products
good,"I value the experience, but with any company there are little tweaks that must be made."
good,Advise individuals and families about financial products that help to protect and increase their wealth.
good,"more on assisting agent on bancassurance department, lot of benefits, more paper work under bancassurance department, inventory, customer service."
good,It was a challenging experience.  It helped me get my foot in the door with sales.
good,"New York Life is a very solid and enjoyable company to work with.  I enjoyed every moment of it. The key to having a positive experience with New York Life is to find a career position, well connected mentor together with effective work and communication skills. My recruiting manager was excellent. "
good,NYL is a commission only position and you need to have some capital saved up if you are going to become an agent.  It is a bit difficult if you have others dependent on you to bring in a solid income right away.
good,Not much to say other than the pay is not comparable to the market. Great benefits program helps to compensate but overall cost of living in NYC is too high for mid-west pay.
good,"As an intern at New York Life, I would help insurance agents organize clients' portfolios, search through job sites to find the best qualified candidates for New York Life."
good,•Set Appointments and consulted with individuals to maximize their retirement portfolio
good,"Buying insurance is something most people don't want to buy or even think about getting, especially when Life Insurance is something not everyone feels is necessary. For this reason, starting a career with NY Life can be rewarding if you are willing to put in the work. It requires a lot of self discipline and determination. This can be a very lucrative career, if you are willing to work very hard for it."
good,"•	Meeting and contacting new potential clients to discuss financial concerns and needs."
good,NYL is a good company for agents if they are working for more than 20 years.
good,Typical New York insurance company that wants to create career agents.
good,Great place to learn basic sales skills and develop a insurance business.
good,"o	Interview prospective clients to obtain data about their financial resources and needs, the physical condition of the person to be insured, discuss any existing coverage, calculate premiums and establish payment method."
good,"Was promised a salary, but ended up being told that's nonexistent"
good,"Unfortunately the stigma of insurance salesman can be true.  I worked with some amazing people but I also worked with many more unethical individuals then one should.  My immediate manager was a great boss and I really enjoyed working for her.  The managing partner of the office would do whatever he needed to hit numbers.  If it was wrong, illegal or unethical it was done.  Upper management did not do a good job of protecting their employees.  If you stood up for yourself they would make your life very uncomfortable.  It's sad because pay and benefits were good and had opportunity to move up. "
good,Sales agent primarily selling life insurance and securities.
good,"very well maintained company"
good,Typical day of work consisted of sending letters to possible beneficiaries. I learned alot about different insurance policies. Co -workers were cool and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the  job is keeping letter errors under a minimum. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom.
good,"Responsible for 70+ incoming calls daily with an average handling time of 5 minutes. Respond to telephone inquiries within the set departmental staffing and time parameters. Provide information and rate quotes on general AARP life insurance eligibility and fixed annuity programs. Maintained billing and account information.

Maintain appropriate documentation of inquiries and/or changes to the customer’s account or profile."
good,Well run company. Nice coworkers. Good culture. Good management. knowledgeable experienced people.
good,"NYL has many qualified employees who work hard to succeed, but the management team was hard to please. Support and mentoring was not a positive influence at NYL."
good,"Helping individuals and businesses achieve their financial goals with insurances and financial products that meet their needs. Consistently scheduling appointments with new and existing clients. Continuously out prospecting for new clients. Attend regular training sessions. Great colleagues, great opportunity, and enjoyable. Time management is essential and being productive and efficient is a must."
good,NYL is an old company. I learned a lot there...had 1 great boss and 1 horrible boss. Great place to start your career or end it. Very conservative company so you have to wear a suit and tie. Co workers were nice. Gym in the basement... Great vacation package.
good,First half of you day was scheduling appointment and doing paper work.
good,The company offers extensive management training. The company has diversity and other similar plans in place that are consistent with industry standards.
good,"Extensive, good training on the sales process."
good,"It is always a busy day at work. Dealing with everyone's needs. complications, comments and emotions -this is a truly customer service career."
good,New York LIfe was a nice company to work for. Nice managers and superviors. Looked out for the employees.
good,This is a high frequency contact and follow-up position.  Must have a big pipeline and continue to funnel.  It is 100% commission.  No paid training or paid mandatory meeting plan.  Some reimbursement opportunities for license acquisition. Great position for someone looking for a entrepreneurial experience.
good,"Great company, 100%commission based pay is tough. Great management team and training with financially sound company. Need to prepared for searching constantly for leads though."
good,"It's a good company. Speed could be slow."
good,This is a rewarding career if you can financially survive the first three years. 100% commission based pay with several business expenses as well.....
good,"High energy, productive enviornment.  Good work / life balance.  Generally strong management, although several layers that can lead to bureaucracy at times and slow to adapt to change.  Main concern is limited opportunity for career growth."
good,"Good place to work as an assistant to a manager, but I was not a field agent. My manager/boss wanted us to cold call and perform regular office duties to set up interviews."
good,"The training was excellent the ability to transfer the education to the streets was the difficult part. The initial years are extremely structured and this was difficult,  personally having come from such success at other organizations the big brother watching was out of control."
good,"New York Life has a great onboarding program focused on the immediate success of the new agents. They are required to hit a certain commission amount to ""trigger their contract"", once this is met, they are essentially on their own."
good,"If you don't mind exploiting your friends and family to sign them up for insurance, this job is for you. There are weekly trainings you must attend that are repetitive.  However, if you need the classes then they are beneficial."
good,The pay was well it was just getting used to the amount of tax they took out our checks especially including the hours we worked every 2 weeks. Most of my calls were people who were frustrated or in grievance because their family member passed and they didn’t know a clue about their insurance policy. It put a toll on me to constantly hear people grieve to me about how there was something wrong.
good,"Peers and support staff were second to none."
good,"When I arrived for my first day as a Contractor for NYL  I noticed that the office space was dated.  The employees were friendly, helpful and professional overall.  In terms of the tools they use a lot of their processes and tools are outdated by today's business standards.  I implemented a tracking process for their certified and courier service mail in response to a concern raised by the management.   They need to transition technologically, as they seem to be looking into employing more efficiency in the workplace.  I noticed that there was recognition given to high performing employees, publicly in the workplace.  This was a plus.  Unfortunately, the salary from the agency was not meeting my basic needs and in addition NYL did not have any opportunities for advancement which resulted in my decision to leave."
good,"Easy, ""throw them at the wall and lets see who sticks."" was what one ex-employee told me. They really reassure you day one, but don't fully explain how difficult building a book of business is from the ground up"
good,"Amazing management and training. A typical day would be to make calls, set up appointment do a fact finding on our future clients to help provide to them the best product for their needs."
good,Positive experience and phenomenal training. My parter was a great leader. Leadership only wanted to see you succeed in your career. Met some really cool people and received some great advice.
good,"Most of the day is spent recruiting and communicating with clients, drawing up illustrations of policies and family planning. The schedule can be very flexible but there is also a lot of travel involved. It is difficult to plan financially when the only compensation is commission based."
good,"My General Office had a good company culture. They were very supportive of diverse markets and promoting women. I appreciated that. This is a very difficult profession if you aren't self-motivated. You must be ready to take control of your schedule and and priorities, you are actually an entrepreneur under the umbrella of a Fortune 500 company. Take advantage of the extensive training."
good,"the company is amazing, you really have a brand behind you and a lot of resources to flourish. however the fact that there's no base salary makes it extremely hard to make it work. I would get a second job but you're held as a captive agent meaning you cant working anywhere else."
good,"Company culture is okay, plenty of people are around to help, pay is completely commission driven, very hard job if you don't have a natural market readily willing to work with you"
good,"New directions, outsourcing multiple job functions - office in Reno closing. Job eliminated."
good,It was a good company to learn about life concepts. It  gave me some great experience selling. I am glad that I went from this platform to more of an investment Platform.
good,"Company has a great culture, however poor management in certain departments. I was there at a time of company layoffs....last to be hired first to be fired."
good,"I enjoy a great team at NY Life.  We work in a fast paced environment and the demands are great at times, but the team really pulls together in my department."
good,"Some groups are phenomenal and others are just okay. The great thing about New York Life is that it's big, so it's easy to move to another group."
good,Sales job. If you are independent and have sales skills this may be of interest. Good people but you are on your own. You schedule your day and when to work. Required to be in office for training which can mess up schedule but nothing can be done
good,"A typical day at work was either calling for appointments or visiting with current and potential clients."
good,If you want to get paid what you are worth than New York Life is the place for you. You must be a self starter that will not take no for an answer. the hardest part of the job is to not be discouraged.
good,Daily phone calls and meetings with potential clients.  How to overcome negative people and to continually strive for goals. Mangement is helpful and supports success.  Workplace culture is motivational and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is closing sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job is contstantly meeting new people of various backgrounds.
good,"A typical day included calling prospects, setting appointments, fact finding, designing solutions, implementing solutions, providing follow up.  I learned how to make my own marketing plan, build my own brand, market according to demographics and geographic location.  All managers assisted equally on developing selling strategies and supporting my business.  Success was made according to what you did not who you are.  The hardest part was cold prospecting to individuals outside of my geographic location.  The best part was being part of a company with such a strong financial rating and working with team mates who also graduated from Radford University."
good,"If you love sales then this place for you. Great support team , a lot of resource , great people to work with, location is awesome.you just have to sales driven.."
good,"Only been with John Hancock 2 years due to acquisition.  Remote site.  Felt somewhat connected to the culture, but was a bit difficult due to they did not know our work environment."
good,"hardest part of the job is to find new clients, It's fun because you meet a lot people thru networking. My job was commission only, no salary, but they have a lot of bonuses but depends if you make commissions."
good,"People and job were great as long as you can be accountable, reliable and dependable.  Also, allows for volunteers programs and projects to help others."
good,Working at New York Life Insurance on full time basis for over 15 years was a good experience until jobs were being outsourced. Good training and benefits.
good,This project’s objective was to improve members’ health by promoting members' interaction with a web-based application that would make them well-informed of their existing health issues.
good,"Day to Day financial operations "
good,all commissions pay which makes it very difficult to make it through the first few years. not paid for training and a lot of mandatory training days.
good,Flexibility is great but compensation is tough as it is a 100% commission job with no base. The Training they provide is great and staff is friendly. If you have a warm market to work with this business may be right for you.
good,A typical day at work is taking inbound phone calls from mutual fund shareholders and agents that sell our mutual funds. I have learned a lot over the years about the financial markets. The most challenging part of the day is dealing with the emotional component of investing and easing clients concerns. The most enjoyable part of my day is resolving issues for shareholders and agents by teaching them new ways to manage their accounts.
good,"Answering telephones and data entry of insurance applications."
good,If you like customer service and being constantly on the phone asking questions this is the job for you. A lot of multi tasking and being hassled by management.
good,"A typical would be to review insurance applications for errors, call for medical appointments if necessary, make recruiting calls for potential clients. Answer phones and other clerical functions for partner manager. I learned the processing part of life insurance and other financial investments. The most enjoyable part was doing the clerical portion of the job. The hardest part was recruiting calls."
good,Challenging and fast paced office with emphasis on customer service.
good,"A typical day at work in New York Life's Participant Service Center consists of fielding 50-100 calls across a wide spectrum of issues involved with 401(k) and Pension plans.  While most of the calls that we field are more likely than not difficult participants, other and more pleasing calls are from more financially savvy participants that have a grasp on what the plans are.  The hardest part of my day is without a doubt the call fatigue that occurs later on in my shift.  After taking 50 or so calls a participant who is unpleased with the product can be very difficult to handle.  Management does an excellent job of providing all of the reps with the necessary support needed to deal with these especially difficult situations."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but you are really wearing LOTS of hats. I always felt as though I had 4pairs of roller skates on and having to go in all directions.... "
good,Training was excellent.  I learned a lot about the importance of life insurance.  I had excellent co-workers.  I didn't like the assistance given for solicitation of new business.  The best part was working with people of all walks of life.
good,Movie Theater and it was a temporary job. I was an associate  assistant manager there.
good,"Very busy call center where customer service is key. "
good,"inbound call center took between 50-80 calls a day."
good,AIG's problems is what lead to the increase in business for New York Life.
good,I learned how to chair technical meetings and worked as a mini-project manager. I enjoyed completing projects on time and the respect from my co-workers and upper management.
good,Learned a lot through working with different type of clients. Needed to be patient and understand the needs of clients. Difficult to advance to the size of the company.
good,"This company gave me my chance to get into the life insurance industry, as a result I learned the importance of protecting one's income to one's family. This knowledge gave me the conviction and education that I need for myself and others about Insurance"
good,"Great management and support, but the job is solely based on commission sales only, so be prepared to have ups and downs."
good,"A lot of my work day is spent on the phones with New York Life agents, both inbound and outbound calls, helping them prepare for upcoming client meetings. Discussions would include both the insurance and the investments aspects of a client portfolio. I work on a team with six other individuals, sitting in a very open forum, desks with no cubicle walls, in which interaction among the team is constant. The people I work with is one of the most enjoyable aspects of my job. Management has been great for the most part, however, with all the changes that have been occurring recently, my boss and management in general seem a little “distracted”."
good,"This was a short term position for me which I used to further advance my profession into the financial advisement role.  While NYL offers that role, it wasn't the company I was interested in pursuing this role with."
good,"If you manage to build a large client base, this can be a rewarding career. This is no easy task, but it would be worth it if you can make it. All commission so be aware of that."
good,"Insurance is a daunting business. If you do not have a well developed network or book of business, can be a very challenging business. I recommend developing some serious sales skills prior to starting NYL and have a solid savings account as you will be working on primarily commission only income."
good,Positive energy with your General Office but the commission is too complex and is not discussed enough. Partner will usually be very invested in your advancement and growth.
good,A very challenging position even for those who have a sales background. There is a need to be creative in how you develop business.  I struggled even after 1 year.
good,Typical day would involve a hands on approach with  your manager reviewing sales strategy and execution. Weekly Sales meeting were mandatory and extremely important.
good,Their Training Allowance Salary (TAS) is just a quota based bonus system. There is no base salary which is difficult for someone just learning the industry. High turnover
good,"This can be a great opportunity for someone who has backup finances available for when they are building their book of business.  There is a plan, but it can take a bit before the money comes in."
good,If you have something on the line to fight for and you don't mind leveraging your relationships (some may suffer) then this may be for you. If not then don't bother.
good,good place to work with advancement opportunities.  Good company to get training and support with while learning the industry.  Great employee benefits.
good,If you work hard and are lucky to have good people around you this is a good job.  Find a mentor to help you get your footing and you'll be fine.  Be sure to make sure they pay you.
good,"This is great job for someone who has time to prospect and devote energy to finding clients. There is no base salary, so 100% commission. Great training and knowledge of the products and overview of the financial world. The management team is great, but does not get you leads. It is a competitive work environment, but agents are supportive of each other. The hardest part is getting in front of enough people who actually wants to buy the product. I liked the flexibility of creating your own schedule."
good,"Will talk face to face, due to the nature of the work cannot talk about it in an open forum. Look at what Insurance companies face on a day to day basis, you will know."
good,"New York Life is a great company and has a great reputation.  Working for the company, you have to be a go getter and self starter because you're paid strictly on commissions.  If you're not making deals, you're not getting paid."
good,"The work / life balance is great, but employees are underpaid compared to the market. The staff is also great and contains many who have been with the company for over 10 years. However the opportunity to advance is scarce."
good,Company it trying to transform itself to be ready for times to come. Believes in bringing in lots of personnel from outside will help it transform. But it is generally not the case. The company needs to treat their existing employees well and re-skill them as well.
good,This is hard for me because the reason I started working for them was different than most. I personally was looking to advance in the investments industry. They offered a program that would get me trained through to my series 7 for day trading. In the time until you get that license it is a full-time sales position. You must be a bit of a shark and be able to reach out to people you know and within 3 degrees of your network to make sales. Then there is cold calling and all sorts of other uncomfortable tasks that can benefit your personal income. The team in the Honolulu HI branch is an amazing group of individuals and the management is extremely supportive and caring for their agents.
good,"The right person can really soar in this business. It's selling insurance, pure and simple. If you can market yourself properly in an over-saturated market and get past the awkward points of selling, you can have a promising career. It is extremely tough, and prospecting is not taught."
good,Being an insurance agent was at times challenging. Selling life insurance was difficult because of the sensitive material that had to be discussed with a client. Yet the work environment and being able to work on your own time was very nice. Management was amazing and the people I worked with were wonderful to be around. Through this job i learned two very valuable skills.Perseverance and time management. Without either I would have not have succeded as I did.
good,"Great culture, have to work hard, if you commit you can do it, overall do your best. Have lead and referrals and you'll survive."
good,"I work on all kinds of conditions, I work very well with my coworkers and assist them when needed. Great in completing my project quota’s and assignments."
good,"NYL is going through a whole new makeover at this time, you have to be adept to change, i would like to wait 5 yrs to see where the company is then. but my experience has been great at nyl. i have met a lot of people there that i call family."
good,"over the years I met a lot good people. I had fun but it was time for a change. I learned a lot of things. I had to learn one more than in the department tonknow all functions in the department. I was the person that fix every computers. "
good,Big company split into insurance and investments. Complex structure. Personal experience will vary depending on which part of the organization you work in.
good,"Sales driven"
good,"Systems are outdated which henders daily productivity which is looked at by management. Compensation is great, but its a pretty boring place to work."
good,And assistant and trainer and marketing firm and any other support staff required to attract clients and sell insurance and investments. If you can thrive in that environment then it is a great way to make a living.
good,"A usual work day for me began with reading emails, returning messages and checking work from the previous day.  Throughout the day, I would review and input applications, educate new agents on how the procedures worked within the company, consult with agents, clients and employees from different departments within the company, process daily financial transactions and do monthly reports."
good,"The New York Life Insurance Company Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or "
good,Assist agent with his clientele. Organize files. I have learned the life insurance company and its offers to its clients. Management team are great people. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting to know each agent and their clients.
good,"Not for everyone.  Training program is outstanding; however, expenses associated with generating leads makes it hard to earn enough money to live for a mature new agent."
good,Great training provided. Co-workers are helpful. The hardest part is being paid by commission.
good,"overall good company, however, rotation and career growth are not encouraged."
good,"Review calendar for the day. call to confirm my appoinments for the day, check to see emails, check to see if existing clients need servicing. "
good,"You learn everything about personal finance, all the tools, recommendations, and how to strategically execute these for clients."
good,A typical day in the office you come in and get situated and then you are off into your day. Reviewing work items and processing. The co- workers can be fun but because of the level of accuracy and the high level of concentration required it is a very quiet work place.
good,"Good company to work for. You are more than just another employee, very family oriented"
good,The flexible hours are great but sometimes you work until 8pm or even later so it cuts into family time. Management is great and you will be given the tools to succeed but also in today's market any sales job that is based off of 100% commission is going to be tough from the beginning.
good,"I went to work for NYL because of the benefits.  One of the few companies still offering a pension, in addition to all the normal benefits like health & life insurance, flex accounts, paid vacations and holidays and a company gym."
good,The training and employees were wonderful. It was an intense training process that left you feeling well equipped in the products. The management is out for themselves and will burn you to save their own job.
good,"The Financial Advisor position at New York Life can be as rewarding as it is difficult. The pay is based completely on commissions, so you must have a sink or swim attitude to succeed. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit and are willing to put in the effort, you will succeed."
good,"great place to work.  I LOVED what we do for people.  It is difficult to get going.  All benefits are provided, but health insurance was very expensive.  They do not pay for your office, computer, or anything you need to work because agents are building their own practice."
good,A normal day consisted of an early training class to learn more about each and every product with evenings filled with calling warm and cold clients.  The mornings and lunches usually were filled with appointments that have been set due to how good of a salesmen the agent was.
good,"Hard to start off getting clients, but company gives you tools and resources to succeed. Good opportunity to succeed financially and good upward growth opportunities."
good,"A wonderful environment, team leads attitude needs adjustments but overall productive, workload constant, pleasure to work with team, training was a struggle, and breaks were good."
good,"New York Life is an outstanding company whose integrity and ethics are beyond reproach.  You can be confident that the products are among the very best and your clients are well served."
good,Compensation can be complicated but its a good job if you like to create your own schedule. There is a lot of learning involved which is great but at times can be overwhelming.
good,Management is extremely helpful with learning new things about the business and selling techniques.  There are always available to answer you questions.
good,"My partner was the best, the training was excellent, but if you don't have an endless amount of contacts you are basically a glorified telemarketer cold calling. You definitely need thick skin. The reversals are killers. You get paid then the client cancels and now you are working for free to pay all the money back. If you have a community you can do well but if you don't you'll be looking elsewhere very soon. It's definitely a revolving door business"
good,"I worked in the Scottsdale, AZ location."
good,Very good place to work. Medical Benefits  are not that great. Compensation for job requirements are not that great. Also the distance is challenging.
good,"Wake up go to the office and get work done, or go out to the streets to meet face to face with prospective clients."
good,"New York Life has developed a great culture focused on providing top-notch customer service. While the financial industry regulations continue to grow more complex, NYL has been successful at navigating through the complexities to remain profitable and relevant throughout the world."
good,"Sales calls/emails - cold & warm"
good,There are flexible hours and great commissions but lead generation and a lack of help in the early months made it a tough industry to survive.
good,"I definitely love and enjoy what I do in my profession. On a Typical day I would check emails, book appointments, search for resumes and do the contract paperwork with the hires. The Company have  great managment and good co-workers. But I want to be with a  Company that is going to offer me what I asking for and what i deserve."
good,"Es un trabajo perfecto para   conocer gente,  y  aprender   técnicas  de  venta. "
good,My co-workers and management staff are great.  It is just not the industry for me.  I have learned a lot and it's just time for me to move one.
good,"It was an excellent job, everyday day you learned something new and challenged yourself as an individual."
good,Work is all determined by you. You make your own schedule and find your own clients.
good,"I learned a lot while working at New York Life, the most important thing I learned is that sales is not what I want to do."
good,"I loved working for New York Life Insurance because the management was very supportive about training new employees.  The corporate culture is uplifting, but they set strict sales goals that must be met in order to activate your employment with the company. "
good,Plenty of Training  takes place.  Cut throat culture. you get what you put into the job.  leads were unfairly distributed.  Senior level Management was lacking in leadership skills
good,"New York Life was a great company to work for however they started pushing mandatory overtime.  Each month by email your group would be told how many hours each week would be needed to work for the following month. This is how you learned that the doctor's appointment you set up next month for after work would mean that you probably have to work two or three hours on another day to make up for the overtime requirements. Working over 40 hours a week for the entire year has become exhausting. "
good,"Although I was only with New York Life for a few months, I enjoyed my time there. But I will say, this job is not for everyone. If you don't have a problem having awkward conversations with family/friends about buying insurance, then you'll be fine."
good,"Must be a self-starter and work to grow your network. Key is to truly understand the products that you are selling to your clients, as you need to be sure they are purchasing what is truly right for them."
good,"My opinion of a typical work day would be to have a set of goals that must be accomplished and prioritizing my day to work towards accomplishing those goals. Always keep in mind the need of malmanagement and being able to readjust my plans to accommodate management needs. The most enjoyment part of the job is accomplishing my task and having the satisfaction of knowing that I contributed to the success of company and knowing that I had an impact in my customers lives, by providing them with excellent customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working at New York Life.  The company was very flexible and I could balance my home and work life.  I learned new operating systems, such as Remedy, Ariba, SAP and Service Now.  It was a fast paced environment and the managers were very friendly.  The hardest part was when the company outsourced and I had to transition my responsibilities over."
good,"Although there are many advancement opportunities, salaries are not very competitive. The company does have some great benefits that could be the deal maker for some."
good,"New York Life gives individuals the opportunity to build their own business while selling the country's best products and services.  The company spends a lot of time teaching new agents the trade and compensates a training allowance.  The management is very helpful and eager to help new agents take off.  The toughest part of being a new agent is time management and developing sales skills to make a living.  It can be very rewarding, but it can also be very disappointing."
good,"Had a great manager at NYL in Syracuse, NY. Job is very demanding, to succeed you must constantly be prospecting new leads and following up. Expect to put in 60+ hours your first year if you want to be successful long term. They tell you after 3 years your business becomes much easier and clients will start to come to you."
good,Selling Life Insurance is hard. No one wants to talk about death. But at NY Life you get great training that prepares you for anything you may want to achieve.
good,"Was promised the ability to be making 100k+ fairly easily and it turned out to be anything but easy. I made around 35k after one year of work (was making 45k in my previous job). A lot of the work you do end up doing goes unpaid and your income fluctuates dramatically. (highest month 9k, ave month 2.5k, lowest month -700)"
good,Great people that work at this company but under values and not very flexible to their employees needs (work/life balance)
good,"Great work/life balance. Position relocated, so had to leave after 8 months."
good,Partner for Dublin General Office
good,Was hopeful but didn't have what it took to sell to strangers and continue making a living. I had a good start selling to warm market but I just didnt have that charisma or knowledge needed to really convince strangers to invest.
good,Very good benefits. Time constricted. No flexibility. Management chooses who want to advance without taking in consideration of people who has been there longer.
good,"New York Life provided good opportunities for people who were oriented toward sales. They offer excellent compensation for self-motivated persons, but require disclosure of personal relationships. A typical day includes classes in the morning and sales calls and meetings in the afternoon."
good,Good office environment but all commission.  Primary market is close friends and family.  Management is very nice and work life balance is great but be prepared to do a lot of work with your close ones.
good,Completed cold calls daily and the company asks you to create a pipeline right as soon as you get there. Pay was based off of straight commission and it was hard often at times.
good,Strong corporate culture; high degree of integrity. I enjoyed my time at NYLife thoroughly. I would recommend anyone who may be interested to seek employment there.
good,"Great company, great training. Products limited to NYL only."
good,"New York Iife is a company for enterprising people who want to help people and also have very good remuneration for money, people who want to have an investment in the future and can help them achieve it."
good,NYL has the best training ground for new hire agents. The training coordinators are knowledgeable in their field. The Management team is fully supportive in meeting the agents need while on training
good,It was not too bad as a summer internship. They managed the process well. My particular position was not that interesting and I would have preferred to work in the New York City office.
good,I worked for New York Life insurance Retirement plan project. I was paid well but worked under a manager who did not know how to appreciate others. Overall it was a experience worth having.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the networking aspect of the career and the ability to help people in their times of need. It was very competitive and demanding. The hardest part of the job was creating my list of prospects and market interest. Because I was fresh out of college, there weren't many people who I knew in my immediate market who I could sell insurance to or who were interested in what I did."
good,Good job if you go in motivated and can handle being denied by customers and work through adversity. Most of the work prospecting is done on your own some will make it most people won't.
good,"If you can sell this is a great company to work for, the culture is top notch, and if you can handle an all commission job it could be for you"
good,"Best in the financial service industry, no question. If you're dedicated to improving and reaching out to your community for financial independence, look no further. However, be prepared to suffer months without any commission if you do not have any potential business or prospects that are giving you the time of day. It is all commission based, but they compensate you very well when you do bring in clients. The training is top notch and the office is a community of people who have been in the financial sector for 10-40+ years that have a lot of insight into the the numbers and how to effectively do consistent business."
good,"You are responsible to furnish your own leads.  A typical day consists of making phone calls, building cases, and training.  Management is favorable to people who succeed.  If you struggle they tell you they will help, but it is usually by giving up half of your lead so that some one else can close if for you.  They never give anything back in return.  It's a learning experience with little feedback.  The culture in the beginning makes you feel like you can do anything.  As you get out on your own you realize that the tools you need are not always totally aligned with the training.  There is a lot of pressure to succeed,  incentives are their bait, nice trips - etc.  Low percentage make it and more people quit.  There is a high turn over.  The best part of the job is helping and educating people who truly have a need for the products and services available."
good,"It was a high stress, poor management, missing overtime pay and night differential.  The work environment had a low moral and low energy.  Sad and stressful."
good,"No compensation, commission only job. "
good,Very poor management of consultant teams and poor work life balance. Compensation plans in recent years became a major source of demotivation. Hard to see employees with issues of character promoted into management positions over others. Challenged to do the right thing in an environment where it was not aligned with your compensation goals.
good,It was a non stop work flow! no such thing as a day off with this company! be ready to have zero life forever
good,"Have a book of business, have money set aside to pay your bills, the first three years of building your business will be the worst, unless you have another source of income."
good,"Working as a financial adviser with New York Life was a wonderful experience for me.  Although the majority of my working life has been as an office/business manager, for a short period, I worked for New York Life because it allowed me the flexibility to care for my physically challenged mother until she past in 2014.  The training gave me the confidence to help my clients achieve goals and secure their family's future."
good,Straight commission job.You better have plenty of wealthy contact to survive. Survival rate less than 1% for the first year.
good,"typical day was just come in listen to lectures about how to sell life insurance and other typical products offered by new york life. I learned how time manage my day because there was no structure to this as I was a my own personal boss. Management was good they just like hearing about good news aka ""sales"" my co-workers were quite experienced so it was good to work around them because they taught me a lot. Hardest part of the job, was cultivating clients at the age of 23 because no one could really trust that a 23 yr old knew what they were talking about when it came to spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a life insurance plan. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting mentored by some of the most experienced individuals working within the organization day in and day out awesome experience."
good,"You need to be motivated, and be willing to work hard and not knowing if you will sell anything in order to get paid. this job has no guarantee if you will make money at the end of each one of the appointment, sometimes you could be spending hours with just one particular client, then at the end, something can still go wrong, such as client might change their minds about signing up, therefore they might make ridiculous excuses, just to avoid moving forward. Making it impossible to count on it. This is the kind of job, you need to know a lot of people, and be able to convince the people whom you know to buy into the products."
good,"Good company for customer. Products are. Overproiced to help guarantee non guaranteeable dividends. Too many alpha male personalities with no desire to help client..... Just help them selves. The Fort Worth office is the only one w an existing morale code, at least the agents "
good,My experience was typical you are required to generate your own leads starting with your family and friends develop a mindset that everything you did was a work component such as when your off you are still on the job by incorporating work in your everyday life.The hardest part of the job is to tell a prospective customer that they can't get your insurance because of an issue.The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the satisfaction on the face of the buyer when they know that their loved ones are taken care of in the event of their death.
good,"to succeed you have to work 7 days a week 15 hours a day. its a good company to get your feet wet into the financial industry, they will sponsor you if you show the will."
good,Utter chaos if you have never owned a business. Do not advise as your first professional client facing role. With previous experience and a desire to build a business in life insurance sales you will do extremely well.
good,It is a great company if you want to buy life insurance but working for 100% commission is not for everyone. It is hard work to cold call people. The money is great if you can sell insurance but it is a struggle.
good,"Typical day in the office would be to make calls from the desk you rent from the company, phone, resources,mail, etc are all at the Agents costs.  One meeting a week, not much interaction with partners who are supposed to help you.  The company wants your top 200 personal contacts to start your business, with a 3% retention rate, those contacts stay with the company if you leave.  You must work with a partner that will help you build your business, otherwise you are just wasting your time and money.   You need 10 to 20 appointments a week to survive"
good,"good work environment. flexible hours. event planning, meeting new people. providing families with the sense of protection that is needed. learned a lot about cold calling."
good,"New York Life used to have a one-of-a-kind Illustration System used by all their agents."
good,"I learned to work a dm 1000 meter machine, received mail from post office, which included sorting street addressed  mail, packages from UPS, FEDEX, DHL, and sorted them to individual departments."
good,I cannot speak to the environment as it has been 6 years since I left there and I have no idea what it is like now at all. It is unfair to comment and I would be wrong.
good,this company provides a great product but you do have to work a lot to make it work. Most of the time this would not pay off. Also it helps to be a bit older because people take you more seriously.
good,"The NYLIM is a subsidiary investment firm under New York Life Insurance Company. whereas to it parent company, It's corporate culture is more toward to that in investment banking. There have been a lot changes to organizational structures."
good,"Have to be Self Motivated and like to work on your own."
good,I was able to get a warm welcome into the financial services industry. I learned how to sell advanced products and annuities but more importantly I learned how to react with clients and service them on a needs based basis.
good,"too much pressure, learned that insurance field may not be for me"
good,"Compensation is irradic, no base, once hired receive very little support from upper management. Most of the managment have very little success in the sales area before the move to management."
good,"It's all up to you. You need to have a growth mindset to succeed. It will reward you for your work ethic and perserverence. The people are great people, and the company has been in existence for a very long time and it shows."
good,"I worked for NYLife through a third party company as a Recruiting Consultant in 2 separate roles, over 5.5 years. I first worked in a Sales Office and loved the environment. Great field sales managers and staff, really awesome culture. Then transferred to a Home Office role and began supporting Sales Managers nationwide. I worked alongside an amazing team within the Cultural Markets area and met great people. I truly enjoyed getting to interact and work with new people everyday and to support managers across the country. I would say that there is a big disconnect between upper management and the middle area employees, but nothing too detrimental to the culture of the teams."
good,It is a good place to learn financial services and Life Insurance.  It is hard to make it a career for long term.  The products are great for clients.
good,"If you're willing to work long hard hours, success is inevitable "
good,"NONE>... Having to start from the ground up was indeed challenging... You must build your center of  influence immediately to succeed or you will fail. Calling ONLY your friends and family will not get you far! You must be disciplined to get out and network, and create your activities."
good,"Good company, people are friendly and helpful. Time flexible. This company allows growth for agents. Hard business to get into when starting off, but with dedication and good work ethic, its a good career."
good,"Let me say New York Life was great. My co-workers benefits and life-style was great. But there was little advancement, they said they want management to encourage job progression but there was hardly ever any movement on that. "
good,"Every morning you check the emails and the phone messages. Return  any calls immediately. Delete emails of no importance. Go through mail. Take out the tickler file and find the day your in and any passed days that you may have missed. Check the paperwork that is in the files and make calls, make appointment, deliver paperwork or file away what needs to be filed. Check NYL 21 for new business and anything that needs to be addressed immediately, if so call owner  with updates."
good,100% commission. Must make min amount to keep contract and benefits. Monthly salary not a given. Pay is not consistent. Enjoy the freedom of owning your business and schedule is flexible.
good,Your gonna learn a lot if you have the right drive and the right management in your specific office. Great starting point if you want to break into the industry.
good,"Failure rate in first three years about 90%."
good,very relaxed place to work with very nice people to work with. I learned a lot there about New York Life Ins. Management there was very nice and the culture there was good. there was no hard part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was everything. I was lucky to be the receptionist there.
good,"It was a good sales experience.  You had a lot of freedom to work your own schedule and find your own leads.  The people who i worked with were great workers and formed a great team.  most of the managers there were there to help and wanted you to succeed.  however, i feel that my manager was not looking out for my best interest.  She had here favorites, and i got most of my support from other managers."
good,"I was an insurance agent.  I sold all life insurance and investments products.  My goal was to provide financial guidance to people, help them with their financial needs with the NYLife products. I learned running your own business is hard.  The company was very supportive in trying to help you succeed as an agent."
good,"Management has no clue!  Mgmt is changing a 170 year success story into a manage on the fly operation - no regard for employees, clients or the company - they want to make the fast buck and leave.  What a disgrace to such a long-tenures, triple A rated company."
good,"NYL was probably the toughest job experience I ever had, but I grew the most through the trials of working for 100% commission."
good,New York Life is a great company with a great product line. It was perhaps the hardest job I ever had. The sacrifices I made and the benefits I recieved were not exactly on scale. I guess that was part of my rite of passage.
good,"New York Life is an excellent career for a self driven individual. You are under contract for three years making you a captive agent but have the ability to work independently but under minor supervision. If you are an agent working outside of your general office, you can not expect much help, but when you are helped, the staff is very knowledgeable. Hardest part of the job is prospecting. If you are not from the area you are planning on working in, you might want to give financial services through New York Life a second thought. If you plan on working an area where you are established, it may be a good choice for you. Most enjoyable aspect of this position is the freedom to make your own schedule."
good,"The typical day of work can involve a day of phone calls to potential customers, paperwork at the office or a series of meeting with other associates and management."
good,New York Life was a good company to work for. My immediate supervisors we're great. They allowed me to run my own operation (within the guidelines) as long as I produced positive results. I was able to grow personally grow within the corporate setting and learned a lot about myself and how I am able to perform under pressure.
good,Great place to get started if you want to put your foot in the insurance/financial world. Provide a lot of good training and a lot of opportunities to start and build your business
good,Learned a lot about the steps in prospecting for leads and the entire recruiting process. From initial screening of resumes to having possible candidates come in for the interview process.
good,"My time at New York Life was a great experience and very helpful education through their NYLIC-University."
good,I was a self employed agent and could work my days either in an office or at home.  I met with customers either in my office or in their home or office.  Objective was for sales of various types of life insurance as well as long term care and other investment products.
good,"From a cold market, developed own book of business , meet with intervals and business owners regarding their insurance and financial needs, closed sales and maintained a new class leader of new applications for 6 of 12 months."
good,"Every day you are given work in your que, It may differ from day to day, You could have all necessary paperwork to be able to pay out on the policy, you may have message you need to return or sending letters and forms to beneficiares to complete. Making payments and reviewing funeral home assignments and re-assignments"
good,Hiring a manager outside the company seems to be a huge mistake. Many people complained about the newly hired Claims Intake Manager & that she is a racist.  She has made many employees want to look to work else where. Complaints to upper management & HR are useless! I still work here until I can find a job I enjoy. She has said a lot of racial references. Just sad I may need to leave so I can have a positive atmosphere.
good,"There are lots of good things about this company, but really think about if it is the job for you.  Management is not tuned in, the efforts to improve the culture don't seem sincere and virtually NO advancement."
good,"To be successful at New York Life, you must be self driven and motivated.   It is a good career for the people who are driven for that kind of enterprise."
good,"I had very good immediate managers who gave me a lot of freedom and respect. I gained some very valuable experience and skills and knowledge as well. However, sales I discovered is not something I wanted to do longterm."
good,Call prospective clients on a daily basis.  I learned about life/health insurance and Long-term care.  I found it difficult to be successful starting a sales career later in my work life.
good,"This is a great company to work for however the office I was in and its management are in dire need of a makeover. Its all about kissing but unless you are related to someone. They play the favorites game and they don't even try and hide it."
good,"My early years were very favorable, but focus has changed over time, and though the company is overall a great company to be a part of.  Recent management has changed the ability to grow & develop professionally, and the business you oversee"
good,New York Life has excellent products and a great marketing presence. The push for productivity creates a stressful environment where it does not allow the sales force to develop a client base in the right manner to become a successful agent.
good,"The management team was great. There were a few problems with one of the Dallas Managers, but there is always one. The Mgt; accepted my willingness to learn and had a key member teach me as much as I wanted, It really was a great environment to learn in, was able to help clean up queus and assist in putting things in order and get my regular job done as well."
good,"When I began working at New York Life Ins Co, I was very comfortable as there were many employees there that were my age. As the company changed management, life at the company got a little more serious. I don't feel that I was taken very seriously when I worked in the Controller's Division. I found work more satisfying when I worked in one of the company's profit centers. The area was smaller and more concentrated and I liked that better."
good,Job was simple. Not many new things one had to deal with on a daily basis. A lot of memory is required when dealing with many cases at once. Basically many of the same things daily.
good,New York Life as a company is a great place to work. The branches are a little different and the whole balance completely depends on the management team of each individual office.
good,I was a temp employee at the time. My time being there I learned a lot. Being productive learning a lot with the financial side of customer service and also the clerical side.
good,"This is a very traditional company. Great benefits. People tend to stick to the firm due to the benefits. In summer, it's half-day Fridays."
good,"I spend majority of my day answering phone calls and working directly with Financial Advisers and clients on their managed accounts. The rest of the day or overtime is spent processing new paperwork and account maintenance items. I learned a lot within the financial Industry and how to multi-task and work well under pressure. We are currently under going organizational changes due to poor management so I have note been exposed to the best management structure. However, my co-workers and myself have formed a strong team are able to balance each other's tasks out. The hardest part of the job is that there is constantly new challenges that arise every day. Just when you think you know everything there is to know, you learn something new. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere and constantly learning something new. I take pride in being challenged and feel proud when I am able to work my way through a difficult task."
good,"Would help clients with their finances for the future and now. Either to grow money, preserve money or allocate money for retirement. Learn about many financial vehicles and new ways on how to grow money. My co-workers were great and I really loved coming into work everyday to see and talk to them.  The hardest part of my job was finding clients and the best part of it was building a plan and solution that would help them better their lives and help their families."
good,A typical day at work. Taking inbound calls for AARP members.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Geared to young early career people, training is very good.  Must be willing to work 60 hour week to start. Very little income until you become established."
good,Interview was easy. Networking. Phoning . Insurance. Names.
good,"Sales/training classes three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) "
good,A typical day at work is really up to the Agent. You have to be very proactive when it comes to being familiar with the tools necessary to succeed. The management is very good about maintaining contact with each agent and is willing to help when necessary. The most difficult part of the job is trying to build a business without any base pay. The best part about this career is the relationships you can build with your clients and prospects and the capabilities you develop in financial knowledge.
good,"Depending on the group and the department, this place can be wonderful or dreadful. Benefits are OK. I appreciate on site FREE gym; however other benefits (such as medical) are very expensive, with limited options for healthcare providers. They used to offer choices but starting this year, all healthcare needs are provided by Aetna and they have ridiculously high deductibles for both individual and family. "
good,"As an agent with New York Life, you mostly have freedom to determine your work schedule, which is a benefit and a challenge. While the long term compensation can be great, getting momentum and a steady income stream can be difficult.  "
good,"I learned a lot from this internship as far as how to organize a movement, the importance of putting together a competent team, and how much effort you need to put into making a dream."
good,"up 6 am breakfast, shower, dressed, follow up on news , markets, e-mails. review appoints and activity for the day such as calls to make."
good,"I'm glad I did it but make no mistake, it's a tough gig and it's not for everybody.  Everything they say IS true by way of unlimited income.  I saw new agents pull multi-thousand dollar FYC's in one sitting...however, that was with them having thier series 6/63 licensing."
good,"Good place to work, great compensation, but not feasible as a single parent working on commission only working 7 days a week."
good,Can make very good money here if you meet a lot of new people. They suggest booking 15-20 new appointments a week to stay in business.
good,MEETING CUSTOMERS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE.
good,"A typical work week was going to San Mateo to classes on Monday from 7am-12pm. Then going to San Francisco and working until 6pm. Everyday was about 8am-8pm. I learned that its important to work in a field that you are passionate about. Yes I do have great connections and that is how I did well, but its more important to work in a field that you love and trust the company and environment you work in. Management was not great. Everyone was really disorganized and getting my paycheck seemed to always be a problem. Hardest part of the job I wasn't doing what I loved. Most enjoyable is that some of the coworkers and I got along really well."
good,Job location in westchester New York made the day extremely long. It was a great company to work for.
good,Es una empresa que se enfoca a mantener a sus agentes motivados para que puedan alcanzar sus metas financieras.
good,Due to upper management and a hostile environment towards the African American community in the office at the time I felt is was best to move on in another direction.
good,"New York Life is a wonderful company, they have different policy's so understand you might be walking into something different but culture of the company is wonderful the work is good and steady."
good,"They have high expectations yet you are paid the minimum. You can barely breath between calls because they never stop"
good,Management is great but the hardest part of this job is starting out with no salary with 100% commission. It can seem a little daunting but the staff do their best to make sure you are successful. I left because I want to be a full-fledged financial adviser and I wanted it a lot sooner than I thought could happen with New York Life. I still think it's a great company to work for with great people.
good,"New York Life Insurance Company is nice to work for.  A clean environment nice management and great training.  Commission based only, so if you don't have a backup plan it may not be something you would want to do."
good,I enjoyed working at New York Life.  The only thing I didn't enjoy is that every week you have to start over with the hustle of acquiring new clients.
good,Great people to work with.  I enjoy the daily work.  It is to your advantage if you have experience with sales and connections to the business world or a certain market of people.
good,"This is a great opportunity for someone who already has a strong market to sell to. Otherwise, you may struggle to find footing in an area saturated with others trying to do the same job. In general, the training was good, the culture was positive, and the management did care."
good,Good company i always loved to work with them and yes im hard working i can do 15hrs a day and i also have some online data entry experience i just need one chance to prove my self.
good,"New York Life gives a fair opportunity to its people. If you put in the work, you can be rewarded well. However, a lazy attitude can set you up for failure. It is an environment where motivated individuals can succeed with great support by the educational resources and management."
good,"The environment is very friendly and the work is also very good. At times, the number of meetings may get overwhelming, but the overall experience is great."
good,"Nothing wrong with the company. Great atmosphere but Income is based only on commissions. Not a stable income"
good,Cant wait to return.  It was an amazing experience.  I learned a lot from the company and cannot wait to apply my knowledge to the field and to keep expanding.
good,The enviroment did not do much after getting into the basics of the business and did not have support. It was more that you ran your own clients and were independent. Sales support staff and IT was extremely helpful online and at the Office.
good,"Great company, but tough to start an insurance career without having a salary.  100%  commission.  I only left because I needed to get a consistent income."
good,It was a great place to work. The pay was great. They had a lot of fun activities for the employees during the week to break up the monotony. Managers were on point with meetings and feedback.
good,I love work there nothing bad to say about New York Life...if was wonderful to work a well ran company ....................................................
good,"not bad to work there, benefits are good. nice people.  8:30 -5pm job, management is professional and nice environment,  opportunity of advancement if you are willing to relocate."
good,Supporting young sales associates with details trainings to prepare for real life meetings and set up realistic expectations for the long hours and hard work needed to be successful.
good,"As anywhere, lots of office politics.  Before I resigned, I saw a lot of good people let go because they did not support certain cliques.  Management railroaded employees that wouldn't go out for (LONG) lunches offsite."
good,"Helping people achieve financial security by contacting them, scheduling appointment and explaining the different plans."
good,"company trains its employee's extremely well. Been to several companies and looked into their training and hands down you will get the best in the industry training at NYL. What NYL lacks is that they do not put that much support behind you to see you succeed. If you bring clients in and need help with them a manager will help, but the managers will not help to create a market for their advisers."
good,"Great company.  Mentor program could have been stronger. The on boarding program was great, but once your contract was triggered, often times you were left on your own to find your own prospects."
good,"Talk to 5 new people every day..............."
good,"No one had any responsibility, all decisions were bumped up the line. People at the to[ were harried and did not respond quickly to issues. However the working conditions were excellent."
good,"Not a bad place to work. But, not enough time dedicated to the informing of associates to the dues and don't of the company. As it pertains to writing business and that business coming off."
good,"Tough industry, there is money to be made if you work for it. Tough not being on salary, no structured schedule. You make your day plan and schedule, in turn you get paid for what you complete."
good,No advancement opportunities into management roles. They hire from outside vs prompting from within. I have enjoyed my time there but time for another career opportunity
good,I enjoyed it here.  Too bad they switched software vendors. Could have done so much more. People were good. IT organization was small but good. Great opportunity to learn and grow.
good,"NY Life is a very ethical company with a strong financial service offerings. Very good training system, always keeping clients best interests as a priority."
good,"I was able to increase and hone my skill set whilst employed at NYL. Training was regarded as the norm and greatly encouraged, I felt that if I was employed there permanently, I could get even more training, as much as I needed. "
good,Must always be actively seeking new prospects. Must work to maintain active relationship with all existing clients. Must be willing to work at all hours.
good,Too much unnecessary traveling to the customer and underwriting procedures hinder a Agent from getting more out in the territory. Does not have enough time to proceed to next client.
good,"New York Life is a great company to work for, it does take a lot to be successful. You have to have an Entrepreneurship mentality to stay on top and the best of all is that you will get a lot of knowledge about the finance industry."
good,Great place to work for work life balance. Focussed on ensuring that the employees achieve goals. Great on site facilities such as medical and gym. There are many ERG's to be involved in.
good,This was my first job insurance being that I was fresh out of college.  This involved putting together a contact list and selling life insurance to potential buyers.  I found out after the 6 months that I was there that this is something I did not want to do.
good,My job was to research and find new clients for the agents i was working for. This was a good experience for me to gain an insight into the industry and work with others
good,Great culture and environment to work for. They start you off with  a training program to get you certified to sell insurance and you must sell a certain amount before moving on to financial products.
good,It was nice working there but sometimes it was stressful especially when you are in commission only. But over all I like helping families plan for their future.
good,"I got my start in insurance at New York Life.  They had a great training program, I was given all the support needed for job.  Friendly work environment."
good,Nice people to work for.  Clean establishment with lots of perks.  I liked the management and the way they were so understanding.  I liked the hours and the people
good,Didnt really accomplish alot there.While I was there I didnt make much money due to the difficulty of selling the product to people. It is hard to sell their products to an average person.
good,"I was working under someone else as an assistant so the experience was nice. I worked mostly from home so that was convenient too. It’s a lot of talking to clients over the phone & bookin appointments, explaining basic life insurance concepts."
good,Great place to work.  New York LIfe is a great place to work the people and CEO are topnotch. Everyone works in a team and the environment is fun and engaging.
good,Hours were scheduled and strict and the job was easy to maneuver with my full time job as well. Average job that wasn't particularly hard or challenging for me.
good,"Didn't care for the interview process because of my lack of sales skills, improvise skills, and accepting natural market"
good,Good experience and management track. Great place to enter the financial services industry. Training is topnotch. This is the best company in the industry.
good,"You are on your own here.  This industry means that you are self -motivated and have the means to market yourself to obtain leads.  This leads will lead to appointment which will hopefully lead to sales.  you will have to produce or you will not be able to afford to stay.  The company did provide good training and is a highly rated company.  If you don't know people with money that will do business with you, you better have the money to market for your leads."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"100% commission job.  don't let them fool you."
good,A typical day was on the phone all day either receiving inbound calls from Agents or making outbound calls to agents and clients.  A lot of certifications and training is necessary.  I worked in a small group of 8 people.
good,"The people are great! "
good,"I learned the importance of and gained satisfaction from keeping the Company's promise to our customers. I learned to treat customers right, pay what we owe, say ""no"" when necessary"
good,A typical day is busy and educational. Always learning something new. Staff is great and the established agents are willing to share the wealth of knowledge.
good,Muy buena compania para trabajar y aprender del campo de seguros y finanzas
good,"New York Life was a pretty laid back environment, all of the agents were very friendly and helpful. I learned how to manage and work with Sales Central the CRM."
good,"The compensation is decent and the benefits good.  However, the culture is poisonous.  Employees don't work to uplift one another.  Instead, they tear each other down and vie for each other positions.  There is also a clear lack of diversity in Management.  Most people are extremely negative about their role, management, and their chances of career advancement.  As such, turnover is high.  Management needs to look internally for candidates to fill positions.  Corporate needs to work extra hard to foster an environment that supports teamwork instead of individual accomplishments."
good,"The people are genuinely friendly, they are willing to explain and go over material necessary for you to complete your tasks. Everyone is work oriented and have an appreciation to be working at New York Life."
good,"New York Life gives you the ability to create your own career and work with an entrepreneurial mindset. Although there is a lot of guidance and teaching available to you as you begin, there is a great amount of independence needed as well."
good,Great training and education with a great company.  For the right person who likes a sales driven career that is centered around helping others it can be the perfect fit.
good,"A typical day was 10 hours, was always learning about the sales process,prospecting,follow up,communication skills,and customer service skills. Developed very good social skills that incteased my success in my career with NYLIC."
good,I worked here for 9 years (during that time I left for 8 months to try another company and ended up coming back because I missed the culture) and don't regret it.
good,I learned a lot from the company and my various managers. I had a lot of great experiences starting out as one of my first jobs out of college.  I earned my MBA while working here and they were very supportive both with scheduling and financial reimbursement.
good,Pay is based purely on commission. Must be good at talking and meeting with people.  Has potential to be a high paying career if your good at it.  Lots of freedom to run your own schedule.
good,New York Life Insurance Company is a very competitive driven work environment where small room for error is allowed.  Majority of workers are self-motivated - smart.
good,"You are your own boss managing your business.  The hardest part of the job is that you are pure commission based and you need to sell, sell, sell to be successful"
good,"Finding life insurance prospects . Showing the importance of protecting individuals and families from the unexpected loss of life and or income. pay off a mortgage, education for children.etc"
good,Outsourcing to TCS has created a stressful work environment. NYL employees were laid off and were told that their jobs were eliminated when in fact those jobs were filled with cheaper labor.
good,"Management in constant flux and seeking direction. "
good,"Excellent training and support, but you have to be financially able to give yourself time to start making money. State registered required but company helps with costs."
good,Used to be a Loyal place to work for a long term career until many IT jobs were outsourced and employees layed off. Good for gaining technical experience
good,"A typical day is all inclusive; always in the working mood and having the mindset of the business owner. It is stressful, but rewarding none the less. Learned a lot about myself, and gained the insight into my character; hard-work is something that is I will carry with me forever."
good,Management and co-workers are great. I was kept very busy which is good thing; many opportunities to learn and grow. The hardest part of the job was learning the terminology of insurance. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients.
good,"Productive workplace, difficult for single parent with flexible hours needed on evenings and weekends. Not a steady income when your pay is determined strictly on commission."
good,"I am a policyholder and therefore an ""owner""."
good,"decent company but its up to the person."
good,One of the largest insurance companies in the US with 171 years in business and profitable over the last 60 years despite downfalls in the market
good,"This is an extremely hard Gig! If you don't have your Mother,Brother,Cousin,Aunt,Uncle,Father,Nephew,Next door Neighbor,Friend or anyone else you could pitch the products to,just imagine walking up to a complete stranger and start talking about Insurance?Trying to sell Insurance is not for everyone.They will tell you that right up front!"
good,"i loved the people and friendly atmosphere. Learned a lot as a programmer and business analyst in analysis, design, development, and implementation of software products"
good,Fun organization with multiple opportunities.  Progressive organization with technical and career opportunities.  This is a must work organization with opportunity for all levels of work.
good,"Recently I was working with a Honda of Tenafly which is a family business. The team of leadership is great which keep you focused on the task for the day. However, the organization is growing and making changes as they face the challenges in the industry. "
good,NYL has been a great place to work with extremely supportive management.  I have learned so much from my colleagues who have helped me grow and develop over the last 12 years.
good,I enjoyed my 4 years 3 months in this company. Company is very much supportive to employees. The hardest part of job is high targets.
good,Great company to work for as its very highly rated. NewYorkLife offers a great training curriculum with plenty of valuable resources for the agents success.
good,It was very fun being able to go out and educate people on life insurance and all of the other agents were very supportive and willing to help when ever help was needed. I was able to learn a lot while working with New York Life mainly because I was able to become friends with the other agents and I believe they really helped me learn a lot. There was ONE Managing Partner who helped me the most and was always there if I needed assistance in any way.
good,NY Life has a relaxed work environment and the managers are very friendly. My position has little supervision. Everyone is very helpful if you have any questions.
good,"Able to maintain better relationship with co workers and customers."
good,Strong focus on education and training.  You can make this whatever you put into it.  Just make sure it is the right thing for you and your family.
good,"Excellent company and corporate culture."
good,Your productivity all depends on how busy the hotel is. Charging reservations and answering phones to either cancel or make reservations. Providing great customer service and being as accommodating as possible. There is not a manager on property therefore if any issues come you will have to try and solve them yourself or call the manager and try and solve the issue over the phone. The hardest part of the job would have to be not being able to control many of he situations without approval first. The tasks and job itself are not difficult.
good,It is a very nice place to work for. Not very hectic and learnt many new things that were challenging. the management and co workers very helpful and fun.
good,"Good benefits,"
good,This company has a very good training system to teach agents about their financial products and sales skills. Managers care about agents very much and very supportive to agents performance.
good,"A typical work day consist of answering calls from agents and clients regarding retirement plans - discussing fund/distribution options."

good,Assisted clients achieve financial security with the broad spectrum of safe financial products and insurance lines.
good,"The company provided significant training but the 100% commission structure is extremely challenging.  I have tried my hardest to get off the ground, but without a base salary I ran out of personal savings to keep going."
good,Great workplace one once in a lifetime opportunity the order of operation is sorta out of whack there though.
good,"I worked through an internship program for 1 year.  "
good,"I was in charge of putting together reports used for weekly meetings."
good,"New York Life Investment Managent fostered an environment of open thought and innovation. The focus was on the success of their participants and investors in succeeding in retirement planning.

good,Interacting directly with clients to promote certain financial instruments and encourage clients to invest in their future.
good,Get to know everyone you work with from top managers to team members.  Creates strong team work ethic.
good,The agent that works for this company is a really good agent who cares about her clients. I only had the privilege to work with her for one summer because I had to start my senior year of high school. If you want an agent to talk to about my life insurance this is the company to talk too. The hard part of the job was when clients were upset because they got denied insurance for being too late because of their health condition. The best part was that it helped me become more organize because it was a lot of filing and paper work.
good,"As a Licensed Agent, you look for prospective clients where ever you can, which means looking into choosing specific markets. You can attend networking events, walk & talks, canvassing, talk to those you know, etc. You execute marketing strategies for personal and business branding."
good,I was able to become familiar with cold calling techniques and other sales tools implimented by New York Life agents.
good,New management structure challenging employees to grow. Several rows of layoffs in 2012.
good,The hardest part of this job was selling life insurance.  A typical day included prospecting and setting appointments.  I worked on my own under the supervision of my managing partner.  The position was a 100% commission based.
good,"Sold annuities and life insurance. I made around $35,000 as a young man living in NYC and decided to try my hand with Hewlett Packard so i could save that money and make another 28k with the objective of returning home and buying a new home as well as starting a family."
good,I learned to provide financial illustrations for current and new clients looking to invest in variable annuities and life insurance policies.
good,Client Service professional with work experience in variable and fixed products/services within Insurance and commercial
good,Great Company entrepreneurial environment must be a self starter and risk taker
good,Very exciting because I had the chance to work with new members within their first 90 days and also on the retention side to try and save a member
good,Excellent opportunity to round out my perspective on the actuarial profession.
good,"On a typical day of work I either spent sometimes on the phone calling potential clients to offer them my services, or sitting with clients to go over their needs and help them accomplish their financial goals."
good,If you can get through the first 3 years a great company to work for. But you have to build your own business.
good,I learned how to negotiate salaries and how to judge people on character.
good,Entering life insurance applications into a specific system. Had to reach a certain applications entered.
good,Help prospective clients analyze their financial needs and recommend appropriate solutions through insurance and financial products and concepts.
good,"Typical day is prospecting, making calls to clients, learning products & updates, and conferring with manager."
good,"New York Life is a fantasic company, a leader in the Insurance industry. They offer a ton of information, training, and knoweldge. They have some of the best sales people in the country working for them. However if by nature you are not naturally a type A personality, you will struggle with their culture."
good,Awesome company. Interned my senior year of college. work with top performers helpiong them build client bases and implemented a client management system as a way to track current clients appointments and potential leads.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I actually enjoyed going into work each morning.
good,"It's a great place to begin your career and develop knowledge and skills.  Hard work is rewarded.    It is difficult to move around the company and once you are in a role, plan to stay in it for awhile. Health insurance has a very high deductible and somewhat costly employee contributions. Not very flexible in terms of working remotely.  Parking is not convenient."
good,"Pros"
good,"Company does treat its employees well although My job is underpaid for the duties we perform. "
good,Being able to use my experience and expertise to meet and exceed the expectations of the customer as well as the clients all while providing courteous service.
good,"Talent is useless unless it's developed. Excellent training, but agents must be able to successfully apply it. The biggest complaint I have is chargebacks. You can go weeks without pay because a customer missed a premium payment. Training allowance is a lie. You're pretty much on your own. Work hard, call 50 people a day, you'll make it. Anything less, you won't. Its basically a 20k a year job for most."
good,Was difficult to balance starting at my age on a 100% commission job for life insurance and handling a family of 6 and all that comes with that as well.
good,"Work very hard, learn all you can - exploit your book of business and you may earn a reasonable salary that you could also earn elsewhere without calling all of your friends and neighbors and going door to door business to business to sustain yourself. It pays very good commissions but you really must be a self starter and it helps if you have a working spouse of supportive family member."
good,"NYL has good and bad qualities.  They tried to provide a work life balance but due to the nature of business, it was often hard. Overall, a good place."
good,"You can work as much or as little as you like, but it will greatly affect you income. A better place to start if you are young and do not have a lot of bills as the income is low for the first year on average. There is that 2% that will make much more. Training is amazing with New York Life, they will help you every step of the way."
good,Great people to work with. Senior management team not very interested in development of staff certain ares. There are some areas senior management focuses solely on development.
good,"Great company, Albany GO is only okay. Mandatory morning meetings with no ""meat"". Doesn't follow curriculum prescribed by company so the office is behind on product knowledge and company standards."
good,"Overall NYL is a great company with great benefits. However, my department (Corporate Service Department) was not a good one. I experienced discrimination from my upper management and a couple coworkers. Corporate politics are a big deal. Upper management does not care about their employees. They only care about their image and work to be done no matter what. No room to grow."
good,Have lots of friends and family that support your endeavor. Be prepared to spend a lot of time prospecting. Look for a commitment to the long haul not the quick rewards
good,"Partnering with New York Life has been a fantastic journey.  "
good,Commission base income. Cold calling and prospecting to gain clientele. Diverse portfolio for wide range of clients. Provide good financial planning for clients.
good,I think NYLI is a great company with a good product to offer. Personally sales wasn't for me but it was a great learning experience. The hardest part was building my own client base with no leads.
good,"Drive around to different businesses and introduce myself and the products we have to offer.  Gather information and set up appointments with HR/Business Owners."
good,"It of course was a commission based sales position.  It was not a bad career as long as you make sales.  Everyone needs life insurance, you just have to convince them that they do before it gets too expensive, or worse it is too late.  I only left due to the death of a close family member.  Selling life insurance and having to relive the sudden death was too much for me."
good,"We learned a lot about different sales situations"
good,"Was and is a good company to work for, unfortunately I did not have the network to support the business at this time."
good,"I believe the company have a great mission, however, managers in different depts make it difficult to advance/move up the career ladder. I like the company as a whole but I think the managers needs to be trained."
good,"NyLifes Advanced Market network was designed for the independent market. I was really excited about that when I joined the team. However, they had little resources and organization/communication to accomplish that. It was disappointing."
good,"Effect the sale and marketing of Life insurance, as well as personal, retirement and estate planning for the Industry Leader in Life Insurance.  Develop qualified leads and set appointments for financial services products."
good,"I loved the company and all the opportunities it offered to learn and grown as an individual, in your area of work or other areas to move internally.."
good,"weekly training and independent sales for the rest of the week"
good,"You're on your own here, not much oversight and targets to hit. I perhaps did not take as much advantage of the training offered, but overall the sales aspect of the business just wasn't for me"
good,It's a good company to work for and has good employees and benefits. Overall its a good place to work for anyone. I have had good personal and professional relationships with everyone.
good,"Good experience, learn a lot from working with licensed professionals. Management is good and is willing to work with individuals to grow them into successful agents."
good,The potential at New York Life is great and the comp plan allows you to make unlimited amounts of money however it is very difficult to generate your own business. The company does not provide any leads.
good,New York Life was not my cup of tea.  I could not push myself to prey on the needs of my friends.  Everybody needs to be prepared for the future but it is up to them not me.
good,"A typical day at work is leaning from the best. Being taught how to run a successful business and to develop your brand in the most productive, efficient manor possible, I must attribute to New York Life. Providing me with the platform to run my business the way I see fit is an amazing experience at New York Life. What I have learned at New York Life is impossible to measure. My deepest gratitude to my mentors."
good,"Process claims, request and review medical records"
good,requires a lot of your time and energy i didn't hate it but its very sales driven you don't sell you don't eat pretty much much needed product didn't hate it
good,Half Day Fridays in the Summer. Jeans and casual dress each day of the week.  On site gym and cafeteria.  Plenty of parking and generous benefits.  Heavy Community involvement.
good,"NYL was a very busy location and the employees were very close.  However, with time work has changed and it no longer felt like a family place to work in."
good,Good job security.  You have to make your own career path with little to no guidance.  Management is lacking overall.  The people/culture is better than most corporate environments.  Great benefits.
good,I worked as a secretary for an impendent life insurance agent.  He was elderly and only worked part-time himself. This was a slow paced office where he mostly tried to keep the policies of his clients going until he decided to retire in his old age.
good,This was a great job and I stayed many years with NYL. But things change drastically in 2007 when a new CEO took the reigns. The company became cut throat and cared less about the employees .
good,"My position was eliminated and outsourced to a company out of state.  Otherwise, a great company to work for. Flexible work hours, fun activities and food provided by the Social Committee."
good,"Training and tools to do the job were excellent."
good,Sometimes very quiet and boring. Had 2 bosses that were total opposites.  One of them was very particular and the other was very relaxed and kicked back.
good,I enjoyed the job but it was difficult to stay in a job purely based on commission. I did enjoy the flexible schedule but I felt like I was thrown to the wolves after being certified and told to find clients the next day.
good,Good company to work for. Work and life balance. Appropriate training. Developers should be held more accountable of their responsibilities. Overall good company to work for.
good,"I appreciated the New York Life work atmosphere, up to a certain point. While they have great management and training, they also hover and micromanage their agents. The helpfulness of the office staff and management make up for it mostly. "
good,"This organization fundamentally have a strong presence when it comes to their long history, however their organization policies could be subjected to small changes to accommodate some of the transiting agents into the company or leading out."
good,"I have been working for L.A. Business Personnel at New York LIfe in San Ramon for the last couple of years and L.A. Business Personnel always answers my questions and have been a pleasure to work for."
good,"Was responsible for short term investing of available funds for investment to cover expenses on a short term of no more than 30 days. Ran weekly reports to let portfolio managers know how much cash they had to spend on weekly , monthly and a running 12 month time frame."
good,"A good company, but it took way to long to get through the back ground process. Asking about traffic violations from over 17 years ago! "
good,Overall its an excellent company with good benefits and good management. Good role for those who business to do for themselves
good,Typical day of work consisted of supporting 15+ Relationship Managers.  I enjoyed supporting them even on the craziest of days.  I loved working with my co-workers and consider myself a team player.
good,"Great place, just have to work hard and properly manage your time. It is very rewarding helping families. Management is very helpful. Hardest part is getting clients."
good,"Constantly provided with opportunity for vertical or horizontal career choices/transitions. Huge company with benefits package rivaled by few. Likable workforce, undergoing transformation."
good,This was a temp position. I enjoyed the job and the people. Management was very nice. I was only there 8 months and I learned a lot
good,This job offers a flexible work schedule and unlimited potential for earning.  It requires a lot of self-motivation and self-instructing.  It is a great place to work if you want to learn the most about the finance and insurance industry.  The hardest part of the job is continually having to prospect for new clients.  The best part is that you work for yourself but have a well respected team working with you.
good,"Great Company, Jacksonville General Office Questionable. Good Place to Start in the industry....Sales is Tough, If you can work in the office, good luck..."
good,I had the opportunity to shadow an employee of DoITT and learn what he does on a daily basis. It was a fun experience that I will remember fondly.
good,"Nothing bad to say, Excellent training program. But working on a commission basis is a tuff way to make ends meet.Great working atmosphere, Good teamwork."
good,Great Company to work with day to day. Learned some very valuable Customer Service and Treasury System skills over the years.
good,"New York Life is the big fish in the financial services/insurance industry. As a top 100 Fortune Company, they have top level managers who invest in their new people. My experience was no different than what I've described. Their system is well defined and a great opportunity for a hard working new agent who has a network of people. That piece is critical for a quick start. The timing just didn't work out for me personally. You must have people you know to call on. However, I believe the principled leadership exhibited at the Valley Forge, PA office is exemplary in the business."
good,"New York Life has a wonderful company with a wide variety of great products. The education there is constant, and most of the time very useful. The management support is great, when it's available."
good,sales environment cold calls and generate your own leads. good training though
good,"A typical day consistent of helping high net worth clients, my responsibilities were to interact with insurance brokers and high net worth client."
good,This is a 24/7 job. Very good compensation but always prospecting and very little off time.
good,"hardest part is finding new business"
good,"The training and products offered are perfect for the right client.  Having a management team that fosters your own skill set is also key.  The wrong manager means a short career with the New York Life.  You must be creative and willing to step outside the box.  The formula they offer (25 point system - ask) is critical to getting the necessary appointments per week."
good,"Job security, great co-workers. Job is administrative and focused on application input."
good,"-Self Motivated"
good,Job has high earning potential but tough to balance work and home life. Management expected lots of travel with zero compensation.
good,"Every day was something new from data entry to assisting customers and clients.  I learned so much professionally from this employer.  I started out in a high volume call center and was promoted to the inforce department within the first year.  I trained incoming employees on all areas of inforce so that they may be better at assisting clients in the call center.  I loved working with my fellow employees.  They were always greatful for the assistance that I provided and challenged me to be better at my job so they could be better at their job.  My favorite thing about New York Life was their involvement in the community.  I learned my passion was in assisting others and I was able to be a major part of the Volunteer for Life program. The only thing I didn't like was constant change in management.  My first manager was so great and really valued me as an employee and cared about my advancement. I was promoted within the first year.  However, it came to a stand still.  In the time I worked there I had 4 different managers and this made it so hard to keep proving myself to each one and advancement became impossible."
good,A normal day at work starts early and often ends late.  I learned a lot about the products and services available in the industry.  I am also painfully aware of how much the general public does not know.  It was enjoyable to try and educate those who I met with my new found knowledge.  The hardest part of the job is generating appointments.  Even though I was promised support it is very much a sink or swim environment.  Having been a manager I believe there is a lot more the company can do to support its new agents.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping new people.
good,"New York Life is a wonderful company for many, including Insurance Agents, Financial Services Professionals, and employees in the Home Offices in New York and in the four other Supervisory Offices across the country. "
good,This job was very rewarding. Some of the staff make it difficult to get along with them but otherwise a good company.
good,You are starting your own business selling there products. You will be educated in there system. The days should be long and six days a week if you want to have an income.
good,"The job itself is rewarding and interesting. The company is a great company to work for. The culture of some work areas are harmful with bullying happening, but nothing done to stop it."
good,"good place if its for the right person at the right time...enjoying my colleagues, my supervisors were great...never put me under pressure but i had to take time off to take care of my daughter"
good,"Need to have some income before starting because it is 100% commission, need to be very organized and have strong time management skills, need to be comfortable talking to family and friends about their financial goals and current medical conditions"
good,Very respectable company with growth potential. Willing to help with advancement as well as training. Open to employees opinions. Hard driving on perform
good,"You are expected to prospect people you already know. You need a large network of people, family and friends, who value what life insurance, both term and whole, can do for them. They also need to be healthy enough to be eligible for said insurance."
good,"Typical day was wonderful, great people to work with. I was welcomed when I started the job. If I ever had any issues or problems I could go to someone and get the help that I needed."
good,Routine work with opportunity to learn.  Very good Management and are open to suggestions.  Diverse culture with many Employee Resource groups. Work life balance.
good,"Great Training. "
good,Coming to work at New York Life each day means contributing to the financial goals of millions of families and businesses and providing them with peace of mind.
good,"Sales courses "
good,the job requires prospecting as the main focus. you meet with prospects to determine their financial needs and make appropriate financial concepts/proposals. You rely on a supportive management and you work in a competitive culture .
good,"I really meet some cool people and still are friends with them.  Good benefits. This was a call center enviroment, taking payments,explaining the coverage that they had. It is a good company to work at."
good,"NYL is overall a great place to work. Regardless of your level, you must be able to work independently in a fast-paced environment, and you must be proficient in multi-tasking, prioritizing and organizing."
good,"Although technology is advancing, the ability to  work remotely is diminishing. Everyone needs to CYA because the environment is increasingly unfriendly."
good,It was a great place to work however the exam that you take before you get the license is something I was not aware of. if you are working for a company that should have been provided by them.  but later on the help you get from them is great.
good,Toughest job I had but a great learning experience overall. They make sure you know how to talk to clients and also give you help when you needed it. Management was great too.
good,Outsourced valuable and experienced resources. New leadership is more worried about profit over the well being and value of their experienced and dedicated employees.
good,"Nice people, great pay. Only draw back was some mismanagement financial issues and communicating with upper management was difficult. Very welcoming group of people. A lot of competition. There's a lack of necessary training in general."
good,100% Commission. Financial and sales education is something in general every human being should know. Lifetime royalties on the customers is great (The Company You Keep)
good,typical corporate but good benefits and vacation/holidays.  good pay and many opportunities to move around.  I didn't care much for my manager at the time but all around the companies leadership was solid which I think to be very important
good,"You eat what you kill at New York life, for sure. However, they teach and guide you the whole way. They equip you with the skills and tools to be as successful as you want to be."
good,They offer a very good training program. Much like owning your own business but with the support of a strong established team behind you at any point.
good,the experience at this company allowed me to  interact and get involved with the community more so that I could reach out to new clients or potentially establish my own company
good,Great place to work if you're ok with a strictly commission job. They do their best to set you up for success. Having the freedom in your day is amazing but making sure you're productive with that freedom is key.
good,"They have a very cool place to chill and relax when you feel stressed. I only did an internship but the office was very well managed, people were very nice and the company overall was great."
good,NYL is good place to work at and learnt so much in short time.  Team is good and able to work effectively.  Good work culture and good exposure to all aspects of the project.  OVerall good company
good,basically spent majority of the day filing policies and spent the remaining time calling prospective agents to come in for meetings as well as call clients to set up appointments.
good,"New York Life was a very pleasant place to work.  I enjoyed the people and the work.  It was laid back but also very professional.  I learned a lot about Insurance and underwriting.  I also learned about many different cultures as the clients were of many different cultures.  "
good,"New York Life has nice people who don't shout at each other or act badly. But once you've been there for awhile it's much harder to get promotions.  Good benefits though, good bonus."
good,"NYL is a great atmosphere for those who are willing to work. There is a lot of room for advancement and potential. With a structured mentor ship and tons of guidance, if you're a self starter looking for unlimited potential, then NYL might be a good fit."
good,New York Life is a fast paced company that goes through consistent change. It challenges you to go the extra mile every day through self improvement and self education while pushing the envelope to perform at the highest possible level.
good,"No thank you no no no thanki don’t have anything to say about New York life the people are ok the managers not so much "
good,New York Life is an great company to work for with an amazing new agent training program and opportunities for career advancement within 2 years in a partner or other management role.
good,"The work schedule is flexible, but as you build your practice, you need to put in long hours.  The compensation is unlimited depending on your commission results. Training is best in the industry, but you have to commit to learning on your own.  Must be coachable and have an open mind."
good,"A positive work environment. Friendly, proactive, professional work environment. I would highly recommend New York Life as an employer. Open and honest."
good,"I really enjoyed the company and the atmosphere with training, company events, hands on training. They expected a lot from us and the training was a little short for all the information you have to process but you have a support system while training. They did major layoffs in the company and gave no formal notice. I didn't appreciate getting a call and hour and a half  before work saying I was no longer needed. Then you can't go to the location to pick up your belongings."
good,Great Company the management is fair but the environment is a sales org favoritism is always played. can be tough to get a fair assessment. Even with year after year positive annual review raises were minimal
good,I really enjoyed my time with this company.  Everyone was very friendly and great to work with. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. Seriosuly great place.
good,NYL is a decent place to work. As an mutual insurance company it doesn't have the market demands of a public company. Excitement depends on what part of the company you work for. I worked for the investment side. It is a life insurance company at heart.
good,I enjoyed working with New York Life.  I had to relocate was the only reason I chose to leave the company.  It is highly competitive so I would not advise working there if you are not competitive yourself.
good,"NYL is a mix of legacy people who have been there forever and the new generation.  The company is currently undergoing an outsourcing transformation, but as one of the last mutual insurance companies, it had that small company feel even as large company tools and processes are being implemented."
good,"the company has undergone many changes, far from how it used to be when  started, from less benefits to out sourcing most jobs. The company is constantly letting go of people we went from 300+ to under 80 and the CEO is always changing as well there was a new CEO every year I worked there. no consistence or security in the work place."
good,"Fast paced sales environment with potential high income earnings"
good,"The company is good, the people I worked with made going to work easy. Its a fast growing company, with good job experience, you are able to learn a lot and take from it good experience."
good,"I am a veteran of some of the traditional life insurers in NYC and have been at NY Life for 5 years.  Overall, I like the company.  The company is true to it's mutual mission and tries to what's right for it's customers.  "
good,"I would take about 150 in bound calls. I learned how to place trades on variable annuities. Management was good and very understanding. The work culture was great, and there was not anything hard about this job. the most enjoyable part of this position was the people i dealt with on the phone and in my office."
good,Great company to work for. Very hard financially to work there right away. Had your own schedule but expected a lot of time and effort put into every day.
good,"New York Life is a great company, probably one of America´s most iconic financial institutes and a pioneer in life insurance. That being said, their products are so intangible, that it takes a special skill and personality to succeed in this market."
good,Great company. If you go to work as a customer service rep you will NEVER get off the phones if you are good at what you do. Great benefits and generous time off.
good,"relaxed company to work for as long as you did your work there was no pressure from Management.  Open door policy and management was always very helpful. "
good,"I work as consultant in NYL and found this place for an excellent work life balance and good management."
good,"Like most things in life, working at New York Life is no different, the more you put into it, the more you'll get out if it. It also really depends on who your manager is. Trying to surround yourself around successful people is always key. I personally found it difficult to find my niche around the office."
good,"I had a good experience working at New York Life RPS. Lots of good people there doing a lot of hard work."
good,Outstanding training and development program for new agents.  Professional work environment and outstanding management team.  Compensation and benefits are second to none.
good,work hard  and get push to the Limit the only that matter the training is good but promoting blacks is hard managers spend more time helping the people they like
good,"Great company with room for growth. There is a free gym for employees and a wellness center on site. The 401k plan is also great. However, health insurance is very expensive. The dress is business casual. The headquarters is located right near Madison square park which is a great location. Work life balance is excellent!"
good,"Overall, I am grateful for the experience that brought many challenges my way. From prospecting to establishing and writing business there was always something to do and a new obstacle to overcome. I have obtained a great amount of knowledge from concepts and products, to sales process. I have enhanced my skills of working in teams and autonomously and leading large enrollments. I learned the struggle of a ""full commission job"" and endured going weeks with no pay. The competition in the office is relentless due to the fact we are located in a smaller area. Yet overall, I could not be happier with the experience this job has given me. With no hard work there is no satisfying reward."
good,"When you start working for NYL, if you don't have any experience, you must attend A LOT of training, which is good, but at the same time, that eats a lot of your working hours."
good,"Great experience, learned a lot in a short amount of time.Staff and agents are very nice and offer help in any way they can. Partners push to get work done ASAP so agents can make their commissions for month and year ends."
good,I worked for NYL for 1.5 years as a consultant.  The people were very nice.  There were a lot of amenities available to the employees.  They have an onsite gym and cafeteria.  The only issues were the business processes.  They were aware of those issues and were making changes.
good,"Typical day consisted of checking emails, setting up meetings, accepting meeting invitations, assist boss and his direct reports as needed, ordering supplies, doing all meeting logistics, printing documents as needed.  I learned a lot in my 18 years there.  Made many friends.  It's not the same company it was way back when I started. They don't want older individuals and when you turn 50, watch out, you might be next on the chopping block. There were so many benefits that were eliminated throughout the years and many management changes - constant change.  I feel I gave them my soul and they tossed me out to pasture when I turned 50.  I know many others who were also eliminated and feel the same way. Yes, I got a very decent severance package and I get a teeny pension that didn't cost me a cent, but being cut at a certain age can make a person feel worthless. I'm one of the lucky ones, I got another very good position, very close to my home."
good,They decided to outsource most of the IT department and that has cause new challenges in getting projects completed. The people to work with are good and talented and the ability to work from home is a plus.
good,"New York Life is a great company. I like its company culture and people in general.  At New York Life, there is up & down on the work."
good,"It is nice to have your own schedule, but everything that will make you successful is based on how well you build your business."
good,A place to explore possibilities in your career. The culture depends on which group and the span of responsibilities you share within the group.
good,"Company is supportive to employees to achieve work-life balance. Hierarchical management chain makes mission, strategy alignment hard. Many loyal, long term employees."
good,"I owe this company a lot of thanks for the thorough training into life insurance, the instructors willingness to review material with students until 100% of the class was on the same page."
good,"During my career at New York Life I have worn many hats, performed many job roles and duties. However what I loved most was the interaction with my customers and clients, I am a people person, it keeps me humble and what I have learned most about my career is that it is nice to be IMPORTANT, but it's more important to be NICE."
good,"Working at New York Life AARP Operations (known today as ""NYL Direct) was a very challenging opportunity.  To start from ZERO, to execute a business plan and turn an idea into reality was such a thrill.  "
good,"Life insurance is the core product, if you have the network to support life insurance sales this is an awesome place. If not, don't bother."
good,New York Life Insurance Company provides a great work life balance.  There are several different areas across the company to work in.
good,"New York Life is one of the greatest places to start your career. The training in this industry is second to none, even other company employees praise this company's training. You learn so many wonderful things about building a secure financial system for yourself as well as the people you help. You also learn to run your own business practice and see what it's like to be an entrepreneur (or a franchisee) with the help and status of one of the biggest and strongest mutual life insurance companies in the world today. Some think of agents at this company as only selling life insurance, and while it may start off as an insurance gig, you will gain more knowledge and can obtain licences to also be able to do investments among other things. While pay is good, it can be inconsistent at times. You also realize how hard you will have to work to become successful in this industry. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it."
good,"A career at New York Life is an amazing opportunity for a motivated self starter who is able to handle rejection.  Great training and learning opportunities.  Once you build momentum, you can shine.  However, people to call on is crucial.  A strategy for getting names will lead to success."
good,I learned great skills working for Advance Financial that I was able to use all throughout my life so far. From customer service to accounting skills.
good,"Great opportunities with a career at New York Life. But it also comes with no guarantee of making a steady income. This is a 100% commission based career. It involves going out there and meeting people every day, calling people every day. Setting appointments are crucial."
good,Long time ago.......great start place for young person to begin career in the insurance industry.
good,"They helped people think about there financial future and what it looked like later in life. "
good,"It has been a fun experience to work with NYL they have such a wonderful work culture anyone would be lucky to work within the company, i enjoy going into work each day"
good,"On a daily basis, I Managed the Director’s calendars and his daily priorities. I also handled all aspects of administrative support in a timely and professional manner, included created/reviewed memos, letters, presentations and reports. Scheuled heavy meetings. Prioritized phone, mail and email messages, responded to requests on behalf of manager. Assisted with budget planning and tracking through Clarity database, reviewed and processed invoices and expense reports for all employees in a specific cost center. "
good,"Awesome place to work. Great training, culture and possibilities. THe only problem is the possibilities. One needs to be sure if unstable income with high earning potential is right for him or her. If so, great place to work."
good,"Great co-workers and managers.  Good training.  Excellent compensation if you're willing to do the work.  You make your own schedule, which means you have to be self motivated to do well."
good,"Receives a high volume of inbound calls assisting participants with in service withdrawals, loan request, processing exchanges and realignments, and other financial transactions. The co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job is being a punching bag for participants that are unable to get their way, the most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone get what they need."
good,NYL is overall a great company to work for. The work life balance is great! Management is approachable and there are several training classes available.
good,"New York Life was a fast-paced call center/administrative environment. A typical day at work included answering 50+ inbound customer service calls as well as processing account changes accurately and quickly. I learned a great deal about mulit-tasking, but most importantly, how to do it in an effective and efficient manor. A large part of New York Life involved solving problems and finding solutions. This was a team effort involving every department, so working together as a team was critical to get the job done. The most challenging part of the job was communicating through the different channels due to the fact that there are separate offices throughout the country that all need to work together. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could sense that someone on the other end of my line was smiling and filled with relief when I was able to help out."
good,"Good company; however, work environment varies by department. Manager dictates the culture of the department."
good,"New York Life is a good company that is very well respected in the industry. For the most part, the people who work there are happy. The only drawback is that it is still very much a company run by actuaries. Therefore, if you are an attorney, MBA, finance professional, etc, you should realize that due to the culture your future advancement will be limited."
good,Corporate finance accounting job functions are typical with quarterly overtime work put in but very good work/life balance during non-busy periods. Management hierarchy and styles could be better overall in the company. Competitive starting salaries and great benefits.
good,The company is pretty good with a hard working work culture. If the Financial services industry is what you want then it is a great place to be.
good,There is much opportunity to learn about the company as well as the life insurance industry. Extreme emphasis is placed on learning and cross training opportunities.
good,Its a nice place to work. Room for advancement. And you can work all the overtime you like. Would recommend this position to another. They also made sure we were well trained
good,"Typical day: meet with your manager over the phone and go over your activities, obstacles and successes. Set 12-14 appt for the next week. Run all your appts for the day, follow up on cases that are pending and meet prospective clients on a daily basis."
good,"100% commission work can be challenging, its important that your immediate family is onboard with your new line of work. Commission work can be a stressor."
good,"The first three years are very hard, as you have to create your clientele.  Insurance and Financial planning are very rewarding but you have to work very hard and be reliance and willing to accept rejection. Persistency is the key of success"
good,Had a positive experience but determined that a job with 100% commissions based salary was difficult to maintain. Overall I needed something with a base salary.
good,"Working for New York Life allowed me to sink my feet in when looking into the financial world. Although there is no base salary, New York provides a great commission package as long as you're able to work long and hard"
good,"New York Life's dedication to training equipped me to provide a high level of education in the community where I both lived and worked. As a result I was able to not just write policies but create substantial financial inheritances for my clients. Their culture of rewarding high producing agents enabled me to travel nationally to many of our nation's most prominent cities. The experience I derived in the field pushed me to develop the skills for branding, market development, professional networks, sales productions and concepts that I now share with aspiring entrepreneurs."
good,"Nice professional atmosphere, little reluctant to adopt new technologies.  Every 3 to 4 years, expect re-org and lay offs. Good bonus and insurance benefits"
good,"I enjoyed my time at New York Life."
good,"I was impressed with New York Life Insurance Company after networking with the General Partner and gaining an understanding of the New York Life Culture and their efforts to help people create, grow and protect their wealth."
good,"Overall, I am satisfied with this firm.  The company is stable and has consistently  good results.  One thing I particularly appreciate is that leadership is committed to the mission of being a mutual insurer and meeting our obligations to our policyholders is very central to the mission.   However, this is a very large and old company and there is a lot of inefficiencies"
good,"Though this job I've gained an extensive amount of knowledge about the retail annuity industry, it's products and programs. The management is attentive and provides employees the opportunity to grow, if they would like to."
good,I was a contractor so my experience with the company was limited to the project assignment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working within a supportive area that valued everyone's contribution..
good,Professional environment with flexible schedule. I always had senior staff members to advise me if I needed help. Team spirit even though their were many agents working for different supervisors. I really enjoyed talking with the clients and greeting them at the conference room.
good,"management was great at helping you jump start your career. everyone who works there is a part of a team, very little competition. great entry level career for most recent graduates looking for experience in finance or sales."
good,"I would recommend being a Financial Representative (Financial Professional) to someone who is highly motivated and can produce results.  That's the only way you can have job security with New York Life.  They have an excellent training program that works if you follow what is outlined, and they also have staff and management willing to help you succeed (but again, if you yourself are willing to help yourself succeed and willing to put in the effort)."
good,"Great training, personally had a great leader, but that isn't the case in every office. Without a great manager, you won't succeed. Need to be personally highly motivated (typically set your own work schedule), not afraid to meet and speak to new people, and persistent. A con when starting, is you do not get paid until you meet the requirement of producing $5,000 and six cases, which some it took two months, or never was obtained."
good,strictly commission so you have to work very hard at first to get clients but if you do it will all pay off in about 3 years. little supervision but they have a great team to help you if you have any problems.
good,The company is extremely conservative so it provides a very stable job if you intend to stay with a firm for 30+ years. It is a huge money making machine that is rigid when it comes to change.
good,NYL was a comfortable place to work. Nice people and work life& balance was excellent. Promotions were difficult to obtain in the department I was in.
good,"Great career for ambitious person in early or mid career. Top training in the industry."
good,"I've been with New York Life for 2 and 1/2 years now. I love the fact that they have a competitive wage, 401K, tuition reimbursement, that has helped me out greatly with paying off my student debt. The hours are good it works with my lifestyle .On the job , it may be a little bit repetitious but it's simple and the days are predictable and it is reliable. The bonus in March were very helpful tooh, I would definitely recommend New York Life is a place for employment."
good,This position is perfect for those that want to be in control of their own outcomes. It requires a lot of dedication and hard work but has high rewards
good,"This is a great opportunity for entrepreneurial go getters, with strong people skills that want to build a book of business for the long-term. The training is extensive, and the financial products and compensation scale can be confusing. This is a 24 hour lifestyle career. This is not a clock-in and clock-out type of job."
good,New York Life is a great company with a great portfolio of products and excellent training programs. I would definitely recommend the financial professionals to all my friends and family - which is where you generally start as an agent.
good,A basic day at NYL would to go to the office everyday and check your emails/mailbox. Make sure clients are happy and follow the steps for underwriting to complete whats needed.
good,"It's a good place to work; the people are supportive and always willing to help. There is no training provided, so you must be willing to adapt and learn things quickly.  It's a very typical corporate environment."
good,"NYL Corporate (not Agent): Good company if you are looking for strong work-life balance and decent pay. The people there are very smart, but not alphas. As a result, the culture is definitely not cutthroat or nearly as demanding at other financial firms like banks or hedge funds. As a result there is less upside compensation-wise."
good,"Great people work there, but the culture was going through major changes.   Too many captains trying to steer the ship.  Made it a real challenge to get things done."
good,This was my first real job while still in high school.  My boss was JR Hinds.  He was an amazing first boss and taught me so much.  He took a chance on hiring a high school teenager to help him do some office work and I believe it paid off for both of us.
good,The help I was provided with while working with New York Life I cannot imagine would be better anywhere else. The environment and the people kept me there probably longer than I should have been. I needed to move on to find a more stable position for myself
good,Tough to get started. It is possible - but inconsistent at best. Managers are helpful but ultimately it is up to each person whether you success or not.
good,"As a sales agent, you had the freedom to plan your own schedule outside of the required training sessions. Management was knowledgeable and readily available to assist throughout the process. Compensation is generous but insurance sales are heavily incentivized as that is the company's foundation. Lots of opportunity for those that are determined and willing to go above and beyond. This job is not for the faint of heart!"
good,As employee with NYL for over 13 years I enjoyed my time employed there. I worked with great people. The company is good to their employees and provide excellent benefits and pay. There is also a good work life balance.
good,It's a shame that New York Life took the hit it did when the economy went down. They had to close doors at a couple locations in Michigan. It was a great learning experience.
good,"Great teamwork, and Moral. High work volume during tax season. Intense training. Wonderful support team. Management over monitored the team. Great benefits."
good,"you work the hours you need to work to be successful.  There is weekly training twice a week, helping to improve on skills and knowledge and building on new skills."
good,Overall the company is a good company.  Individual managers are not.  Some did not  manage very well.  They would not protect their employees and would let them fail as an individual instead of a whole.
good,"A very good place to start a career in Financial Services, and receive some of the best product and sales training from a very large and successful company."
good,"A company that cares about its agents. "
good,A very good management team and agents were supportive. The training sessions and workshops for agents help to always be aware of the dynamics in the insurance industry.
good,"In-house training by professionals is unparalleled.  Agents are supported with full-time practicing estate planners, attorneys and other experts in their field."
good,"Great training and great people. Position is commission-only, but is a good job if you can stick with it. Management takes a great interest in success of agents."
good,"Very well compensated for work, but you have to prospect for new clients pretty much every minute of your life if you want to succeed in the business of life insurance sales."
good,You work for your money. 100% commission. A base salary should be included. You have to have a special personality to be in the life insurance business. Might be good for a college student but not as a full time career
good,"The company primarily focuses on life products only as they believe in keeping their S & P rating high and their profitability high."
good,Good company with great leadership. Flexible schedule and free range in terms of who you can do business with. Learn how to sale concepts and the value in financial and insurance planning. Relax work culture and must be self motivated. Hardest part of the job is making sure to constantly be active in order to generate new leads.
good,"A brief morning meeting, where we discuss activity from the previous day and what is planned for the day going forward. We receive updated company information and also ways to improve sales. The atmosphere is structured and professional. The hardest part of my job is finding reliable leads to produce sales and the best part of the job is the flexibility in my schedule and potentially higher pay."
good,An agent is a pure sales job. Great if you are strongly self motivated and have a large network to draw from. Less so if you are less motivated or have a smaller pool of people to sell to.
good,"As an intern you get to experience what a typical day is like at New York Life. This is because the managers put you in the shoes of a regular employee. For this reason you will learn valuable skills such as client base development, sales, and security analysis."
good,"This job is very stressful, but highly rewarding.  If you can make it through it is worth the journey.  There's unlimited potential, but turnover is high as income is entirely based on production."
good,"Always about quantity over quality."
good,"I loved working there! Overworked, paid great, underappreciated for hard work and mandatory overtime. Managers were a little sneaky but it was a good place overall."
good,"Great opportunity, Great training.  One of the largest if not the largest life insurance company in the business the opportunities are open to do business any where in the country."
good,the Insurance industry is a professional group from various past walks of life.it allows anyone the opportunity to advance in their career. all said it is not for everyone.
good,During my tenure at New York Life the training is unparalleled. The office environment was one of professionalism. In order to progress one must have the ability to constantly get new names if not the training is all for not. The commission-only structure does place pressure on one to have a fast start but that fast start can lead to a quick demise later on.
good,"If you have what it takes... then, yes! "
good,"Hello"
good,"Request information from other teams, answer question from others. Meet dead lines, and remind other team to meet ours.  Have team meetings, check status."
good,"Corporate Audit Department maintains a balance between functionality and quality of life, audits are risk based and the annual risk assessment is aligned to the Company objectives and current economic environment . Typical day start with the review of the daily agenda and scheduled meetings with audit clients and team members. Depending on the engagement, these meetings will include walkthroughs with the clients, brainstorm and field work sessions. We review the work of the staff as soon as it is completed and the staff is coached to document tests and walkthroughs as they are finished.  After the scheduled functions for the day are completed the timesheets detailing the hours worked in each engagement are prepared by the staff, review and approved by the In charge.  The most  enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to expand your knowledge about diversified businesses and industries where the company operates.  The hardest part of the job I think is to deal with multiple engagements  when resources and time are limited."
good,A great place to grow and learn many different skills within the insurance field for Life and Annuities. Provide classes to learn and obtain your 214 Insurance license.
good,You must have a large network in order to produce the results required to have a meaningful career.  A lot of time spent cold calling if you do not have a large network to start with in the beginning.
good,New York Life was a great place to start your career in financial services.  They have an excellent training program and provide support to new advisors.  flexible schedule. Commission only.
good,"The people are very open about knowledge sharing and getting work done in a collaborative manner. "
good,Overall a good company to work with. Work life balance is good. Corporate culture is good. But there have been some changes in organizational structure.
good,"Excellent place to work except for the out sourcing of many jobs."
good,Great place to work. Great Benefits. Great people to work with and grow with. I love working with customers and  putting smile on their face during the most difficult time. I enjoy making sure their families are financially secure.
good,"Working a New York Life was a great experience for me, since I never worked in that particular type of environment previously. I enjoyed my time spent with the organization."
good,"This is a self, sales driven job. You have to be willing to put your name and face out there to find people to work for you. Commission based pay is psychologically stressful."
good,Company treats employees fairly. Employees get to work with state of the art technology and there are many opportunities to learn new technologies on the job
good,"work life balance is good, compensation is good,  management is moving the company in a new direction and seems to be making nearly every wrong decision, employee morale is at a 170 year low"
good,"training is valuable "
good,There is little bad I can of NYLIC. The training and products are second to none.  The job itself teaches you alot about you.  It requires decipline and very good time management.   Coworkers are all encouraging and the development managers are great.
good,"New York Life is a great company to work for. They treat their employees with respect and dignity. New York Life is a mutual company, which makes a big difference in setting strategic priorities for the business."
good,"Reliable, conservative company that is good to work for.  Developed lots of relationships with sales, product, and management teams."
good,Great place to work if you are motivated and have lots of connections. There is no safety net if you do not have sales. It has great opportunites and you are selling some of the best products that are out there right now
good,"A typical day of work at New York Life could vary from day to day.  Depending on the clients you speak with.  From as simple as taking premium payments, or taking loans on a policy.  To dealing with irate clients who want to cancel their polices for a variety of reasons."
good,Management at NYL really helped me grow as a person. They really helped me expand my knowledge in AML. Taught me the ropes of the corporate world.
good,"GOOD"
good,New York Life provides a good opportunity to develop a financial services career.  Management is supportive and the training program is excellent.  Fluctuating income based on commissions is only negative.
good,"I graduated from a claims paying position with another insurer and was now working for the home office of a large insurance company in the business for over 100 years. "
good,Lots of strategic meetings to align to new strategy roadmaps
good,Great training foundation. I was fortunate to have a grate manager and mentor. The skills and knowledge were easily transferred into my next role and enabled a smooth transition.
good,"I enjoyed what I did and working with the public and agents,  It was over 25 years ago."
good,"Great training program, keeps you highly motivated. Able to earn securities licenses, but beware. Must buy in and be willing to take the risk management aspect of a financial advisor and sell plenty of life insurance."
good,Great place to work and advance your career if you have the market and or connections to solidify good business!
good,"Great Company, great brand, established company.  The management in the SF/SJ area is a bit transactional and serves a large portion immigrant sales force, so sometimes, it can be sophomoric.  But, they are motivated, you just have to overlook the lack of professionalism at this General Office.  The SJ and SF offices recently split, so not sure what that has done to the culture.  The NY Life corporate culture in these GO's is definitely not the typical."
good,"Overall it is a good company. However, it is hard to advance or move between groups. The organization is very much the old school vertical structure, the upside down pyramid where there are more managers doing the talks than staff doing the work. Although they tried to so-called flattening the organization, it pretty much failed in a lot of the departments or business units, which only created more confusion and no improvement. Management is demanding, which sends mixed messages to employees, it's good that it pushes the a lot of talented good people to do quality work and own it, but at the same time, work/life balance is lost, opinions/feedback are ignored. There are a lot of good people in the company, but it's sad that the company doesn't retain a lot of them as before due to lack of opportunities for moving around the company and advancing. Although they promote diversity, only certain (personality and else) types can advance in reality. "
good,"My co-workers are great. We feed off of each other and learn different creative ideas on how to approach clients. We show ways of marketing ourselves then get creative with different methods that we can implement when sitting face to face with them. I learned such valuable information on life and finances such as IRA's, 401K's, rollovers, life insurance, and health insurance. The hardest part about my job is finding clients. If some clients say no one of them will say yes. That is what keeps me going and gets me through my day. I never give up but at the same time I will not be that annoying sales person, my clients and I have a good comfortable connection with one another and it is important that my clients will always feel comfortable talking to me about anything."
good,"sort mail learned responsibility "
good,"good management team"
good,Overall NYL is a great company. I enjoy meeting new people and customizing plans per the needs of the client. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the charge backs or loss of commissions. I have learned to be more resilient and adjust to the at hand circumstances.
good,"New York Life offers several benefits and training to it's employees. New York Life offers several great product to help people achieve their savings, lifestyle and retirement goals."
good,Call and set first meetings or closing meetings with clients or future clients.  Meet with them about the different types of products New York Life offered and which one best benefitted  the client and clients family.
good,"As an intern, I was able to learn first hand how the business world works.  My manager gave me a task that was meant to take the duration of the internship to complete, I completed it in the first quarter of my internship.  My task was to analyze data on the the company's email platform.  The hardest part was learning the platform itself, but was able to learn it quickly so that it then became the easiest part of my job.  "
good,I had to visit clients with my mentor. Calling on policy holders and prospective clients was my daily responsibility. Management was very professional and my co-workers were hardworking sales people.
good,"A typical day at work would be input simple & complex applications and process changes to current policies, perform accountant tasks, maintain a good relationship with the clients, staff & agents. I enjoy working with my co-workers, always learning from a variety of people and I'm always open to new ideas. The most difficult aspect is learning how things are done at this particular company, but I'm a quick learner and will have no time learning my job quickly."
good,"I enjoyed many of the personnel that work with NY Life and the company is a very ethical leaning organization. The reason I terminated my employment was that it was a commission only position and though you are considered as a contracted agent, you are required to travel to and attend all training sessions. Mondays were a full day of training. Friday was a half day and then various instruction during the week. There is no compensation for mandated trainings, which consume almost half of a 40-hour workweek. Expectation was to put 60 plus hours a week without compensation other than a free working lunch or dinner occasionally."
good,"I worked at New York Life as an intern selling life insurance. With this position i basically had a head start into financial service. The hardest part is just when your getting started. You have to have a good book of business and since you just started, there's no one to call to sell, so alot of cold calling is involved. But if you work hard as time goes on that book of business will grow. The most enjoyable part is the continuous training recieved from managment. They really would like to see ther agents succeed, so they have meetings every moring."
good,Always trying to help others protect their families in the long run...
good,Worked with the recruiter making phone calls and setting up appointments for perspective clients who were looking to become sales agents. Also worked doing some IT troubleshooting and using Microsoft office especially excel. Management was very friendly and helpful and the co-workers were easy to get along with. I learned a great deal about being more personable and communicating with people over the phone and in person. The hardest part was getting use to all the phone calls that needed to be made but the most enjoyable was the environment. Could not ask for more.
good,The hardest part of the job is not having always the tools or resources readily available to assist the client or agent
good,"New York Life is a company that celebrates diversity, recognizes talent and makes every effort to reward employees whenever possible. It is a very comfortable place to work. You are able to work in a corporate environment as well as with different levels of management. My co-workers are great. The most rewarding aspect is being able to locate a beneficiary to process a claim that they had no idea about."
good,"Thouroughly enjoy working at New York Life. Pays well, have had wonderful managers. They are one of the few companies that still provide a pension in addition to a 401k. Benefits start as of day one."
good,"Drive your own business"
good,"I’m a consultant for NewYork life insurance, so I worked for them as a C2C, work culture is really good and work location and working hours are flexible."
good,"Extremely stable company to work for. They have been around for 174 years and that works to their advantage. In the tortoise versus the hare, the tortoise often wins."
good,"Networking events are your bread and butter for this industry as you must create new contacts at all times, constantly marketing yourself and introducing yourself and your services to potential prospects."
good,typical work day was a lot of calling and setting appointments to meet with new and existing client. hardest part of the job was getting clients to set a meeting. work place culture was very diverse and friendly. they provided lots of training's and way to over come objectives.
good,"Had a great experience working for the company, but in the end it wasn't the place for me."
good,"The level of professionalism and training is unmatched. The company culture is amazing, the dedication to doing the right thing for clients and helping you develop your career is there. It's important to know however, that you do need to have a market of people that know and trust you and will either do business with you or recommend you to someone who will. Coming into this business with no local natural market is not imposible, but you need to know the importance of building a market the second you come into this business, and even then it will be an uphill battle. But for those who enjoy networking, community events and can sustain themselves as their building their book of business, this will be a highly rewarding career."
good,A typical day at work was meetings in the morning and project work for the rest of the day.  Only long hours were due to complex system issues whic took place after hours.  Learned many skills while working here.  Training was available so one should definitely take advantage of it.
good,"Finding new customers, not in your warm market. Training is second to none. The partners at New York Life are helpful and do what they can to help you build my business."
good,Everyday was different. You never knew what to expect. I learned that teamwork is very important in the financial industry and knowledge of the content is a plus. The culture is very family oriented and everyone is looking to help you out.
good,"Excellent opportunities in the Chinese Market in Flushing NY.  I have been fortunate to obtain excellent training at the Flushing, NJ office and have many professional colleagues."
good,"If you have the ability to talk with people this is a great opportunity. Great earning potential commission based pay, but if you put in the work it's worth it."
good,"My Internship as a financial representative was a great learning experience. I was taking 5 classes at the time and so my manager said I can come in and sit in on meetings whenever I was free. It worked with my schedule very well and I learned a lot of budgeting, retirement, and using a insurance as a financial vehicle. They tried to get me to and go full time but I knew financial sales was not what I wanted to do."
good,"Three days a week there are trainings for the first 3 years and the rest need to get on the phone or go door knocking looking for a client"
good,"1. Typical day - Team Meetings - 10%,  Development Task - 60%; 3. Other tasks - 30%"
good,This is not your typical 9 to 5 job. You must be all in! You're the employer and employee. I learned about the power of positive thinking and taking action.
good,It's a sales culture so it's not for everyone. The people you work with genuinely want to see you succeed. Help is always offered to those who ask. Being 100% commission there's a feast and famine roller-coaster that can be stressful but that evens out after a couple years. Hard work is highly rewarded and allows for plenty of upward movement. The company almost exclusively hires internally.
good,"Gotta be ready to build a client base, BEFORE any money rolls in ... Great training. Professional culture. Just gotta be ready for the first 12-18 months of building. Probably no life outside of work.. too much the first year."
good,Worked with a good group of people who did not micro manage. I was in the office a lot alone which is good but could get lonely and creepy at times.  Great location.
good,Commision based position. Difficult to secure potential clients to do business with. Have to do your own canvassing and generating names to work with as clients.
good,"Very good company to work for if you can learn to manage your time and keep mentally focused."
good,"Good training "
good,New York Life was great but there were some employees who have been in their roles for entirely too long. I left because I was harassed by an employee and when I addressed it nothing was done.
good,"Productive Work Place , it takes a long time to build a substantial book of Business. "
good,"New York life was an awesome place to work in terms of resources, training, and overall team morale. I would recommend it for anyone who is self-motivated, lives locally to the office, and is ready to dedicate themselves to building their business."
good,"Every day is different. "
good,"When it was good, it was good. "
good,"It was a rotating 3 days a week shift. One month night shift and one month day shift. However, it was a pleasure work environment. Manger, supervisor and co-workers were friendly and co-operative."
good,"I don't see why I have to do a multi page review of NYL when I am just trying to update my resume.  It is ridiculous that I have to put filler in because I think it is inappropriate to require this."
good,It was a very interesting culture.   Management changed recently and created a lot of anxiety among the agents....the money-makers of the company. Not sure how it will be going forward
good,"NYL is a solid company to work for if you're a strongly self motivated individual, willing to learn products in a classroom setting as well as working the system during your own hours.  Not for someone that needs a regular 9-5 type structure. Must be able to understand how and to be motivated in order to fill your own hours with the purpose of gaining clients and improving product knowledge.  Life Insurance and Retirement planning is not an easy ""quick buck"", however with time and effort the payoff can be substantial."
good,"I found working there to be valuable. I was only there as an intern for a summer, but the nature of the work and training that they offer is extensive and certainly helps you grow as an individual and a professional, regardless of whether or not you decide to stay in the financial sales industry."
good,Excellent work environment & career advancement.  Job training was good.  Best part of the job was Flexible hours. &   Great benefits. Hardest part of the job was somewhat stressful.
good,"The knowledge I gained while working at New York Life was invaluable and will be an asset I will use throughout my career. Although it did not work out for me, if you have a good book of business to get a jump start, the potential could be endless."
good,"The work life balance is great here, I did not exactly enjoy the pay scale set up. There is no initial money to start at the company, you have to earn"
good,A fun place to work and progress. The work is technologically advance ans the employees are motivated. It is easy to pitch in ideas and start projects. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
good,"Excellent Training, Excellent follow-up with training accountability, As a new agent NYL would benefit from starting new agent with a salary to keep their head above water or at the very least a draw. This is an excellent company work for and plenty of training to succeed."
good,"This is a solid company with a solid reputation.  However, the job was not a good fit for me or the company.  I received some excellent training and worked hard to obtain my license in health, life, and annuities.  The company provides good benefits and pay for those who want to sell life insurance policies and make a lot of money.  I retired from the federal government and felt the time was not right to begin a job in this field."
good,"Gave me my first IT position, forever grateful. Started as a entry level programmer. Moved through the ranks quickly. Management could use some work though."
good,"NY Life is a prestigious company with opportunity to build a lucrative insurance and financial services business.  Extreme persistence and dedication is required daily.  A series 6 and 63 certification is highly recommended to achieve greater success.  Consistent compensation is hard to achieve for at least 3 to 4 years.  A training allowance is offered for a minimum monthly sales level.  An existing network of potential clients is essential to achieving minimum levels of success.  Persistent phone calling, sales meetings, social networking, event planning and community involvement is essential to achieve minimum sales standards. Great emphasis is placed on social networking.  Management is excellent. Several group meetings and training sessions are required weekly for the first 3 years."
good,"Coming from the Technology side, work was fast pace with constant triage and resolution of day to day issues. As well as long-term planning. "
good,"Day to day duties would vary. You are responsible for yourself, commission only. Prospect on your own to find new clientele which included cold calling and b2b."
good,The culture is good. The flexibility in schedule is a great positive for great work and life balance.  The people are super nice and they are supportive.
good,"overall a great work place for the right person. make your own hours, other than the 2 days you need to be in the office. management is there for you when you need it most. most difficult part is building your book of business. MUST have something on the side if you're just starting out. Everything takes a lot of time to get done."
good,A fortune 100 company that understands the value of the people it employees.  NYL understands that in a highly competitive financial service industry they must invest in their people and provide continual training and provide all the resources necessary to be successful.
good,"I enjoyed my work at New York Life.  Managers come and go, so it is truly what YOU make it.  The harder you work, the more money you make. One should study and obtain the credentials to be able to do more things."
good,"Great Company, benefits and vacation are awesome, but their is no consistency across departments on processes, work at home arrangements, etc. Some managers have historical atitude- no work at home, come in at 7 and stay till 7, etc."
good,"Pay can be great but it is a difficult business to break into. There is a a lot of training and the industry is constantly changing as the government regulations seem to be evolving daily."
good,Typical day would be data entry of life insurance applications.  It was not rushed and most of the staff was very helpful.  I also had to cover switchboard.
good,"The good news is that they will keep you in training for a long time to make sure you succeed. The bad news is that they keep in you in training a long time. Many months of mandatory meetings, required checkins,  forms to fill out, quotas are stiff, and the payoff is not awesome. You could make a great living if you have no filter or fears of approaching strangers. Cold calling is not a big part of it, but approaching strangers, or worse, your friends and family that's a big part of it."
good,"A typical day at New York Life would be getting to the office and checking your calendar.  Send out any emails, check your social media and then make 10 calls at minimum per day.  Then head out to any appointments scheduled with your clients or managing partner."
good,I learned how to prospect and network with good centers of influence because the job was %100 commission and all leads were self generated.
good,"As a life insurance agent, I am responsible for administering my own practice. I acquire clients through cold phone calls, event marketing, and social media prospecting. I maintain a large excel database of prospects and create my own marketing materials. After converting prospects to clients, I guide private client data through a complex and lengthy underwriting process, lasting weeks. Finally, I follow up with clients every six months to service their policies. Organization is the cornerstone of my practice."
good,The training is rigid and very motivational. They require you to do prospecting with clients and they are focus on FYC for the first part of the year.
good,"Great management and sales training! Leader in the financial industry!"
good,Working here has really opened up doors and helped me become the great sales person I am today. Plus you get to manage your own hours and work times.
good,"The Jersey City office is a really good and productive workplace with friendly co-workers and open seating."
good,High pace environment that was different each day. I enjoyed the people I worked with while there. The hardest part of the job was really short deadlines and changes mid job. I still made all my deadlines.
good,"First Rate."
good,I was a really fun internship. M mentor was really helping and went out of her way to help me succeed. So overall it was a great experience for me.
good,"New York Life is a great place to work. However, due to being compensated purely on commission, it is crucial that you know a lot of wealthy people or people that understand the importance of saving. Otherwise, you will have a very tough time getting any clients without much prior experience in solicitation."
good,"New York Life Insurance Company was a good company to work for, and the hardest part was leaving. I was able to advance my career during my  years at the company, and I a made a lot of wonderful friends/co workers."
good,"Great company with friendly and assertive members."
good,I enjoyed my time working for New York Life. There was a team first environment and many opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,"Besides working with wonderful people, the best thing about my job would be the scope of responsibilities for my team which allowed me to get great experience on so many platforms and applications, as well as the opportunity to troubleshoot some challenging issues which required a healthy dose of critical thinking and, at times, creative thinking to resolve.  Overall, my experiences here have elevated my knowledge and expertise across many different technologies."
good,there is strong company culture of working for the best company out there. its always easy to start an appointment talking about NYL
good,"Nice office. Made you feel as if you was working in heaven. After 10 years i grew alot because I was able to learn from their corperate structure. But like all fortune 100 corperations, there was only a limit to my growth. So i took an early retirement and  resigned."
good,"You need to keep in mind although they do have the best retention rate in the industry, the odds are still not very good for new agents or advisors I do not recommend this job for everyone, but the sales, marketing, and customer service training is the highest I have ever experienced."
good,My typical day entailed answering phone calls and checking email plus processing new account and death claims.  I have learned to handle difficult callers and how to provide excellent customer service.
good,Very Demanding industry for those just starting. Must be able to handle a commission based salary.
good,NYL is a corporate institution with great benefits and great work/life balance.
good,I've learned a lot from the fastidious agent I worked for. I cant complain. the work place was well managed and the manager knew how to manage schedule for the agent and work load for everyone.
good,Number 1 Mutual Life Insurance Company with the highest financial strength credit rating.  Great supportive atmosphere.  Great opportunities to earn trips. Trained by the best.  They genuinely care about their clients. The hardest part of the job is prospecting to qualified candidates.
good,NYL is a highly rated life insurance with a conservative business culture.  The Tampa division of NYL is a company that encourages personal growth and development. There are many al la carte trainings and learning oportunties for growth within the company as well. Good pay for entry level positions. Any customer service positions are not with its drawbacks but NYL does have flexible schedules and understanding managers for some personal situations.
good,"Was fortunate to start my career at NYL, in the Waltham office (MA.) Learned a lot of information and strategies, was able to comfortably ask anyone in the office for help or assistance, great team atmosphere, very experienced management team."
good,"I am a former employee of 9 years with NYL in Westwood, MA.  For the first few years I thought the company was great, then the layoffs (they like to call them position eliminations) started.  People started to work more with less.  The benefits stink.  Current management stinks & the technology is for the birds."
good,"Helpful,learn new thing in differend department nice people to work with"
good,"New York Life is a very strong company.  I started straight out of college with little sales experience.  With no salary to trainees, this is a very tough start for inexperienced sales persons.  However, with strong company ratings and tremendous products, New York Life Insurance is a great place for experienced professionals."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the statisfaction from the customers and my boss.
good,This company provides many incentives to keep you motivated.
good,I would call to meet with client's and address their financial needs and come up with a custom plan to fir their budget
good,"When I was employed at New York Life it was a very good company to be an employee with. Co-workers became like family in the way everyone worked as a team on the job as well as volunteers and charity work. It provided a stable work environment and rewarded you for hard work. I started in the warehouse and worked my way to being a shift supervisor in Print Mail and Distribution Services for over 20 years. I had a great respect for my team as they did for me and they always knew what was to be prioritized. The hardest part of my job was being the key balance between upper management and the workers getting timely answers to satisfy both, whether it was job related or personnel. The most enjoyable part of the job was cross training all of my team in multiple aspects of their jobs including equipment operation, trouble shooting, quality control, time management, and a host of other knowledge that I acquired in my years of employment. Challenge in general is what made my job fun and exciting. In my 28 years of employment I was never denied a salary increase or bonus. I loved my job."
good,"Great company to work for in the IT field. My experience with them was as a contract position that was eventually going to end, but my brief time with the company was a extremely positive one."
good,"Typical day included several outside appointments in clients homes making a sales presentation for life insurance, annuities, long term care or investment products, or possibly a client review of existing policies.  I learned a great deal about the possible uses of life insurance products and their application to the average person. I enjoyed staff meetings and sales competitions with my associates. The hardest part of this job is continually finding fresh faces to introduce the products to. There is a system in place for this, however failing to utilize the referral system effectively is terminal. The most enjoyable part of this job was the satisfaction from helping people accomplish their financial goals."
good,Company does not supply leads so you need to do lots of prospecting. Management is very ethical. They train well. New hires get training pay as long as they produce.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, I would still be there had I not had to move. The environment was great and diverse, compensation was fine but bonus' and promotions were on hold while I was there. I was in a standard administrative position while going above and beyond to learn more, teach agents, and be a positive representative for  the organization."
good,Had the best manager. Hardest part of the job was finding your own clients.
good,Great training and feedback from management. The other Administrative Assistants were top notch and very helpful. New York Life was a fun and exciting place to work. The people there are what made it.
good,I have always enjoyed working at NYL. The only sad part was leaving because there weren't any entry level positions in IT at the time.
good,"Need more set hours. Salary needed to provide for family. Learn to manage my own work, profected prospecting for clients, increase closing skills to make deals with clients and prospective clients. Gained a lot of leadership experience. Worked long hours, even weekends. Hit or miss sometimes with sales."
good,"This help desk is the 1st that I have worked at, but I do like the fact that they have Right Answers to help with getting to know their system."
good,"I'd get into work at 730a, go to my office and prepare my day. I learned about Life Insurance and Long Term Care proucts among a variety of financial products such as 401k plans, IRAs, etc."
good,"Good Management Team, very supportive. They offered good training. This kind of position is not for everyone."
good,"Agent base calendar. Appointment setting, Cold Calling. Follow Up, Training and Prospecting."
good,Assist agents when dealing with clients and their financial information.
good,"They provide great support but you must bring in at least 200+ contact, usually friends and family, in order to succeed."
good,"-Make cold calls"
good,"Training isn't extensive, but the people you work with are very fun.  No day is ever the same, which is nice if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes."
good,"New York Life was a great company to work for.  I wish I was still working there but it just was a specific contract position. Data Entry, scanning and opening mail with friendly people."
good,"You really get paid for your hustle."
good,"I learned a lot working with NY Life, as that was the start of my life insurance profession.  Good Leadership and guidance. I would like again to be a part of the NY life team"
good,"Training is extensive but very informative, the company does not micro manage you which is a plus. Overall New York Life is a great company to work for."
good,Sometimes very hectic work . Love the environment. promotion process is not clear.  Work from home is not allowed in some departments. Bonus is good. Salary is within Market range
good,Stay organized and always act professional. Always be diligent about making calls and setting appointments. They are your livelihood. Strive to keep a positive mindset.
good,"The most enjoyable part the job is being able to assist clients on a daily basis, the support we get from our leadership department and the most valuable skill I learned working for this company is; teamwork."
good,New york life was a great place to work you do get different post your not just standing on the same post the staff was great to me was here for five years had to leave when they lost security contract.
good,"It was was a nice place to work until new Management came in."
good,New York Life Insurance’s Service Organization provide best in class service by making every customer experience a positive one. It is the hallmark of what we do and how we keep good going.
good,"Great company to work for. Very mission driven, with the clients needs at the focal point. I enjoyed my time there immensely.  I  worked with a great, well trained sales team."
good,"5 years of experience in Information Technology with strong background in OBIEE, ODI, Oracle Applications, and Data Warehousing Complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including System Requirements Collection, Architecture, Design, Coding, Development, Testing, Production Support, Maintenance and Enhancement in variety of technological platforms with special emphasis Client/Server, Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence applications in Windows and Unix environments."
good,"- A lot of education"
good,I enjoyed my time working at New York Life. Management are all very helpful during transiting time. Very diverse cultures. Always learning new things with the online and onsite training.
good,"working with only commission is difficult. you need to be dedicated to stick to a strict schedule to obtain clients. The management generally wants you to succeed. this job is a long term game, you will get discouraged, but you need to just think of the end result."
good,"Commission only good work place very good office staff home office staff"
good,"Great training, good management team, job opportunity with a lot of growth available from income opportunity, to professional development NYL is a Fortune 50 company with a formula that works. "

good,"New York Life has the best training and resources of any other Insurance company.  It is very important to obtain a securities license as well.  If you are a people person and persuasive enough to bring in new clients every month then you may do well there.  Job security can be your number one concern, because when you run out of close prospects you always need to find more clients to keep a steady stream of income.  The job is very competitive because of the number of agents and insurance is ""sold"" not ""bought""."

good,"If you are great at sales, have a high amount of contacts and amount of energy, you can succeed, Commission based so you can get the amazing training they provide (not really paid to you unless you get your quotas), no base Salary so you GOT TO get out and SELL. Commissions and bonuses are good, but again YOU HAVE TO SELL to get money to live. If the sale you worked so hard to get is reversed, they charge you back from that and you have to pay it back to the Company. I loved the management and training provided, nice work environment, but the lack of base salary plus reversals got me stressed out every day, had family I had to support and it was very very stressing waking up and checking your ledger to see if you got paid and if your clients did not forget to pay so you can get a check."

Some meetings require me to send our power point presentations through our video conference and others require me just to display it locally in our room only. I learned how control and understand crestron and polycom systems better. The hardest part of the job is teaching technically inclined people how to use the conference room equipment.

good,"Management is very supportive and tries there best for each agent to become successful. At the end of the day, they can't make you go out and prospect to guarantee the name flow needed to be successful. You have to be a self-motivator and resilient. The majority of your job is out and about doing events and walking in businesses. You're a financial planner at heart but the first few years is going to be all sales and trying to get the clients, nothing is given.

Managment of the company is a strength; most are highly experienced and well rounded leaders. Co-workers are dedicated and flexible. The hardest part of the job can be the pace. At times the organization is reactionary. The most enjoyable part of the job comes from knowing that customers' lives are improved from the work I do."
good,Great people and environment! Very friendly and welcoming atmosphere.
good,Used extensive contact base to solicit group health business For NYLCARE from small to medium sized business market in conjunction with an independent agent specializing in annuities and life insurance products.

good,"Lots of training is provided regarding the sales process and the products. However, it is solely your responsibility to find your leads and create your market. This is an industry standard for this type of position. So if you are able to take the short term hit financially to start out in this job, New York Life is probably the best firm you'll find for it."
good,"If you are into Sales, this is the job for you.  There is no annual salary so how much you make (or don't make) in compensation is totally based on YOUR performance.  Management is great.  Training is great.  They give you all the tools and help you need to succeed."
good,"It is great part -time job if you have to take care kid .great team work,but the salary is not enough to pay off daily life .it was so stressful when you work there"
good,Working for NYL was fun.  I rarely had any issues with hours that worked or the people that I worked with.  It was sometimes very cold in the Data Center but that was to be expected.
good,"Good place to learn how to conduct people to people business"
good,"After 6 months was moved into another role when others retired from the Underwriting Team, but no salary raise. The position was available for direct hire, but the company did not hire."
good,"You run your own business which is great, because the company supports you all the way. The issue is in the thing that you cannot control. Compensation is too client dependent, and your work life is your personal life and vise versa. There is great opportunity and potential with New York Life, but unfortunately its not for everyone."
good,New York Life is very flexible when it comes to work life balance. Upon working to New York Life i was given the opportunity to choose a work schedule that worked best for me. I also like the flexibility to work from different New York Life locations. I started my career working in the White Plains office but i also spent alot of time in the New York office.
good,You would have to work mandatory overtime. At the beginning of the month they would tell you how many hours they needed each week. You would schedule your mandatory overtime hours that fit their needs. I learned a lot about life insurance. My manager was awesome. The hardest part is dealing with older upset people. I enjoyed the employees that worked there.

good,"An interesting, enlightening internship at a New York Life Insurance branch."
good,"Agents are able to set their own schedule "
good,I was young when I started at NYL and wasnt able to focus as much as I probably would now. With the lack of a base salary I needed to leave after a few years and take something with a salary and commission to stabilize my situation at the time. The management and help from NYL is second to none. Great company.
good,"NYL offers excellent training and support.  The management team really cares about helping see agents excel at their practice.  The culture is positive and professional.  "

good,"Meeting people is your job. Co workers are all awesome. Commission only is difficult to survive on, but overall this is a pretty great career if you have the determination to do it."
good,"Great company, with a proven training system. The offices in Denver were great environments to work. However, I couldn't make it work on 100% commission."
good,"Typical 9-5 job. Good people, fun atmosphere. Learned a lot. Low pay, but very entry level and basic skills required to have success in the role. I would recommend as a stepping stone job."
good,"As an insurance agent with New York Life, or any insurance company, be prepared to be a self starter and get used to an environment full of highs and lows.  Sales is a personality driven career."
good,New York Life has a focus on development and growth through Team enhancement.  there was a synergy developed between all staff and management that created a well defined goal of success.
good,"NY life has very good training for their agents and a training allowance for agents in their first three years on sales made. However, some sort of weekly stipend should be paid out to new agents and commission payouts should be higher after training allowance ends.  My first three years have been challenging, but I have always received encouragement from management. A typical day involves branding, and building new and existing relationships with prospective clients and a goal of making two appointments a day.  Much flexibility with this type of work, but sometimes it's enough to set yourself up for failure."
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. Friendly and supportive people and many employee resource groups to join to become a well rounded and responsible individual."
good,"Very relaxed coworkers and managers. The hardest part of the job was having to bring on new business (sales position). Management was very awesome and the training is top tier. However, the company kind of leaves you on your own to figure out how you will develop and maintain your clients which for someone inexperienced with that sort of business is sink or swim. Starting out they want you to bring on friends and family then your immediate network, without providing you with any help aside from marketing materials to send them. If you have or had a similar role it is an excellent company to work for. If you have not, it is not necessarily the best. Perhaps there is a reason why the company has such a high turnover rate and the insurance industry as a whole."
good,Great team working to provide for our clients needs by reviewing their personal and financial goals to meet their objectives and dreams.  Great training and tools for employees.
good,"Great work life balance and culture, combined with a good pay and benefits.  Opportunity for growth and many levels, however it is not handed to you on a silver platter, you have to find them (the way it should be).  Technology is improving however still behind the times."
good,"Takes lots of hard work to make commissions, but great place to work and advance your career!  Much opportunity for awards, bonuses and trips at New York Life.  Takes awhile to build a book of business.  Lots of patience required!"
good,"It is a very driven environment that requires you to be self-motivated and disciplined. The development managers are always available; thus, support is always of the highest caliber and availability."
good,N Y Life Insurance company is an inspirational organization to every employee. Had learnt many valuable things form my leads and mentors and given many opportunity to arose as a potential candidate in the organization.
good,Many options of employment from sales to management and training.  Teams of men and women to encourage your growth and prosperity.  Good mentorship in place.
good,"New York Life is a great company with great people.  They are very culturally diverse and provide excellent training and development for those that are willing and capable to thrive in a commission based environment.  From being in the industry and working with others from other companies New York Life provides a great opportunity for those that are performers.   On the other hand,, those that are under performers will not succeed or be profitable."
good,"Management area fair, sometimes it could be very challenging and some time so relaxed.benefits are great culture are great only cons is pay is average"
good,It was good working there. All managers were  great to work with. I will miss this job. Unfortunately due to out sourcing I lost this job. Very sad for a person of my extensive experience to be out of work.
good,The one thing I loved about New York Life was the end goal was to make the agent and client  their number one priority. There is great continuing educational opportunities available for the staff.
good,Its a great place through and through - the employees care about the company and we are continuously improving.  There are a lot of enjoyable employee activities that will help people stay connected.
good,"Although the days consisted of being inside an office, there was much to do. With files, sorting, data entry, correspondence retrieval, phone calls and more, monotony did not come into the picture. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management and the positive environment that was created. It was easy to work hard because I had people I wanted to work hard for."
good,"Multi cultural company, lots of compensation and bonuses. Hard working place but team work company. Friendly environment, professional training. Great assistance from management."
good,A dynamic business  that's demands the highest level of results in all aspects of her career. Fun environment and a great place to grow and learn. Highly recommended
good,Co-workers are very willing to help you with you work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn on a daily basis and improve your skills. They have many resources to help you better yourself.
good,"A very good place to work. Everyone is there to help you succeed. Every employee has a strong motivation for success, and this motivation is transmitted to everyone that works there."
good,"work life balance is really good. Good compensation and benefits. "
good,"A typical day of work is responding to agent inquires and assisting them with understanding processing by phone or email.  I work independently, but I collaborate with team members for insight and different perspectives on processing.  "
good,"Great work life balance. Very good training. Great corporate ethics.  Flexible hours."
good,great place to work at!  coworkers and management are very supportive.  They offer a lot of ways to help you be productive
good,The compensations program is outstanding and the freedom you have with this kind of work is beyond a blessing.
good,The owner was very patience and a good teacher. I learned a lot.
good,"The culture and possibilities working here are awesome, unfortunately I was fresh out of college and wanted a paycheck instead of a commission check.  I believe it would be a solid job for me now a days."
good,"Excellent place to work, people are nice, but things move a lot slower than other public companies."
good,"For the vast majority of agents, attaining a decent salary and reaching the level of business they expect will prove to be impossible. There's an 85% turnover rate within the first year and a 95% turnover by year three which is not unusual for the insurance industry. Where New York Life excels is its ongoing training and high grade of professionalism. The management at the company is excellent and in general the company is very well run. The products and name recognition are also first rate. But although It's commission structure is high, it comes with the increased risks of being 100% commission. The vast majority of new agents will find capitalizing on the available opportunities difficult, and unlike other agencies, New York life does not provide leads, so expect to market to friends and family for the first six months. I wouldn't recommend this job to recent college grads, but those who've been in the industry may thrive. This environment breeds top sellers and elite workers retain high levels of autonomy in their business practices and career track."
good,"Great company to be a part of. Best training!"
good,"My job is entry-level and I learn a lot about recruiting, sourcing and recruiter's use in social media. I recruit for multiple hiring managers and source resumes according to their current hiring needs. What I enjoy the most is the environment, which is encouraging and friendly. It creates a positive and productive atmosphere."
good,This was fast pacing job with a lot of changes every 6  to 12 month new laws and updating applications and ways to input informations.  The hardest part about this job was inputting application and working the front desks with heavy phone volume and great customer services.  Received Employee of the month 11/2009.
good,This has been one of the best jobs I've had. The pace of advancement is outstanding and the community of works is second to none.
good,This was my first internship at an insurance firm. I had a great time working here. Its a very corporate environment. Learned a lot.
good,You receive the greatest training in the industry. The resources to help you succeed are phenomenal. It is a place that fosters an environment to create ideas and resolve business problems.
good,"A large and well respected company. Significant workforce reductions, but extensive annuity growth cause significant increase in work responsibilities. Strong team environment, simple user friendly workflow database, & cross training yielded significant output."
good,Great company to work for!  Everyone was friendly and genuinely wants you to succeed within the company . The pay is far also great job stability and security!
good,Since being here in fl. I’ve worked at several dead end call centers. NYL is hands down the best place I’ve ever worked at. I would recommend a cs position to career minded individual.
good,"They encourage you to spend a lot of money (events, commercial, lead purchase) to invest in your business. For my age I had difficulty being taken seriously by prospects. Also, when people cancelled or changed their payment plan, I ended up getting a reversal where I owed NYL a portion of my wages back. If you're great in sales you can make good money. If you don't develop by the time your contract year starts, you will scrape by."
good,"I love the management and other agents at New York Life. I very much enjoyed working for them and feel like the Partners do everything they can do for their new agents. Unfortunately, straight commission was not ideal for my personal financial needs."
good,"Tough industry to get into. Selling life insurance is not the easiest thing to sell, especially if you don't have a good referral market. Unlimited growth potential and incredible company culture."
good,Very good company. Training was excellent. The culture there was solid and very conservative. I really enjoyed my time there. Very nice people and excellent management
good,"Great place to work, management, coworker are fun and productive environment.  Great benefits and work-life, opportunity to advance to the next level. Great fitness center"
good,"If you are ready to hustle and be a shameless self-promoter New York Life is the place! Literally unlimited financial growth, but make sure you have an income coming in from a spouse or being supported by your family, Becuase it is going to take quite some time to start making real money."
good,My roles was busy and a meeting planner. Lots of logistics and travel. I learned all aspects of meeting planning. Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to all the beautiful destinations. New York Life is very much a family. You work hard and have some play time and rewards.
good,"It is a great place to work if you can be on your own and work in full commission only."
good,"My typical day will be checking for any updates for the day work load and if any changes have taken place."
good,"Left because I had to relocate. Great people and management who care. Advancement opportunities are there, but they were slower to promote than average. Never had to bring work home. Made great friends there and enjoyed the culture. I would definitely recommend working here."
good,"I honestly love this career, it's just not for everyone. Extremely challenging for beginners with no prior experience. Excellent training program but very difficult in the beginning."
good,You must hit a goal first time out or you won't get paid at all. Out of office work. You'll be in office about 2 hours a week. You'll have to work hard but you'll get out of it what you put in. Work really hard your first two years and you'll love this job.
good,"While at New York Life I received my first real taste of the entrepreneurial experience, which included time management, networking, business planning and learning how to communicate with potential clients."
good,Wonderful place to work. Love the ability to take on multiple tasks. co workers make the day go by. good work culture but not so good work and life balance.
good,NYL was a great family. Great things to do focused on the community and also the life of the employee.  Very customer centric as products demand.. Had a lot of fun activities and incentives.
good,"Worked on straight commission, time was very valuable, so  made sure I used it to my advantage.. I was fortunate to have excellent resources at my disposal."
good,"Generate purchase orders on a daily basis.  Order Telecom (iPhones, iPads) for the entire company.  Assist the Finance Team with invoices that need to be processed for payment.  Assist outside vendors with invoice payment status.  Handle Procurement Card transactions and reconciliation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers.  The company is very work and personal life balanced.  I have learned taken on a lot of job responsibilities and learned a lot over the years.  The management that I have worked with was great."
good,This job has a lot of opportunities for people who just have a High School Diploma and are looking at furthering their career and getting help to start a career. If you currently have graduated from college I do not recommend starting here. You are treated just like the people who don't have degrees and have to work just as hard to do something you actually spent four years studying to do. Overall good work place but not a good place to start for recent college grads.
good,"Amazing job if you are a people person and can get someone to invest in themselves and you for the next 30-80 years of their life. Amazing management, great work areas. To much autonomy though."
good,Working at New York Life insurance company was an good learning working experience.  Working with other team members with resolving issues.  Learned on the job skills example (managing window servers and active directory).  My team(co-workers) and I worked closely with each other.  Assisted each other if we had trouble resolving an issue.
good,"processed mail for all agents and staff. Enter applications for insurance that would come in.Assisted with phones when needed. Processed deposits, and took to the bank. Helped agents, and customers with questions. Did inventory on supplies on a weekly basis. This company was constantly cross training in every position, which is what made it challenging and fun.  All co-workers were very enjoyable"
good,Working with NYL has helped me to be creative in the way I market their products.
good,"-A typical day at work would be checking our systems for any important updates, follow up on existing cases, make phone calls to prospects, prospect for potential clients, and be on time for scheduled appointments. The management is very helpful and willing to help us with any concerns that we may have will talking to prospects. The hardest part of this career is the reality that some days are roller coasters, for example you will go the extra mile to try to close a case but at the end of the day you have nothing to show for it."
good,"A typical day would be getting on the computer and checking the data base within the company to see which employees were having technical issues. I learned how to be more punctual, and more detail oriented. As far as management they did a great job in keeping me well trained and well educated about the overall culture and duties of the I.T. Department. The hardest part was everyday facing a new technical issue and troubleshooting that issue successfully. The most enjoyable part was the environment. Everyone was very helpful and team oriented when it came to solving issues."
good,• Achieving assigned sales targets of Life insurance products
good,"On the job training. Managment was very understanding, and supportive. The management made you want to work hard and to the best of your ability. Supervisors were not as helpful and very hard to work with. Co-workers embraced me and offered a lot of knowledge and experience. Hardest part of the job was learning to prioritize and the most enjoyable part was the office environment. Very professional and fast pasced but also a comfortable place to be."
good,"This is a great company to work for and the management and training programs are amazing. But in short, you must be willing to work hard for at least 40 hours a week if you want to make it. The income is worth it, the freedom is worth it, but you won't get anything out of it unless your serious about applying yourself."
good,This is not an easy career. If you live at home with parents and have minimal expenses its worth a shot. You need to be prepared to work a lot of hours to achieve the results they highlight.
good,"New York Life is a great place to start a career, I enjoy working here and the group of people that I work with. I really enjoy helping new agents in their learning curve and helping them learn the industry"
good,"Every general office is different.  My experience was great, management listened and was supportive of employees.  Benefits were great and there were multiple employee recognition opportunities available that employees could participate receive."
good,Great place to work along with  advancement olortunuty.. Very helpful and  knowledgeable staff the income is the best part of the job.  Agents are paid very well.
good,Overall great company to work for. Must be a go getter that has a drive to achieve goals. Loved the work and would go back in a heart beat if I knew I would have the drive and client base to create a steady income for myself and my family.
good,"At New York life- AARP, the csr is treated well. the pay is good and the job is relatively easy.  Promotability is easy for those qualified and desirous of a different role."
good,"NYL is a superb, solid company. They manage their finances well and have been in the black since opening. Learning about their history is a good read and will help understand the culture they encourage. I would highly recommend working at New York Life Insurance."
good,"Great training, fantastic company/products, and the opportunity to carve out your own path in business. The company will help you succeed if motivated."
good,"Typical day at New York Life was, reviewing providers schedule and retrieving medical charts from medical chart room and placing charts in providers office. Scheduling same day and future appts and calling to confirm next day appts. Answering calls and taking messages for the providers. Assisting the providers in faxing, typing and copying documents."
good,"Good pay and people but not much room for advancement and work is monotonous. Have to keep typing for this review because my answer was too short, hope this is enough characters."
good,"Typical day required meeting deadlines, assistant internal and external clients and balancing payments incoming and out going."
good,All of the staff at New York Life are kind and passionate about what the company can offer to the public. Being around for over 170+ years gives the company a good stronghold in being stable and able to provide many benefits year after year.
good,New York Life was a great business to train in.  The managers were intelligent and educational.  New concepts were taught daily and reinforced through example and experience.   The opportunities offered by this company are great.
good,"You make your own schedule, however, what you put into this career you will get out. Must be willing to put in the work, at least 10-15 appointments each week.  Management will do their best to help you (buy stamps for mailings, pair you with senior agents).  Most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday, ability to make uncapped income, and mentorships with senior agents.  Hardest part of the job is staying busy, which means make those 10-15 appointments per week.  You do a great deal of cold calling, so you have to be able to take a lot of no's."
good,"While not the largest of the benefits administration firm, this is a great, small company to work for backed up by one the largest insurance firms in the world."
good,"It's a commission only gig. If you can handle yourself and be responsible there is a lot of money to be made. But be warned they have you start off by selling to family and friends."
good,I have nothing else to say about this company only that its a great company to work with. so if you want to be a part a team this company is the right place to be.
good,"- Everyone is nice and helpful to the new hire."
good,"Came in each morning briefed and ready to canvass an area to talk to potential clients.  It was great getting to help people with their lives, and to see how our products gave them such peace of mind"
good,"This place was great to work at, the only reason I left was because the job wasn't something for me.  Benefits are great and the building itself is amazing.  They really try to accommodate you and they even have a gym and daycare for your use."
good,"love people I work with.  The hardest part is my commute to work."
good,"I was very fortunate to get this job right out of college.  Each day was different in adding variety to my job.  I learned to do several jobs in the department which allowed me to widen my horizons.  I was a clerk that input insurance applications into the system.  I also, was receptionist at front desk for clients, personnel, and agents.  I was also secretary for the General Manager in which I would take shorthand and type letters, credentialing agents, planning their airfare trips to business meetings."
good,I had an awesome experience! Great culture and they do a lot for their employees! You can also learn alot in the health insurance business for your personal gain. I would definitely recommend:)
good,A typical day was answering phones beginning to end. Management and training were phenomenal. Teammates were like family. Culture was fun and inclusive.
good,"Flexible hours"
good,"You can work 24 hours a day with this company to make goals and try to earn a living but unless you have a huge family to make money off of or are inheriting a book of business, it's not likely you are going to succeed. There is no support as promised. At the best you are told to take another ""agent"" on your appointments & they get 1/2 of what little commission you make."
good,"Big boys club. You will get paid for the work you do. Don't expect any other reward. Upper management can through their insular position, undermine any dedicated worker. Freebies and agents are given to those managers that qualify for the golf buddy list. Favoritism abounds."
good,"I was expected to work for three months, money free to learn the New York Life process. THey were not able to convert my license from IPA to NYL and I was not able to sell for two of the three months where I made no money, I could not afford to stay"
good,"Straight commission right out of the gate, without any training does not lend for a successful career. Going in already knowledgeable and experienced in sales would make for a very successful job."
good,This position was only commission and do to the economy sales was low due to unemployment.  I was solely on my own which made me not be productive as I could have.
good,"It is a 170+ year company for a reason.  It is a fortune 50 company for a reason.   I was not a good fit, and that is a joint failing of both my manager and me."
good,I enjoyed my time at New York Life. I met very influential people who opened up my mind towards a better future. I learned that selling insurance policies was not the wisest life choice for me as an individual. The workplace was highly business oriented. The hardest part of the job was convincing potential customers to purchase insurance. The most enjoyable part of the job was working within this very reputable company. I was given the opportunity to work & was taught various methods of the salesapproach.
good,"Make no mistake, the opportunities are amazing. However, you must identify as a salesperson first and foremost. Secondly, you must understand and be willing to run a business. The overhead can be crippling if you are not careful. I survived 5 years but the inconsistencies in income has taken its toll. My finances have strained relationships with friends, family, coworkers etc. It is time for me to move on."
good,"Very hard to penetrate in Atlanta.  Start off selling term,  then convert your term subscribers to whole life in second year."
good,Must be driven by income. It is a very stressful environment if you do not have experience and or do not have enough people to contact. It is a referral based job and it would be difficult without referrals.
good,"12 hour day, people try to hurt the good people doing the right thing by staff. They have great training programs and development, you just have to have a good sponsor to get you in."
good,"New York Life is an excellent career choice, however, the experience can only be complemented with supportive management. Overall, the workplace culture is great."
good,Stable company. The most enjoyable part of the job is definately the relationships that are built. Dealing with various personalities daily was something I learned.
good,"Once in a while only go to office, most of he time on field targeting clients. Freindly Management and co workers. Getting new clients is the hardest part after introducing most of your relatives and friends.We used to arrange Booths wherever there is an event nearby. The most enjoyable part is you could always meet new people. Since I was new in US I did not get the right opportunity in my professional field, that is the reason I opted Insurance Sales."
good,"New York Life is an exceptional company. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the people there, it was a very positive atmosphere. I learned a lot about sales and insurance."
good,"No typical day at work. "
good,This is not the culture I was accustome to.  There are a lot of promises that were broken and trust that has not been establisted
good,"working environment unstable ."
good,"Suggest you build a proper network a year before joining, develop relationships in networking groups meet as many new people and build as many new relationships as you can a year before. Start reconnecting to new people and old associates as well as old friends. Have a huge pool of people to prospect from going into the job first."
good,"I loved the company, the job, my team and all the management I learned a lot and I feel that I have a lot to bring to the table.  I intend to further my career in this industry and looking for the right fit."
good,A typical day at work is to meet my quota from my work allocation. I learned about many shortcuts while typing to improve my quality and basic training of how to type the applications correctly. My co workers were patient and direct about the work. The hardest part of the job is not to let it get repeatitive. The most enjoyable part of the job just something I really like doing.
good,"Challenging job, but with potential.  Hard work, many hours.  You do have to make cold calls.  They tell you you don't, but after talking with friends and family, you will have to make cold calls to make money."
good,"Engaged individuals, business owners, and families to assess needs and present appropriate life insurance products. Utilized the FNA process to develop customized packaged for clients that best suited their needs. Partnered with clients to set up tax deferred retirement income accounts."
good,I would not recommend this position or company unless you have a lump sum of money you can use  while you grow your business. This job can take many hous of your day with no pay.
good,"Typical day included prospecting new clients, time in training on new products, meeting with new prospects, conducting financial analysis, and developing plan for clients.  Hardest part of job is dealing with rejection.  I learned everything I could about insurance and investments and how to use them in a financial plan from which the client could benefit.  I enjoyed all of the clients I met and was able to help."
good,"New York is on of the best Insurance Companies to work for. Its highly competitive, it is a sales, commission job.  Their training is second to none, youget to work your own hours,showever you are always on, meaning you are alwasy closing a sale.If you love helping people and really doing your life passion, this is the job. However it takes a while for you to get a jump on it. You have to get yourself in lots of organisations, function always meeting people."
good,"As an agent, you have the flexibility to manage your own schedule, except on Mondays, which is when you are required to attend a mandatory training. Your earning potential in the company is unlimited, but you are paid on a commission basis."
good,The training is amazing and the staff is more than willing to assist you with your business. We were able to work with whomever we want and when we want.
good,"Phone calls, business drop ins, daily client meetings. Friendly competitive co workers. Best training in the industry. Must be self motivated and driven to succeed."
good,The training and resources I was given access to were very advantageous. The culture in the office was one of encouragement and people that genuinely wanted to see you be successful
good,"Great & strong company, they truly mean well by their Agents and clients genuinely, commissions can be tough, need to have great discipline, but can be incredibly rewarding at times, must be a people person with a great attitude and mindset. Must be willing to sacrifice work/ life balance for sales, recommend having some savings coming into commission only career, have a disciplined savings method as well for in between cases, this same discipline will help clients understand the importance and value of their own financial discipline as well, not a 9-5, hours can vary greatly if willing to put in the time, being out in front of people is the key to success"
good,"felt very comfort to work in the company "
good,"This company prides itself on training. The training comes down to a bunch of seminars that you have to use your own vehicle and own fuel to attend. The throw large amounts of information at you with no regard to well you are learning the information. If you are lucky you will have a manager that cares about you and the success of his team. I was not so fortunate. My manager was shady and did whatever he had to do to make sure he got his bonus (legal or illegal). He was conniving, manipulative, deceitful, and uncaring. That list could go on and on! If you don't already have money then this isn't the company for you. If you do not already of a list of clients that will do business with you then be ready to GRIND. The ones that make it in this company seem to be handed a book of business. THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP!"
good,I had an amazing experience working with my manager. He was very helpful and supportive. The job allows you to make as much money as you want however you have to dedicate lots of time and be very well organized.
good,"Overall great place to work for. Competitive, salary is great. I had a great experience working there. If i didnt relocate i would still be working there."
good,This was a great company to work for.  People are very friendly to each other and help each other out with their work. Work questions are answered by knowledgeable co-workers.
good,Great place to work. loved the culture and the fact that they are always motivated to be the best versions of themselves at all time. Competitive while also at the same time helpful team environment.
good,Company invests in its employees. You will learn how to become successful as a financial services professional. The job is results oriented and the structure is a meritocracy.
good,Its a decent job but it is a call center so its stressful.  The management is good and they have a decent work environment but the customers you will be dealing with make it not worth the pay.
good,"The on going training program is amongst the best which leaves you well informed. However, it is important to get it on your own as there is little involvement from management. It is also a high energy and stressful work environment."
good,Very good working culture. The company offered continuous training and provided opportunities across departments. Management encouraged the staff's continuous growth.
good,NYL is a great place to work to acquire new skills while working in a fast paced environment.  This job will prepare anyone to wear multiple hats.  I recommend a job with NYL.
good,"At New York Life I was able to learn new sales techniques and skills"
good,Enjoy working at NYL.  Nice people. Good working environment. Work life balance  commute is long from where I live.  Opportunities to move with in departments.  Career oriented.
good,Simply put...you have to be willing to go places and outwit and outperform your peers. The life of an insurance agent is tougher than other jobs. Productivity breeds results!
good,"Unlimited potential for go getter type workers. Must get your own clients when first starting out, but New York Life provides you with unlimited support to get your clients."
good,It is a great opportunity to grow. Staff support is amazing. The training program is great. A wealth of knowledge on how to succeed in the industry. Diverse group of people.
good,"Very Competitive, Educational, Great and Friendly work environment. Have lots of great and unique products for clients. I would recommend this company as a great place to work at."
good,"Meeting people and winning their trust is the hardest part of the job.  Once that is done, designing the solutions to their problems and then getting them to purchase products to fix the problems comes next.  Then keeping them on track for all the changes life can present."
good,"Fun and open work environment with great people. Typically, I worked in recruiting to there was not too much change in my day to day activities. However, it was not overly demanding and was good experience."
good,"I worked in the tech center temporarily as an assistant; in my experience, I helped work on a few devices, troubleshoot and refill printers, as well as assisted agents with their printing needs."
good,Great people and work culture.  Lots to learn from the best in the industry.  The hardest part of the job is to be able to manage your time in an efficient manner.
good,The environment is a fast paced environment that requires you to put in the time to make phone calls as well as managing your own practice. The hardest part about the job is the straight commission based pay structure.
good,"The priority is client service."
good,"It was good place for sale's call. Also, it is good for those want to have part time job. But, this work is not guranted a steady income because it is insurance contract sale by phone."
good,"You will have a great experience at New York Life.  Great structure, resources available, and management team.  There is a great sense of open door policy where you can walk in and talk to other leaders that may not be on your team, and get feed back."
good,"Typical work day at NYL involved developing & maintaining Client Analysis Tool website, making sure the NYL Agents' website queries were attendekd to."
good,"It was my first big job as a salesman.  I earned the ""Million Dollar Round Table"" award in the first three months of sales.  It was very satisfying to set up a life insurance plan for families that I talked with."
good,"New York Life Insurance Co is a great company to work for.  The company has been going strong for over 170 years and values it clients, agents and employees.  Continued education is always encouraged.  There are many opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate."
good,Worked in the call center answering approximately 100 calls daily.  Learned something new everyday either from my co-workers or my bosses which I really loved.  The management were very knowledgeable and also helpful with any of the representatives needs.  I always enjoyed turning challenges into desirable outcomes for my customers.
good,"I mainly worked from an office out of my home, because the closest office is over thirty miles away and could not travel that everyday.  I enjoyed working for this company."
good,"Fun place to work, Good team work among colleagues, Very good management and good child care facility for the use of parents"
good,Great place to work but horrible people. I enjoyed working there. The agents are respectable hard-working people but management is all about the bottom dollar and not the people
good,"great benefits, good brand recognition, talented partners that lead you through the selling process."

After working temporary for 2 wks., the Office Mgr. asked if I would consider coming to work full time. After giving it some thought, I decided to join the company. I learned a great deal working in various positions. The company recognized my willingness to learn and to grow. So, I was given the opportunity to work for Partners in the Recruiting and Development department. While I was with NYL, I received three promotions.

You are stuck with only being able to offer their products and their Re-insurance might as well just be Crump. Not a bad culture.

Altogether I enjoy that fact that people are open to feedback and new methods of improving workplace practices."

good,"A day at work is a time when an employee performs a duty of the work for which he/she is employed. It involves interaction with coworkers, supervisors, and management. This time stretch for eight hours, five days in a typical work day, but may extend beyond eight hours when important aspects of the work need to be finished within a specified time-frame, or week-end. While performing a duty of the job, interacting with coworkers, supervisors, and management, an employee learns new things on the job, organizational culture, and job procedures. An employee needs to be aware that management monitor his/her performance and measuring it against standard. This will give the management an idea of whether or not an employee relates well with other employees and is a good team player. Co-workers are other employees with whom an employee interacts to ensure proper and up-to-date performance of the job. As a new employee, co-workers are key to performance and designed procedures. Many organizations conduct formal training to all its new employees before putting the new employee on the job. A new employee deals with remembering all the elements in the training. The challenging part is figuring out whether or not you meet the standard and beyond, which is the goal a new employee wants to reach. A new employee needs to focus and exert as much effort as he/she possibly can. By doing so, the employee learns the job quick. When the job is at his/her finger-tips, it becomes very enjoyable because there is little worry about errors and omissions."

It is difficult to start a career as an insurance agent without significant backup funds.  But it was an amazing learning experience that I have gained a great deal of knowledge from."

good,"New York Life is a great company to work with. The Financial Services Professional position was challenging and fun. A typical day would involve checking emails and voice-mails in the morning. Reviewing outstanding underwriting requirements on client case and making phone calls when necessary to keep the process flowing. That was quickly followed by reviewing pending open cases, reviewing and putting client presentations together. The day would finalize with several hours of outbound phone calls several times a week or driving out to meet prospects and clients."
good,New York Life Insurance is a nice company to work and builf a career with.
good,"New York Life was a great stepping stone for me. I learned so much from the people. If you are very goal oriented, this would be a great environment for you. Its filled with people from all cultures and walks of life who are very positive and motivating."
good,"NYL is a great company, very nice atmosphere, some of the agents that I met were very nice and helpful.  I don't believe that I could have been successful in that particular system."
good,"It was a comfortable place to work and a high paying job with many opportunities as well as good people to help you along the way. However, it was too comfortable for my personality and career desires."
good,The office staff as well as agents at the Nebraska General Office is great. Everyone is very helpful and there is a sense of family as soon as you walk in the door.

good,This company is a great company. Willing to work with you. I’ve accomplished a lot here.compensation is well. Great benefits. Weekends and holidays off.
good,I recommend any one to work for them is is a good company. Targets are higher if you have time to convince people to buy insurance it is a great job.  and you must be very influential.
good,Great company but you need to be a self motivator and have good pipeline before entering into this job. Typical day is trying to generate business with your own contacts. You do learn a lot the the product and industry of this business. Hardest part of this job is getting people to do business with you and meeting the companies deadlines.
good,"New York Life is what you make it. If you are willing to work you will do well, if you are not you will not make it. I’ve made council two years in a row and I’ve worked to make it every year it’s not easy but it is rewarding"

good,"if you can observe your actions day to day and take action towards your goals, you can achieve high income. I was recognized as an executive council agent and it was extremely challenging. I left to pursue my passion in fitness!!!"
good,"Great place to work. Flexible schedule. If you put your customers first, you will be very successful. Its a bit hard since people are not interested in life insurance out of no where, something usually triggers that interest.  Also some people get rated and cancel policies, which most of the time its out of your control."
good,"Decent rotational program for their summer interns. Could have more specific tasks or projects that interns can help with. Loved the team, flexible working hours"
good,"Recutive benefits. "
good,"Very flexible hours. not a ton of advancement opportunities, and it is very demanding. "
good,It's a great company. If you are a driven and organized person who is okay with the hustle then this is an awesome career. There is room for growth in your career whether that's management or other disciplines.
good,"This is a great place to advance professionally. The opportunities to excel in pay is available; however, clients not paying their premiums and being decline can really hurt your paycheck."
good,"Manning the fire panel, report the deficiency, monitor the cameras. I learn how to be a better leader, a trainer. The culture in there with managements was in order. Highly secure as far as access control."
good,"NY Life is a great place to work for if you have the mindset of a go-getter. It is not an easy place as it is commission based exclusively. It is very hectic once you gather a pool of clients. Overall, very rewarding! I helped one of the top agents."
good,"The management team are very knowledgeable and willing to aid you in your success. Although, I work remotely, due to my job description; however, the environment seems to be a positive one."
good,"It was a great place to work, the co-workers are great and we have become friends, The management was great as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I went to Job Fairs and when I prepared events for the agents."
good,work in payroll department. handle paychecks back then was paper checks ran through processor then distribute them out. very busy when it was close to pay day.
good,"Everyone is there to help you go on appointments, answer questions and share best practices with you day or night.                                                                        That's really all I can think to say!"
good,"New York Life provides the best training you can ask for in the Insurance industry.  They ensure your success by giving you "
good,I have really appreciated the opportunities I have had to expand my knowledge and experience from the cross department mobility. I also have been supported by my managers as I pursued furthering my education and aiming to acheive my goals in the workplace.

good,"I love the culture of the company. The office staff is professional and courteous. High turnover among agents. I enjoy the challenges of the work. This is a good fit if you love to follow rules, like working independently, are a people person, and are not discouraged by changes in the regulatory environment. The best part of the job is the variety of people you meet and serve on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is overcoming people's perceptions of what you actually do for a living. You must be a self-starter and good at time management."
good,Learn new technologies. Ability to advance careers within the organizations. Good culture and a lots of opportunities to climb the corporate ladder
good,"My internship with New York Life was extremely positive and provided me with very valuable experience. I learned about the insurance business well enough the I passed the New York State Life & Health Insurance Exam, for which I received a stipend of $540 and which qualifies me to be licensed to sell insurance. I was also assigned to enter data about clients on different databases, thus expanding my knowledge on data entry and how to store information on clients to make it easier to interact with them. Through sitting in on meetings and classes, I observed and participated in drills which improved my public speaking skills and ability to interact with potential clients in both a group setting as well as one-on-one. Perhaps the most difficult part of the job was passing the exam, as it was a lot of information to take in and study in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and management. The full-time agents who worked in the office welcomed me with open arms, helping me out with anything that I had difficulty with and inviting me to join them for lunch. The management was superb as well, as they were always around to answer any questions that I had and took a genuine interest in making sure that my time interning there was positive and would provided me with valuable knowledge and experience moving forward."
good,"NYL is a great company. There is a lot of potential there and a lot of room for success. This is company where you will be able to have your own ""business"" and grow it everyday."
good,"•	7:30-7:55 Trained a client"
good,"While your daily routine is dictated by yourself, as it is straight commission, management is readily available to help construct a sales plan. Compensation was excellent, and though work commanded more than 40 hrs per week usually it was a rewarding experience."
good,"NYL is more expensive than most life insurance companies"
good,The co-workers and atmosphere are a great part about New York Life.  Most days are easy  with no stress and comfortable with flex time.  Highly recommend the company. I couldn't ask for a better set of managers.
good,"Great company to work for, high quality staff and happy people. The client comes first and this is present in all we did. The compensation is good and you will work for it. Plenty of incentives."
good,"8:30-5:00"
good,Our family has been working for New York Life for over 30 years.  We were able to be trained here and taught Customer Service skills and other office duties.
good,"I work with New York Life as an insurance agent. To the best of my knowledge, New York Life is a strong mutual life insurance company  I do not also have any prove to any negativities in their management or any aspect of their administrative  operations. Overall, I strongly believe it is a great place to work."
good,NYL has an incredible sales training program and many perks. They do their best to not let you fail.  The hardest part of the job is learning to discipline yourself. The most enjoyable is having an open schedule.
good,Sold life and health insurance.  Learned different sales techniques. Met with potential clients  to secure their financial future.
good,The people I worked with were very friendly and willing to help.
good,"This was a good company to work with, just had some problems with an agent in the office. The most enjoyable part of this position was being able to work face to face with clients and help them with their financial needs."
good,"typing, checking emails, appointment setter, data entry, mail processor, and customer assistance."
good,You need to be driven and cant back down from a challenge. Main draw back is a couple dry months can sink you.
good,"You need to be completely motivated and okay with a job that pays commission only. If you're okay with this, the management and trainers are fantastic."
good,"Very stressful yet rewarding if you work long, hard hours and sacrifice"
good,"Well, it's been a while since I was last employed there. I started"
good,NYL is a r Grrr eat place to work. You have the opportunity to have your own career  and be financially successful. The management team is very helpful and are there to help one succeed.
good,"Flexibilty and determining your own income are big pluses.  100% commission based on a sale makes for some great months and not so great months. I left because I desired more consistency with my family and our income. Great for a single individual to begin growing and once established, flexibility for family."
good,"I was an assistant to an independent NYL agent. He was an awesome boss. I loved my job, helping and assisting him. I had a lot of responsibility help grow and maintain his business/clients. I really enjoyed helping/assisting his clients."
good,I like New York Life Insurance Company because there are lots of training and flexibility in work. The future of the financial field is very promising.
good,"New York life is great company to work for. The people are very friendly,  the work load is doable. and management really tried to help with all that they can."
good,"A typical day would include agent training, client consultation case management and marketing activities. Activities are constantly rotating depending on the needs of clients."
good,"If you want to be your own business this company is for you. A lot of resource within the industry to help you on to success. Managing partners are always available to help you and thrive for your success. Great way to build your own retirement, learning and teaching others. If you are seeking on a new beginning of financial stability this is a good place to start."
good,"This is definitely a great company to be associated with. You are in control of your own productivity, so if you want to be successful, have a plan."
good,"I worked there for about a year before opening my own business. Mentorship and opportunity is outstanding. Diverse cultures and plenty of growth. "
good,"Competitive program with good training, but still commission based sales, if you don't sell you don't get paid. "
good,"Terrific company to work for but don't expect anything to be handed to you.  They have a wonderful training staff that educates you as best as they possibly can however everything is up to you and how hard you want to work.  No leads are provided for you so typically you will have to start with your warm market and eventually learn to live off of referrals as well as your ability to cultivate cold leads/relationships.  Their management staff is top notch but it's a pure commission sales position and that's probably the worst part of the job because you will have some months that are up and some that are down.  The whole goal is to make council twice in a row and that affords you the ability to become a ""partner"" (manager/glorified recruiter).  This is the only way that you'll acquire any type of steady income and even this will start to trickle down if you aren't recruiting enough agents onto your team.  All in all it's a great company with terrific products but it's a company that burns through 80% of the people they hire within two years of them going to work with New York Life.  The only thing I would change about my experience would have been going into management when I had the opportunity."
good,"I only have good words for NYL and all the people whom I worked with.  "
good,"It is a commission only position and can be up and down, but if you are successful, the upside is big.  No capped commissions.  The support and training are excellent.  New York Life is the best company in the industry."
good,"NY Life is a great place to work, the support system is excellent the management team is professional and helpful in all aspects. The training program is amazing and the products offered are Superior to most."
good,"Being an employee, you get great benefits like a pension and matched 401K. Over the course of 4 years, I received 4 pay raises and bonuses.  Lots of room for promotions on staff/admin side. Great place to work, relaxed. Management is annoying"
good,"You are more than fairly compensated for your efforts, but getting up and running can take a lot of time since you have to find your own clients.  The Charlotte office is a very supportive place to work."
good,it is a very good place to work. Good management team. A typical day at New York life is a friendly one. People help each other to a certain level. Management always available for employees.
good,"In NYL every day start on your own pace."
good,"New York Life gave me a great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the different variations of annuities and life insurance policies. The hardest part of the job is getting in front of someone and trying to pitch your product especially still being in college because a lot of the times they will overlook you because you don't have the age or the work experience for them to trust you. However, overall this was a great comapany to work for."
good,Good company and you will learn a lot. Top notch products but the hardest part may be prospecting depending on your natural market. It is hard to overcome the fear of not knowing everything with a company that offers so much. You must figure out early on to use your support system.
good,"I enjoy the team I am a part of and my boss is wonderful."
good,"As a NYLIFE agent, one is paid Only by commission. I believed this is a problem. It is a great company to for for but, the commission may be a problem with the charged backs."
good,It will take long hours and a lot of work to grow your business however you are well compensated by the company. Also there is plenty of room for advancements in the industry. Would have a strain on relationships because it is a lot of work and a lot of time prospecting.
good,"If you have the personality, drive, and don't mind the inconsistent income, you can do it. The schedule is amazing, the training is amazing, it's just not for everyone."
good,"Its pure commission, you eat what you kill, so really it depends on you what you make per month. If you follow through on your monthly plans and market the way you supposed to you will be fine. The biggest knock I have against the company is reversals. Say you sell a Life Insurance policy and you make $2,000 in commission. Well say that client decides to cancel their policy 6 months into the year. Well that's fine and dandy put you have to pay back New York life the money back that they paid because your client canceled. And when that happens unexpectedly it can really dent your pocket book. It can be avoided but that means you have to be hustling every single day."
good,Worked as a assistant for an individual NYLive sales person. I would produce sales presentations based on customer information provided by the sales person. I learned a great deal about the insurance and investment markets. I have great flexibility in that I could set my own schedule and work from home
good,Work life balance is great but you must still be doing things to prospect new clients. Your success begins and ends with you but you will have all the support you'll need.
good,"As a Registered Representative my focus was to ensure a balance portfolio for all my clients. Site visits was a key part of my days and nights based on client availability. "
good,Able to build your own team through recruiting was exciting.  Helped people to establish their businesses by becoming an agent with the company was an opportunity of a life time.
good,Professional place to be in  and good team work.Managers responded well to our requisites.Excellent Coordination with our line managers and beautiful location.
good,"If you are willing to put in the work to obtain your licenses, generate leads through sheer hard-work and determination, and continually learn & develop this workplace is ideally suited for you."
good,Excelente empresa para organizar el tiempo personal con base en proceso y sistemas ya probados de exito
good,It was pleasure working with New York LIfe Insurance Company.  I was very grateful  and happy with my management and the coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was the commute to Westchester Tarrytown.   I had very positive attitude toward the job or any project that was assigned to me.
good,"Answering phones, keying in all new applicants, created life insurance packages, laminated policy, enjoyed working for a great bunch of people, workplace culture was great."
good,"very  enjoyable, I enjoy helping people, answering  the  hard questions, training  young people, "
good,New York Life is an excellent company.  But the pay is commission only.  They have good training and good management. But if you are not a good cold caller or know lots of people that want to buy life insurance you will have a tough time.
good,"I don't remember much of this position. I was able to obtain my life insurance license. "
good,"A typical day at New York Life was productive but hectic. Phones were always ringing off the hook. However once I got familiar with how everything worked, it was a walk in the park. I learned to that is was very important to have life insurance and that the position of a life insurance agent is not easy but it's worth it when you are helping people. Management was great, a friendly, family environment. My co- workers were very helpful in anything that i needed and always willing to go the extra mile. My most enjoyable part of the job is when I would finish all of my work and assist some of the agents with back up work that they had."
good,"Deben pagar mejor,pero por lo menos hay trabajo estable todo el tiempo"
good,"Answering and resolving calls in the queue in a timely manner"
good,"A typical day at work would start out hectic and busy but wind down with a few jokes and laughter here and there to lighten the mood. I learned how important and meaningful team work is, how each individual members participation in daily job functions and duties are imperative to the companys ability to reach their goals and objectives. Unfortunately people in management positions do not always have their team or the companys best interest at heart and tend to abuse of the liberties and priviledges that being in a managerial position affords them. The team or fellow co workers make all the difference in how the work is approached and successfully processed, the team has each others back and that is paramount in accomplishing day to day responsibilities and goals."
good,"Start the day with training classes about products, thourough knowledge of product is very important. Prospecting or recruiting people and booking appointment from leads . Make a presentation, find out more about client financial situation. Filling the application, submitting to the home office and wait for application to be processed. Approved or rejected application, medical appointment with nurse for blood work. Delivery of application and illustration of policy. Learned a lot on potential customer."
good,The company is great and promotes great culture within the organization. There are many opportunities to grow within the company which is certainly a plus.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,It was a great company to work for.  My co-workers were a great group of individuals and New York Life offered its employee a benefit package that anyone will be happy with.  It was a great experience being a part of the company.
good,"very good, well managed company for business and client relationships. Employee training is very well done and on going."
good,New York Life is one of the best life insurance companies. They hold the highest ratings of any out there. You work on your own time.I feel that I helped a lot of families with placing policies from New York Life.
good,I like working for NYL life because of the work life balance and the freedom I have in my position.  My team is one of the best units in my department.  I am able to learn other aspects that's outside of my job description.
good,Great industry to work in. I personally need something more guaranteed at this stage in my life. Compensation didn't work for me being 100% commission.
good,"I really have enjoyed my time at New York Life so far. I've received great training in order to do my job well. Coming from a company that just threw you to the wolves, having the confidence to go it alone after weeks of training was a welcome change. Our management is very understanding when it comes to scheduling, i.e. coming in late/leaving early for doctors visits, traffic, etc, and won't hesitate to close the office in bad weather, which most companies don't. They really do value their employees and want them to succeed. We are also eligible for benefits on day one of employment, which I think is unheard of! "
good,"This was a very great company, enjoyed the people I worked with and everyone is willing to help as needed."
good,"Difficult career to start out, but if you can make it the rewards are endless. NYL has a great training program, you will learn an enormous amount about insurance, financial planning, and prospecting for new clients. Be ready to work long hours and w/ends as you will meet with clients and sometimes in order to do that you will meet on THEIR schedule, which may not be convenient to yours. The agents, management and support staff are awesome people, they really go out of their way to help you even though most often they get no compensation to do so. To help each other is the culture there, I have never experienced that helpfulness anywhere else in a sales oriented environment!"
good,"I am currently employed at NYLIM, Retirement Plan 401(k) and Pensions divison.  I am an ERISA Administrator.  My daily functions include handling of all legal and QDRO requests sent to the department for review and processing.  I have been employed here for almost 5 years.  I work with plan sponsors, management team, ERISA Consulting team and all internal RPS areas.  I enjoy my job.  I am seeking employment outside due to turmoil.  The company is undergoing management changes which leave employees like myself with no other alternative but to explore outside opportunity."
good,learned about the importance of life insurance.  Love working with clients and agents.
good,Company is very detailed oriented. Direct supervision is administered. High volume of work.
good,"I appreciate your time and attentiveness to my qualifications. I myself have been in the shoes of those who seek qualified talent because in some cases it can be rather difficult to find good talent. I hold my word to everything that I do and promote being the person I am. With this attitude I have been exposed to some of the most unique opportunities on could imagine all of which deals with people and accomplishing goals. "
good,"Great place, great management team. Its all designed to help you succeed."
good,"Did not work for the ""company"" but for two New York Life Agents.  I loved working there and only left for a better opportunity for advancement."
good,Great place to work...learned so much. The people there were always willing to assist in advancing one's knowledge for the tasks at hand.
good,"A typical day is as follows:"
good,"Prospected for clients for Financial products and services. Learned that I needed to have a regular paying job, some people are great at 100% commission position, but I am not."
good,Answering inbound calls throughout the day in a competitive environment. I learned how to multi-task. Most Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to breathe in between calls. The most enjoyable was the people.
good,The manager I have is making my life impossible to want to continue with the company.
good,"I liked NYL very much.  The management team were very knowledgeable.  I had a difficult time bringing in business and might not have been cut out for NYL.  100% commission is an all or nothing kind of business.  Not everyone survives."
good,The Company offers Extensive weekly training. The Compensation and benefits were also very atractive.
good,"A typical day at work involved meeting new people everyday whether visiting business owners, cold calling prospects, or presenting ideas at seminars and workshops. Part of the workday meant prospecting for new business. I learned how to manage a team of outside consultants which consisted of legal, accounting and banking professionals who helped determine the best course of action for a client's financial plan and meeting their goals. Management and co-workers were available for joint work, and supporting agents with new innovative ideas. The hardest part of the job was accepting 'No"" for an answer after you would pitch for a sale. This meant you had to keep prospecting until you got a ""Yes""! The most enjoyable part of the job was closing a sale, but more importantly, realizing that the client's needs for financial security would now be met."
good,"Best part of New York Life Insurance Co. is the management staff will train and push you to your potential. Put in the work and and you will have their support. The hardest part about being an agent is to not become discouraged and give up. Like they say ""you have to get enough no's before you can get a yes"". The Rye office was an awesome experience."
good,learned more about the various insurance policies. Everyone one at NY Life were very helpful and you felt fullfilled when you were able to help customers better understand their policies.
good,"Exellent Company, Great people, good technical suportsd, career opportunities"
good,"I really enjoyed working there, I learned a lot in terms of the products and different ways to sale. They have a great training program, teaching you about all the products they offer and ways to sell it to clients."
good,"If you are good at sales there is a lot of great potential. If you're not a salesperson, not so much. You are responsible for finding your own leads and figuring out a method to do so with very little guidance."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me making calls trying to set appointments with prospects. I may have had an appointment or two with some prospects so I would go see them. I learned so much from discovering a need, coming up with a solution, how to present the solution, and how to take care of that need for the prospects. That would turn them into clients. The workplace culture was great. Everyone was so friendly and willing to help one another. The hardest part of the job was setting the appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving problems for the prospects and clients."
good,"New York Life's sales program was a great place for an entrepreneur to learn all the necessary skills for building a business from scratch. I learned how to work with prospects through a systematic sales workflow and developed strong relationships with my clients. I learned the importance of creating an enjoyable customer experience, a first job I'd recommend to any strong willed entrepreneur."
good,"New York Life is a fast-paced company that can attribute its success to the team-based structure.  The intranet is easy to work with, and all agents are available to help to various degrees."
good,I went into this opportunity knowing I would get out of it what I put into it.  Whats important to me is getting help when I need it.  I always do.  They really push education and sometimes its difficult to figure out how to get that and marketing done but I think that's a good problem.  I love the flexibility as a single dad!  I love what I do.
good,"Basically as an insurance agent, you get out of it, what you put in. Great atmosphere, great manger during my time there. I only left because I changed states and my license expired."
good,Running various reports for management. Answering many calls regarding their plans and making  changes to various parts of their current plan or additions.
good,I enjoyed working with New York Life. I was a third party vendor and found them very professional and flexible when it came to changes in the industry. They understood their training needed updated and worked with us on changing it
good,"The job was entry level to the company. Compensation was solely based on sales during a set period of time. The educations and coaching at the company were some of the best that i had every received by an employee. They gave you all the tools needed to be successful with the products, it was on you to make lasting connections with prospective insureds. They did have options for purchasing leads, but i found it was just as beneficial to look at obituaries, recent birth, and good old fashion door knocking. The entry level at NYLC is focused on if you are passionate enough to succeed and have the drive and hunger to make it happen."
good,Great place to work and grow into a career if your self motivated and hard working. Management team needs more experience and guidance from Established Agents and Senior Managers. High income and growth potential for the right hard working driven person. I would rate them as a good place to train and work.
good,I cannot put a price on everything that I learned about all different types of insurances.  I had great success as an agent with New York Life because I just love working with people. The job help me to educate not only myself but the community about not procrastinating in preparing and leaving things in order for your loved ones . Planning for retirement and health issues is about most importance.
good,Excellent people and support.  Training and education is phenomenal.  Great management with good skills and knowledge for this industry.  There are opportunities for advancement.
good,"NYL was very focused on employees career path and had in place a self evaluation program which required the employee to evaluate their own performance.  Once complete, it was reviewed by the  manager and discussed with the employee.  This process encouraged improvements and allowed the employee to be a part of their own career path decisions."
good,"Every day is different. Most of the time we are looking for a new prospects, making calls, answering emails, or attending webinars at least twice a week."
good,"Great company but all commission based and building a book of business is no easy task.The management and staff are some of the greatest folks you could ask to work with, nothing but the best."
good,"While many large organization take prides of what they do, NYL is on the same boat, however, they show a great respect to FT and consultants where are large organizations abuse their consultants and usually put the blame on them. That does not happen in NYL. Respect, dignity and great knowledge sharing from seniors to juniors."
good,I enjoyed working with Bill Gasque at New York Life. The only reason I left was because my husband got sick and was hospitalized for 3 months and then need 24 hour care when he returned home.
good,New York Life has an excellent training program.  It is a 3 year comprehensive program.  A typical day is calling clients and servicing them as needed.  Being persistent is the key here.  I do enjoy providing solutions to problems or meeting a financial need through the product and services we provide at New York Life.
good,"One of the best stops along my career, it hurt me to leave due to a move I had to make.  I would recommend this job and career to anyone.  It was truly the bets place for me to learn and grow."
good,"The pace is fast and the days are long, if you can keep up its the best place to be.  You get the best training and there are always resources to help you be your best."
good,"selling life insurance, pension plans etc depending on which licenses you have."
good,"It was okay, the manager of the El Paso branch is a pervert. Other than that it was great. that is literally my only complaint. Everyone else is great, and plenty of chances to make money."
good,"I loved working at New York Life, I started in an entry level position doing accounting administrative work,the staff were all very friendly. when a better position opened which was in the claims department with better pay and more challenging works, I applied and got it. It was a small department but the supervisor and manager and one other coworker were all willing to teach. I had learned a lot and put my greatest efforts into my work. The saying "" Work hard pays off"" was so true in this company, my title was the same, but my compensation went up considerably after a year of work."
good,"Trusted company. Great commissions. A lot of sales reps so a lot of competition. Excellent weekly meetings."
good,New York Life is an incredible company to learn and grow from!  I have learned the tax advatages and the non advantages and how to give my clients that education.
good,"New York Life is a great company to work for. The atmosphere is very supportive, the management is great and compensation was great. I learned a lot from New York Life."
good,"Highly professional work environment. Great business ethics."
good,"Downers grove office was much bigger - get mgmt.  Needed to work on life / work balance.  Job security was always there and pay was fair.  Tampa office - pay was not as great.  Mgmt needed work, no work life balance.  Since the office was so small, cannot be sure of job security."
good,Great place to work. Great people who care about their work and the business that is conducted on a daily basis is outstanding. I am extremely lucky to work for a great company.
good,"NYL is a company that cares about their employees and their security.  Each day you learn with the different experiences  and it helps any individual to become a stronger employee.  A very diverse culture that will shape and enhance not only work experience, but character."
good,"Each day is never the same and that's what makes my job so interesting because you never know what will happen. What I learned most throughout my experience with New York Life is the  ability to use my skills and knowledge to help businesses, families and individuals protect what matters to them most. I have a great work environment, the agents and management are what encourages me to work hard and be a part of a team. The hardest part of my job is the hours I put in to make my business successful. I do enjoy the flexibility and meeting different people from all walks of life."
good,"We prospect for clients through phone call-in section, Facebook, LinkedIn and walk-talk (face-to-face). We listen to clients' insurance needs and advice  by suggesting to them any of the various insurance and financial products the company offers."
good,This is a great place to work if you are planning a family or have a family. They are very good on work/life balance. They offer great compensation and good benefit package.
good,"Great place to work, but it's all commission based pay. In my opinion in order to really make it you have to first save 6 months of personal expenses and then work hard to catch a big break."
good,I enjoyed working at New York Life. The management is very hands on and tries to help you succeed. The primary reason I chose to work at New York Life is for the amount of resources that are available for training and it's reputation as the best in it's industry. It was a great opportunity but the compensation is only commission based and that was hard to handle in the beginning and ultimately the reason I decided to pursue other opportunities.
good,"Since working as a contract graphic designer at New York Life"
good,"I worked for New York Life doing Clerical work from 1978-1987. I resigned to stay home with children.  After 20 plus years now at my present job, there is no room for advancement and have re-applied again for employment at New York Life. So far, I have not been called for any interviews. I want a great place to work where I can retire from and I want it to be New York Life."
good,"Very encouraging place to work. The entre managment staff is a pleasure to work with. Hardest part of the job is prospecting if you do not have any prior experience in sales. Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to create your own schedule. However, good time management is a must to suceed in a sales position."
good,"I admire the people who can put everything into this position and get out of it, all it has to offer. Many agents are so successful and making a difference in people's lives daily by providing the solutions they need for protection and accumulation. I will always have this ethical and amazing company as my provider."
good,"My day starts with coffee. LOTS of coffee. Usually because it's always going to be an action-filled day. I get in the office at about 7:30am and first things first, I make a handful of phone calls to the home office, as well as other mainland companies, given the time difference from the mainland to the islands. In the mean-time, I'll be checking emails for any issues that may have resulted in current cases, as well as questions that clients may have for me. Agents, whom are my bosses, will get alerts overnight for the businesses currently in process. I'll sort through them and notify them of crucial points they will need to resolve. Follow-ups usually last me till mid-morning to after lunch. All new applications, and servicing paperwork, are mailed out in the latter part of the afternoon, as well as getting clients specific forms and applications upon their request."
good,"Great company with great benefits. Learned a lot of medical terminology, how to read medical records, and database management.  Hardest part of the job was being on the phone most of the day."
good,"The New York Life had one of the best training. Great place to work, wish the commission structure was better."
good,"My day at work there was pretty good since I had tons of things to do, i learned so much different software programs and my manager and co-works were so nice and friendly that make me feel like home. The hardest part of the job was having tons of work but no help, but i did enjoy the pay and that i was always busy doing something."
good,Enjoyed the company support even though the agent is considered an independent business owner.
good,"I joined their trainee program in 2008, studied the mainframe and Cobol. Grew in the position and went on to code in PL/I and Assembler. I learned alot with this company, worked on many interesting projects - will never forget my first project on my team - to convert MARKIV (obsolete language) code to COBOL, hmm if don't know MarkIV Google it."
good,I have/had a hard time with this career because of my own consistencey. I think I need to be in a more strict envrionment. Great opportunities here and I will be back if I leave.
good,"Prospecting, making phone calls to potential clients, and setting appointments. Management offers support to assist in obtaining clients."
good,"New York Life has been around since 1845. The stability, strength, and intregrity is the mission. The management team is helpful. I love the atmosphere, environment, and the individuals that make the company great."
good,"A great opportunity to serve by the resources the company has provided. 175 of dedicated service to its clients as history depicts. Truly, a company providing solutions to the clients problems."
good,You can expect a happy employee environment and high energy. Everyone knows and speaks to everybody. There are plenty of resources  there to help employees to ensure success in their career.
good,"The good is the flexibility and that there is no cap on how much income one can make. The company culture is great and it is the most honorable career ever. I love building relationships with my clients and prospects."
good,I enjoyed working at New York Life.  My only complaint is there is no salary.  It’s commission only.  There is an initial bonus you are given for the first three years but that’s only if you are selling.
good,es una muy buena empresa para aprender muchas formas de ventas pero no hay un salario fijo
good,"A typical day includes training"
good,"This company is a true meritocracy. If you put in the work you will get the results. Be prepared to sell a lot of insurance. Although, they are a full financial services company they do not offer much training on investments."
good,100% Commission.  Sky is the limit on managing your clients/business.  Huge market for growth and residual income for the future.  Pension and Mileage paid and very flexible schedule.  Very professional and enjoyable to be part of the company.
good,"Arguably the best way to start your professional career. A true test of skill set, from sales management, to client retention, to management of multi-level responsibilities as a financial services professional."
good,"While, I was not totally in love with my role at NY Life the overall culture and team I worked with were amazing. They went out of their way to welcome me to the team and were helpful every step of the way."
good,Interview was 25 years ago. I think they now do alot of inhouse job posting. Was a wonderful place to work. Most of the people I worked with were there when I started and one by one we started to retire together. They were my NYLIFE family.
good,"NYL is an amazing Company to work for. Better be on your A game! You're able to help out people on a daily basis.... Hopefully you know a lot of people. A lot of calling on people and businesses, so hopefully you have the gift to gab!"
good,Working here was a great learning experience. Very challenging not just career wise but personally as well. You really have to put in your full effort in order to succeed in this type of job. Wouldn't recommend to just anyone. you have to be strong and challenge yourself everyday to be and do better and be able to face day to day rejections. The job consumes you but Its a great career for the right kind of people.
good,"New York Life was fun and collaborative.  Benefits were great and the people that worked there are great.  That being said, not all offices are the same.  Culture is different in each office.  Had to leave b/c of relocation."
good,Outstanding training program for new agents.  A lot of professional resources related to learning the industry.  NYL is a very professional environment.
good,"Great place to work. Always a Long commute to work. Great work environment. It was an absolute bliss to work at KLM and I will always cherish those work memories. Learned a lot about computer systems, data analytics, information systems and etc."
good,"work hard everyday to reach out to new people, prospecting and reaching out to your warm market. Lots of studious effort to become licensed and a full agent."
good,"I have New York Life a little over 2 years. It is a fantastic company to work for and I still believe it is the best Life Insurance company in the world. I will continue to be a client even after I am gone. The variables that are out of my control when it comes to insurance sales ultimately sank my future there. I am knowledgeable and very skilled at this, but that alone is not enough to build a book of business large enough to keep your head above water. Ultimately the inconsistancy of commission checks put my family in an undesirable situation financially, and that is not fair to them. If not for that, I would not be looking at my options outside of NYL. In fact, If I could negotiate a base salary while reducing my commission percentage, I would do that just so I could stay there."
good,NY Life is a great company for career advancement and industry experience.  They offer many career enhancement opportunities especially in the leadership and coaching areas.
good,"Sales company, If you easily adjust peoples focus to purchase their products you  will do well at this company. If you struggle to maintain contacts in order to develop business you will not do well."
good,"Great place to work, but SOME (not ALL) of the managers there are really jerks. There were 3 I truly didn't care for and 2 of them I had personally were wonderful!!!"
good,Very good Job. The structure is very open. You are responsible to set your own hours and to maintain a good book of business. The job is completely commission based which can be a positive or a negative depending on the person. The management team is extremely helpful and are willing to help in any way you ask.
good,"Walk and talk on a daily basis for prospecting new business clients."
good,New York Life provides you with everything you need to have an incredibly successful career. They are the strongest financial services firm in the country and have great products. The managers are incredibly smart and great trainers. I would recommend the position to anyone willing to work hard in sales.
good,"You will be given the tools and training you need to succeed. It can be lucrative but you have to be willing to work and put in the time it takes to develop your business. You are your own secretary, admin, marketer, salesperson, etc. You are in business for yourself but not by yourself as NYL gives you all the tools and training you need. There is light supervision which is mostly accountability to your own plan. It's 100% commission so if you aren't comfortable with that don't try. You have to be confident in yourself."
good,"New York life is a fantastic company that's very culture centric.  There's a lot of focus on communications, change management, and ability to ask senior leaders anything needed."
good,Can be lucrative but must have strong pre-existing relationships. You need to have substantial funding saved up and be prepared to put in several years before you truly see the pay off.
good,"Met and educate clients. Set goals and met them. Sales products"
good,Being an intern New York Life taught me the many skills needed to advance in my next career. I loved the autonomy they give to their employees and they have excellent managers to support you if needed. The work place culture is a professional yet friendly environment.
good,"A nice place to work, if you are willing to work hard, however salary is not guranteed. A 100% compensation based job. Not for everyone. The more book of business you build the more compensation you will get."
good,"This project gave me an opportunity to expand my knowledge on the Business Intelligence tools and also to work on various new Platforms."
good,Being with the company for nearly a year now it has taught me so much. Honestly a great company for sales and learning to start your own brand. If very outgoing and reaching the right people the compensation could be great. My problem came with my leads becoming very dry that led to me feeling the anxiety of not having a steady income while having financial responsibilities.
good,New York Life is a great place to work.  The management staff is exceptional and the training is tops in the industry.  I would recommend the Dallas GO to any aspiring agent.
good,"The commission was very difficult to adapt to, however it challenged me."
good,I enjoyed New York Life. It is a very competitive and goal orientated company.  They give you all the training and tools you need to succeed at the job.
good,I really enjoyed my job at New York Life.  I loved the work that I did. My boss was very good and understood when certain situations arose. The job was part time but often times I would work over just to make sure I had completed everything.

good,NYL is a great company to be employed with.  Great benefits and the people are great as well.  Management in my department was good until the supervisor was forced into retirement.  He did a very good job of taking care of and protecting his staff when it came to the corporate bullies.  There was always something to do and the atmosphere was fun.
good,"Adjusters long hours that may conflict with work/life balance but that is being addressed."
good,NYL is a great place to work for extroverts who enjoy working with people and making phone calls.  This is a people-centric business with a focus on helping individuals plan and protect their retirement and family.
good,Great company to work for.  Work life balance.  Very diverse and inclusive. Lots of opportunity for advancement.  Tuition reimbursement and it pays well.
good,"First, only left New York Life because my position was no longer necessary and I was laid off. I can see the business reasons they did this and I agree with those decisions. My position had become unnecessary. They treated me very well once the decision was made and gave me a generous severance package as well as 9 months notice."
good,"You pretty much get what you put in.  It's great for anybody that knows a lot of people and does not need money.  If you're relying on a paycheck every week then this wouldn't be for you.  If you have 6 months of expenses saved up, then you can definitely make it here."
good,"At New York Life, it was always a fun, friendly, competitive atmosphere.  I really enjoyed challenging myself daily to thrive in the industry.  The earning potential at New York Life is very high."
good,Great Place To Work. Strong Company. Great Training. Great Compensation. You Have To Continue To Sell in Order to Survive. You Eat What You Kill. Not For Everyone.
good,"My typical work day was one of a secretary. Answering the phone, greeting clients, making appointments, and filing. My manager was a notable agent who made the job easy for me, only reason I stopped working was because she was retiring."

good,"If you love challenge yourself then this is the place for a insurance adviser."

good,"Perfect work place, amazing colleagues, wonderful management and perfect work-personal life balance"
good,Make outbound calls to current T-Mobile customers. Attempt to present them with offers for available upgrades on phones and their current plan. Assist them with questions.

good,"Very nice place to work, was in the top 500 fortune company, enjoyed working for New York Life. Enjoyed my co-workers. Was unfortunate they had out sourced the work."
good,Excellent management.  Work life balance is phenomenalimes. at all t.  The training provided is second to none.  Management goes above and beyond to help you
good,"Coming into the insurance industry, there are many older agents who do not appreciate how quickly new agents push a sale and write the book of business. I was fortunate enough that every member of management was willing to be there to help out."
good,"The management at this employer is amazing. They provide step by step , hand held process for new hires. There is no guessing on what to do next, because there is always someone to help you get to the next . It is hard work becoming an agent as it is difficult to build a client list"
good,It's a great company that will take care of its employees. The job is very exciting and rewarding. Commissions are hard and unpredictable.
good,"The company itself is great. Training is phenomenal, depending on the General Office you are connected to and your Managing Partner's involvement with your development. "
good,"New York Life surprised me. Being that it is a major corporation (Fortune 100) I never expected such a familial and comfortable experience."
good,"This office is has a great training program and development manager. There are plenty of resources located right in the office and someone from management is always there to help and support you. Training  takes up a lot of time, but is worth it. The only thing as an agent you have to find business. Not always the easiest."
good,"They have a great product that I believe in.  They help families to be prepared, save their assets, protect and distribute when the time comes.  I love this company."
good,"This is a great organization with a long history of excellence. It is a tremendous opportunity to the right candidate. Lots of opportunity that will present as a result of hard and successful work. Nothing is given, everything is earned. This career (financial services) is 100% commission so be prepared to self fund your income for 6 months or so."

good,nyl has great benefits and a good corporate culture.  Lots of time off given. Lots of room for advancement.  The company is growing fast.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Learned a lot about being financially prudent. Hardest part of the job is working on commission only. Most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and people.
good,NYL is the life insurance offering company and the project was to implement the web application for Term Conversion for Elife Application. This Elife application helps clients and agents to apply for life insurance in the paperless form and gives flexibility to get signature done in remote and in person too.
good,Helping clients with life insurance needs and developing sound financial plans. Cold calling businesses and talking about business continuation planning and vitality. Great team of workers and management was extremely supportive.
good,"New York Life is a top company in the insurance and investment arena.  Their products and services, as well as compensation are top notch.  Management was great, but at the end of the day this is a commission job and if you are not the right fit you will not succeed."
good,New York Life offered phenomenal training and management during my tenure with the company.  The incentives from completing sales goals were great and fun to work towards.
good,"Amazing job, learned a lot, great support, plenty of freedom regarding income. The education is never ending and they are always setting up classes to give you hands on training."
good,"If you want to work for a corporation, New York Life is the place to work. There was a lot of work, some with tight deadlines some not. My co-workers were dedicated to getting their work completed in a friendly, productive way. The most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating with each other and working with illustrators to come up with great ideas for our marketing."
good,Excellent Place to Work.  It is telling that most of the employee have been here over 25 years.
good,"Innovative, deadline oriented, fast paced with the feeling of being connected as a family."
good,"A typical day at work involves getting to work at 9am at which point I open my work email and begin to check both email and then voicemail.  In the process of doing that I look over my boss's  calendar that I printed out the day before and check my email for any documents related to his meetings.  The morning part of my responsibilities usually involve making sure he is on time for meetings and is prepared. I also work a lot on his PowerPoint presentations, just making sure of the wording, clarity and overall presentation.  The second part of my day I usually dedicate to projects I am either working on with others or that I have complete responsibility over.  Many which involve team meetings.  "

good,"New York Life is a great place to work. Its a very busy and fast pace work environment, but the people are very easy going and helpful. I work with a great team and i have a wonderful manager."
good,"Great company, with strong core values and history. The ability to make as much money as your would like, but its a double edged sword. With the ability to make as much money as you want, you can also make nothing as this a commission only position. If you have a family to support strongly way out your pros and cons. If you are single with no one to depend on you, and don't mind struggling before you reach your success then this position is great. "
good,Perfect location in New York City.
good,My day is totally in my own hands. I'm my own boss and schedule meetings with clients and I choose. Management is very supportive and more than willing to lend a hand. The hardest part of the job is the phoning aspect but the most enjoyable part is helping out a client and knowing that they will be better and more secure in the future.
good,New York Life Insurance provides a workplace friendly environment. Family oriented company and promotes work life balance.
good,"I enjoyed helping people with an important decision. I learned a lot about all financial matters especially those associasted with death. Often good people do not want to think ahead and making arrangements for their passing away. The hardest part is the 'selling the life insurance product; because it is intangible; it is not something you can put on a shelf, brag about or see."
good,"I learned more about finance in the time I've worked with NYL, than most people will learn in a lifetime. It is a great opportunity to change family's lives for the better. Having an entrepreneurial spirit is key to success! The management team is very supportive if you are coachable and willing to try new things. The hardest part of the job is learning to deal with rejection. Not everybody will buy from you, even if they have a need. The most enjoyable part of the career is helping people save for retirement and helping them manage their risk."
good,"A fast pace, hard working but a light environment to work in."
good,It was wonderful experience to work with such a big company. Sales was very easy with the co-worker and the manager.
good,"I give it an A+, especially outside of customer service. Management is great, HR, and operations, Schedule Changes. The hardest part is working in customer service."

good,I am able to achieve my daily recruiting goals in a productive and competitve environment.
good,Want you to develop and promote.  Get involved in community.  Encourage education.  Open to being innovative. New York Life is a great place at any point of your career beginning to end to work.
good,The interview process took over 6month before I was eventually offered an engagement. U get what u work for in NYL . No limit to what u can earn. The job flexibility is super.
good,"New York Life was a great place to understand and learn about Life Insurance, Worked in a Hybrid development model which gives flavor of agile and water fall."
good,"I have been employed for 3 years . The environment is comfortable ,everyone is friendly, work is challenging but its insurance, training is good.The only con would be that time off is limited around the holidays."
good,"New York Life is the oldest, most established life insurance and financial services company.

good,New York Life is an amazing company with quality leadership and training. If you are looking to start in the financial services/ advisory space...this is the place.
good,"I loved working for New York Life!  They were like family.  They only reason I left is because I wanted to do more for women and be a life coach.  I felt that their restrictions regarding social media were too stringent.  But otherwise, it is a great wonderful company and you will love the people their."
good,"New York Life Insurance Company is a great place to work and build a long term career. The financial services industry is not for everyone, but can be ideal for the right personality."
good,Finding new Clients is my drawback. You do get leads from the company but they are few compared to how many people you are expected to talk to on a daily basis.
good,Good place.  Treated fairly.  Manager of DC office is amazing.  You get out of the career what you put into it.  I have enjoyed working there for the most part over a lengthy period.
good,"The company will train you to be a top tier financial services representative. The one thing to remember is that is a commission only job, so know what you're getting yourself into. Drive hard, show up and stick to the training method and the company will do everything in their power to help you succeed."
good,I worked in various field offices which I found to be rewarding and a good learning environment.  Good working relations with team members created a excellent environment.
good,"This is a great place to be. The amenities inside the campus are unmatched. They have a great cafeteria with actual cooks with great perks on Fridays. Training is extensive, but rightfully so. There is a lot of revenue on the line when your handling member accounts. That’s the extent of the pressure. The actual workload is the norm. They let you research answers before you give them. You need only to know how to research in their system."
good,Need to already know people that you will be able to sell Life Products for at least a year. This will help you financially while you make contacts on the outside.
good,"New York Life was a great place to work."
good,"New York Life Insurance Company is a company that for over 170 years has never forgotten their mission, vision and purpose. Truly a leader in the corporate world, regardless of industry!"
good,"Tons of training, great professional people, and very honest from the beginning. They said it's not easy but if you are willing to put in the work you will get results. Everyone in the office from MP to Agents are all willing to help and are happy to see you succeed."
good,"It is an incredibly wonderful place to work, the best place I have worked at. I chose to leave because of working hours and how it did not work for me, but it was an absolute privilege to have been able to work there."
good,"This has been the best place I have ever worked. The management team is top notch and will help you every single step of the way. You can ask anyone within the company, no matter what level they are on, and they will help you. They will go on appointments with you if they are able, and 100% support your success. It is a competitive place, but that's just the nature of the industry, however, we enjoy ourselves and it's never intimidating. We all joke around with each other, and make sure that we're having as much fun as possible."
good,"Difficult job but if you succeed, you succeed big-time. The most difficult part of the job by far is prospecting; finding new leads and setting meetings. This job is not for everyone and before beginning, think real hard about what your business plan will be. ""Who is my market and what value-add do I bring to the table?"""
good,New York life was amazing. The job culture is so diverse and so welcoming. The employees are friendly and management is productive and present through your entire experience.
good,Great place to work if you have experience. I had the chance to meet great people who have helped me learn more about the job. There is flexibility in your schedule.
good,I love the customers and the fast pace of the work. The job had many educational classes and opportunities to excel. Managers and superiors were also very hands on with their employees and treated very well.
good,"I worked for the sister company New York Life International.  The days were long at times, being that we worked with international markets.  I enjoyed working with other assistants overseas.  Learning about other cultures was great.  My team was a great team.  We worked well together.  Even though the days were long, I did not mind because I loved being there."

Duties included prescreening and evaluating consumer credit worthiness; developed decision based on evaluation, authorized payments, and processed payments when necessary. Respond to customer, investor, or other 3rd party inquiries, researching and/or preparing documentation, or analyzing determining appropriate course of action.  I enjoyed my coworkers, it was a small team so everyone communicated and it was a good job.  I was released per my contract was over.  I reapplied, however the position and team was laid-off and sent to other departments."
good,"fast paced with time sensitive requirements on letters, application input & scanning, commission payments, billing and paying policies, reviewing and responding to emais"
good,This was a great work environment and good people to work with !!    The company provided good benefits as well as good work life balance.  Also provided training on our skills needed for the position.
good,"Insurance sales is difficult--not everyone is cut out for this career.  And, it's a career, not a job like many other financial services companies will sell themselves.  But, if you follow their advice and work hard to build your business, you can be tremendously successful, or just successful.  And, that's the point, it's up to you.  New York Life is a fantastic company that continues and thrives because ""they"" do the right thing by the customer and the company--there is a reason that it has the highest of reputations."

good,"The responsibility of an insurance agent is to find clients/customers and develop a rapport and trust so that the customers' financial needs to be addressed and protected using products that have been designed for specific application.  It is a time-consuming and a hard work business.  An insurance agent must create a client base or book of business in order to operate efficiently with a satisfactory income.  It needs at least 10 to 12 hours of work per day initially, but once the business started, the referral and income are going to follow.  An agent who works for a company must produce a certain amount of income quarterly.  The management is going to monitor agents activities and requests to attract more clients to the company.  Failure to produce minimum company's requirement premium is going to affect the agent's contract with the financial institution."

Management at New York Life is different from many organizations; I praise my management and look up to them every day. I normally do not have coworkers New York Life but try to collaborate with fellow agents. I like being a leader but even better part of a team. It makes the day more enjoyable when people work together. The hardest part of my job is honestly having prospect understand the value of life insurance. But the best and most important of my job is when a family understands the importants of life insurance when they incur a loss."

good,"The culture: The culture at this company, specifically the Bellevue location, is like no other place I have worked at before. The management team works together to help every agent grow both professionally and personally. 2. Teamwork: You can be put on a team or work individually. There are senior agents and advisors that will mentor you along with a management team and product consultants. 3. Options: Within two years of working with the company you have the opportunity to learn the management side, become a full financial advisor, learn about positions in the home office, or continue to enjoy the agent role. 4. Training: The training for out industry is absolutely outstanding. I have worked at other financial firms and have many family members in the business and what New York Life has is truly special. 5. Uncapped Income: You truly have the opportunity to earn as much income as you work for. My first year did not make six figures, but my second year I did and I make about 145% every single year compared to the last. There are many people in our company (and office) making a seven figure income. 6. Entrepreneurship and Grit: To be successful in this business you learn time management, build grit, and gain control of your life.

After working here for 15 years, mostly as an advisor - now in management, this goal is evident in the culture, the collaboration among colleagues, the training, and the pay.  I can't say enough good things about the company all the way from the top of corporate in New York City down to the local agents here in Grand Rapids.  Yes, the career of being an agent/advisor is extremely challenging.  But if you are willing to put in the effort and integrity the industry requires, this is the place to open shop."

The most enjoyable part is setting your own schedule and having an unlimited income stream."

good,"This company is great.  If you are really looking for a ""career"" and you are tried of trading dollars for hours this is worth looking into!  The only draw back if any is that if you are not use to working on a commission pay you will want to make sure you have some money saved up, or someone that can help handle your expenses while you see if you can cut it.  Noted this is if you plan on going into the sale side of the company."
good,Great people and great environment! A wonderful place to work.
good,"In my 22 years with New York Life, I held different positions. My last position was ""Event Planner"". The company has numerous meetings for agents and managers, through out the year, nationwide. My unit was responsible for the contents of the meetings, creating Power Point presentation for the different presenters. Ship to and from all the different materials, awards, gifts for the event. Keep a record of all the presentations for compliance purposes. On site, we coach the presenters delivering their presentations before the event. Check in all attendees, coordinate with the hotel to set up each workshop the way the presenter wanted it, check/arrange audio needs. Collect the video from each presentation to post on our web site upon arrival from the trip. Our unit was made up by just four people, so we needed to be flexible sharing responsibilities, an adapting to last minute changes on upper management side. It was crazy but fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating rapport with field officers an agents.The hardest part was to be away from my family four days at a time."

good,"You'll spend a lot of your days in class when you feel as though you ought to be out gathering prospect names or meeting with potential clients.  But you're better equipped to meet those clients once you've been to class.  There is no better place to learn about the world of finance from this fortune 100 company whose managers have all been in the trenches themselves.  Managers say they hire special individuals, good people, not merely good sales people.  The job requires self-starting motivation along with persistence and the ability to handle rejection.  If people say yes two out of ten times, you are considered a success.  That said, you might have a string of bad days, but all it takes is a few great days,so you can help build a self-sustaining business.  As one manager says, if you're willing to do what most people won't for three years, you'll be able to do what most people can't for the rest of your life."

good,"A typical day, you start by reviewig the underwritting status of your cases, answer to the requested questions, gather any information, like extra signatures etc, I learned that the whole process of approving someone takes sometimes very long time depending on the health of the client, management was great, very supportive and encouraging, lots of new learning in a short period of time, my co-worker agents were as novice as me and that made it fun, we helped each other, and sometimes shared cases, the hardes part was to have to wait sometimes up to 1 or 2 mos. for underwritting to decide on approval, since they have to see all of the details and risks."
