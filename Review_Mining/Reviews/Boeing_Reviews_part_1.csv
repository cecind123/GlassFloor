bad,"A male colleague worked from home for four months under the guise of a groin injury, while I was EXPECTED to come into the office with e recent throat cancer diagnosis! My male colleague was allowed to work from home, but I was not offered the same courtesy! I firmly feel this was SOLELY because of my gender! My Manager favored the men under his ""charge"" while females were ignored; with two notable exceptions who were ""buddies"" with the Manager's male colleagues/subordinates!"
bad,"Not the best company but the experience was good."
bad,Management did not care about their people. You didn't get raises. Work life balance was not good. Management didn't support their people. Didn't put anything back into their people.
bad,This place is run like a fascist regime. People are taken advantage of on a daily basis. I’m planning on leaving here ASAP after the new year. There so much of a communist attitude from the managers here. Not to mention the cost of living in Washington State near Seattle. If you don’t give your soul to the company you’re as good as fired and the Union here is useless. Most union stewards are Company stewards.
bad,"8h/day, 40/h week job...  Low pay, pension 1/2 paid for by employee (industry standard is 100% employer paid, and higher), cheap relocation policy, high LTD (Due to many ""Claims""), horrible management/leadership, high taxes, low standard of living (Winnipeg), low morale/camaraderie, people line up at the punch out clock 45 mins/1h early, walking around the plant you'll see people sleeping/glazed over eyes, high turnover rate and low retention.  Might be an ""good"" employer for Winnipeg.  The qualifier there is ""For Winnipeg"".  It is insulting to find out others were given signing bonus and moving expenses.  All I wanted was my moving expenses covered.  The ""Relocation policy"" covered only  50%.  "
bad,"When I would tell people I worked at Boeing they were immediately impressed, but the truth is my job was nothing more than a data entry position and the pay reflected that. When I got sick they fired me for too many days off, though doctor approved."
bad,I hated it there. People are so busy playing politics that work never get done.  Nothing ever gets accomplished.  They arw the only company I know of who will tell you that there is no money for projects but you will still have to go through the motions.  Boeing is a train wreck waiting to happen.
bad,"Management has Blind eyes on, No one is in it for the satisfaction of putting out a Superior Product, very much a Robotic Atmosphere, don't ask Questions, don't tell us what's wrong, just do your Job and don't question or Complain or we will find a way to get rid of You."
bad,"Paid 25% less then market "
bad,"Management play favorite and as you get older, they would make any efforts to suppress your salary as well as kicking you out of the door!! Experience is a liability to them and not valued."
bad,"people"
bad,"Managers and employees are risk-averse. This inhibits innovation and creativity. Processes are over a decade behind. Very little external experiences within the leadership, promoting stagnation."
bad,"Some coworkers were determined to do as little work and stir up as much $4!7 as humanly possible.  They would hide tools and parts, write nasty anonymous notes making fun of people and generally be as cruel and evil to everyone as they could manage.  Oh, and they got caught...repeatedly.  Management can't do anything even if the person in question brought a gun to work, came to work high as a kite, assaulted a coworker or shagged a coworker on company time.  The best they could do was move the troublemaker somewhere else to make other innocent people suffer.  Stay far, far, far away."
bad,"Don't go with the brand name. Company needs lot of strict policies to safe guard employees. Some teams have no work at all. Some teams have are over loaded and have no work life balance. It's on either ends. "
bad,"This is the worst company to work for in Aerospace. I was in Composites and I would say, don't even waste your time. Go to Northrop. This Company is a junk place to work."
bad,"once a contractor always a contractor, contracts exploit workers, and you wont get paid for holiday, sick leave, etc.  They will fight to renegotiate your wage to minimum wage as a scare tactic"
bad,People who work their don’t care if you die in one of those plaines. They do what they want when they want with management approval. Quality is a joke
bad,"worst place to work for. ruins marriages, ruins lives, people live here and are under appreciated. miserable and not worth it. the company could care less about its employees"
bad,Bedbug infestation problem at Boeing in Oklahoma City. Extremly hot and stuffy in the buildings. They won't turn on the dehumidifiers in the building. Cheap!
bad,Boeing was a great place to work staff were really friendly and everything was fair you do have to wake up early in order to get to work but great benefits
bad,Boeing has a process for everything. It doesn't matter whether its right or wrong follow the process. When you question a process it is like you are seen as insane.
bad,"Generally you are not paid for 40 hours of work, but rather to work for 40 hours, .  Innovation and strategic thinking will get you in trouble if it goes outside of your immediate area of responsibility.  Management tends to focus at the task level, often micromanaging experienced and competent people.  Employees are held to the letter of internal polices, the same are constantly violated by management, especially those who want to advance.  An ""opportunity"" is used to load more work onto you, with little to no recognition. Over time you will find that no matter how well your performance reviews are, the value of your compensation erodes.  Avoid Boeing if you are looking for a place to develop your career, but it is an acceptable employer if all you need is a job and a paycheck."
bad,"Sucking soul crusher of a place to get lost.  I turned in a eeo complaint and was told what a courageous thing I did by the company lawyer"
bad,The company did not pay enough and expected way too much like you weren't allowed to used phones in designated areas and yet you could not bring a book to read to stay occupied.
bad,"Avoid Boeing. No room for promotion, doesn't foster an environment to develop career. No opportunities to work on proposals unless you are called out by name."
bad,Not a good place to work. There is no job security and management is terrible. You are treated as a number. You are not able to take time off without being harrassed.  People that are on your team are not able to help you. Everyone is out for themselves. Management is horrible and they do not care about you. They get rid of people like you are trash and they spend money on traveling and events for themselves.
bad,The most unproductive period of my working life. Poor management. Micro management. Ethically unsound. Could not leave quickly enough. Did not learn anything apart from how not to manage people.
bad,If you are under 30 it is a great place to work once you hit 40 years old you might as well have a target on your back.  Diversity is more important than skills and education.  So much for that degree you worked so hard on.
bad,"Racists company "
bad,"Stressful work environment, lack of communication from management. No accountability for poor behavior/bad decision making. Extremely low starting pay for the area."
bad,For such a prestige brand to have such low energy and a lack luster environment is surprising. Probably one of the most difficult jobs to come into work every morning.
bad,"hello today and tomorrow, hello again today and tomorrow, this is the most screwed up website I have ever had to use.  I am being forced to be in an evaluation for Boeing eventhough I don't want too."
bad,"Not a Good Culture to work in. Very few advancement opportunities, to Much a Union Environment. Managers are only in it for them Selves, not interested in Employee advancements or Training."
bad,Worst job and culture I have ever experienced. 10% of the workforce somehow manages pulls the remaining 90% and company forward. The majority of non-union employees are severely underpaid and the workload to headcount is disgusting. One employee could have four vendors to manage while another could have 65.
bad,"If you want to be pushed toward mediocrity and a lifetime of incestuous internal bickering then this is the place for you! Do you love  goals and objectives that contribute to absolutely nothing? You'll get that here.  Work in an unclean, cramped, noisy distracting environment!  Be told you cannot telecommute despite the fact that your entire group is virtual! Watch your great benefits disintegrate before your eyes! Live in a world of silos, finger-pointing and a complete absence of accountability! Watch nothing get done..ever."
bad,"The company has a bunch of Trump supporters, so it's not a company that has a long term vision of a strategy for success. I would stay away from the company."
bad,"The job is OK as an Engineer sometimes."
bad,they hire senior managers that are a joke completely worthless who know nothing about the teams they run. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN WORK AND HOME LIFE BALANCE. THE SUCK THE SOUL OUT OF YOU
bad,This is the dumping ground for the worst managers in boeing. A typical day starts off with you walking all over looking for the parts to do your job. if and when you find them then you have to stand in line for tools. Everyone hates it there and is looking for another job.
bad,"Ordering parts for airplanes for 5 people. Learned about airplanes.  "
bad,Working environment and morale has hit an all time low at this location. Upper echelon has ignored our voices and managers are incompetent to perform their duties.
bad,"Mad managers, dishonest very cut throat.  Any type of advancement were for their friend.  Managers could not be trusted, they would tell you one thing and tell their peers something different."
bad,"Boeing does not value their employees. You are nothing but a number."
bad,"I haven't worked at this company in fifteen years, therefore I an not in the position tell you anything about the current environment at St Louis BOEING."
bad,"upload travel voucher travel for employees in long beach and st. louis.  Posted invoices to customer  accounts from the posting journal "
bad,"Known for laying-off they're senior employees and bringing in new college grads.  "
bad,Boeing have the worst managers to care for workers and the union didn't care about workers. There are to many meeting without accomplish the jobs. There is not a family friendly work place. I got discharge while I taking care for my daughter oversea. These managers jobs were terminated workers. The people were not friendly.
bad,"Great place to work as a union employees but horrible place to work as a manager. Was given no training, no support as a new manager. Upper management shunned me because I didn't start from the ground floor. Management was blind to the problems and just forced the flavor of the month down our throat."
bad,Management has no clue on how to implement and endorse their own policies.  Policies change to fit what they need no standard from one person to the next.  San Antonio Boeing
bad,"Excellent company to work for.  Fantastic benefits, fair to employees.  Advancement opportunities are plentiful.  Would recommend this company to anyone interested in the aviation / aerospace industry."
bad,"I worked here because I love airplanes, but I found the management left something to be desired"
bad,"Too many terrible things to list, just awful. Sad because the product is amazing. I've wanted to work at Boeing forever, can't believe this is what it is."
bad,Lockheed took over the KC-10 contract treated all the previous employees of MDC as suspect and this was a real bummer time in my life. I really want to forget this.
bad,"Be prepared to get over worked every day.  New Breed has poor management and you get mandatory overtime every single week and there's nothing you can do about it.  If you need time off you don't get none.  If you miss a day of work, you need to make it up somehow because of the mandatory over time by management.  There is no advancement within the company and you get really low pay.  You get to work 10 hour days M-F with no time off.  They don't care about you, so you might as well find work somewhere else."
bad,"No Engineering workmanship or support. Lack of planing i.e. work orders. Harassment at work were you live, internet, etc."
bad,"Company was aggressive in the post banking crash economy. Every - every! - employee who was not line staff was in the business of protecting his/her job, not being a leader."
bad,"Boeing mesa was a good place to work with good benefits. however, much to my surprised, the new management team had turn this place upside down. New policies are in place to replace 90% of well-trained staff members into outsource, contracted work without providing benefits. This was not the place it was 23 years ago when I first started working there. "
bad,"I would not recommend working for Newbreed Logistics to anyone. Once Newbreed came in and took over behind Boeing, they doubled the work load and decreased pay rate almost in half. Once the new company was trained by previous Boeing employees, Newbreed dismissed all of the previous employees as if they had nothing to do with they're success. They hired all new employees with an embarrassing pay rate. This was hands down the worst employment experience ever. Unfortunately above rating does not let you choose zero."
bad,"Recently having relocated to Oklahoma from Seattle, I am looking for a position in where I can step back into the exciting business world, help others, and hopefully get back into software, IT, consulting, research, investigations, or process/procedure analyst. "
bad,"Bad Management"
bad,"Executive management is driving the company into the ground it used to be a family based company and now it is a dollar company that does not care about quality, employees or Loyalty."
bad,I had a contract through PDS. Liked the work did not like some of people(how I was treated
bad,one of the best jobs i have ever had to take an aircraft from concept to production and see it become the airlift work horse of the USAF.
bad,Ahead of the rest advancanced training
bad,"threatining, timid, challenging, terrible managmen, thorrible, terrible managment, long hours, many meetings, lot's of presentattion creating,"
bad,I preformed audits/inventory for the different tool rooms and PCA stores within the Auburn and Frederickson plant. My team members and myself worked well with each other along with getting the audits/inventory done in a timely manner.
bad,all liars from the top down and right to your face with out blinking a eye. First job I get in my field I am out of their.
bad,"My experience, was in product and services management, I experienced an immature implementation management and reactive working environment. The technical teams seemed to be managed similarly. I notices changing roles and assignments on projects regularly."
bad,"Run Run Run as fast as you can away from this co. Treatment of employees by management is unfair,  unethical,  belittling,  and down right Rude! They don't know how to build a plane, which is why they go into management.  Which also, they know NOTHING about. If you are a man they don't pick on you too much, but if not, than you are constantly harassed.  Unless you dont mind sleeping your way to the top"
bad,"At Boeing Distribution Services, you may feel the Nasty Management Attitude, Specially in the Order Filler Department. You’re supposed to have at least 30 days to complete your trainings, but they want you up and"
bad,"I was hired to take over a highly critical and complex system which is required for interactions with the Federal Aviation Agency.  Upon arrival, I found I was to replace a 16 year employee who retired.  The system was his only job and he did not document anything.  He had integrated 6  OTS packages into a whole system and then proceeded to ignore anything he could.  That was bad enough but he gave the manager 2 months notice of his retirement and he left on the designated day.  I was hired 6 months later so of course, I got zero turnover.  I also inherited a list of 100+ failed transactions with the FAA and each transaction represented an aircraft that couldn't be completed and therefore could not be sold or delivered.  That accounts for nearly two billion dollars worth of inventory.  The system I inherited was full of bugs and the previous developer had never fixed any of them.  He just wrote a stand-alone agent to correct the data.  He wrote over 500 agents that he used to keep everyone happy but of course, he never documented when or how to use the agents."
bad,This is a great place to work if you have no marketable skills and don't mind being treated like a child. I have a skilled trade and am sorry I came to work here.
bad,"They have no clue how to invest in their people.  Engineering is sub-par, way too much management and stuffy environment.   The final product is cool though."
bad,"No job security at first. Frequent layoffs until you have gained some seniority."
bad,"I do not wish to provide an ind depth comment at this time for personal reasons.However, I feel that the company lacks diversity and culture.  Advancements are minimal for minorities.  Work, life, and balance is an issue too."
bad,"Boeing is een US gigant, met nog veel uitdagingen op internationaal gebied. Kennis en resultaten worden gewardeerd."
bad,"Leadership at Senior Manager level and above is only about them.  Partnering for success is direct falsification of partnership with the supply base.   The Senior Leaders only worry about cost savings to ensure they manipulate their numbers to get bonuses. "
bad,"I work Human Resources and Project Management items. The workplace culture is in flux. Right now, it seems like no one knows where that will lead to. It is a hard environment to work in when you don't know who will have a job from one day to another."
bad,Employees continually cover up mistakes. Management takes all of their stress out on the mechanics. They rely on 2-3 workers to carry the entire load while 7-10 sit around with fidget spinners. The place is a joke.
bad,"Strange place to work, super boring work. A few good people but a lot of strange people. Not a good place to work but not the worst either. Was called but not sure I could ever go back there. Work is simply not inspirational."
bad,"I left because of the debased minded culture this company portrays to its employees.."
bad,This company is imploding under the weight of it's own bureaucracy. Very dysfunctional and cut throat. Management is making horrible decisions and cutting their touch labor.  This company wont survive another 5 years.
bad,"most of the technical staff has been or will be laid off and the management focus is on cutting costs at the expense of innovation. I do not recommend working here, unless you are new and starting your career. it is a good place to gain experience."
bad,Did not tolerate any excuse of tardy/absent because I have a child with disabilities and that gets sick a lot. The company does not train you and does not have advancement options.
bad,"For hourly employees they do everything to undermine and take from you. If you are a salary employee then they believe that you can do no wrong and you are great. Boeing puts fourth all these programs that look great but they don' back up anything they put out and each building has different management and programs. No one works together because the atmosphere is that everyone creates their own kingdom and will not do anything that might jeopardize their kingdom. Also Boeing tries to outsource every job they can so that they can minimize the amount of employees they have. Management cares only for the stock holders and not about products, safety or their people."
bad,"Worst culture and no training; very top heavy with managers; lots of long time employees bilk the company for money and stand around and talk all day and don't help new people because they're afraid the newbies might actually do the job better."
bad,Difficult to advance.  Scope of work is not very challenging.
bad,"A typical work day for me was not bad I actually enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with on a daily basis they were great and willing to help you if you ask, it's management that needs up. Communication between workers and upper management was almost non-existant, lower level management was constantly giving incorrect information to the workers because upper management was constantly altering the way things were to be done causing jobs to be completed incorrectly, which in turn caused a backup in production. Scheduling was not the best, throughout my year of work my work schedule was changed multiple times. Training was learn as you go which also caused multiple issues as there is no standard, there were a few classes that you are required to pass for certification purposes but nothing more."
bad,"Trying to find work elsewhere. Moved to Charleston with high hopes as a contractor at Boeing. Swallowed all the lies told to me at first. We were all told what a great opportunity this would be, ground floor and all that. It's the same junk that goes on everywhere else. The players and suck ups get hired. Hard workers don't. Worst parking ever too!"
bad,"I worked there for a few months. There's alot of family that work there. We couldn't get parts for our project because the manager of the warehouse didn't order them. She was not reprimanded because her husband was the manager of engineers. If you want to excel there you basically have to be related to someone there. All other employees were just the worker bees who caught all the flack because the project was behind. They kept leading me on saying they were going to hire me on next month, then next month, and so on. They needed to hire a few techs but said I would be the first hired on permantently, but then I saw them advertising a direct position ahead of me. They were not honest at all!! My floor manager named Craig was the only good thing I could say about the place. He was an awesome manager to have and a very good person. If more there were like him it would be a great place. He should be the one in charge."
bad,The leadership is sub par at best. The Assembly line has poor management being performed by unqualified people. Deadlines are increasingly shorter with no supplies to compensate. Management asks for opinions from workers and then does the exact opposite.
bad,"Management is useless and made of a bunch of clowns. "
bad,Boeing did not provide for family/work balance.  Management was poor.  Advancement was unavailable.  Assistance with paperwork and Total Access was dismal.
bad,"I used to be proud to work for Boeing.  Now, I don't miss it at all.  Their culture shifted to caring about their employees to caring more about covering their mistakes.  Complete lack of integrity and failing to follow their own values."
bad,"An environment of hopelessness  and  confusion. The majority of your lower level management , have never worked in aviation . They lack people skills."
bad,"This is a shady company hiding behind the Boeing name. Absolutely no care for product quality or employee well being. Only thing that matters to management is meeting impossible delivery deadlines, even if the product is missing nuts and bolts and the workers have to stay an extra 4 hours to watch the paint dry.  I took a pay cut at another company just so I could get out. The only reason people stick around is the great benefits that Boeing provides."
bad,"This company boasts about the importance of its employees, but does nothing to keep valuable employees engaged and appreciated. Everyone is replaceable, and any issues that an employee faces will not be addressed unless the employee has some form of leverage to coerce management."
bad,"Boeing insisted on managing projects in accordance with project management industry standards; however, the people of Boeing do not know the first thing about project management.  They are the blind leading the blind.  They are a fully functional organization in spite of their insistent that they are projectized.  Not one seems to have the first idea of what the corporate goals are.  They just march along pretending to know what 'management' wants and are rewarded for doing 'whatever.'  My experience has given me pause in boarding any Boeing manufactured aircraft after seeing how their management works."
bad,"After a long term employee announced his retirement in two months, management failed to hire a replacement for six months until they were in violation of FAA Regulations.  They hired me to take over the incredibly complex application and make the required modifications to comply with FAA regulations.  After I relocated to the Boeing location and got an apartment, they presented me with a contract that was $10/hour below their advertised rate that we had agreed on.  Since the apartment contract would have cost $4000 to cancel, I was stuck with no negotiating options.  When I got to work, I found out that the application was required for each aircraft sold to commercial and military customers - in other words, it was critical for the business.  The prior employee only had the one application to support and spent the 16 years integrating it with 7 OTS programs, 5 of which were not mentioned in the job announcement and 3 of which I had no experience.  There was no documentation and the prior employee was not available to give any insight or pass down.  It took me 3 days to make the required changes in the application and 3 weeks to get the changes integrated into the other programs.  Just when I had it working and ready for test, the manager who didn't hire anyone for 6 months said it took to long and fired me.  I feel sorry for the next person the hire to take over the application."
bad,"Racist Culture. White privilege. Discrimination and Harassment. My manager target all the minorities. I worked for Boeing for 9 years and the last 2 years of my career I and other minorities were discriminated against, harassed and treated unfairly."
bad,"Hard for minorities to advance. I wouldn't tell anyone not to try out a company, you may have better luck with this company than myself or other minorities that I know."
bad,Poor upper management lies poor teamwork turns back on union members double standard. No control over new hires who miss work on a daily basis and management doesnt do a thing
bad,Boeing expects too much from employees and doesn't take the proper actions in order to keep up with production rates. To try to keep up Boeing started taking away almost all of the employee recognition programs and made us work large amounts of overtime.
bad,"Management is inexperienced and "
bad,It sucks it is not a good Boeing culture they abuse and bully employees and I got laid off after 32 years and it was while on an L&I claim for another employee injuring me. They are not about employee anymore just schedule and bonus
bad,This company is going to implode under the weight of it's own Bureaucracy. Engineering is costly and takes too long to make changes. Management is ladder climbing and jockeying for position. The mechanics are the true back bone of the company.
bad,Terrible miserable place to work they expect you to give your life to them mandatory weekends and nights second shift you basically live there never get to see your family
bad,"The new management culture is not good and the company is losing many valuable employees. Employee's are not valued or respected. Management does not abide by the written company principles around respecting people. It is virtually impossible to win at this company. Managers are coached to give employee's low performance ratings, to downgrade employee's that are at the top of their levels. Alternate work arrangements (telecommuting, flexible work schedules) are very unfairly administered. The Company and management chain are all about cutting costs and no longer care about their employee's. Many that have 30+ years are leaving the company due to this kind of hostile work environment."
bad,"Spent two years working as a Senior Project Manager for the LTD organization of Boeing. I experienced extreme disorganization, lack of clarity, bullying, power plays, misdirection or no direction, lack of accountability, lack of support, back stabbing, undermining and the greatest amount of wastefulness imagainable. These folks sit at their desks for 20+years doing very little of value,  running in circles to appear busy. Unskilled, uneducated workforce. Just like a government operation.  If you want interesting work this is not a healthy work environment on any level.  Buildings have no windows, parking requires bus rides added to you day to get to your office or shop, cafeteria menus are heavily fried."
bad,"After working for this organization for over a year and trying to get authorization for a Statement of Work and Requirements, this management has failed on every account to act responsibly and provide support and guidance to the Information Technology employees to promote their Lean+ programs to save Boeing over $300M per year and eventually resolve safety issues. Management is to concerned about political safety than aircraft safety."
bad,"Don't work here.  if you've ever seen the movie ""Office Space"" that's life at the Lazy Bee..........      I was glad to move on.  That was a career ender..........................."
bad,Lots of better companies to work out nowadays in the Puget Sound.  HR is non existent and management can do whatever they want.
bad,"7am-7pm with hour lunch. participate in paint shoots,sanding and prepping plane for paint and primer. short breaks occasionally,12 hour days 5 days a week."
bad,"it all depends where you work. For the most part it is a very dysfunctional company that would not survive in a more competitive industry. Managers can be incompetent as the company offers minimal training to managers and selection process is poor.  "
bad,Experience of working on an airplane.  Just was not what I liked to do any longer.
bad,"Management was not capable of actual two way converstaion."
bad,"A typical day at work varied with engineering, technical writing, recording and analyzing test data.  Boeing was a short-time extension of Rockwell International responsibilities following Boeings purchase of Rockwells Aerospace Divisions.  I learned about Testing Operations for Minuteman Missile System Inertial Guidance Sets.  Also learned documentation of procedural requirements for testing operations.  Management was supportive to technical activities and schedules."
bad,"Absolutely horrible experience! I worked for the company for 8 years at EO&T and my psychological and physical health was completely ruined. One of my manager was a complete micromanage and manipulator - he didn't allow us to make any suggestions, we had to copy him on all emails, he re-wrote all analytical papers after us (people with 30+ experience in the field), he called us at 1am, harassed and bullied. I contacted HR and ethics and they did absolutely nothing! In fact HR rep said-what are expecting? my manager does the same!"
bad,Advancement in this company is based solely on being from the Washington area and your time spent in the Boeing Company. There is little regard for education and past non-boeing experience. The company is Bureaucratic in there thinking and creates an unhealthy environment for it's employees.
bad,"Apparently nobody reviewing this company has been through a 40,000+ employee layoff. Hopefully you're not hired on the tail end of their hiring spree because it's a cyclical market. On the defense side, job duties get duplicated because of over hiring and Boeing employees have to spar with SAIC employees to keep work in house. Questionable management culture. Benefits are good, however, but feeling of simple 9-5 job over shadows the benefits. Company HR and management are looking out solely for the company and the employee is a number. I've seen non-degreed union workers get more training (green belt, kaizen, etc) than degreed engineers because according to management, 'the training is just not in the budget'."
bad,"Wow what can I say about Boeing. First of all, it is in Clear Lake which is a nice area but very expensive to live in. The moral at Boeing is awful. No one really enjoys going to work and it shows. The managers are moody and secretive and the overall tone at Boeing is employees are bored. "
bad,"A terrible company that only values shareholder profits. Avoid at all costs as qualityis no longer a Boeing priority."
bad,"new management every 3 months. No consistency with the treatment and assessment of employees work load. All about who you know, not who you are or how you work."
bad,They don’t pay a living wage to start you can make more at McDonald’s  the company is drug infested including management where I worked was a bunch of people who sat around and planned pot lucks and didn’t work most of the time
bad,Terrible toxic management Never been at a place that had more hypocrites/narcissist as managers I enjoyed the work there But management screwed all that up.
bad,"14 years at company. Was thrown away like a.piece.of.garbage after.they made me.wait.2 year with a broken neck that could be repaired for surgery.  "
bad,"Boeing India Pvt ltd has expanded it's head count leaps and bounds and in 1 year time. You will come across several openings in job sites with cutting edge technologies in the JD. "
bad,"Management would rather hire/transfer from outside than promote. Those that are hired from outside generally have little experience and 50% of the time hired in at pay rates above current employees.  This done to attract local employees and meet state agreements.  Approximately 85% of promotions are based on social relationships with management, not experience, leadership skills, or hard work. "
bad,This job is almost just as bad as being back in BCT in the Army. You cannot make your own decisions and if someone has another idea of how they want to do things forget being able to have those implemented. They talk poorly to you most management does at least. People are constantly in HR and you can hardly trust anyone that works there because they've created a dog eat dog environment. Things look pretty on the outside due to the just less than stellar benefits they provide to you. But after you work there you realize the benefits can't make you happy enough to be there. Management can't make their own decisions and it's micro managed all the way to the top.
bad,"If you have good experience and knowledge do not go to work there. You will not be taken seriously. The team of Maintenance personal I worked with was highly educated and experience from working at other companies. Sadly Most of 2nd shift Left. We All Left Boeing As Fast As We Could.  Well, Boeing, you did not listen to all of us about working in a team environment. The unsupported shift teamwork. Upper Management talks team work, Talk the talk but do not walk the walk. slander, professional discrimination go on under there nose. "
bad,"The Boeing company worked hard to provide a safe and challenging work place culture, enabling employees to learn and progress their careers. The company provided a learning center that pushed and developed managers to better lead their employees."
bad,"it is a job"
bad,"This place has a very cut throat environment, because of the constant fear of being laid off, no one will willingly share information which makes the culture here unbearable and really hard to work with your colleagues to get work done. The attitude of ""do more with less"" will make you drop from exhaustion, literally. There really isn't much of a work-life balance.The management is extremely poor which doesn't help the environment. On an average day, I was yelled/cursed at, bullied, belittled, unable to take bathroom breaks and had a line at my desk. "
bad,"Workplace culture has taken a negative turn over recent years. Employee morale is declining, influenced by job instability, outsourcing and lack of communication, as well as messaging flowing down from the upper ranks that is not clear or honest. Decent benefits but they have also declined."
bad,"Boeing has great pay and benefits but that is quickly going downhill with each vote as they phase out the union. There is no future with this company and no job security. The culture and atmosphere are dark and the morale is terrible. There are some good first line managers who care about their people but most management above that ruins anything they try to do. The company is sinking and it is no longer a hopeful and prosperous career. I attended college and worked hard and tried to advance my career within the company at no avail. Boeing does not care about your personal abilities. They care about numbers on paper, and that is what you are to them."
bad,Inexperienced managers.  The focus is not on new products for market.  Non-competitive rate structure means there are too many managers and not enough first line workers.  The company does not do enough to share the tribal knowledge of all 4 generations currently working there and build on that potential synergy.
bad,There is no respect for engineers. Cost over the accuracy of the work. Dealing with not trustful management. Establishing a fear environment of lay off at all time.
bad,"This review is for Boeing Satellite Systems. Processes and expertise of the workforce was fantastic and world class. But most of that was stifled by poor business practices and incompetent factory management. An inability to compete to win satellite contracts, resulting in multiple rounds of layoffs. An attempt to cut costs to the core by overworking their remaining staff that just killed any semblance of what little morale that was left."
bad,Promote younger inexperienced people too fast. Anyone over 50 is looked at as not having value and want them out of the organization. Lawyers were hired to write procedures for HR to follow in getting the average age of the work force lower. Disliked Boeing experience and wanted 'other' background to work on Boeing products. Makes a lot of sense?
bad,"Requires a significant amount of dedication to work here. You will be told to work weekends, unpaid, throughout the year with little notice. There is very little opportunity for advancement and the overall outlook in the future looks frail."
bad,"Great benefits - flextime, generous 401K match, paid time off, sign on bonus, referral bonus, teleworking is position applies."
bad,The work is great but it's all the obstacles that are set in place which makes it hard to do your job.
bad,"Boeing stifles free-thinking and creativity.  Management is so multi-layered as to be ineffective at decision making, leading to a lack of progress and loss of competitive edge..  As one co-worker put it, ""Boeing is as nimble as a Glacier."""
bad,"I have worked in many many places....ranging from city courthouse to large high tech companies. I have never worked at a place that had such a low regard for its people. I was used to being treated as a valuable resource, as a professional with a job to do. At Boeing it was about survival and watching your back for me. I worked in 3 different jobs during my last employment there and each of them had their dysfunctional parts. It was frustrating working in a place where it felt you had so little recognition. The saying ""its not what you know but who you know"" actually did apply at this company. I noticed that if you were a tall white male you were given recognition and advanced along quite nicely. I was not any of those things unfortunately. I stayed much longer than I wished as I kept getting promises that the new job would change things or the new manager...however it is such a huge company I am sure there are many different environments. I would advise anyone joining Boeing with caution and negotiate the highest salary possible to start as raises are few and far between. There was no typical day at work, each day was filled with putting out fires or trying to get another area of the company to do their job so you could do yours. I worked there a total of over 11 years. Yes there were some spectacular people there, just like anywhere but they are fewer in number than other places I worked. They did provide fairly good benefits and pay but IF the tradeoff is working in a hostile work environment, I would not do this again. It saddens me that this is how this company turned out"
bad,"Boeing has become so none compliant that it is at risk of getting shutdown. Boeing total departure from tried and true classic engineering, is still a big problem. The culture a Boeing is I don't care."
bad,"People there are one's who will through you under the bus without winking a eye. Management only thinks of there friends and keeps       "
bad,"This was an absolute joke. I have no idea how they build airplanes . No one works. They walk around all day complaining that they need more money. A lot of these people are high school graduates making $30 plus an hour with large bonuses every year. Morale is ridiculously low here and it's contagious. "
bad,"Poor Managers"
bad,Do not work here you will be out on the street in a couple of years ...The corporate steam roller is coming
bad,"Typical Day: Schedule was 6;00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. working on my own"
bad,Low cost facility. Unorganized and caotic. No experts on site.
bad,"This company will drain the heart out of you. One day you will be told to pass a certain defect, the next get reprimanded for doing so. Your co-workers will cut corners, you will see waste of company resources on a daily bases that could easily be prevented. You can, and will be thrown under the bus by management if it serves their purposes. If your body starts to hurt or break down from increased workload due to under-staffing you can be medically retired by the company. The union that is there to protect you, also protects the lazy employees that makes your job harder."
bad,"Highest management is bias, Back ground check investigators feel like gods if they do not like you....you can loose your job or not get hire  so you need to talk to them as your god."
bad,"Management does not care about employees and it works up the chain from there.  They belittle employees and give management to the favorite employees, not the experienced ones.  They make you work mandatory overtime hours,  that can go on for over a month, with not 1 day off which takes away from family needs/ wants and can affect the employees health."
bad,"Will never work here again. The management is garbage, work culture is not there, employees hate their life and work feels like a hostile environment. They treat you like its a communist concentration camp."
bad,Boeing is becoming a very poor place to work.  Management style has changed from an inclusive family like atmosphere to one where they have turned everyone on each other.  Most of the stuff that is reported in the media is either a lie or just a small part of what is really going on at the company.  Management doesn't even know the jobs they are managing anymore which also has helped to bring morale down to an all time low.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Went to work for the Freight Payment team last summer at Spare Parts Distribution Center in Tukwila.  The team had been together for years.  They were just getting ready to outsource and offshore operations while moving the management team to Mesa, AZ.  I was the last one brought into what was already a dead department.  Most of the FTE's had retired or moved on once they found out about what was happening and didn't want to wait it out.  They brought in contractors to clean up the backlog, but training was horrible and there was only one remaining person with any real experience to train and oversee all the contractors while getting the offshore team on its feet.  ...I was GLAD to see that contract come to an end even though the pay was good."
bad,"i started getting sick constantly due to working conditions and over work, 1 weekend off a month for a year and a half and 10+ hour days takes a toll."
bad,"I worked for a Boeing subsidiary in 2014-15. I'm sure it would be a fantastic place to work if you're a heterosexual, white male from Hertfordshire - for me though, the everyday racism, sexism, homophobia and antisemitism, in which managers often participated, was just too much, and after spending my childhood impatiently eager to join the Aerospace industry, I very quickly left and re-evaluated my career."
bad,"The company engages in wage theft of non-represented employees 'encouraging' them to work lots of overtime without pay."
bad,"Management has decided that they know how software development should be done after consulting with a contractor (Pivotal Software). As a result you can expect management to determine your hours on site, your dev environment and even if you get your own desk or get to share with a coding buddy. Wtf is a coding buddy?... Nothing good. "
bad,Typical day at work is 10 hours.  There's not much learning besides OTJ which is usually rushed and expectations are high.  Management DOES NOT VALUE employees.  Workplace culture is primarily driven by the quest for a healthy bottom line.  The hardest part of the job is constantly being set up to fail with little to no help.
bad,Poor management and people lie their way into positions they're not qualified for . The benefits are great but the way Boeing uses the rules for their own benefit and not for the employees.
bad,"Boeing overall is good. Certain projects in BDA need to be shutdown and restarted with new crew as its very much a ""jobs for the boys"" environment with untrustworthy and unskilled people becoming employed and promoted to management roles."
bad,"Management is the biggest issue, middle aged men good ol boys who don't like diversity or even know how to spell it."
bad,"If you can handle the boredom and lack of caring for the product then this is for you. I've learned many things throughout my years at Boeing some good and some bad. I prefer not to work in that type of environment. There is no time for families unless they work with you at this place, Boeing survives on overtime and doesn't care what kind of life you may have."
bad,If you aren't looking to advance in your career then this is the company for you. Not a fair company. It's not what you know it's who you know. Better chances of advancement by applying to a Boeing in another state other than Charleston SC
bad,"Workplace Culture"
bad,"Start up was before the departure of third shift to prepare for the first meeting at 7am."
bad,"Your career will go further if you pick up on political strategies from Game of Thrones then if you work hard. Big ideas only happen on power point. I've seen countless people steal ideas and make pretty PowerPoints that show data/results that are technically impossible but the 'leadership' viewing the PowerPoint are so far away from the truth of the actual production system that they don't know any better."
bad,"Boeing is currently reducing headcount in order to reduce overall costs, however the workload or process requirements are increasing.  This creates an environment where employees are set up to fail and management unfortunately shifts all blame on employees rather than finding ways to eliminate unnecessary tasks."
bad,"Too many layers of management. Your career can be great or miserable depending on your manager. No recourse, unions are worthless."
bad,"Boeing may be a good place to make really good money, but the money is the only thing that is good about the company.  After years of work, numerous injuries and 2 surgeries and being subject to harassment, I decided that my health was more important than the money."
bad,"Good company, management style behind current models, good vison but cannot execute to cost competiveness."
bad,"No significant merit raises in three years (or more for some) for any hourly/non-exempt salary employees."
bad,great pay if you can deal with a lot of  BS. management doesn't give a hoot. the  Union is a joke only there to get themselves rich. Union does not look out for its people. Boeing Does not care about its people at all and neither does its union.
bad,"I love working with my team. They make it fun and we make sure to do entertaining things on a weekly basis to keep our groups morale up. The hardest part of my job is staffing since it is so dynamic but it is also the most fun since it is so dynamic. It keeps my hopping. My job has a lot a variety which keeps it interesting. I love to put out fires and find solutions."
bad,"Boeing is a good company. I do think that it has need for an intensive overhaul & in the long run feel that because of the lack of standardization of its processes  & too much dependence on 'trible knowledge' that it is going to have a period of discontinuity because a large segment of the work force is nearing retirement age & when these people retire, there will be a lack of structured information for the new generation of employees to 'keep the ball rolling."
bad,"i don,t like this job very boring same place work all day . not enjoy it"
bad,"Boeing is not everybody. Pay is good once you max out (6years) . Starting pay is kind of low. The work culture is toxic. Constant threats from management, who don't really manage. They will blame hourly for their management mistakes. There is no accountability.  The company is in a bad place financially and it's going to get worse."
bad,It is hard to advance. Not alot if work life balance for some programs.  Parts shortages cause you to look for something to do some days and then work overtime to still meet schedules.
bad,"Walk, no run. If you value your career and your self-worth do not even attempt to work here. You will not make a difference, you will not change the fraternity brotherhood, male dominated mentality here at Boeing. If you are a Woman you will get no-where. There is no respect, no morale, Just NO."
bad,"Worked 10 years in the Shared Services Group."
bad,"The work environment is Okay and will say their is no work, life and balance as it may seem. Your designated a lot working the weekends in overtime and furthermore, mechanics are overworked and all management cares about is the numbers and how many parts for each plane model are being produced hourly, daily and monthly."
bad,"I do not recommend this company if you want to advance or grow in your career path. Everything is very political and you cannot get promoted unless you have been at the company for over 10 years. They are very old fashioned and the environment is not good for young professionals. It is very political and very slow paced. They are not open to letting you take part in company events. The employees there are not productive and stay online playing games or watching TV online. The managers don't do anything about this. The nickname for the company is the ""Lazy B"". HR does not even care if managers do not know how to talk to interns either. It was a hostile work environment throughout my time there."
bad,Not room to say and since I have nothing nice to say it's not worth the time to say anything at all besides it's a horrible place but the pay is nice!!!
bad,This place sucks because of HR. They stifle the environment and encourage tattling and this leads to backstabbers and a toxic culture. HR claims to treat all employees equally but they favor blacks because of affirmative.
bad,The manager i had was not good she forced people to work to punish them. She talked about irrelevant things in the work place. She was odd and would not make eye contact she didn't care if something was wrong
bad,"Boeing was my dream employer."
bad,"Get ready for MANDATORY overtime 10 hr days, 7 days a week 2 weekends on and then 2 days off (repeat) for 7 years or you get terminated. Company policy infringes on your 2nd amendment rights of concealed carry in your vehicle (parked outside the gates in parking lot) eliminating your ability of protecting yourself during your commute. IT techs hired to time the time it takes to get to your work area from gate on breaks, come through the gate with a minute less and you are written up. culture forces you to practice incomplete rushed work. Company harasses employees using FMLA, Medical clinic sends paperwork requesting you to sign forfeiting HIPPA rights or your claims may be denied or delayed. Hated my work environment every single day, but put up with it for the $$$. Blood pressure and hypertension were at dangerous levels, it doesn't bother those that are willing to forgo their values and compromise their integrity for great pay & benefits/promotions."
bad,Great environment but be careful who you interact with. The good ole boy system is in full swing. If you just do your job and not question anything you will love it.
bad,"Management was horrendous. I worked for a manager who ruled with an iron fist, who used intimidation as motivation. She was an utter disgrace. A typical day at work for my team meant trying not get yelled at. That is all we did!!! The hardest part of the job was leaving my house in the morning. The most enjoyable part was when I finally got on I-90, and headed home."
bad,"The local Plant and its Management did not follow the rules and policies of the Main Company, they gave me my 60 day notice via telephone while I was on Vacation."
bad,"i was the last remaining employee closing out the labs in Long beach, my day consisted of boxing 50-75 pound units, doing all the shipping documentation, logging, record keeping, loading trucks, moving units from lab to lab for processing, responding to emails, phone calls and in person demands from engineering management.  "
bad,Constant rush with delayed parts and management expecting miracles.  regular mandatory overtime with little to work to do but make sure you look busy.  Shocked the Boeing company's aviation division can actually earn money.
bad,"Room for improvement within the culture and leadership. Care for ""family time"" are vocalized but not meant. Injuries and worse have occurred when management was notified of potential dangers and then dismissed. However, employees jobs are secured and taken care of if they do get hurt on the job. Advancement opportunities are abundant."
bad,Converntional big company.  Not much advancement and everyone is comfortable.  It is easy to hide and difficult to stand out amongst the thousands of employees.
bad,"There is a horrendous work culture here.  You expect a company to do more than pay lip service to the ideals it presents to the outside world.  In this instance you would be wrong.  Management is poor at best.  There is no strategic vision that an employee can get behind and support.  There is constant reorganizing for little to no purpose, other than perhaps to make things more difficult for auditors to do their job or hide costs.  They do not value loyalty or experience and are in the process of reducing the average grade level, and thereby payroll, by eliminating experience employees in favor of interns and recent college graduates but having no one to train them."
bad,Crew i worked on was very immature and LAZY. Worst job i had in a long time! Low starting pay. I just couldn't see myself doing that job for 6 years spraying that material (Hexavalent Chromium) for THAT low of pay. Any experienced painter will not like 777 bodies/wings. (Major structure)
bad,Used to be a great company to work for. But now they've fostered a culture that pits management against employees and employees against each other. It's very cut throat and stressful.
bad,A degree is more important than experience. 80% of all new hires will be family members with no experience for job hired for. 95% of all jobs posted are already filled so mostly will be a waste of time applying. if possibly hired dont expect to move up within the company.
bad,"First of all let me say ""I loved my job"" and still do love my job. I am a wiring/Avionics specialist. I received many commendations for my work from Boeing. I am a contractor and was released for a process violation that I was told to do by my lead, something that was and is the ""Norm"" But because I was a contractor and he is an actual employee they let me go, I am not writing this out of anger or hatred. Just know that they treat contractors in a bad way. Upper management says ""Contractors are expendable"" so lower management and employees treat contractors very badly, especially quality assurance.  Most of my coworkers I really enjoyed. I admit some of them are deadwood. The hardest part of my job.....Nothing. Just dealing with certain individuals and management."
bad,If you are willing to work weekends and evenings and get paid for 40 hours this is the job for you.  The pressure is intense due to the large dollar values and direct management's propensity for blame shifting.
bad,"You'll be made to work in excess of 70 hours a week on some projects, there is no acknowledgement of your work. Leadership is only involved in advancing their careers. If you try to get things changed to improve the system, you'll regret it. Safety forms are always pencil-whipped. It would be easier to just make copies and change the date on them. First line managers routinely cover up any findings or delete them altogether from reports."
bad,When the planes went down so did our jobs. Either relocate without assistance or take the package and walk. Basically those were the options. Very stressful and not fair to your family.
bad,"If you’re not a managers favorite, then good luck getting anywhere. Also, if you have a disability and are a contractor, you’re royally screwed. They treat contractors like second class citizens."
bad,"They required a bachelors in accounting and experience only to have us cut and paste snapshots from their accounting system into an Excel workbook,,, I No challenge at all.  And yes, I asked what else can I do to help and that was as good as I was going to get!   Having 13 years in various accounting positions and on the brink of obtaining my masters in accounting, there was o amount of money, that kept me interested in this position!  The work was nothing like the complex duties on the job description.  I dreaded going to work everyday.  Plus the accommodations were awful.  The hired 5 accountant "
bad,I was very excited to start working for this company up until I found out how it was ran. The poor management skills these managers have and lack of people skills is unreal.
bad,Great benefits and great pay only after you max out. The hardest part of the job is my work shift. I never get to see my family. And they take away overtime to the people who want it and make the people who are trying to have a family life work overtime.
bad,"I'm salaried, work in an office."
bad,"The good:health insurance, schedule, holidays and vacation. "
bad,"After being cat fished by this company claiming to be Boeing,, I was told that I actually work for Argon ST,, in other words, it's a subsidiary of Boeing and does not offer a competitive wage compared to other companies in the are and definitely not what the rest of Boeing pays they're employees,, I have several years of aviation experience and I have been passed over for promotion twice.. This is a shady little electronics company that has nothing to do with aviation or Boeing,, look for employment elsewhere if you want to succeed,, I currently am"
bad,"It is a good company for younger people.  It is going through a transition of out with the older workers and in with the younger."
bad,"Poor planning, no manufacturing management support. Politic driven - if you don't brown-nose then they find ridiculous ways to get rid off you. Basically you're paid well to put up with their corrupt and crooked business operation."
bad,"Tasks are often broken into small increments that rely on co-workers input due to the large workforce and complex beauracratic processes.  The company is grossly behind in technology and struggling to recover from multiple PR problems due to poor engineering, lack of innovation and profit driven leadership styles. The jobs are mostly undemanding and unrewarding leaving high achievers feeling unfulfilled. If you like a slow work pace and don't mind constant last minute changes this is a good place to work."
bad,The way they treat you at Boeing is crazy you could have one manager who's great and another who could care less about you. There's really no common ground. If your not part of the old boys club there's no room for advancements.
bad,"Cutthroat environment, poor inexperienced management."
bad,Worked on trying to setup an online store.  The only problem was that it made Boeing nervous and they did not allow the completion of selling products online to Airline operators.
bad,All comes down to whether you want a structured life for you or structure your own life. You work under a corporation with good to decent benefits and are characterized as a number rather than a valued personal
bad,Management could not be trusted they would go out of there way to make things bad. I was told not to talk to anybody and no body that worked there really talked to each other and you had to really watch your back side.
bad,"The Chinook program was managed by bullies with no respect for the individual...At any rate, I am now semi retired and I'm getting training towards a Peer Specialist position. In September I will attempt Certification to become a CPS (Certified Peer Specialist). My true calling is to help people. I've inherently known this since a life changing event back in 2004 that culminated in a much needed divorce - my ex-wife and I had no children; and we remain friends. This calling has come to fruition now with all of the training I am receiving and the compassion that I feel towards those who are recovering from addictions, trauma and/or negative life events. I am a sincere person with much compassion and hope to give to those who are struggling."
bad,Their are way to many chiefs and no Indians. Most of the people are good people but then there is a lot of them that have been at Boeing for ever and need to retire or be fired. Their attitudes are terrible! Then there are the new people that know it all and have only been at the company a short time. And all of them telling you what and how to do it.
bad,Relatable environment.  Having to self train and inputting proper turnover procedures related to that specific job site. Took on more then job description annotated. Worked 10 hours of Overtime weekly
bad,"No training, management support or communication.  "
bad,"Boeing is a sinking ship. It will be bailed out eventually by our tax dollars, that is not to mention the huge tax breaks they got to ""pursue keeping work in wa."""
bad,Wasn't properly trained for job which made  it hard for me to perform up to standards. I felt management was very disconnected from employees. Overall I was dissappointed
bad,There is really no room for growth. You cap out at about 19.00 an hour unless you have been at the company for 8+ years. The bonus incentives are also not great.
bad,very less chance to grow. bad management. people are hard to work with..don't expect them to find anything when layoffs come. management don't give anytime  to get up to speed on new technologies.
bad,Low employee morale.  Executives from st. louis tried to transform cecil field which is a low cost boeing center into a large boeing center on shoe string budget.
bad,"Boeing is throwing away its technical workforce.  Don't join in and get tossed out with the trash."
bad,Boeing is always rated as one of the best places for a young engineer to start their career.  That's because it's a miserable place for anybody over 50 as the company outsources senior level experienced folks and replaces them with contractors and college interns.   A very cold and heartless place.  Not what it used to be.
bad,Admin staff and Resident Auditor in charge were hard to work with and maintain a comfortable atmosphere.
bad,"A typical day at work, first thing in the morning a crew meeting with supervisors. things I learned from the supervisor at the meeting what jobs were not complete. any other meetings that were required for that day like safety , where and what time. Coworkers were great to work with and learn from. Hardest part of the Job was when too many people decided to take the day off at the same time and there were not enough people to cover all the work packages. most enjoyable is when everyone that was supposed to be at work was there and all work packages were covered, and all prior work was completed so we could accomplish our work."
bad,Had twenty years before divestiture in 2005. A total and complete job
bad,Awesome people some really great managers . The union is not looking out for the best interest of the employees and HR destroys lives . At this company your just another number and they dont care about you and they know you can be easily replaced . The only thing good about working there is the pay and benefits.
bad,boeing was great socal fleet was not great to me but work enviroment at boeing was good my company did not provide any controbution to safty boots forgot about my 90 day review
bad,Management was horrible ! Co workers were ok ! Do your job and go home ! Worst job ever! If you don't kiss butt you wont get anywhere ! tell manages issues and they do not care.
bad,"After working here for a while I've just given up. For a company that prizes innovation, management just ignores common sense. Its a good place to start and get some skills under your belt, but most leave after a short while to go to better paying competitors."
bad,"If you are debating on becoming an AMT at the Military Delivery Center (MDC) at Tukwila on the KC-46 or P-8 program be aware of the following."
bad,Boeing was ok to work at back in early 2000.  Cannot speak to current management culture or business outlook. Cannot speak to current benefits or job opportunities
bad,Work itself is fairly simple. The constant changing of managers ensure that nothing will ever stay consistent. The leadership changes plans too often to make anything work. No real effort to fix the major problems
bad,"It is good to have a couple of years of Boeing work on your resume. The stress and lack of leadership is a problem. Millennials leave quickly and old folks are retiring or taking early retirement with a half years pay as incentive. The pressure of Airbus seems acute, but in the trenches you dont know if someone on high has a plan that will solve all the problems."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is the good people I meet and learned so much from.  The people that helped me thru the years with there experience to help me learn and exceed in my job title.
bad,"This Boeing in Everett is a Union. The idea of a Union is good, but it is used and abused. I think this is why Boeing is constantly moving people around and hiring/firing so often. They do not have as many perks as they use to. The pay is not very good (at least not anymore or where I'm working). Counselors aren't much help with questions about advancement or ""green-lighting"" and don't seem very knowledgeable. I'm kind of disappointed with my experience so far, I thought this would be the one."
bad,Boeing Company promotes many young mangers who are less experience and careless to older workers.  Young and particularly beautiful white women get ahead more easier than other people.  Managers treats workers unfairly.
bad,"Not really accepted as a skilled member contributing to the environment."
bad,"I am sorry to say:"
bad,"Boeing environment is a productive work place that is really into health and fitness which closely has been made possible by the employees who value the essence of well-being and better life style due to the stress of the job. It includes ping pong tables, good trails to walk and jog, yoga classes a gym. Employees are encourage to bike to work when necessary."
bad,"A typical day working as a Boeing Admin includes recording every minute directly into a specific aircraft, and having managers (plural) looking over your shoulder to determine your overall status and effectivity (5S and Toyota Production Systems are mantras adhered to by all management). "
bad,"Do yourself a favor and pass on this location. I’m not sure how the rest of Boeing is, but the Andrews AFB (C32/C40 program) location is not ideal. The management (from the top to the leads) is not transparent nor honest! If you’re not a yes man, than consider yourself on the losing team. I was only at this location for less than 2 years and saw 6 people either fired or quit. (There’s approx 12 people working this location. HUGE TURNOVER) The management team is comprised of 4 people that are visibly cliqued. If you don’t get along with one of them then you’re the odd man out. Being a hard worker does not pay off here. They do not empower their employees. They do not exhibit the sacred Boeing Behaviors. Do not be fooled by the titles at this location. This is warehousing. The work conditions are not suited for any decent human being (old warehouse, asbestos, mold, leaking roof, rats/pests). There is no solid training for new employees here. You learn on the go and you will be chastised publicly for your mistakes. I wish I knew how toxic the work environment was before being hired because I would have declined the offer"
bad,"If you don't have life, this is the place for you. If you like having 2 days off a month, this is your cup of tea. This is a Monday-Friday work environment.  But with the quality of leadership, you work 3 weekends  and get one off. If you have plans for the week end, you can use your vacation or sick leave to have it off. "
bad,"Poor management and co-worker attitudes should make anyone want to steer clear. Pay is great but not enough to sacrifice work/home, social life, and mental harmony."
bad,"You will gain essential experience that is sure to enhance your skill set, but the work culture is very political. It is very hard to move up or even align yourself with a position that is comparable if you’re willing to relocate. They use the STAR method for interviews and you will take writing tests."
bad,"A friend who worked there said the only time he'd go back there is if he was going to be homeless. "
bad,"The Boeing company has been engaging in some very unethical practices, its no longer and a place to feel proud to say I work for Boeing its just a machine now"
bad,I gave 17 years of my life to Boeing . Then they laid me off. The job security at Boeig is veiled. The people are for the most part good had working individuals.
bad,"Does it matter really? Also, I don't see why these questions are asked in order for me to look for another position.  It doesn't make sense.  I made some great connections at Boeing and I'll leave it at that."
bad,"Management does not support the projects properly, lack of HR involvement, schedules are pushed up, parts were hard to get, it was difficult for supervision to control manpower since management wouldn't back them."
bad,Looking else might be better off.  Not clear cut assignment with little or no explanation.  You have to be on your own to figure out how things worked.  Often time was wasted in which it could be saved if there was a little be guidance.  Many high calibers engineers.
bad,"This place will pretty much suck the life out of anyone who is capable and willing.  Work is overloaded to employees who are more capable than others, while some co-workers do half the work and receive twice the pay. Manpower is always down so overtime remains consistent, so for most there is no work-life-balance.  No room for advancement whatsoever, plenty of internal job openings, but not sure where/who they go to because everyone is chained in to one place and requests for movements are rarely granted. And then of course there's management... or the lack thereof... more like chariot drivers.  You're the horse/mule and they just crack the whip constantly because they have no idea how to properly motive their crews.  Eventually, most workers just break and turn reclusive and disgruntle, sad really."
bad,"Used to be a great company, current management has created a ""sweat shop"".  Many employees are being threatened they will lose their jobs if 1 minute late, phones must be put in lockers."
bad,"Over all work for Boeing is not bad they have good insurance, good benefits how ever working for Boeing at Germantown has thought me not to trust the managers. Management and HR is a mess. They don't answer you with respect and the managers do whatever they want with their employees."
bad,"Lives are ruined every day with layoffs. "
bad,"1st, 2nd, 3rd, Senior manager, and Super-intendeds need to be removed out of management.  Boeing has been making very poor management decision due to the quality of individuals being place to lead others.  Poor decision making, poor leadership, very political environment, and narcissism infrastructure that prevent anyone from moving forward or upward."
bad,"Great place for engineers to work, but if you are on the business side, I wouldn't recommend it.  Poor company culture, older workforce and mindset, revolving door managers, and very little Gen X/Gen Y/Millenials there.  Pay was not at all competitive in the Seattle area; doubled my salary within two years of leaving the company."
bad,"Boeing focal was fine to work for, but Dell was micro managed and pitted people against each other.  People were rewarded for telling on other people or speculating or making things up and reporting to Dell management.  I felt like I was doing a lot of the work, while other people were free to play on their cell phone or facebook as long as they were watching others and reporting to management."
bad,"There is a ceiling for hourly/production positions half way up. For grade and pay."
bad,"Boeing is a very large company, they have many employees who are all small fish in big ponds. The bottom line of any business is to make a profit. Boeing chooses to keep people as contractors because, well because they can and then those employees do not get any bennefits. They will continue to loose valuable employees by doing this."
bad,"Great culture to start but in my department there was a bullying culture."
bad,"I was a contract employee at Boeing. I was hired and placed by an outsourcing company ""Appian Infotech"". "
bad,"If backstabbing, lying managers and ""teammates"", constant last minute ""required overtime"", unrealistic production goals and extremely poor management is what you're looking for, then this is right up your alley! Its pretty bad when long term employees (10+ years) are saying that this company feels like slave labor. They preach a ""One Boeing"" culture but realistically is anything BUT that. The hardest part of the job is finding the motivation to even go into work, the most enjoyable part is clocking out!"
bad,"If you are working for boeing, know that you can get laid off at any time. People are afraid to come in as that day may be their last. If you are hired then know your salary WILL NOT increase much over the next few years even if you take multiple jobs internally. Management is weak with almost no communication."
bad,The attitude most longterm employees have is very negative. The management at the floor level does what the upper management tells them even if it place employees in an unsafe circumstances. Their is no clear procedures for doing work tasks and people are expected to work without the proper tools or resources and training. If your considering working for Bowing I will tell you to stay clear of that place unless you want to go insane.
bad,"Evangelical coworkers make up stuff to get rid of the Jewish contractors"
bad,Systems are behind the times. Lack of flexible work schedule and opportunity to work remotely. Training opportunities are limited for older employees.
bad,This company expects you to work overtime and weekends with no remorse. One man even died at his desk from stress at the Long Beach location after turning in a proposal. Also in the Commercial Sector if you are from California they will treat you terribly and if you anger a director they will find a way to make you leave.
bad,"The work group has far too much work for the number of employees to do it, and frontline management puts a lot of pressure on employees to ""do whatever it takes"" to complete it.  Frontline management is not supportive of employees.  Opportunities for advancement are limited.  Compensation and benefits are not competitive in the marketplace."
bad,As a contractor there was little hope of becoming a permanent employee. Culture is very traditional. Not flexible. I worked in a top secret environment.
bad,"Boeing has the resources to progress but is challenged with outdated program management. "
bad,management is so busy jockeying for position that do not have a clue  what anyone is working on.  There is so much inequity about who gets to do what and when.  Some people got to travel or work from home whereas others did not.  The workload is not evenly distributed amongst workers since management doesn't really know what anyone is doing day in and day out.
bad,"There is so much potential working for Boeing. Such amazing products, and innovation. Sadly, their leadership treats employees like furniture. They can be moved without notice, discarded, trampled on. They move jobs and not people. They have substandard compensation and benefits. It's unfortunate."
bad,"If you're an HR Professional, and you get offered a job as an HR Coordinator with Boeing, DON'T take it!  You'll never be promoted to or considered for an HR Generalist position. They don't promote HR Coordinators into generalist roles.  I came to the organization with a PHR and years of experience.  I finally had to leave to get paid what I'm worth and to do work that I enjoy."
bad,"Boeing is neither good nor bad, evil or holy. What you have to understand in the aerospace industry in general is that it is a very old school environment. Unfortunately, I have to say, don't get into the aerospace industry if you lean towards the progressive side. What the silicon valley tech industry is to liberals is what the aerospace industry is to conservatives. That doesn't, make it good or bad, but you have to understand that if you're not a good fit for that culture things are going to be very difficult for you. YOU WILL NOT ADVANCE AS FAR IN YOUR CAREER IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE BEING YOURSELF. If you're a left leaning person who is very smart and you're focused on engineering and technology I highly recommend staying away from Boeing and trying to go into tech (Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc). It doesn't matter what your major is; electrical, mechanical, even aerospace engineering, learn some coding and go to tech. Boeing is VERY old school. (THIS IS A REAL REVIEW - NOT BASHING BOEING BUT ALSO NOT SAYING IT'S AMAZING LIKE WORKING IN HEAVEN). This is an actual honest assessment from an engineer with ten years of experience at Boeing. For certain types of people it's really not a good idea long term. You'll watch your friends achieve more and be seen as leaders in other industries where they feel more comfortable."
bad,Too many layers of management. No opportunity for advancement. Lack of care by management to do any performance management with employees.  A check the box activity.
bad,"Lack of advancement. Many employees at the San Antonio site are not qualified to perform their duties and there is a general lack of ethical business practices even though the ""company"" preaches and everyone signs annual ethical work statements."
bad,If you start in a heavy duty position at 40 years old count on being injured due to the lack of concern from management about ergonomic work fixtures.
bad,They are too much about numbers and rushing into things before actually figuring it out. Everything in the company is a numbers game. Don't make enough money to live comfortably until after 6 years.
bad,"a typical day at work -"
bad,I worked a lot of free overtime and still got laid-off.  The work environment was very stressful and fast-paced.  My manager did not understand the details of the tasks nor the technical aspects.  He relied on other people's opinions without forming his own.
bad,"I worked at Boeing full-time (More than a year)"
bad,"Boeing in the Seattle area is downsizing in engineering.  There have been layoffs.  Understandably morale has suffered."
bad,I would not be interested in working there again. They take a different approach to patient care than is customary in a healthcare environment.
bad,They only want their look a like and folks that would support them whether (THEY) management are wrong or right. Love to use work force reduction as an excuse to promote there friends
bad,I have worked for this company twice. Both times management worked hard to make employees suffer at all times. What do you say about a Company that lets one of it's senior Mgt. state on a national program that he wants his employees to COWER on national television.
bad,"Company is very much pointed towards males to grow within the company. If you are female, you will be given the grunt work and will never be rewarded."
bad,"Worked for this company for six years. Management and safety practices are poor. Upper management constantly violating policy and forcing employees to do unauthorized work. A good company to work for, IF you know someone higher up. Otherwise, enjoy working your life away. Little to no advancement. Forced to work 10-12 hour shifts daily. Sometimes for 3 months straight (no days off..including weekends)."
bad,There is no such thing as job security at Boeing... Most people who have been there over a decade have been laid off at least once. The stress of always waiting to receive that layoff notice isn't worth the pay.
bad,"My job of giving tours was great.  I was good at it and enjoyed the process.  I learned an immense amount about building the planes. Most customers would say ""You really love what you do, don't you!""  However, the management style was police state and bully mentality.  I met some great employees outside of my work group. That is who I represented.  My daily situation inside the annexed office was stressful and full of malice.  Contractors and coworkers being managed seperately with challenges of emotional intelligence.  My manager's style was to build clicks and fear of losing one's job.  He had grudges and history with original Boeing employees and tour guides and Obviously projected that on to me.  I have lost my job because I was good at it , honest and fair."
bad,"Extremely poor senior Management, always in survival mode, no forward thinking, and very clannish (Most senior managers are leftovers from the Rockwell era).They constantly preach the Boeing standards for values, but often bend the rules as it suits them. Lots of Nepotism, and advancement based on it. It is a local company with a national, and global appearance only. The facility is run by those who have personal interests In keeping there jobs and the jobs of friends and family, not on hard work or merit by individuals."
bad,"I worked here when I was 18. I don't remember much besides poor working conditions, brutal heat, and overly competitive employees."
bad,"Unless you work in factory floor/engineering environments, most likely the corporate/office locations will involve a lot of back talk, and long email chains with blame game being thrown around."
bad,management is so tied up in meetings they hold very little accountability to personnel on the team which allows for under-preformers  to slip through and burden the excited over achievers with their incomplete jobs. additionally overachieving is not recognized fairly but has a tier base for raises that top out at .60 a year however if you surpass expectations you can not surpass the .60 raise that other people who simply achieve expectations and nothing more get. you are simply a number a pawn that can be replaced or moved to a different section without you being asked an opinion.
bad,"The job wasn't hard. What was hard was dealing with the engineers and numerous people that oversea every aspect of the production process, each with a different opinion on how things should be done. There are many veterans that work here, but discrimination  against disabilities is still a concern Very stressful and hostile environment."
bad,"They took away QA jobs throughout Boeing which created stressful work environments, ultimately leading people in getting corrective actions and in some situations discharged from the company. They changed their corrective actions policy which made it easier for them to fire people for mistakes that couldve been prevented by the company. The Union doesnt even fight hard enough anymore either!"
bad,The culture and sense of direction has taken a turn for the worse now that Boeing management has completely taken over Jeppesen.  Domain knowledge used to be valued and is now seen as irrelevant thru outsourcing or giving up operations as a priority.
bad,"30 year employee. Just retired. I spent 30 years in body structures. It was very demanding and very hard/physical work. Designated to work 24/7 365 a year. Management sucks. The company holds nobody except for a few accountable. Those are the ones with a true work ethic. There really is a reason its called the Lazy B. People really can come in to the work area, sit or wander and do nothing. You complain to management and their tried and true response is that there's nothing we can do. Now don't get me wrong as it sounds as if i'm a little bitter. I'm not. I had some wonderful great life/work experiences there. Yet the day i hit the ""Button"" and drove off, lets just say it truly was a heavy weight lifted from my back. I don't miss it at all. So in short if your a hard worker with a strong work ethic, this place is for you. If your a lazy worker looking for a free ride with no work ethic, this place is a dream job for you. Enjoy. Signed former employee."
bad,"The work was just what I thought it would be, when you are able to do it.  Constant roadblocks that pop up everyday and prevent the work from being accomplished.  Management changes like the weather.  Not paid by experience, new hires make more than employees with years of experience on the particular program.  Employee input is never taken into consideration even though it is asked for on a daily basis."
bad,"Pay is good, benefits are good, and yes, there are some fabulous people at Boeing. However! There are also TOO MANY of those you go home every night thinking ""How do you even have a job?!?!?!""  Expect to get laid off, more than one time as your job is not secure. Ever. Expect to work overtime a bunch, and probably not see your family as much as you should. Lots of Divorces happen at Boeing. There is ZERO work/life balance. Don't work too hard either, or you'll just be made to work more and more and more. But that's OK, because you are nothing but a number."
bad,many things wrong with the company. no future there. the rules do not apply to everyone. managers play favorites and they make it known if you are not one of them.
bad,"Overall - a family friendly, but old school and very, very stubborn company to work for. Backwards ways of running the business and draconian management structure."
bad,After 17 years I was laid off. The people I worked with are the best in the aviation industry. The upper management changed too much. The production needed changed too much and they did not seem to care for their McDonald Douglas legacy employees.
bad,"My unit was involved in the testing of installed wiring bundles on new 787 aircraft in Charleston, SC from 2011-to 2012. This work was good - aside from the schedule."
bad,"The glass ceiling is very much in place and only those who do not have original thoughts will do well there. They churn through MBA's until they are burnt out and go elsewhere. Many people have recently left Boeing for Amazon. That tells you something. Boeing gets rid of the older workers no matter how good they are at their jobs. They keep managers in coveted positions that are terrible people and play favorites. As long as you kiss up to your managers, you will do well there."
bad,Managers do not know how to treat the employers.  My manager only nice to her friends. She was not a manager that is fair. She took side with her friends
bad,"A typical day started at 5:00 am, had to punch a time clock, I would come to work at least 15 minutes early each day, then I was 12 minutes late one day because of a flat tire and was docked for 30 minutes. Constantly worked overtime."
bad,"Building airplanes is a cool thing to do. But the management there will make you hate working there. There’s no consistency in the way management enforces the rules and regulations. The good ol boy network is in place. They are firing people for bogus reasons. Management makes horrible decisions and the mechanics have to shoulder the load of these decisions. Many of the employees there are looking for other employment. They need a union tho help offset the overwhelming power that management has. If you get on a manager’s bad side, you are targeted. It’s obvious to everyone and there’s nothing you can do. HR is no help to the employees because its like they’re the union reps for management."
bad,Boeing ATM was a short lived company meant to help air traffic control and management organizations with updates and coordinate Boeing airplane updates to fit more airplanes in the sky safely.  It failed due to a lack of product and leadership.
bad,"out of a team of 10 people, one or two are expected to do all the work, as all others volunteer to join committees and are gone to meetings all day. the quality inspection is a joke, each one contradicts the previous inspector when called. the facilities are worse then a rest stop, the walls are graffiti strewn and the break area is over priced and far away from the work. don't apply if you don't like heights."
bad,"Not the best place to you work if you are looking for a good strong team environment. Majority of senior level management are most focused on pushing their own agenda even if its not what's best for the team. As a mechanic don't look to move up to the next level of you career. You are not provided the same ability as people who sit at desk all day. The company with take, take, take everything they can from you with little reward."
bad,while I choose not to give a in depth review right now there is a culture change at this employer starting in 2016 that makes this a stress full work environment.
bad,"Many hardworking, dedicated employees. Benefits package took a heavy hit in the later years. Work life balance is not in alignment with a healthy lifestyle."
bad,"Management was about how many jobs you could sell.  You where asked to work long hours and they didn't like when you had to take any time off for home life. Some managers where good, but upper management didn't care about the workers, or family lives."
bad,"Leaders are stuck in their own ways, processes are not lean, culture is not compatible with young, motivated individuals. You have to be here for years to move up."
bad,"Boeing used to be a good place to work, however over years it has taken a turn for the worse. "
bad,It's not an engineering company anymore. The management only cares about their money but not employee. No job secure. Waste young talented people. Will collapse soon.
bad,"lots of opportunities for lean, way to much support in place with no set expectations. Senior leadership does not support first line production. No plan in place to replace mechanics due to normal attrition."
bad,"9 years of reductions in a row and they wonder why morale is low?"
bad,"The department I was in had the worst management ever. Those who performed well on their first assignments were transferred to another manager without a choice. That new job required 15 - 30 hours of unpaid overtime each week for months on end. The promise was always made, ""Later it will get better, we need you and a few others to help us through a tight spot."" A tight spot that the managers created."
bad,"Culture has changed a lot. It used to be a company with high standards, high engineering understanding. Now, the standards and the priorities are based on sales and it is a company focusing in ""cookie cutters"". Managers are trying to drive the design and the production while the engineers are blindly following these orders. The morale is defeated and the engineering quality is poor and comparable to Ikea assembly kits with the same bad instructions. "
bad,Boeing has grown so large that it is difficult to truly be innovative and adaptive the current market. I consider you to be successful if you can get 10% return in results of 100% effort.
bad,they are fast becoming the Walmart of airplanes and are taking everything they can away from the employees. if it keeps going in that direction you will be just as well to work for McDonalds.
bad,"A lot of better companies to work for out there in the Philadelphia area.  HR is non existent and management can do whatever they want.  Performance reviews are a check in the box and there is no diversity at the management level.  If you want a job and a pay check, no issues but if you want a career, it's a waste of time to work at Boeing.  There is no proper training and you are left to figure things out on your own.  The leads are leads because they have been with the company for 15+ years and not because they are competent to do the job. If you are in the ""in"" club, you will progress even if you have no skills but if you are not in the ""in"" club, no matter how hard you work or are technically competent, you will get one excuse after another for a low performance rating."
bad,"Boeing used to be a very employee orientated company, they took care of people.  That has changed due to the fact that Boeing is only focused on profit now."
bad,"Great place to work if you aren't a family person. The money was average, but the constant mandatory overtime is a family killer."
bad,"*  ""It's not what you know, it's who you know"".  "
bad,"various different tasks of the Data Management arena."
bad,"Hard to advance, a lot of old timers..."
bad,"Typical Day: Being lectured on how the higher ups are putting pressure on  the project and being asked to work weekends. My typical day included documenting test procedures. There was very poor/non existent documentation on how the software could be tested, and when developers were asked how to test their software, a lot of the time, they did not know."
bad,"In the beginning they care about you‼️The a new flavor of the month comes along!"
bad,"Favoritism runs rampant. Its not what you know, or what you can do. Its who you know. So many hard working, good people are overlooked, and not given what they deserve. Such unfair treatment. Unstable management on ALL levels. I averaged 3-5 different managers per year, while employed during my 10 years there. Only twice during my entire tenure did I have the same manager for an entire year.  With so many different managers it is impossible to get a fair yearly pay raise review. They ""copy and paste"" managers from different organizations that know very little about their new management job/organization. Since management does not know the job, they do not know what their employees can do. Management only knows what their employees can do by word of mouth, whether it is true or untrue as told by peers. Its VERY rare that you have a manager start at entry level, doing what a new employee would do, and work their way up from the bottom to the top of the SAME work organization. Employee developing and coaching is nonexistent. Leadership provides no motivation and does not lead by example. Nobody is held accountable here. There is no discipline enforced. This has created a lazy and careless work environment that is contagious to new hires. There are too many obvious miserable employees working here, and that is contagious to ALL employees. Now they have started back with a shift preference. Longer tenured employees can change to their desired shift preference by their lower employee number. These changes affect ""on the floor working employees"" for the whole site, and changes too many"
bad,"Management does very little to aid production. The union says ALL employees should be treated fairly, so if one manager doesn't understand how to document slackers, then the entire factory goofs off so they can get behind and be paid extra on overtime to make it up. Some workers have a life and don't want to be told on Friday at lunch that they have mandatory weekend work. If you have plans for your kid's birthday on Saturday, you have to take Friday as PTO just in case. It's a ridiculous system."
bad,Management will grind you down to nothing. Why do you want me to write about a company that didn't care about my life at all? I was just a target for another score.
bad,The company is run in an inefficient and disjointed manner.   There is far too much bureaucracy and a lack of transparency Career mobility is limited.
bad,"In the last 2-3 years at Boeing, I was extremely unhappy.  The management started to care much more about the bottom line & shareholder value and significantly less about the employees doing the work.  At this point, I would not recommend that anyone obtain a job at Boeing."
bad,"Love the assembler job. Pays well."
bad,Just hard work with no reward. Worked as a contractor with little direction.  All of my ideas were ignored and the promise of a future position within the company was rescinded.
bad,"Terrible leaders are protected at all costs.  Unethical behavior is covered up.  Despite the messaging of their expensive marketing, employees are often treated like a cost to the company - expertise is traded for cheap labor on an annual basis."
bad,"typical day was o k. tooling was normally readily available.leaders however,were questionable at best.normally not in a leadership position by being the best qualified."
bad,The company does not value independent thought or values.  Management teams (I was part of many) are very clickish and if you don't have the same political views you will be eliminated.
bad,"I spend a majority of my day starring at my PC monitor. I am required to watch 2 webpages for updates, then when they do, I am to read the update and respond. Its a lot like being a fireman - lots of waiting for something bad to happen, then when it does, fix it. It's very boring and I have spent a large amount of time surfing the company intranet looking for online classes to take - I have taken a majority of them."
bad,"-The top managers in various areas were bullies and demeaning to those who did not agree. "
bad,"work culture was ok"
bad,Company pays high but treats employees with disrespect to the point that the benefits are not worth the stress and disrespect. Very bad management. No trust in employees.
bad,"The Boeing company, in my experience, is one of those companies you hear stereotyped as the ""two-faced"" leadership style. You can never seem to trust anything that doesn't have a follow-able paper trail."
bad,"Working 12 to 14 hours a day 7 days a week with a lot of time wasted."
bad,"It truly is the people who make the workplace here bearable. Without them, without the friendships that are built, this place will rob you of your time, your energy, your motivation and never blink twice about it. This company preaches work-life balance, but does nothing to back it up. As a new employee you will start on nights and only if you're really lucky will you make it to days in the first 5 years. For 7 years now I've been on nights, getting moved around constantly and haven't made it to days. My family is a thing that only exists on weekends and even then only if they dont force me to work that weekend, which they do, regularly. This place is a drain that traps you with great pay and benefits for no education and experience, and then wrings you dry."
bad,It had its ups and downs.. when you were trying to move out of a area they wouldn’t let you unless of certain reason which was unfair. Managers really didn’t understand certain situations or can even help you with certain situations
bad,"Boeing does not foster teamwork or individual/professional growth. The management structure is less than to be desired. Without a clear vision, it seemed as if you were working in circles without seeing any positive outcome or results. Transparency between management and shop floor is next to none. If you don't have thick skin, Boeing will chew you up and spit you out. With that said, the compensation packages are excellent."
bad,Boeing has a poor culture in recognizing and rewarding performance. Promotions mainly depend on who you know otherwise it is based on time with the company rather than contribution. On the flip side poor performance goes unnoticed as well. Depending on your career path this could be good or bad. I would recommend Boeing to those who are nearing retirement for the health benefits and slow paced environment. I would not recommend it to those just starting their careers as the lack of advancement opportunities could handicap future growth.
bad,"I hope the place survives the transition they are driving. The tactics to get there are vindictive and cut throat, and continual harrassment. It used to be a great place, not any longer."
bad,Too many hoops to jump through make a career advancement nearly impossible. Shamed upon for taking time off work. Threatened that we as mechanics can be replaced in a matter of minutes. Managers are looking for any way to cut head count.
bad,Not alot of room for advancement without a bachelor's.  No mentors to help get you where you want. Everyone is concerned about themselves. No teamwork and noone goes above and beyond and won't do anything outside of there job code
bad,Needs improvement for employee retention and EQUAL advancement opportunities. The changes that are being made are not sufficient to address underlying issues
bad,"My typical day at work consists of arriving at the location and staring my job. I have learned a tremendous amount about the manufacturing of airplanes and tooling to facilitate that. The culture unfortunately is very cut throat, with the opportunity to be passed over for advancement very easily due to who you are and who you know. Management just does what they are told and not what is actually beneficial to the build. That is depending on how long you actually keep a manager. But there are some great managers there but once they buck the system or stand up for an employee they get moved. The hardest part of my job is watching what it was turn into what it is now. The best part of my job is the mechanics that I work with and building a technological wonder of an airplane. I have so much pride seeing these fly overhead and saying I helped put that in the sky."
bad,"It is a wonder that this company makes any money. The level of bureaucracy rivals anything that you experience when dealing with the federal government. Managers are not allowed to manage, they cower to whatever edict comes down from above. The rank and file have very little input."
bad,"You come on as a contractor with ""promise"" of becoming a Boeing employee, but this is not guaranteed. As a contractor, you do not receive any benefits or paid time off. The pay is less than a Boeing employee as well because the contracting company takes 20-25% of your paycheck."
bad,Good coworkers and poor management. Workers don't trust their managers because of their incoherent stances on programs. They tend to flip flop and have no coherent strategic focus.
bad,"Boeing has the potential to be an incredible company. Lack of focus and accountability in mgmt. has led to rampant ineptitude. Much of mgmt. ""got lucky"" and lack merit for their promotion. Mgmt doesn't want to hear any perspective that is remotely negative. If you share it you are labelled as a negative person and mgmt. shrugs their shoulders saying ""that's just the way things are, we can't change."" "
bad,worked there for 9 years and learned a lot from coworkers; as I gain more experience I got more responsibility and that deter me from growing and developing.  Management will do anything to keep you underperforming during your reviews regardless of what you do.  it was impossible to succeed with the amount of work and demand required by your job and customers. I was supporting 700 engineers and would not assign more help even if they needed more support. Morale was low across the company so I was given the option to resign so I did. I just did not see myself doing and staying in that environment with out any growth and opportunities.  talked to several coworkers and they wanted to resign but could not do it for one reason or another.  Boeing was great to work for in past generations but now it's not the place to be as they become more lean do to competition.  in the mean time the increase of benefits do not out weight the negatives and I think it will hurt the company in the long run.
bad,"Boeing used to be a great place to work. Over the years, they became greedy and fail to understand how their lack of caring for their employees, is what's letting AIRBUS compete with them so."
bad,"Poor management style they want to bully employees, harass them for using earned benefits, all about their management bonus and schedule not about employees or recognition. They are killing morale and making good employees leave the company, they are also forcing older employees our so they can bring in less expensive millennial help, well you get what you pay for."
bad,"No peace and harmony with this company. "
bad,"Suffocating management styles in combination with relentless cutbacks for the last several years has made Boeing a shell of what it once was. Things may turn around, but for now, these is little room for innovation/creativity or career advancement. The company pays well and it is easy to get complacent because the jobs are very easy and unless there are layoffs, you have a be a complete buffoon to get fired. Since they are going through various cycles of layoffs, I can only recommend you apply if all you want to do in life is help build airplanes. You going to need some intense passion for the industry to really enjoy it."
bad,"Boeing used to be the cream of the crop, now it is almost the bottom of the barrel.  It is like working in a geriatrics unit.  Everyone is older and cranky.  They complain about the good old times, but do noting to better the current situation.  Equipment is old and needs major updates that do not happen because there is no money to do it.  All aspects of your job are micromanaged by managers that have no idea what our job is or how to do it.  Due to lack of mental stimulation everyone is back biting and causing drama."
bad,"I saw some terrible behaviour from management in regards to bullying and harassment. Complaints were made to HR but nothing happened. There was a re-org and these people responsible were rewarded with promotion. "
bad,"Boeing is a great place to work. I worked with great people for 20 years doing systems design, reliability, safety, service and customer engineering ."
bad,"Unfortunately The Boeing plant in South Carolina has a long way to go as far as taking care of their employees.  The benefits are great, but the workplace environment is terrible.  The management at this particular plant is a disaster!!"
bad,"We were part of a small crew loaned to a different branch of Boeing with a large project."
bad,"boeing is not the place it was when I started in the late 1980s.  many features from pay and benefits to working conditions that made it a special place to work have faded.  the pressure to please wall street with dividends and buy backs mean bathrooms aren't cleaned or provisioned with soap and toilet paper.  executives are out of touch while their compensation soars.  they spout platitudes about safety while lower level managers develop fetishes such as having everyone in an organization work the same hours in the same location, forcing some to endure extremely long, hazardous commutes. outsourcing and offshoring are similar fetishes adopted for cost reasons and wind up being more expensive in the long run because of poor quality and rework.  while we have copious management, leadership is scarce.  what is left is the quality of coworkers struggling in these circumstances.  most people are decent, some try to do a good job, but many give up and do enough to go along and support their families.  there are many opportunities for improvement as well as bureaucracy with a vested interest to preserve the status quo."
bad,"I Test systems of the 787 aircraft, Troubleshoot and fix issues of failed test. I learned a lot of technical systems integrated on the aircraft. Management is a big downfall of Boeing. Their bad decisions ultimately affect Test and Mechanics on the floor. The place is overly micro-managed."
bad,I worked there for almost 5 years and every year got a little worse.  The management is terrible.  No matter how hard you work it still is not good enough.  I have seen tons of people work towards advancement only to get denied because the management had a brother or niece or buddy who wanted to job.  The parking is bad as well you have to park offsite and be shuttled in to your job.
bad,"I have no real knowledge about the company itself because I am a contractor and although we work just as hard, and often harder than the permanent employees, we do not receive the same benefits.  Politics are tough in this company."
bad,"It was the worst place I have ever worked, though the pay and benefits were nice but does not balance out the rest. "
bad,"I worked for this Boeing for over 23 years.  I worked in Kansas and in Washington states.  I worked with Boeing employees from all other states and Boeing suppliers and customers.  So my feedback includes their experiences as well.  Boeing thrives on great innovative products most were developed in 60's, 70's 80's.  Boeing has been developing derivatives of those airplanes ever since.  Exceptions include radical new designs like 787.  Which as every one knows turned out to be an engineering and business nightmare.  Extremely high costs, delays due to poor management and decisions of outsourcing.  But I am proud of the resiliency and inginuity of the Boeing engineers who finally pulled it through.  And may be some day this airplane will make profit if Airbus does not catch up and beat Boeing by making a better and cheaper airplane."
bad,Too much management who care nothing about your life outside of Boeing; they spend too much on getting blood from a turnip and can easily get burnt out. Too much nepotism and backstabbing going on - its a more of a me than a we (team) effort to get the job done.  I was asked to do some unethical things by my manager and I was the one who got dismissed!
bad,"A typical day at Boeing would be working with many fine people. Boeing is going through a transition of out with the older workers and in with the younger.The downside is when layoff are going on, there can be a lot of unneeded turmoil and strife with in the company."
bad,"Nepotism prevails.  Advancement depends on being in the circle, otherwise it does not happen.  Management does not care about employee morale."
bad,"The daily work was gratifying and rewarding.  However, there was no on-site management to monitor worker’s daily conduct and behavior.  Co-Worker’s therefore created their own sub-culture of inappropriate behavior and conduct."
bad,"System Engineer"
bad,"All I can write a review about is the commercial side of Boeing. The work is fairly easy, but the simplest jobs are overcomplicated and time consuming w/ paperwork. My managers that I have had were all really great people to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people I get to work with or around are friendly and ready to help you when ever you need it."
bad,"I started at this company in the late 80's, and at the good management left, the new team has been ruining it since surprised the planes get built."
bad,Office Working conditions are located in manufacturing facility.  Office workers have good communicative contact with floor personnel.
bad,"After working for two other directors, I had the misfortune of working for a new off the street hired Director of culture differences."
bad,just a number at the company only thing good was pay and benefits
bad,"San Antonio is considered a lean manufacturing location; however, I am the only one working in an area designated for four individuals.  Excessive overtime and reactive emergent activities with quick turnarounds are the norm--not the exception."
bad,You do a lot of work where projects are initiated with no commitments from process owners. You also perform significant amounts of non-value added tasks that will never be used or analyzed.
bad,"The Refurbishment side of the coin in San Antonio was disorganized and ill-planned. The workers were made to feel unimportant and as such, made to feel as second-class citizens."
bad,"Working To engineering drawings.New projects,things are always changing."
bad,category management for sourcing and contracting of non production items in the hundreds of millions of dollars per category
bad,"Benefits are good, salaries are low. Vacation time is stingy for new people (10 days). They don't expect much of you."
bad,management is horrible and racism is high. if you are not a favorite you will not advance at all.
bad,"The schedule is King. Be prepared to be rushed and guilt-tripped for using company paid time off benefit. Also, be prepared to be in whatever position you get assigned to for years unless you're terrible at your job."
bad,"Relaxed place to work. If you work hard and do a good job they will reward you by making you do someone else's job making half of their money. A raise outside of contract wont happen either. ""No raise to a union employee outside of contractual raises (.05cents every 6 months)""  so it will take you about 15 years to get to top of scale. So if you don't plan on advancing in money then this is the place for you."
bad,"I would never go back because of the way they laid us off, they basically called us off of the aircraft and walked us too the security guard and said can we have your badge please then escorted us off of the premises"

bad,Boeing is serious about safety and work surfaces. Was a great company to work for but I was in a contract with them.Wish the contract lasted longer and I got to be a boeing employee.
bad,Bottom line is all important. Safety is shoved aside. Managers will fudge employee reviews to get rid Of older workers right before retirement to save money. Culture has gotten worse over the years. Was a good place to work but now it is a toxic environment. Internal slogan was always family first but that is simply not true. Business always came first.
bad,"Just was laid off from Boeing in the IT Group (DBA). There never was any word of layoffs, as there was plenty of work that needed to be done. Immediate Lead DBA was extremely unprofessional and condescending!"
bad,"Boeing's existing culture tended to be top-heavy, with marginal opportunities for advancement. You could pay a price for looking at other opportunities outside your department."
bad,"Being in Alabama, and it being a Union job, it is sort of an odd mix of things. The management is pretty aloof and run around with spreadsheets barking and the hourly union folks don't really want to get it done and do the bare minimum. "
bad,"There is a lot of politics at this company, very little room for advancement, and the culture is extremely hierarchical. You can receive a graduate degree, and they don't recognize you. Everyone at the company gets a bonus based on how the company does - not how they perform. They're not good for millennials at all."
bad,"HR at Boeing is an ineffective, highly political organization with leadership that either comes from non-hr backgrounds such as Finance or Engineering. The lack of leadership relegates HR to being a secondary function to other functions such as finance and has created a bureaucratic leadership team rather than a team that has a coherent vision of modern HR."
bad,"There was a lot of over-time with out pay, no job training or preparation, and politics. It felt like a dog-eat-dog world in the Marketing culture and no teamwork ethics."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend, based on low-mid management unable to make decisions when presented with options and treating staff poorly.  Staff don't get promoted within a project, have to jump to different projects.  A lot of work is doing configuration and installing third-party software. Not much creation. Slow administrative pipelines"
bad,"What you come in to Boeing making you will be at until you leave (other than cost of living adjustments and the rare occasion of a promotion, a promotion Grants you around 3K)."
bad,"In general Boeing is a great place to work.  The majority of people who work here are pleasent and are there to help.  There are a ton of jobs to move to if you are un-happy with your current one.  Good benefits with a good 401K package and dental and health.  However, what has been happening in the past few years?  With all the good, there is a whole lot of bad.  No matter how you look at it, at the end of the day you are just a number.  You can and most likley will be disposed of at one point in your Boeing career.  The benefits are good but with each new contract they are getting worse and worse.  There are oppertnunities to move upward.  However, its difficult with how everything is structured.  Your individual contribution is measured on a team level not at the individual level.  The pay is good, but even that too has taken a setback with the latest contract negotiations.  In all, the company that I was hired into in 2011, in relation to benefits and pay, is no where near the same company that exists now in 2018.  If you are looking for a fun, innovative, and exciting place to work.  Boeing is most likely not for you.  If you enjoy bureaucracy and everything that goes with it, then this is the place for you."
bad,"They have emphasized to have efficiency of the work but they did not have attitude to change or improve the present situation and stay with lots of insufficient process and rules which slow down the decision power and loosing the reliability as the company.   In addition, they may be good to follow the very limited rules and do not know the overall pictures and flow of the business.   i was surprised at their lack of knowledge of the entire business flow and international practice between countries.   In addition, they do not spend the time and money to teach the employees about the view and practices of the efficient practices of the business world outside."
bad,"Big corporate company's like Boeing your just a number and when you number comes up your gone. People dont care about the product, just a paycheck...."
bad,"Company does not use it resources wisely. favorites, Who you Know versus what you know. Just get the job done. Any mistake can lead to you loosing your job. Fear tactics."
bad,"Interesting place to work, education is a great benefit, relocation not available, can become stuck in one job classification, transferring of ones job skills and tasks, not easy."
bad,"Outsourcing and axing of experienced workers has become the norm; slicing the knowledge base to reduce payroll costs. It's a death spiral that not fun to watch,"
bad,"As a contract worker, you serve at the whim of Boeing.  It's not bad it's just secure as a contractor.  I felt they had an age bias because I and several temp workers over 50 were not retained and the younger temp workers were kept."
bad,"This is a company who if you love to work all kinds of crazy hours not get any kind of advancement unless your a minority, then this is the place for you."
bad,management has self-serving goals. Primarily focused on short term goals that advance their own careers. Culture of job insecurity results in cut-throat adversarial relationship between employees.
bad,The job was quite satisfying until they brought on some new managers.  My new manager was terrible.  She had no experience in management and was described by many as clueless.  I felt singled out and harassed. After several months I resigned.
bad,It's a easy job but stressful no chance too move up in the work place u don't get treated fair and manager don't do anything or help u with things u need to perform your job and it's a place morale is down
bad,"Boeing bought a local company c. 2001 with 100 employees and built it up to ~365 or so by 2010.  Now there are ~80 employees at this site and the workspace itself has been chopped down to a fraction of its original size (recent reduction may have gotten rid of the echo, though).  My fellow employees are great:  smart and hard-working.  The managers get stupid pretty quickly as you go up the org chart, though.  The company does not seem to trust the employees, so, for example, there is no petty-cash system for ANYTHING, sharp objects are more-or-less forbidden, etc.  All of this makes it a huge struggle to get work done, because you're screwed (sorry) if you need a bit of hardware (and don't want to buy it yourself) and regular orders take forever.  Boeing is trying to move its work to the southeast to save money.  No one will officially say it out loud, but the time remaining for the ABQ site is limited.  Work for Boeing in Charleston, SC, or Huntsville, Alabama, or St. Louis, MO, if you want, but a job in ABQ is not a good long-term bet."
bad,"the most first level managers are young people, and a lot  of them lock the technical advance ability, therefore, they choce to management path. If you had a bad luck,  and you might meet a manager who doesn't know about technical staff, but know how to play the game with his (her) boss."
bad,"Very, very prejudice, favoritism, back biting, they aren't willing to properly train new hires,the company is known for nepotism.The management is very deceptive."
bad,"The management has a lot to be desired. The last few years that I was there, most of the managers were inexperienced in the process of the airplane build & managing people. I learned something new everyday which was the best part of the job. Going into work in the last few years was the hardest part of the job.The work day was sometimes very busy, other times very slow. Some people were not very team orientated & did not do tasks at the end of the day, like clean-up."" FOD it's a matter of Pride!""."
bad,"the summary says it all. not all managers are on the same page, no training for any job you are moved into, constant squabbling between shifts, no accountability for your time working, no goals, no expectations. Boring."
bad,"I work as Chief of Staff  in the Learning and Development organization. My organization is responsible for creating learning solutions that impact the entire ~166,000 employees around the globe. The work itself if very rewarding."
bad,"The overall pay structure was laid out and up front from the beginning and was very fair.  The environment was the difficult part.  Coming to work everyday became a chore.  If there were employee issues there was no resolve; they painted the picture of such an easy process if there was a problem but ultimately they had procedures in place to protect 'their' people.  It's hard to say exactly who 'their' people were but there was definitely a loyalty in some groups."
bad,The majority of management  has never worked on the production floor so they lack the knowledge of aircraft production and what it actually takes. They take people away from each shop and assign more work to the Mechanics whom are left which creates injuries and bad morale.
bad,I think Boeing is struggling financially and unsure how they will keep market share and reduce costs. I think their current approach takes the power away from those that can make the most improvements and that is the workers themselves.
bad,"Used to be more friendly and family oriented, now it is just about the stock price. You can't trust anyone there. Maybe it is just the Philadelphia location but I doubt it."
bad,"Boeing has often done layoffs during economic hardships and here we are AGAIN.  I would think that Boeing would gather lessons learned from the past and utilize them so we don't have to keep going through layoffs. Management can't often figure out what they want or get on the same page so there are a lot of delays and re-work to projects which ends up having teams feel that they aren't accomplishing anything significant.  Yet, Boeing is at a crossroads where they NEED to move faster.  Management needs to change!"
bad,IBM has a contract with Boeing.  We moved their equipment thru out the facility.  Work environment was OK but office is Long Beach is close now.
bad,"I would like to further my career within a smaller business to make more of an imprint; be a part of a more thriving work culture, and be offered a more competitive benefits package."
bad,"not good. the management need to be way better. Lack of accountability at higher levels, but the same is expected of the manufacturing personnel."
bad,"Made travel reservations for 26 staff members.  Scheduled offsite meetings, conferences, internal and external weekly telcons.  Greeted vistors and directed them to the various locations."
bad,"That title was an often repeated quote from executive management that explained the whole situation Boeing IT is in.  They don't retain young employees because they're stuck in an era when aerospace and health care were the only industries that needed IT.  Half my (repeatedly RIF decimated) team were COBOL/mainframe programmers.  The morale was hilariously bad.  And the pay was barely average even by their own pitifully skewed calculation."
bad,"Boeing is a great place to work as long as the non-management employee is a non-thinking, non-opinionated drone and is happy with that. Management is stratified and out of touch with the labor force. The Boeing culture is to positively encourage, support and reward ""leadership"". The non-management labor force are referred to as ""worker bees"", as in mindless drones."
bad,"Outsourcing, Managers ""manage people,"" not ""processes."" They are out of touch."
bad,No advancement available.  Major changes just pop up with no warning or preparation.
bad,"1.good 2.blue print reading, 3.good, 4.good   5. working 6. making money,"
bad,For me it was not pleasant due to the fact that i had to uproot my family to S.C. But Boeing is a great Company just wished i could have been hired here.
bad,"I've given Boeing multiple chances and the disappointments just continue. Throughout my time with the company, I experienced workplace bullying. Something that I never came across ever before in my many years in the work force. My mental, emotional and physical health were impacted significantly. This is not to mention that the amount of overtime that is expected of you is completely unreasonable!  I'm exhausted all around. The ""tools"" used are not adequate for such a large company. The lack of reliable and structured systems pave to continuous double, triple, quadruple amounts of work. Overall inconsistency of work. Management is weak as they are subdued to the politics that have been engraved to them. The benefits are great, but that's about it. "
bad,"Up till 10 years ago Boeing was a place where a grandfather, father and son/daughter would all work.  The culture changed to heavy micromanagement.  Employees became seen as a number and expendable.  Quality started taking a back seat to high production rates.  Employees began to burn out negatively effecting their personal lives and health.  In my own case I've hade 4 surgeries to repair worn out body parts."
bad,"Boeing offer great educational assistance, but it takes a lot of patience and hard work to advance IAM Union Mechanic to a salaried position. There is not a lot of management support on the shop floor for employees looking to move forward other than into management."
bad,"Chaotic.  The HRBP role eliminated leaving first line managers to survive unrealistic expectations from executive level."
bad,"culture is wrong everyone complains but doesn't seem to want to change, union is not there to provide better benefits but just there to receive more money depending on head count"
bad,"I worked at Boeing IT for 30 years. I left because I was forced to by a manager who was not paying attention either to the work flows in his group, nor the technical and process recommendations of his people. I was told that my performance, which had been judged wholly acceptable by my manager just 3 months prior was suddenly unacceptable. Then I was told that this unacceptable performance, had, in this manager's judgement being going on for months prior. That statement alone was an admission that he had not been paying attention, regardless of my real performance. Most of the manager's inattention is his own fault, but some is the result of demands from his boss that he focus his attention up the chain rather than on the work of his own people. Many, maybe most, of my former co-workers in IT are working under constant threat of being fired due to impossible processes imposed on them with no input allowed from them, or opportunities to improve them. Coworkers shared their fears of losing their jobs with me when I first joined the group, but I didn't believe that the problems were that bad. Obviously, these bad processes were not developed by my immediate manager, or even his manager, and none of those folks had any input into fixing the process problems either. Many of my former coworkers left before and after me. All found other jobs equal to or better, sometimes way better, than their Boeing jobs, or were eligible to retire and did so. By better jobs, I mean either higher positions, better pay, more productive working conditions, etc. I was able to find work in a new field,"
bad,They put me on a performance improvement plan and fired me. Did nothing to deserve it. All my performance reviews were good and did nothing wrong. They just didn't like me. I was quiet and kept to myself and was nice to everyone. That's all I have to say...
bad,"Executives are clueless about the day to day realities of the departments they oversee, it's like they live on another planet. They speak about goals to increase quality, decrease costs and empower employees. However, middle management is incentivized to bring in short term revenue so quality is inconsistent, costs are higher than they should be (often hidden by managers accounting tricks), and there is a lot of wasted value by preventing the best employees from contributing their maximum potential. Millions of taxpayer dollars are wasted within this bloated business."
bad,Boeing once had a great culture and put employees first. Boeing changed from an Engineering Company to a Finance Company and the culture suffered. Employees went from an asset to a line item cost item.
bad,"Boeing offers good pay and benefits package, but the management structure is poor. Blind leading the blind. "
bad,Boeing is not for younger employees. I am 23 and everybody I work with is double or triple my age. I am over worked and Boeing will not pay you your true value. They under pay and will let you know it via their job classification page
bad,"Having survived Boeing at several locations in the U.S, several times in my career, I have no desire or intention of returning, nor will or would I recommend it to anyone else, except people I don't like."
bad,Lots to learn in a short timeframe. People are friendly. 1:1 training would be helpful. Work schedules are pretty flexible. Workplace culture is pretty relaxed.
bad,Slow and focused only on problems            
bad,"As a Geospatial Analyst the pay was less than other similar companies.  When there is work, you will work a lot of OT.  When there is no work you will get laid off. That is unless you are a buddy of the incompetent manager who spends most of his time taking classes.   The reviews are based on a baloney self evaluation that results in an arbitrary number given by said clueless manager.  They can't manage to keep a steady supply of work, or really know what is going on, or how to get more work.   "
bad,"Ok place to work, highly siloed, no real room for advancement. Work is mundane, the building itself is quite old as well. Parking can be a bit of a problem."
bad,"I actually worked for Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing. As a little sister to Boeing, Jeppesen is desperately trying to find its way through the rigors of global software development for the commercial marketplace. Senior leadership has not learned how to set achievable objectives that span from the business level down to the production level. Generally speaking, I found their temperament very reactionary and unpredictable. Goals were set only to change dramatically the following quarter - no clear direction and very little consideration for the technical nature of the market they are struggling to service. Flexibility is not defined as jumping all over the map chasing customers and reacting to whims. If your products are good enough, you don't have to change with the wind."
bad,Boeing Defense & Systems was most disappointing to be part of the Supply Chain Team. Boeing St Louis exhibited poor leadership and lacked a robust management culture to enlist qualified and experience Supply Chain Analyst. My experience was premised on providing value solutions for company the St Louis culture lack the progressive spirit to drive financial improvements in support of lowering the cost to our prime customer's.
bad,"Currently the moral in my organization is very low. unrealistic schedules are driving poor judgments and short sided decisions from managers. overtime and rework are the norm."
bad,"They seriously believe they are too big to fail, and that seems to be the company's most persistent attitude. It affects how they promote to how they fail to take care of their people in the little things that make the company culture what it is."
bad,"Senior Leadership is out of touch with what is really going on. And instead of tackling the hard problems, they look for easy solutions. There is also no career advancement. You are more likely to be given additional responsibility on top of current and then never be promoted to align with the work you do."
bad,"Working for Boeing is only beneficial when it comes to the pay and benefits that are offered. Rules are inconsistent and management is a joke. I honestly felt like a zombie working for Boeing and if it wasn't for the great pay and benefits, I never would have continued working for them. The union also doesn't help employees when needed or when they do, it takes forever to get any assistance."
bad,Boeing is a large corporate company only worried about the bottom line and politics.  Management isn't held accountable and their is lack of training for your job role.  Benefits and paid time off are good.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that work at Boeing are great. "
bad,They are not working for a future in St. Louis.  They are only concerned with profit at the cost of quality of the product.  They are cutting salaries and hiring inexperienced people at lower salaries.
bad,"The company is slow and has not adapted to new technologies. The management team is in the wrong mindset, doing whatever it takes to be ""on schedule"" at the risk of doing things right/quality. Multiple managers will openly admit team members low performance but individuals are never written up/fired. Lots of no value added work and engineering by excel files and powerpoint."
bad,"Boeing is a grate place to work if you like to brown nose your way to the top. If you are there to work, mind your business, and not pretend that you know things that you have no idea about then you will never advance."
bad,"The pay and benefits are great. Otherwise, You are a number. Show up and do your job and don't expect much recognition or encouragement. This is partly to blame on apathetic upper management and low-energy culture.. Meanwhile, Lay-offs and hiring freezes happen all the time. I found it sad. Guess that's the ""Big Company"" atmosphere. Not for me."
bad,"Working at the Boeing Store, you learn tons of cool things about planes and get to meet lots of fascinating people. From higher management and engineers to welders and tourists.  I personally don't the buyers listen enough to what the sales associates tell them from customers. They'd sell more realistic ""Boeing"" gear than the stuff they can't move from the shelves.  The location I worked at had an awesome cafeteria right down the hall, though!"
bad,"If management does NOT like you, they will do all they can to get rid of you.  When I became sick, I had a major issue with my Boss not wanting to try to compensate me and my situation.  They DO NOT care as long as the work gets out.  NO COMPASSION whatsoever"
bad,"No Job Security, Incredibly Bureaucratic, slow moving to the extreme. Consistently fails to execute programs to schedule and cost targets Limited chance for growth. Is now in process of outsourcing key engineering/production jobs to all parts of world and US while decimating local labor force. Severance package is pathetic. Stay away unless you ambition involves pushing paper from one side of desk to another for 8 hours/day."
bad,Boeing allows for independent as well as teamwork. A typical day at work is checking and responding to emails and phone calls. Set up and facilitate project meetings.
bad,"Boeing Seemed to reorganize on an annual basis, without much consideration for employee morale. During five years of employment, the corporate tax department was disbanded, the corporate financial accounting department was reorganized, and the financial analysis department was in a constant state of change."
bad,I have worked for Boeing IT for over 16 years and it used to be a great place to work but in the last 4 years the executives have made it one of the worst places to work with all of their 'improvements'. There is far too much bureaucracy now and it is even more difficult than ever to get anything accomplished. Combine this with all the layoffsit has become almost unbearable to continue to work there.
bad,"Boeing is often seen as the end all be all of careers by a good majority in the northwest. I can tell you that in my 9 years of employment with the company, that is not the case. Incompetent management, lazy coworkers, and often substandard tools and technology given to complete time sensitive tasks are common themes within the factory. I have never seen a higher concentration of entitlement and misery among its workers of any employer I've ever worked for. The IAM-751 union has also lost the majority of its once great strength in fighting for their workers. It's truly a sad situation. The company and union are now in bed with one another, only giving the illusion that there is union representation for the workers' best interests. The culture is indeed on its final death rattle as many of the old Boeing are retiring and the new generation of entry level wage are hiring in. I've also seen a great decline in the quality of their product in farming out jobs and materials to 2nd and 3rd world countries for the sake of the company's greedy nature to pinch pennies. While there is money to be made in long term employment, it comes at a greater cost to the happiness of the worker and their families."
bad,"I worked as a test engineer for Boeing.  I was layed-off from Boeing after 12 years of hard work for them.  Not because I didn't perform good work.  It came down to disagreeing with how management ran my division.  I wanted to perform my job a logical way, not the Boeing way."
bad,"I am a young, intelligent, hard-working communication professional. I was at Boeing for almost a year, and I have been thoroughly traumatized by my experience. There are many, many corrupt, unethical, incompetent first-level managers it's astonishing. I was bullied by management and unfairly treated. I developed extreme anxiety and depression as a result. I did not feel safe at Boeing."
bad,"I have been at Boeing for well over a decade. I have never had a bad performance review. I have also never had a promotion. I have gotten the standard annual raise. This is generally less than the cost of living (2-3%). A pathetic raise by other company standards. Especially for those that are going 'excellent' work. There is always the talk of 'reduction in force (layoffs)' activities going on. This is in the IT side of things, not the mechanic side. The work is enjoyable if you can find a manager that will not micro-manage your projects to death. The management needs to learn to trust in the teams they have and step back to let them work."
bad,"People call Boeing ""the Lazy-B"" for a reason. There isn't a fast pace, good enough performance is rewarded with continued employment. Ambitious people quickly get bored, and there is very little correlation between performance and reward."
bad,"I was mostly waiting for my security clearance during my time with Boeing. With my work being classified, I spent much of my time in self-guided study and looking for project work in other departments. I was originally hired because of my positive attitude and professional demeanor. My hiring was part of a plan to help weed out of the pre-existing drama within the work place. "
bad,"This company has so much waste, it is ridiculous. The compensate for the lost funds by cutting employee benefits, rather than eliminating waste."
bad,"Worked to death, forced to work overtime,people were forced to work while injured to prevent negative impact on  P4P, bonuses. Shift start time changed without notice. Managers were sadists.Co workers were great. Lower management were immature, amateurs. The hardest part of the job was walking miles everyday. Makes you wonder why the 787 is having so many problems."
bad,A typical day is actually not so typical which is what made me realize that I must keep up with the demands to provide the customer with their requests. I am flexible on my start time and open to having to work late but the key is to focus and not lose sight. I was often having to start work at midnight and the next day having to work a much later shift where my time would begin at 7:30 or 8:00 am to meet customer demands. This is expected in my role and I was fine with it because it allowed me to meet new people and see what is important to them including what the trend is and use that as a guide. The hardest part of the job would be the challenges that surprise you when you are leaving work or are at home and having to assist a manager/s over the phone with little to no resource. What I most enjoyed about my job is being able to leave my desk and meet the customers in person and see how much they appreciate my presence and support. My involvement with the customer proves valuable because I am there as a subject matter expert to explain why there are some issues and what action items I will take back with me to work on. This helps me to realize how much time i have to work on the assignment but it also helps the customer know that it is being worked on. 
bad,"As a contractor, I found this to be a difficult place to work. The only good was the technical work. All in all Boeing is a dismal place for a contractor ... you really are at the bottom of the totem pole."
bad,"There safely and work ethic that they preach about in the class are not enforced on the shop floor. They have a very unorganized part schedule that they think is possible, but physically isnt possible."
bad,I am just a number.  My ideas for improvement and work ethic hold no value here.  Pay and benefits are GOOD but not GREAT.  You can only advance if you A) have a degree already and B) prioritize all non-Boeing issues as a far second.
bad,"Landed in the wrong place with a poor manager.  When the job was explained to me, it was conveyed it was a position that would require some level of technical skill, but it does not."
bad,"Decent people, decent company, but stuck in the 20th century. So big and bureaucratic it's almost like working for the government. Lots of useless people who are nearly impossible to fire. Process and schedule driven at the expense of quality and results."
bad,"If a person does something for twenty or thirty times and learn by repetition do they understand why they are doing it? If you work at Boeing you will find most people only know what they have done for the past 20 to 30 years and the basic engineering reasons are unknown to them. Almost nothing is written down, the basic engineering methodology is do what they have always done, including calling people on the telephone rather than email."
bad,"Boeing is going thru a major cultural transition, they are in the process of changing corp. policy's to benefit younger employees. The older more seasoned employees are being left out in the cold."
bad,"This was a first hand look into why I am not cut out for Union Work. No pride was taken in their work in my area, more effort put into not working than actually getting things done. Very poor management with non-leaders put into leadership roles."
bad,"Boeing offers work life balance.  Very slow to promote and the Leadership only cares about metrics.  They say they are all about our culture however they do very little for the people.  The office buildings are dirty and they don't even offer coffee or water for their employees.  Parking is horrible, often you walk a mile to get to your desk.  It feels like you are working for a company from the 70's or 80's.  Leadership just keeps rehiring new people but they are not doing anything to keep the people they have.  They need to start taking responsibility for the culture they have created and fix it."
bad,"Management was made up of college grads, not aircraft people. Only worried about their bonuses.Very weak, not well lead. Decision making was no where near up to par. Training was well done. Directs had decent benefits but poor pay."
bad,"Boeing is about 30 years behind the curve in a lot of areas.   Aviation Electronics is 30 years behind the curve, still using steam gauges in the cockpit, just now moving forward but way behind the curve and without defense contracting this place would have gone broke long ago."
bad,"I would not recommend working at Boeing unless putting up with massive amounts of BS is acceptable to you. Boeing is an old beast, slow to change and evolve. Management and directors talk about people being their greatest asset but their actions don't reflect any of their talk. Workers' benefits are the first thing to be cut. It's a culture of deliver at all cost, regardless of quality. It's all about hitting those numbers at the end of year so they can secure more plane orders and then the cycle begins again."
bad,Washington was ok but south Carolina a joke. Management a joke.people who don't know about working on airplanes .Are put in to positions they should not be in.
bad,"Poor Leadership and communication... no innovation ... low on collaboration !  no reviews for contractors, guidance or training"
bad,"Although it was a good ""fall back plan"", to consider this company a long term career would be a stretch. I did not feel like I was part of a team or that I mattered. I felt like a number and tax break box had been marked."
bad,The hardest part about this job is the workload.  it is over the amount of work that humans are capability of doing.  I really would appreciate it if this wasn't a part of my job searching.
bad,While the compensation is decent and the benefits are great it doesn't always make up for the culture shift that is struggling to shift and the management structure.
bad,"Well at the start everything was great and then after training it did not go the way they said. It was like having another job, we didn't have what we needed and didn't know how to get it."
bad,"Typical workday: No guidance, no SOW"
bad,Lots of on the job training. There was very little done in the way of mentoring or job advancement. Co-workers were great to work with.
bad,I feel like a person is successful if they yield 10% production from 100% effort. Old way of doing business type culture and reward years of service over actual contribution.
bad,The job is subject to weekly and monthly reporting cycles. Schedule status updates are due Fridays each week for input into Boeing systems for review the following Tuesday. Cost and schedule reports and charts are generated weekly. Weekly program reviews are conducted either on a Weds afternoon or Thursday afternoon to discuss presentation data and review status issues. The meeting formats are standard and expectations are understood across all functional teams. The degree of support by 1st level management of these meetings can vary considerable unfortunately. Considerable effort goes into the preparation of the meeting but the importance management gives to the reviews can vary.
bad,A typical day at work was monotonous mechanical work. Flooded by bitter conservative men who forget about the outside world.
bad,"Boeing International Corporation is a great company to work in, with many benefits and good pay. But the moment you sign your employment contract, you are indebted to them to work for long hours and there are so many policies it makes innovation and new ideas difficult to process and action."
bad,The people are mostly nice. I enjoyed the crew I worked on. I worked on the wings. The hardest part of the job was getting through the red tape.
bad,"The Company is good to work for as far as great benefits and good people.... but once you get a layoff notice your thrown to the wolves and no manager will help you transfer or find another location to work. I put 6 years into Boeing and when I got layed off, my manager started treating me like the plague. The Boeing BESS system is a joke (their job posting site). The criteria are written for people they already have in mid for the job. of course I don't have 3 years experience in using a software program that one 1 small department in the entire company uses."
bad,"Boeing has been a supportive company and they put employees first. However it is the most inefficiently run company I've ever worked for. The moto should be ""pass the buck"". Leadership doesnt take action, they just hand off. There are no consequences for insubordination. If you are union you cant get fired, even if you violate safety protocols. People are frustrated."
bad,"The good-old-boys club. Not much else to say. Boeing is a series of kingdoms with short sighted managers. To work there you must believe that ""self importance"" is job one."
bad,"I enjoyed the projects that I was assigned, but there was a lot of infighting between groups.  There was not enough collaboration amongst peers. Management did not provide sufficient guidance."
bad,"Boeing was an interesting job... for awhile, but the work never changed and neither did the pay or opportunity to move up within the company, so I moved out."
bad,"Very large company, technical (engineering) Based. I fyou like working on small parts of large projects that you can hear about in the news and are changing continuously, you will like Boeing. It was not for me"
bad,"good work live balance. low periods. easy going. hard to move up in salary, kind of like working for the government. time off good, no problem there. salary was a constant average."
bad,Very stressful place to work. Managers are mostly never available because of being in meetings most of the day. Virtually impossible to get everything required done in a single shift.
bad,"There are so many positives about this company.  The work-life balance is great, benefits are good, they invest into the development of their engineers with training and mentoring programs."
bad,"Like with any company, it really depends what group you are in.  However, if you are younger than 30, you may find yourself at odds with the majority of the employees ( average age is 48).  "
bad,"A once great company that has lost it's way. From the elimination of employee pension plans, steep decline in insurance coverage and shipping jobs to low cost areas, the Boeing Company is proving more and more that they no longer care about their employees."
bad,"In the PPC division, 40% of 1st level managers have less than 1 year experience and frequently show their lack of management abilities.  HR writes general job announcements, so may not be doing what you thought you applied for.  The CEO makes millions while the regular workers' pay is kept low."
bad,"I became ill in Jan.2013 and was under doctors care ,called in everyday I was out.I had my mother' cell on file for my emergency contact but she was never called. After being an employee for so many years I thought at least they would send a letter or email or call my emergency contact telling me that my job was on the line,but they didn't.They fed ex a letter stating that I was considered awol and that since I past the sixth day of absence it was a voluntary discharge/resignation.I feel it could have handled better than that. So they said that I had to wait 36 month before I can reapply."
bad,"No good deed goes unpunished. Horrible management practices, punishes hard workers and advances slackers and screw-ups."
bad,"working with them was fun.. I used my own vehicle to drive from store to store, sat in a gift shop for about 6 hours with almost no customers"
bad,"They are in a bad spot because the average age of the engineers is like 100! Promotions have not been based on performance so they now have a bunch of under-performing over-paid white balding males that will work there until they die. They have restructured continuously during 2011 and 2012 and let a lot of management go, which needed to happen but the cuts were most likely not based on performance. Morale is very low and it's impossible to transfer to a position to learn something new. Technology and equipment are VERY outdated. The best part is when you land a virtual job and get to work from home some and it was easy for me to feel really smart there! When I first started a coworker told me to show up and slack or bust my rear and the pay difference will be a few bucks. Eleven years later I can say he was right (I got passed over many times for deserving promotions since I was a female). With that being said there are a lot of nice and talented people there. I recently resigned and never looked back since I had all I could handle."
bad,"Face it, this is a HUGE corporation with a lot of potential for sideways and upwards moves. There are some very talented and progressive thinking people working at the floor level. The top level management envisions cutting edge progress and constant forward movement. However, Boeing's downfall is usually first level managers who are much more interested in building empires for themselves rather than taking risks and finding better and more progressive ways to do things. Co-workers are great but all struggling with the same obstacle to making the company better, the first level management."
bad,"There is a very ""boys club"" type feel, limited diversity, and they preach work/life balance, but you may end up working over 50 hrs/wk a lot of the time."
bad,wouldn't go back to cecil field in jacksonville florida the managers and supervisors don't listen to their employees feedback or critacizm. they expect you to work such long hours with little in return.
bad,I didn't personally have a good experience at Boeing.  The harder you worked the more they expected out of you.  I was a contractor and they didn't really treat us as well as the directs.
bad,"Soecifially at Boeing spectrolab some of the employees treat you like you don’t belong there and will make complaints about you that dont even adhere to work quality, and managment will take sides with out hearing yours because of the temporary job status"
bad,"Has a culture that is toxic due to specific individuals. Management will not step up and do anything about it. BDA generally is good to work for, average money, good EBA conditions. Not a company of choice unless specific people are removed."
bad,"The Boeing culture is well diverse, and I found potential value being employed by the company. If lead by fair and confident leaders, a successful career is possible."
bad,"Long hours for mediocre pay. Pay scale is not accurate for job performance.  I have had 18 managers in 4 years.  Never get the proper team or tools to actually succeed,"
bad,"great people and good job, but mostly contract and hard to get a permanent position.  Job was menial, but paid well.  Also being a military product job was short term at best."
bad,"Management is incompetent and not sure that they are heading in the right direction for success.  Company continues to hire massive amount of people, promoting lots of people to management, who build their own kingdoms and then laying off massive people."
bad,The ever changing and shrinking satellite business does not make for a great work environment. You must really go that extra mile to stay valuable so that you don't get laid off.
bad,Enjoyed working there. Free coffee paid overtime and clean work area. Flexible work times with plenty of work and collaboration between employees and supervision.
bad,"Decisions are ever changing, so it is hard to feel grounded and certain about performance.  The organization is trying correct the current culture, however, it feels more like spaghetti is being thrown up against the wall. Lack of clear direction is causing undue stress and lost engagement of the workforce. The very best thing about Boeing is the people. The product and history of The Boeing Company really is an amazing modern marvel."
bad,"There is little room at Boeing even in the satellite division for real innovation. Like all Big aerospace companies, unless an idea shows a real immediate ROI, they probably won't invest in it."
bad,"Benefits are excellent. Working environment is good. Good work/life balance can usually be done.  No job security at all. Upper management sacrifice people regardless of dedication, skills or performance."
bad,Good job to work at. People are nice and willing to help you in situations. They really train you to learn your job really well.
bad,"Boeing has move many jobs to North Charleston, SC and St. Louis to avoid labor costs.  They are doing a bang up job (sarcasm)."
bad,"I worked at Boeing as a design engineer for 25 years before I was laid off.  So I am well qualified to review this company.  This company is moving towards having younger engineers take over manager positions.  With many experienced engineers retiring, there is a gap of experience which is a result of the hiring freeze of the 1990’s and early 2000’s where the industry was in a slump.  So the company promotes many twenty-somethings to manager and often with disastrous results. "
bad,Typical large company with a huge good old boy network. Not a very friendly place. I have worked at more rewarding places.
bad,Fun place to work. Lots of opportunity to learn manufacturing processes
bad,"Boring work, way to much management.  Decent pay and benefits though."
bad,Shipside support was very hard. There were 200 of them and 1 of me. Manager did not give me help. Coworkers were people from every Boeing facility in the country and I did not know much about any of them. The plane was made all over the world and I could only speak English. Round trip email took 3 months.
bad,"This job location had a lot of learning associated with it.  Basically,  logging and taking calls amounted to learning a decent amount of computer hardware, software and operating systems."
bad,"This job is not something to be considered unless you have no other options. The leadership team is lacking the skills they need to be good leaders and supervisors. In 2013 alone there have 16 people who have left the company due to poor supervisors. The supervisors tends to draw you in by being completely understanding and accommodating to your reservations and concerns or any challenges you come across while performing your job duties. The main supervisor stresses that ""communication is important"" but chooses not to communicate with the team when it comes to important information. Instead we are forced to make mistakes and have those mistakes count against us at the end of the month."
bad,good co-workers
bad,"Boeing San Antonio, Texas was very disorganized. Managers were not trained in the aviation environment which caused tremendous waste of manpower and materials."
bad,"People are very driven but the work is grueling and lower level employees are used and abused for lack of better term. They have one program, finance, for new hires and no other option aside from IT or Engineering. What about the rest of business functions?"
bad,"CDG hires under Boeing since it is a subsidiary, but the work load is not very engaging or challenging. This is a good place to settle in because your coworkers will be awesome, but don't expect to experience much career growth if that is you main objective."
bad,"The site I work at is fantastic. The team is great, management really cares about the employees, and the job/life balance is very evident. However, upper-level management has no idea how to run the company."
bad,"You get paid well to stand around and wait, Do not apply if you want to solve problems by making changes. You will be stonewalled."
bad,Management is blind and deaf to the realities of  how manufacturing works. They are idiotic in the way they treat employees. The management style is hard nosed and totally out of touch with the world. DO NOT APPLY THERE!!!
bad,Ok place to work. Lots of travel. About 80%. Management needs more training with people with people skills.
bad,"Boeing has great benfits, the work side though doesn't have many opportunities to grow your career.  Tried multiple times to go in different directions but no opportunities given."
bad,"The pay and benefits are good but, there is no job security at all.  When the upper management doesn't know about what they are doing, that's all creating a mess down the stream."
bad,Boeing as a company has allowed me to expand on my Enterprise/Solution Architecture experience and has given me the opportunity to define value and leverage the gap between the Business and IT :).
good,There is no job security at this facility. Employees are considered a dime a dozen and management is the main problem. There are some good managers but they are limited due to their supervisors and restrictions. If you are not able to move then you will not advance.
good,"Best company wage wise.   Management does not know how to manage people. They have taken all incentives away from us. They tell us lies about a union and workers on the floor just don't care anymore.  It's just a job now.  Nothing special."
good,"Good job, we were moved around to different managers too much."
good,"As a contractor with Boeing, no benefits. Work 4 - 10 hours days. I have learned about the tools Boeing uses to build the planes. Some of the tools are very heavy, but, having the right tool for the mechanic to issue from me makes the customer happy. Making sure the customer returns the right tool makes Boeing happy. Contractors works hard for Boeing. Enjoyed learning the Cribmaster Program."
good,In the position i was in it was not a healthy work environment and people really treated others badly
good,"I was not ready to be forced resign, felt i was able to work full time with work related permanent restrictions. I loved doing my job. Hate that i can't"
good,"nothing special, not a great place to start a data science career path, politics at peak.poor data quality and very slow IT environment , demorlised work force and very poor and far below compensation."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you can stay away from the drama. Everyone is out to ""get your job"". Can be a childish work environment if you get caught up in the drama and not focus on building the aircraft"
good,"people not working."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo piuttosto chiuso, colleghi interni all'azienda e non consulenti esterni, non interessati a divulgare proprio know how"
good,"This place is great if you are cut throat, have no conscience, and dont care about other people. You think you are getting somewhere then they do layoffs. You think you are making friends, then they get whiff of anything you may have that they can screw you out of and you're gone."
good,Boeing is too big; I feel like just a number now.  The feel is that it does not matter if we are there today; or what is it you are working on.  Compensation and benefits have got worse each year and more out of my check since I am not part of a union.
good,Boeing defense division does not care for the employee workplace work life. They are all about making money and not taking care of the employee who helped them get there.
good,A very politically correct environment that did not listen to ideas that were proven to save millions of annual dollars and provide better products. Supplier took advantage of this.
good,"If you're the type that enjoys high pressure, micro-management style Management style, work mandatory overtime and 6 days a week, Boeing is a great place to learn how to ultimately learn and multi task quickly! Boeing has a rewarding compensation package as well."
good,"The main function as a M&P engineer is working with suppliers to ensure products they deliver to the company meet FAA requirements and specification, coach suppliers on process improvement, work with cross-functional engineering teams in design upgrade, and problem solving in materials and processes related issues."
good,"Since Boeing take over, pay is lower for new hires.  Contract employees are rarely offered full time employment."
good,"Aircraft, boring no advancement."
good,"Looks great from the outside. Virtually no career advancement opportunities for contractors. I played musical desks for the first month I was there, didn't get a working computer until my 2nd week. Lots of busy work and little guidance."
good,"Such a large and established company, such a shame that management and executive levels are oblivious to the wasted talents of their employees.  No advancement, no shift changes without hardship, mandatory weekends with no plans on what's to be worked.  Why?  This company should be setting the example of how great things happen with great people, but its not."
good,the hardest part of the day was the Monotony. After you where there for little while you would do the same thing again and again. I guess that comes with manufacturing.
good,"I would have expected that for such a large company, they would have treated their employees better.  The contractors that work there are treated completely unjust and there is no opportunity for advancement and they do not have a problem letting contractors go because they are just a number.  There are alot of open ended promises that are never seen through.  Most of the managers that are there are very ""clicky"" and if you are not part of their group you do not stand a chance no matter how good of an employee you are."
good,I see no future with the Boeing Company.  I need to find another career opportunity where I can use my creativity and be compensate for it.  It was all about the good old boys club.
good,If you looking to have a slow career and don't have any creative talents and would just do anything to get those bucks this is the place to be. Wouldn't suggest this place for any aspiring leaders!
good,"The Benefit package is great, especially for those in school. Continuing education and balancing the work load will be challenging on the production side of this company but it can be done."
good,"I learned more about the aerospace industry than previously know, but the learning and experience curve/hurdle takes about 6 months to get acclimated"
good,"Meeting deadlines and providing realtime, minute to minute status is critical."
good,Employer is not concerned with work life balance. I was hired as a 1st shift employee and forced to work 3rd shift. None of my life at home with my family was considered. If you do not have a family or friends this company is for you.
good,Discouraged from forward thinking or thinking
good,They don't treat their workers unfairly. They strive off of the buddy system and only find ways to fire people for unjustly causes. They treat contractors unfairly and they have some managers in the wrong positions
good,"Poor Management. Promote from within however nepotism is high.  One has to fight for advancement. If you're not a relative, then forget it. I do not recommend working here"
good,They constantly change managers. Most managers arent professional and base their employees treat off of friendship levels.. the work comes and goes so you never know whats going to happen
good,"Good job difficult environment. "
good,"I learned a lot at Boeing but it has gotten me nowhere. No other company has looked at Boeing as experience. I never was able to see my family and worked 14-16 days straight. I worked with many amazing people, however, we all realized that Boeing is not a ""family oriented "" company."
good,"I work in Everett site and the culture is terrible. Management has to be some of the worst I have ever worked or. Forced to work weekends, forced to change shifts. No wonder the morale is so low and no one from management cares."
good,"I found that many Boeing employees were lazy and only willing to do the bare minimum. Cooperate level leaders cared very little for the individual workers, and were consumed only by production and numbers. When many people use the quote ""if you haven't been laid off at least once you haven't worked long enough for Boeing"" you have a serious problem."
good,"In my 7 years career at Boeing, what I have observed is that Boeing has became a family business where there is a visible unfair favoritism and that is getting out of hands."
good,"This is a different company now than back in the day when it actually was building airplanes. The product is still quite impressive in the end, however the company itself seems a bit lost. It has been often led by people who only see the product as means of making money and not as an impressive new technology that delivers value to the customer. I felt the strategy around products and markets was weak and foggy in the recent years. The company fell behind in its infrastructure upkeep, frequently cutting corners to save money, in places pintching pennies on basic tools."
good,installing parts on the plane solving problems that restrict the production of the plane. drilling and fabricating parts when authorized to do so. communicating to management on the problems and issues that arise.
good,"The company shifted from being high morale with the Boeing Family to Cut throat environment. "
good,I love to work and they will take advantage of that. It is a union job being a mechanic. I started doing a job that a guy that has been there for ten years couldn't do in 11 hours. I brought it down to five. Now that is the only job they want me to do.
good,"stressful and unhappy co-workers. poor management who don't know what the employees do, but manage them with important aspect of their career life-performance review, raise, and promotion. Very misaligned with the employee's real performance. "
good,"Less of the above topic. Not a conducive place for minorities and advancement. Do not value education and experience, especially when you are a minority."
good,"I have some great learning experiences here and have met some great co-workers. You get to see amazing parts of commercial planes many will never see. I didn't like the structure of management. We're supposed  to work together, not work for them."
good,"Boeing seems to seek out managers who are clueless about anything related to management.  They only still exist because it takes a long time for such a big company to die."
good,"Wonderful co-workers who do their jobs well and want to succeed.  Management, however, changes tactics often and gives mixed messages to office workers and production workers causing consistent conflicts and makes production times worse rather than better."
good,"Mgm't has a Washington State attitude - in other words, South Carolina can't build a quality airliner. Some workers hard to get along with; Mgm't impossible to present new innovative ideas."
good,"At Boeing most employees are worried about job security and must constantly play game to stay employed.  Too much politics by upper management, employees are just numbers and can be laid off at moments notice.  No human factor!"
good,"Working the space shuttle program was absolutely great, commercial space is not so much.  After a long career working shuttle operations and sustaining engineering, I was forced into a specification writing position without any job satisfaction."
good,"The products developed, manufactured and delivered from here is spectacular."
good,"Overall rating ***"
good,"The company has an opportunity to focus more on Employee safety and work life balance."
good,"A tipical day at work looks different every time. That is one of its positives. In services, there is always something different and the possibility of impact. The hardest thing of my job is the schedules. As a support on a 24/7 service sometimes the hours are tough, but the team is great at working together and there is always something to learn."
good,"Good for experience. People were great to work with, work was mundane and low attention from supervisors."
good,"only worked here for 7 months when contract was picked back up by Boeing only to be sub'd to another company in which 8 people, including myself were laid off."
good,A typical day is spent doing about 2 hours of real work and 6 hours trying to look busy.
good,"IMHO, the company is overrated. The actual job was not really what it was cracked up to be considering the application process was rather lengthy. Parking is the pits and I disliked the sense of urgency opon arriving to work. Training was fun and educational. Sadly, I was given no other choice but to self-terminate."
good,"over the years I worked there I moved around a lot ."
good,I am technically not a Boeing employee. I am a contract worker from Vetran's Sourcing Group. They pay fairly well but you get no appreciable benefits. I would like to be a Boeing employee. They offer excellent benefits and advancement opportunities.
good,"Was a good company until the incepted McDonnel Douglas management..They set unrealistic expectations, Management has NO clue, Figure it's easier to work everyone to death (Designated O.T.) than staff accordingly."
good,"Expects you to work hard, be loyal, and don't complain.  Can work on very cool projects, and the products are one of a kind.  Lots of layers, lots of rules and processes, very structured."
good,"There were a lot of issues with management there. This produced a lot of miscommunication between engineers, Technicians and mechanics. It caused things to seem a little more hostile."
good,"Boeing constantly looks to layoffs to meet cost challenges. They are attempting to revive culture but Management (not leaders) makes decisions in isolation thinking they understand their people. A lot of silos and finger pointing in problematic situations. Highly risk averse culture. I've worked in several salaried organizations and the problems are always the same even if the work is different. Benefits used to be top of the line, but they're being cut each year to ""meet industry standards."" I preferred the days when we were innovators."
good,"The atmosphere of the hourly employees in this company is terrible. Management treats you like cattle and does not listen to employees concerns. Job will work you to death as required, and then lay you off when not needed. I know many employees who lost their wives and family/friends over this job."
good,"There is endless opportunity for training. Resources are available, just need to work for managers that foster development! I have pride in my position and the program we support."
good,Currently the micro management of the workers who build the planes has become ridiculous. They would benefit by allowing the workers to do their jobs without a meeting every 2 hours. It would also help if they would monitor the workers hours who can’t seem to get simple work done in an 8 hour shift just so they can have overtime.
good,"At best I had 40 hr per month of honest work to do, I got far to bored and had to leave."
good,over all if your looking to work over time and no life then this is the job for you.  Good pay health insurance not so great now used to be great health insurance until Health Care became mandatory then the prices for health insurance went sky high.
good,"The Charleston, SC facility is the most impressive facility I have ever worked."
good,There are constant layoffs. There is subtle covered up discrimination in place throughout the site which is ignored by upper leadership. Management is protected and non-management is 'laid off' in order to continue the discriminatory practices.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Mesa plant for Boeing Aerospace in  Mesa, Arizona. The entire environment was not friendly. The location was not comfortable. The team I worked never been friendly to me. The Manager was white old man and racist."
good,"Boeing will penalize you for not working excessive overtime and their hierarchy system makes it hard for people to advance. As good as you are at your job, advancement will be difficult if there are other people that were hired before you."
good,"Boeing IT culture is slow to change and inhibited by countless layers of bureaucratic red tape. There is a great lack of empowerment, and those with first-line management empowerment rarely make/own decisions. An effort for collaboration has built a culture of requiring unanimity. So when 20+ diverse people don't have the same opinion or won't come to a consensus or compromise, no work really gets done, and everyone spends all day in meetings."
good,They don't care about work life balance and the day is very stress full. The company pushes job sales over quality and accidents are part of a typical day
good,From an IT perspective this company is falling behind daily.  It is fraught with dysfunction on both the SW dev side and also the finance side. There are not enough good leaders to go around.
good,Managers seemed to be more interested in keeping the status quo rather than making the correct business decisions. Mangers argued a lot about the lack of upper management support. Still was a great place to work with the team environment.
good,"The benefits at Boeing are great.  My department has been going through a reorganization for over 2 years now, and I question whether or not they know where they're going with the reorganization.  Career growth is not a strong point, either."
good,Not much to say. It has been a learning experience. It opened my eyes as well. They are only interested in the money for the day. Supposedly they care about your safety but not as much as they want others to believe.
good,"the company was allied universal, as long as you had a or could get a secret security clearance with the federal government and had any experience in security you could get the job."
good,They have really good benefits at The Boeing Company - however job security and the overall working environment is terrible.  Management runs the company more like an armed force than a business that values its employees.
good,"merits do not matter in Huntsville, it's who your daddy is not your qualifications. Run away from any hourly position as Huntsville management treats them as the enemy."
good,Typically 8 hour work days. Good structured program for Interns. Not too much pressure to deliver. Few weeks of internship were pretty slow. Good activities after work.
good,"great pay terrible management, lazy workers, good benefits though and there are some good people and a few good managers. bad work culture, good workers are force to carry people who do nothing"
good,"This company has a good amount of employee turn over."
good,Wanted to retire from Boeing however management tends to cut workers to save themselves.  Often you will find that the employees are more educated than managers.
good,"Over the past 10 years and possibly more the business model has changed to one that is in support of stockholders versus how it used to be all about building great planes."
good,"Typical work days start early, and only last about 8 hours. Work life balance is encouraged. Safety is a very big focus for the company. Management supports chance, but the general front line employees are not as willing (usually 20-30+ year employees)."
good,Company culture is very conservative and old. Not a lot of young energetic people. Older people's contagious negativity sticks and hurts the growth of new young hires.
good,"Immediate Management allowed associates to sit around on company time and talk, do home work, eat or nap. All instances are against company ethics and integrity policies. It was hard to have respect for shop and management under these conditons."
good,The company has continued to lay off and cut benefits while increasing workload and letting quality go to the wayside. Managers are not at all supportive of the quality function in the areas I supported. This job could be great or could be horrible all depending on the direct managers you work with.
good,"Boeing is very much a standard corporate environment with many people who have worked there for 20+ years.  They are very beaucratic, and it is all in who you know."
good,The company is a good stepping stone but it is not a place to stay for 20+ years. The benefits are getting worse every year and they treat their employees like they are easily replaceable.
good,"Very busy days, lots of beauracratic processes. Good pay, good health insurance, great co workers. Job adds value to the company's bottom line. Negotiating with suppliers is the best part of job. Worst part of job is too many processes and inexperienced leadership"
good,"Offers great Insurance benefits."
good,"The quantity of work is dismal. It used to be thriving but has significantly dwindled since the contract has changed hands. The management gives no consideration for it's employees' well being. They hide behind the shroud of a government contract, blaming its literature for the severe lack of fringe benefits. Pays it's employees the absolute bare minimum as mandated by the US Government.  No performance raises, ever."
good,"Poor production managers set the tone for the buildings.  People are constantly under stress which leads to finger-pointing and poor team work.  Everybody is looking out for themselves, sometimes even putting others on the chopping block in order to get themselves ahead.  Mechanic work force is filled with disgruntled employees, many of whom spend much of their time trying to figure out how to game the system via FMLA, deliberately not doing their work so they get over time, etc.  The company will pay for your schooling if it's a strategic field of study... however it seems that people don't feel like they can handle both school and work due to their work environment's chaos and time commitment.  Moral is pretty low in every work group throughout the entire main site in Charleston."
good,"Sometimes you just need to go , you can make something out of every jobRecognizing the value that employees around the world bring to the company, Boeing ..."
good,"Top  heavy on management, bottom heavy on project engineers. Too many old people weighing down the culture. Not a place to work for anyone under 40 years of age."
good,although job security is good there is no room for real growth if you are stuck in the maintenance field. I have been applying for jobs the past four years and there seems to be not a chance for hope in moving forward with this company.
good,"I have worked for Boeing for over 12 years now.  In that time I have see some good changes and some not so good changes.  "
good,"Without a clearly defined direction Jeppesen is the oldest, largest and most well-funded start up in the history of the world."
good,"Pro: really neat products, possibly room to grow ( must try hard to do so), education benefits are GREAT"
good,You have 15 layers of management which don't allow creative freedom. Its a wonderful company if you can find the right location and program to work for.
good,"A typical day of work includes supplier data assigning to reviewers, conducting metrics on supplier data, creation of company data sheets and scan/filing documents."
good,Overcome environmental challenging and work load for shrinking work force.
good,"Okay place to work. No room for advancement once a proven performer. Management clueless, constant begging for overtime help including holidays."
good,"The current management culture, along with the bleak future outlook, makes working at Boeing in Houston an unattractive option. there is no sign that this current management culture is going to change."
good,Currently working 10 hour days building cable assy's.
good,mi alzo la mattina presto alle 3 . alle 3.30 sono sul camion vado alla ditta a caricare la merce tutto questo in un ora e poi inizio il mio giro di consegne.
good,Everyday was the same procedure but also every day was different depending on what problems occurred.
good,"As a contractor, working in Everett, I've found a large percentage of the personnel to mean spirited, always trying to find fault with my work. Quick to send out broadcast emails to management when they think I'm wrong on my work -- later to find out I am right. The twin towers buildings are dingy dirty buildings which are not properly maintained. An excessive attention to useless detail and a lot of reworking the same problems due to the inexperienced management I support. I'm looking to get out ASAP."
good,"This is a strong company, however the pay is not worth the time spent away from home, as well as lower than other companies pay for the same positions. Leadership lack vision, integrety, and are willing to run their people down in order to thrive. I have had 2 days off in 3 months. Luckily I have a strong family."
good,"Boeing is a great place to learn what corporate America is all about. Learning to leverage complexity while performing root cause analysis and leading systematic problem solving has been very rewarding. I truly value the diversity of people and thought."
good,"Training with Boeing is helpful to help me update my job experience, although the management needs to be more respectful of certain situations and work with employees."
good,If you can adhere to the culture of Boeing you will soar in your profession. Also is you enjoy working for a large company this is the place where you should be.
good,"Continually switching direction without the guidance required to be successful. Lacking proper leadership due to imbalanced structure, and poor strategic planning."
good,There is a constant fear of headcount reduction! The company offers good benefits and reasonable salary but the annual increases are way lower than the cost of living increases. I personally did not receive any salary increase at Boeing in the last 8 years.
good,Micromanagement is the main issue at Boeing. They focus on charts and graphs instead of people. Lacking in communication and compassion. Top down management style.
good,"It's stressful, there is no advancement unless you are friends with the right people. Working hours are whatever they want with no consideration for you or family. If you are content working the same position for a few cent raises every year, then this job is for you. If you want to actually be acknowledged for you work and paid accordingly, then this isn't the place for you"
good,"pros. "
good,"It was a nice place to work, We would spend most of our time running away from work, we just hide from the management until the ask someone else to do the job."
good,"Don’t treat everyone equally, lots of double standards and favoritism...don’t give everyone same opportunity to learn and grow....you have to be management favorite in order to recognize and good performance review regardless how hard you work and all of your customers appreciate your hard work."
good,"Management caters to certain people , ignores problems until something goes wrong. Working there was ok? most of the time. we were free to organize our area as best to suit your needs. Not a fan of the hierarchy system. I would like to see a culture change. Especially in regards to tension between different shifts and management. I would return under certain circumstances if it were ever offered."
good,"Now that I look back, my manager seemed, to me, to be unqualified to manage a program since the first day I got there.  We were always behind schedule and encouraged to work overtime hours.  After coming back from the Christmas/NYE break, I was laid off on my second day back.  The reason was that my ""job performance was poor.""  I asked why I was just hearing about this ""issue"" for the first time on the morning my work contract was being ""terminated.""  My manager just said, ""That's the way it is.""  I was shocked and upset because I saw how mis-managed this program was.  I wondered why she was a manager.  In the time I was there, I heard many stories of unqualified people being promoted to managers.  I guess it is who you know and not a matter of ability or qualifications.  I was really looking forward to having a good career/job but that just didnt happen.  To this day I think I was lied to and laid off as a way of advancing somebody's career other than mine."
good,"It is too secretive and hides a lot from employees. It does not have enough employee support and security measures in place. If you are on a contract that has been lost, rather than relocate and reposition they leave it to the employee to re-apply for new internal positions. This is a waste of employee assets and an inefficient utilization of talent."
good,"Boeing is an old company, with oldschool management that isn't well trained. I had great colleagues who worked well together under pressure and the constant fear of layoffs and reorgs. While there are excellent training benefits, it doesn't mean you'll advance to a new position or higher pay grade. Lots of reorgs and layoffs, with 30K permanent professional employees slated for layoff between 2017 and 2020.  I had 7 managers in 6 years-- typical."
good,The pay is insulting but the work load wasnt too bad. Very slow paced. Not challenging at all. Rinse and repeat job tasks daily. Very repetitive. Hostile environment at times due to union/management issues. I never plan to return to Boeing.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the statement of work at Boeing.  It was challenging, but fulfilling.  Workplace culture was a little stressful and unorganized.  I've learned a lot about what it takes to be productive and the essentials for a typical day at work.  The hardest part of my job was watching the policies and processes not being followed and quality of work being brought into question.  Management is an area that needs to change. Policies need to be kept and Integrity needs to be accomplished.  This is what I learned."
good,Operation center type of environment. nice working environment with great coworkers and team members/ great opportunities to grow and learn from others.
good,"DOD employer. The job was easy and most people were not working that hard. "
good,"Though the company provides a somewhat competitive salary for the northern Seattle area, the size of the company lends to structural issues that propagate throughout the work culture. The size of the company lends to the need for many layers of management (apparently), but few managers have training outside of their specific area of influence. As a result, management of employees, focus on maintaining motivated employees, and other non-measurable aspects of management are not rewarded or taught. As a result, work-life balance and overall work culture suffer as long as the whims of managers to appease other managers are met."
good,"Boeing has more potential, talent, and capabilities then almost any company I have seen. It is criminal that they are so poor at using them."
good,"Great place to improve personal skills."
good,"Long and complex processes exist and there are more ways to say no than yes. There is a push for culture change; however, change comes with push back and moves slowly."
good,"Tends toward a non-collaborative work environment. Management does not take bad news or criticism well. The CEO is outstanding, and seems to understand that culture change is needed."
good,"I worked there for 7 years on the Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS). Decisions were made for groups by managers not acquainted with the workings of the groups. Meetings were terrible, hours were long due to management."
good,Productive and stressful workplace. Unsupportive management and preferential treatment was given to some. I enjoyed the good relationships I made with a few of my co-workers.
good,"Over-all I enjoyed my work experience at The Boeing company. The most difficult aspects were the methods used to position people in management who did not have the appropriate skill sets - People / Vision / Competency / focus / basic business competency to properly manage both the workforce and the specific job functions assigned to the programs I was part of. Senior leadership never was held accountable for the decision- making that ended up costing the company 10's of millions of dollars, just on the program I worked on alone - As a shareholder it was quite troubling. The best experiences I had was the people that I managed and the team-effort we brought to the company. The culture and belief that we could change the way the company worked on internal programs, was the glue that kept us all together - we all worked toward that effort. Leadership at the top of my business unit lacked transparency and honesty. Leadership in CAS failed to hold management accountable for the incredulous program over-runs. People should have been fired.  After 17 years - 4 years as a consultant and then 13 years as an employee.. I couldn't take it any more - I chose to leave the company."
good,"Excellent pay, good raises, great food, good opportunities, good advancement, good atmosphere, good benefits, excellent diversity, good place to work."
good,"This summary requirement is stupid and I do not agree with this as a requirement to submit my resume and look for jobs, it has no bearing on this process."
good,"The job was a job. The management was incompetent and would not supply the required tools to do your job. I enjoyed doing the work I was hired to performed, however due to poor management I spent more time with personnel issues than my job. Also, I applied for 30 different positions within Boeing which I was fully qualified for, but never received one interview. I believe that Boeing is very discriminating when it comes to older workers."
good,"As Boeing, it was great working there.  But when it became United Launch Alliance, it went down hill quickly.  Upper management formed their little groups and if you weren't in one of those groups, you were doomed."
good,"Going through some major shifts. Cutting and reducing costs has become the main focus for a company used to be popular for its engineering, innovation and care for employees."
good,Boeing is a well established company however in the government market they are still trying to establish themselves amoung the comepetition. It has become more reactive than proactive. Many decisions being made with poor executions.
good,"Lots of hiring, lots of firing.......here today, gone tomorrow!"
good,"I have been at Boeing for over 2 years and hired under the new contract which has a two tier pay. Meaning if you start today in the union part of boeing you will be making substantially less than tier one employees. They have a pay range for each job classification. I was hired in a classification that paid between 12-28. We were brought in at 15 for skilled tig welding. Now tier 1 pay cap is 38. You pay union dues on a wage never acheiveable. 90 +bucks a month, 2.5x 38 bucks an hour is how it's based. Company is always trying to cut costs and it mostly falls into pay and benefits. The environment in the shop is toxic. Management is untrustworthy and will lie and deceive you. Tier 2 workers don't stay around long, as I type this I am actively searching for a new job with better pay and job security. Family life is hard to juggle as well, you are given no vacation or time off your first full year here. Boeing likes to claim they are family oreiented, but will not allow you to flex time or miss work. PC culture is strong here and diversity is their favorite word. The company side is a little better, but cut throat. Be careful who you side with at this place."
good,"Cant say a lot, you need a security clearance to work here. Very highly regulated work environment.The local people were good to work with, but much of the out of state management were clueless."
good,"Over the past several years they have promoted people to management that have no people skills and just want to move up the ranks.  They just want to ""look good"" to upper management at whatever cost"
good,"If you are great at kissing up, then this is the job for you. Play golf? You will fit right in. Avoid real work and dump it on others? You will love this job."
good,"Wrote, negotiated, market researched the best pricing, released contractual agreements. Managed shipments.  Balancing daily schedule could get hectic."
good,"Management dictates conditions and rates performance on a very political basis. Metrics used do not correlate with factory results. Dissent tends to be squelched or disregarded.Workers are regarded more as expenses rather than the source of company profits. Products are outstanding, not because of management, but because of the integrity of those who design and build them."
good,"fun fun more fun then fun again ,too much fun. fun, then more fun fun every day all day all week all month. ...................fun all year , and every year...."
good,Disappointing project which was fueled by management who are souly concerned with schedule rather than delivering a quality product. Boeing has changed drastically....
good,Management is the worst here.  They do not care about employees and what is going on in their lives.  The culture there with the employees is decent but management makes it difficult.
good,Boeing is a challenging and a great place to work. There are always challenges you must overcome and it makes it very rewarding. They will always provide you with the opportunity to learn and prepare for the future.
good,"A typical day is spent checking emails and sitting in meetings."
good,"A typical day work will include some drawing engineering drawings updates and perhaps some troubleshooting on an airplane. "
good,CSC is in a transition. CSC and HPE is merging into one company. CSC is not doing well. There is a lot of people let go. People's moral is low. The company has tough time to maintain talents. The company is mainly focus on low skill IT workers. This is not sustainable. I haven't talk to my current manager for six months already. There are just too many people (about 60 to 70) for him to manage. There hasn't been a raise for the last 3 years. The only good thing is you are able to work remotely.
good,"Friendly, hard working employees building the 787 Dreamliner. Very surprised at the many,many employees who are behind the scene that are supposed to be our support and help in the build that are rewarded with Boeing points and unavailable when needed. Hard working logistics team."
good,"Work is not level loaded; some groups have a lot of work while some groups sits idle"
good,"Boeing is OK to work.  Management culture still believes they are a union environment yet preach that this is not a union shop.  Sometimes, this is difficult to work around.  The benefits package is great but the compensation between comparable cost of living areas is sub par."
good,"I would like to remane anonymous. Anything I say or do will be held against me. My opinion is irelivent to me seeking another job,therefor I will keep my opinions to myself. Thank you."
good,Worked for Boeing in 3 different locations. Everett Washington is the worst I have ever seen. Lazy people that try to hold the company hostage. Walking up and down the isles banging empty water bottles and screaming at other employees how to vote on contracts and they allowed it. I  came from a different division and was IAM there also but they were good people. Space and defense was wonderful but Washington was the worst place I ever worked. Management there is horrible because they are afraid of the union.
good,"Appears to operate a golden boy/girl method of choosing who is to be advanced.  Much talk of training staff, but little is done other that for corporate HR led initiatives."
good,"As a contractor, I work harder than direct hire employees but instead of getting hired, Boeing managers just extend contracts.  Contractors are asked to perform to ""employee"" standards, but never reap the ""benefits"" that employees do (for example:  health care, performance Bonus, 401 K, PTO)."
good,Business declining. The aerospace industry for boeing is not growing. there is no room for advancement and people are getting laid off.
good,"I worked at the Boeing Company off and on over a course of 12 years as a Contract Designer and Technical Illustrator, at the Seattle, Everett and Renton locations in Washington.  I met many very fine people and, for the most part, hard working.  It was, for me, a difficult culture as I found I had to watch my back in many cases."
good,This is a world class company that provides opportunities around the world which allows for great experiences for career growth.
good,"You get what you put into it. Management is horrible- mid level managers are incompetent in most cases and do not really know what goes on beneath them.  Its surprising anything gets done at all, actually."
good,"Being a People Person, I enjoyed helping co-workers and those who allowed me to be part of the team. You have to earn the trust of those you are assisting, if not, you would be seen as not effective, or an asset to the organization.  It is not what you know, but who you know to make advancement. I was told that I was there to do my job, not to be heard or seen.  Hardest part is not being heard by management about ideas, processes about the communication within the office. I enjoyed working with other Office Administrators who was passionate about those we supported."
good,"I would like an opportunity for possible advancement commensurate with my hard work."
good,I wish they would buy Spirit back here in Tulsa.  Tulsa ran well on its own till Wichita started controling it and it has not been the same of become near as proffitable as it was.  Wichita did nothing but send their management rejects or people that didn't havee a clue.
good,"Boeing is a good place to work as long as you don't mind working weekends and swing shift for awhile. There is a LOT of down time, not an extremely busy working environment which makes for long days."
good,Big supply chain problems but a very pleasant place to work. A little so on moving forward when problems arise but all in all a good place to work if they could win any contracts.
good,"The Boeing Company truly builds amazing things. Working on airplane production lines, I've worked with some of the smartest people you can imagine. It's truly amazing dealing with the complexity of the products, bringing literally millions of parts together   successfully is quite an accomplishment. The Boeing Company leadership measures success by the next quarter, leading to a long series of shortsighted decisions that cost Boeing so much money. I'm hoping that with Jim McNerney leaving that the Jack Welch management model retires with him."
good,"Boeing is for the most part a good company overall.  Here in SC not so much.  Managers are not held accountable, there is no advancement opportunities if your not friends with your boss or your boss doesn't flat out like you.  Been turned away for several jobs that I am highly qualified for to only have a newbee come in from another site or hire someone  with no experience at a higher salary.   After 7 years here, actively looking for another job."
good,"There are a lot of good people working together for technical excellence."
good,"Although many engineers are great people with tremendous knowledge and skills, management is often weak and unable to manage teams effectively. The company lack knowledge transfer processes and better management."
good,"•a typical day at work: is nothing less than 10hr day,doing same jobs on a 2 day cycle,then after that work down line on jobs someone else didn't get done and try to learn that job as well as your own"
good,"lavoro che si svolgeva solo di notte dalle 23.00 alle 9.00 del mattino dopo."
good,"I had a very professional and 'rich in experience' employment at Boeing until I came up to work at the Everett plant permanently.  The union is very helpful one on one but in general the union and the management create an environment that is very negatively competitive.  My experience was that they are not open to diversity including different ways of thinking or speaking other than the way the people think and speak that run the organization.  It is a hostile environment and is run on 'management by gossip', back stabbing and the buddy system.  My sense is that they are very behind in the way they think and do business.  I've heard from Boeing folks in the Renton area that it is well known that the Everett plant is run this way.  I'm not sure if it's just the culture or because it is such a large plant in numbers of employees.  I retired early because of it."
good,"it was a fun yet challenging workplace and even as a temporary employee i learned skills to make me better in the logistics and warehousing industry. The management was fair but really did not engage in the everyday working of running the stockroom, and most of my co-workers were good honest and hardworking indidviduals, the hardest part of my job was that it did not provide adequate job security which was expected because i was a temporary worker.The most enjoyable things of the job was learning new things and meeting some great people."
good,-Full day of work and then some; over-time required (days and weekends) to keep up with scheduled work load.
good,"Co-workers are friendly, ."
good,A place where you can learn alot from diversity and senior employees- Everett
good,"Job itself was great. co-workers were great. awesome benefits. management, that's a whole other story. I have never worked for a company whose management stabs you in the day every other day. This is a new program and whenever they bring in a new manager from a different plant, they want to run things their way. This project is on a totally different level hen building a sheet metal plane and they need to earn the ropes before barking orders. Company has no structure. Different areas in the each Cell are behind schedule but they make it mandatory for everyone in the cell to come in. They wait til the last minute to tell you that you have to come in and work on the weekend or to tell you that they are changing you work schedule so instead of an 8 hr day you are working 10 to 12 hr days. There is no life/work balance with them."
good,"Very low pay for the job we do, especially when you compare what they pay others in washington."
good,I spent the majorite of my life working for Boeing Company and it provide very well for me and my family.
good,great place to make a living great pay great learning environment
good,"Good starting place and free education is a big bonus if you take advantage of, however, they are lower pay than most and benefits packages have severely decreased."
good,"It's a job, didn't expect to be supported by Boeing or management when times get tough in your personal life.  YOU are a number, and if you become too expensive for Boeing, they will find a way to get rid of you."
good,"This company offers great benefits. In today’s world they do offer great health benefits and pay that you may not be able to get elsewhere, especially in San Antonio"
good,"Previous employee (25 yrs ago), but the culture hasn't changed. Management is still top-heavy, and employees are overworked (in 777 Structures) - but laziness is evident throughout the factory. "
good,"inconsistent work place with poor management, employees are not paid fairly or promoted fairly for their work or accomplishments, time and experience will do nothing as they hire people that do not know much about the industry."
good,"I was employee at Boeing through a contract job with Xerox. There were no benefits. The contract lasts for 18 months and is subject to revision. Boeing will either have Xerox renew your contract and keep you, hire you directly from Xerox or have Xerox let you go."
good,"The health insurance and 401k contributions are great"
good,"There are many opportunities to grow at Boeing.  If you're young and eager to learn (and open to travel), this could be a good company for you.  Average compensation and good benefits package."
good,"Been there are long time and this is what I have to offer. These thoughts are purely my personal opinion."
good,"Boeing is a fine company.  Truthfully doesn't offer advancement and can become a trap of convenience.  Once assigned, that is where you will stagnate."
good,"If it's important to you, be sure to get your questions answered regarding teaming, the cultural awareness or involvement.  If possible, interview with the team you'll be working with"
good,Boeing used to be a great company to work for when I was hired on. I chose them over three other major players because of their industry leading benefits. However they got a severe case of corporate greed around 2012 and have been cutting pay and benefits ever since. My advice is for younger engineers to stay there for two or three years then move on.
good,"The job is not difficult, There may be days when you have a challenge arise, but there are enough talented individuals that could help with any issue."
good,"Boeing was a little passive on quality, they often don't take the time to really review production in the right way. Overall they are an ok company to work for"
good,"it is all about schedule and delivery.  First time quality, care and concern for employees do not exist at this facility.  Though Boeing does offer outstanding benefits I am not sure the level of stress, the lack of constructive leadership from management and a culture of who cares makes it very difficult to work"
good,I am not in a position to say. That is a complicated question for sure.I really do not think it is relative to my applying for jobs on this sight. I mean really!
good,Boeing was a wonderful place to work.  I was blessed to work on many different aerospace products and services.  I learned something new every day and valued working with experts in many different fields. Boeing is a technology giant and continues to innovate it's way into the future.
good,Typical day was alright standard meeting in the morning follow the job instructions. easy work sometimes stressful not for the work but the people. i do recommend 2nd shift instead of 1st.
good,The managers at Boeing are walking high without a union to set them in place they make there on own rules and pick favorites until they are managed this place can be down right brutal.
good,"fast paced,hard working  they have good benefits excessive over time"
good,"No review expected, the company is in the middle of transition from support of the Space Shuttle to work on the SLS vehicle.  Other than that, the company is iffy when it comes to supporting the end user."
good,"Boeing is slow moving, is incredibly great at work life balance but sucks at helping people move up the ladder. Everyone is underpayed, and everyone complains about it, yet, nothing is changed from a compensation perspective."
good,manypeople have worked there  along time. you have to develop a thick skin. I love the people I work with however there are a lot of politics and clic and people getting upset over the littlest things. its common
good,2 people can work for Boeing but have totally opposite Boeing Experiences. So you Career and Happiness in your job greatly depends on who your manager was.
good,"Running off the back of big Boeing, with all the paper work, but not all the experience. Some of the tools employed actually make the work harder and hinder rather than help. Several things were backwards with the PM doing all the work for many other sections which then plugged that information into their bespoke system. A nightmare PM role."
good,"Boeing Seattle lost it's core culture that was valued so highly at one time. Layers of incompetent ""leaders"" just looking to climb the ladder who don't really care about the product."
good,"Worked there 25 years and found that the culture changed...to where my skills were no longer really valued.  Makes sense though, I guess...after that long."
good,"seniority is everything at Boeing, however even with thirty-five years management found items to write me right me up on and the union failed to help me out.  Management are ego driven and not people driven."
good,"Pros"
good,"I leaned that working for a great team of people made my life more fulfilling.   I really enjoy working as a team and completed projects together that help make the company be more strong am successful.   I also enjoyed working with interns and new hires because I learned so many great ways of doing things better and thinking more proactively.  I also enjoy when I leave for the day so I can go home and play with my dog,  I feel good about myself, that I make a positive difference at work and hopefully to my team and my managers.  I love to work and it makes me feel good inside."
good,"The culture is a mix between the older and newer employee's, depending on the group you're assigned to can depend on how much change and improvement you can implement.  Management is a reflection of this with levels of favoritism depending on who you know."
good,"Boeing has always had very interesting work and above average benefits. Boeing has flexible time and work from home options, which is a great benefit to those with children or who are a caregiver. "
good,"Not all divisions within Boeing are the same, pay the same or have all the same benefits.  Boeing is a very large company and has a well established culture.  Many changes are taking place right now, especially at the management level."
good,Money is the only motivation. Not worth the stress and headache that you have to endur in your time there. You never get to spend your money and see sunshine.
good,"Great company to build your career, but not without the typical big company pros and cons.  Current business environment is not really conducive towards a happy and healthy work environment though."
good,"The work is fun and challenging. The pay is great!. But, the worst part of the Boeing Company is the Management and HR. They don't care about you. You are just a number and HR is employed by Boeing to actively try and fire employees. They get raises and promoted for it. And then your fellow Employees constantly try to get each other in trouble or fired. Everyone is always stressed over there attendance because you can get fired for being 1 second late. Boeing reminds me of high school with all the gossip."
good,"Workplace culture is horrible, regardless of incredible efforts, training, year-long plans and MBU changes to make a difference.  Not enough emphasis on culture.  Only on money.  Money is still the focus today.  Not customers, not people, not airplanes.  Just money."
good,"The aerospace industry in socal is somewhat volatile."
good,"Boeing job culture is toxic. There is a disconnect between management and the people doing the work. Also, they do not value the work and innovation of employees, but merely the cutting of costs by whatever means necessary."
good,"Lots of supporting the managers with creating and updating constantly changing and repeating processes and metric gathering activities."
good,"The pay and benefits are above average. However too many managers believe in Theory X management and believe fear and intimidation are needed to get the job done.  Good managers, who try and promote employee growth are passed over for those who only know how to please their boss."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Boeing is overall a good company to work for.  However, the culture used to promote ""people first"".  The current work culture is changing.  Jobs are being eliminated at current sites and being cored up at central locations."
good,"A good place to work.  The benefits are very good and the work life  balance is ideal."
good,This company is good with its benefits but when it comes to compensation and work ethic of employees needs work and for the company to save money they ask too much of employees and don't look at management
good,"Great place to start as an aerospace engineer and learn the rope. However, advancement is contingent on really knowing the right people. The hardest workers are rarely recognized for some of their monumental achievements, because the 'ones everybody knows' tend to get the spotlight and promotions."
good,"Poor management "
good,"lots of good activities and performance, worked well with union team, dysfunction of certain teams in undercutting and back channel communications encouraged and impacted trust among and between team members."
good,"Too many competing priorities, too many senior leaders no one in charge, driving wasted efforts, sr leaders do not know business Need to learn to listen, messages are filtered layer by layer, need to let people talk to sr leaders. SSG drives poor decisions"
good,"Not much support for career development for engineers. Management out of touch, hands off and do not want to support. Dated/backwards IT policies and computing resources, out of date software etc. Treated just as another cog in the machine. Lots of stovepipe organizations and red-tape, waste more time and money in endless meeting cycles, far too many layers of approval."
good,"I was a business operations specialist for 2 years, which was spent managing an executive's business, leading annual planning, supporting cross-team coordination.  Team used Excel for everything except analytics and had no desire to transition to a more efficient (or appropriate) tool.  I sat in a mauve, broken cube with a broken chair.  Mother's room was an old broom closet.  Quality of work was low across the group, which was probably ok because so were the expectations and there was a lack of accountability across all levels.  There appeared to be no potential for career advancement during my time with the company (many layoffs).  Benefits package is good for some things, but has terrible (almost no) mental health care coverage - which includes coverage for autism.  "
good,"I was laid off after 16 years of excellent performance. And during those 16 years, the threat of layoff was constant. Keeping employees scared is no way to keep them motivated. Also, company leadership has NO visibility of what the day-to-day workers actually do."
good,Much too difficult to write a review.  I am concerned about a review being misconstrued.  You are better off at this company if you have an engineering degree.
good,"Painfully boring job, lots of politics as to who advances in the company. No one leaves though, because the pay and benefits are too good to give up, so expect to work with a bunch of older guys and gals who hate their job but won't do anything about it. If you want an easy job that's hard to get fired from, well, this is it."
good,great medical/401K/time off.  Although making a difference or change is almost impossible.  This is no amazon and some of the best new talent is in and out in a year because of the lack of room to grow and be creative.  Very compartmentalized with little opportunity to advance.
good,"Boeing is a great place to work. Employees are considered to be the company's most valuable asset when in turn its not a true statement. Performance is not valued across the company; therefore, good employees seek opportunities elsewhere.. Company vision is not aligned to its strategy. I managed to be with the company for a very long time due to my great attitude and work ethic."
good,"Overall is a good company to work, however, lately due to bad management many talented engineers are discontent. They are bending over backwards to bring in young inexperience engineers and can’t wait to get rid of senior work force."
good,Good job one day then terrible the next. Leaders are old and not open to new ideas. Everyone is trying to please the person above them instead of looking out for their employees.
good,Instead of embracing new views and ideas it tends to just be an ongoing dilemma of can'ts and won'ts because while the idea maybe a great one the company has made the paperwork impossible to change.
good,The Culture is suffering. It is difficult to come to work everyday when everyone around you is unmotivated and complains about their job constantly. Management should go undercover in the factory because I think they would be shocked by this culture compared to the offices.
good,overall a good company to work for.. I have worked for this company fo 25 years and have learned alot. Its a good company because they are all over the world
good,arrive bright and early to catch shuttle to main building. All work all day everyday. No real work life balance. work no less then 6 days a week and sometimes 7. Great money but long hours
good,"Great Place to work out of College, not knowing what to expect.. Does give you the experience needed with in discipline. Need more of a Reverse flow down to Production.. So that everyone is on the same page"
good,"Constant layoffs, unless you're management or an engineer, you stand a good chance of being laid off."
good,"Family has worked at Boeing since the early 1980;s     the stories that were told at the dinner table back then led me to try   lasted a year and was laid off (c best part time job you will ever have is the saying)    tried again in 2008 with the downturn    was a pretty good feeling to be chosen and hired. the managers were all still old school and knew what the job was and how it got done, as that group has retired the new influx has no aircraft assembly experiance or desire to learn     just as you get your self comfortable in an area of assembly  you get moved to another. time after time.    frustrating"
good,50 to 60 hr work weeks not uncommon. Work environment can be stressful but the people you work with are first class. Was a great experience building airplanes.
good,"People in general are great to work with and there is lots of opportunity to learn new roles, process and look for efficiencies. Unable to provide more information."
good,"I truly enjoyed my position at the boeing company although job-security was not there.   The company has 2-3 layoffs per year, which puts everybody on edge."
good,"There's nothing wrong with Boeing, but there's not a lot going for it either. It's great to work for an established company, but there are too many layers of management. They are also pushing cash flow as the number one measure of success. Doing more with less is the motto of the second century. There are plenty of people doing jobs that were previously done by 2 or 3 people."
good,A high stress project with long hours and is very understaffed. Avoid unless you are looking to work for Boeing and transfer out.There are a lot of young professionals that are being taken advantage of and are more often than not looking to jump ship.
good,"this has been a fair company to work at. But as competition gets stronger and effects boeing revenue, they are slowly decaying as one of the better companies to work for. The poor planning will limit the overall growth of the company and the employees."
good,"lacked leadership and enough people to do the work , leading to over working the staff and getting people hurt .   Always robbing peter to pay paul to get the work done ."
good,"Lots of good people there and product is interesting. Challenge is in the size of bureaucracy, however, great place for learning."
good,"Difficult work day to day with Job uncertainty, Management not fully versed in infrastructure and tasks. Long term vision of Company hampered by short term needs. Good team but large work statements are common"
good,the work is all hands on all profesionals. work is all for DOD great place to learn. thoughthe work can be monotnous from time to time.
good,Boeing is a good company but stay away from the IT Software and HW area in Renton.  The SSG management team at the top there is dishonest.  They have no concern for Ethics and will bend you over backwards to protect themselves.  If you do something honest for the company they will look the other way if they feel you have undermined them.  I spoke up to do the right thing and the management there released several of us to save money and get rid of those who questioned policies and procedures that we felt could be improved.  I enjoyed my co-workers very much and working with everyone except the management team as you can't trust them.
good,"I have learned so much about working and drilling metals, fixing items previously damaged by some means while in our hanger. I love working so the hardest part of the job for me is when I have nothing to do. I live to build and fix everything I can and have a ridiculous number of certifications to keep me from running out of work. The greatest joy is the final product being bought by QA and/or customer QA."
good,Very slow moving organization that models the government that it serves. Lots of redundancy and not much room for innovation.
good,Boeing is a very large company that has a high standard for pushing the limits in the aerospace industry.  The common good of the employees gets lost in this. I personally find the automotive field is a better fit for me. I have worked both and the manufacturing side of it is move more professinal.
good,Simplification occurring. Downsizing many departments. Benefits are great. Management varies. Lots of work. Many cliques. Older team members waiting for their retirement payoffs. Younger team members are most cohesive group. Mostly on the job training. Culture is changing. Great products make you proud of the work you do.
good,"Interesting work is available, but company has not been winning major  new defense contract awards. "
good,"Boeing is a great place to work, if your fresh out of college. That being said, if your highly motivated, always want more, and are not satisfied with being around average engineers people then this is not the place for you."
good,The company is behind the curve in adopting technology that will allow for rapid deployment of airplanes and additional aerospace products. The competition has caught up and is on track to surpass Boeing. If Boeing doesn't adopt a culture of competitiveness and innovation it will fail hard.
good,"I loved my job and what I did. Just a lot of things that are very unfair and overlooked. Great people working with, but HR and manangment need much work."
good,Boeing is a large business interested in reducing cost by eliminating experienced employees.  Top heavy organization.  It believes tenured programs can be run and managed by entry level workers.
good,I am a Contractor at Boeing SC. I don't get any benefits or perks. I don't have a say in which shift I'm put on. They get holiday pay and double pay on certain days. I make the same pay all year and two weeks out that I don't get paid because the plant is closed.
good,"I work in a newly formed data science/analytics team to analyze aircraft data and provide recommendations to avoid aircraft delays using predictive modeling and statistical methodology. I usually use a lot of R and SQL. "
good,"Highly specialized work that is interesting throughout most of the facility and the work is performed by a good group of knowledgeable people.  Corporate flow downs tend to be counterproductive to production.  Local management inhibits production due to an inability to effective manage people, training requirements, and customer interaction."
good,"If you are a space enthusiast, Boeing may be a good fit for you.  Career progression is based on who you know not what you know.  Not an ideal workplace for Millennials."
good,"Good salary, top heavy, driven my management decisions and less on engineering. Lots of opportunities to move around to various programs and locations."
good,"Customer focused, efficiency driven, fast paced, constant change, integrated business systems, state-of-the-art products and services, one-company mentality."
good,"Was a great company, until they decided the pension plan was too expensive and management decided to get rid of life-time employees w/ years of experience.  This was a bad idea in the 90's, when Boeing offered a retirement package that was to good to be true.  The brains and tribal knowledge walked out the door and the CEO admitted it was a mistake."
good,Managers tend to not know a thing about the work in the area they manage. Political Correctness is the key criteria for selecting managers.
good,"•	Support of in-house custom software for on-line manuals and aircraft documentation "
good,"Great pay, Horrible mandatory Overtime. Management likes to play head games. I learned alot about building aircraft."
good,"Pros: Good work life balance. Many different jobs within company. "
good,"Great pay! Not much direction, a lot of wasted time in meetings."
good,"Recieved 250 hours of factory 737NG training which we brought back and attempted to support the Navy with. It was challenging to incorporate civilians in to the Navy work centers and for a year we were a wipping post for anything Boeing. "
good,"If someone asked how did you like working for Boeing, I would have to reply ""it depends who you worked for. Many great managers were more exceptions than the rule. Good people people. Others were too eager to advance at the expence of others."
good,The company was B E Aerospace. I was a vendor for seats on all AC. The job itself was quite rewarding but management was horrible.
good,"Unexpected meetings, no structure in process."
good,"A typical day at work is very long and testing. Learned a lot about how to follow processes and patience. Management, don't have much to say about management. Co-workers are tired, stressed out and all in all good people just being overworked. Hardest part of the job is the over time and waiting for corrections to complete jobs. Most enjoyable part of the job, there aren't any."
good,"Not a bad place overall, new manager was brought in from another division and acted like she was working with military contractors and not everyday people working accounting."
good,I'm not prepared to discuss my assessment of Boeing at this tine.
good,"The company changed when they bought MD. Benefits changed, management especially changed. Almost all the computing has been outsourced to India, or other countries I just hope they don't go to far down cause I would like to receive some retirement."
good,"This place is like working for the government. They hire a lot of contractors. Contractors are laid off at a whim. If you are hired ""direct,"" you get great benefits."
good,"Too much redundancy, factory work. Sat in cubicle hardly interacted with anyone. Constant work flow was hard to keep up. Management was clueless to the needs of their workers even though we expressed the problems frequently.There was favoritism to some employees, giving them the choice jobs and also let them do nothing much of the time. Some co-workers were friendly but most kept to themselves because interaction with eachother was frowned upon"
good,"Great company to work for, but this particular work site is very disorganized"
good,My experience with Boeing had its ups and downs. I was working there through a temp agency and there was no room for advancement.
good,"Good work, but not valorate employe, good co-workers, I enjoy services to customers."
good,"Well, even with a Master's degree in Management, it got me nowhere. It just didn't matter. It was a ""Good ole boy!"" thing. If you were liked, you got a bone."
good,"When I went to work for Boeing the facility engineers were world class and everyone knew it. Their procedures and policies combined with the close interaction between senior and junior engineers resulted in well considered designs. When Boeing decided to manage engineers with accountants and business majors, the moral, design quality, and culture shifted drastically south."
good,"Boeing doesn't provide the same modern work/life balancing options many other major companies around the Seattle/Bellevue offer."
good,Management needs to be revamped. They keep adding more managers to manage the managers instead of addressing the main issues. Makes for a very poor working atmosphere.
good,"As a methods process analyst in the IRC you will print paper that tells the mechanics what to build, how to build it, and when to complete it by. That is all."
good,There isn't a lot I can say about this company.  I work in a highly proprietary environment.  I can't share much of what I do.  All I can say is there is a lot of walking to get parts and supplies in my job.
good,"Boeing does believe in growth within yourself. Once you get your foot in the door, you have many options to grow. You must make connections and have drive to move within the company."
good,Work when there work and sit when there isn’t. If you have opinions or ideas keep them to yourself no one absolutely no one wants you to succeed more than you. Watch out for the fakes they get friendly until they backstab you or snitch on things you didn’t do or did with out knowing is wrong. It’s not healthy. It’s a toxic environment especially for anyone with morals and humility.
good,If you’re looking for growth within this is a  Great company to start at and it will develop your career and grow. Management is willing to help you excel.
good,"Management did not support the engineers working to get the work done."
good,Management does not work together for the benefit company.  Most are focused on their advancement and not helping employees to be their best.  The last 5 years at Boeing the focus was on cost savings and stock price and not on innovation and product improvements.
good,"Boeing builds the best airplanes in the world! Workplace culture has shifted from employees being respected, valued and treated like family to employees seen as expendable resources.Products and services are high quality."
good,"It was close to home and paid well, but as a contractor I had to jump through hoops to try to get hired on just to get benefits or PTO. The organization of work was rushed and all the blame was dumped on the person receiving the work."
good,"Mostly good co-workers, mostly good management, mostly interesting work in my case, flexible schedule, no micro-management. The problem is compensation. Salaries are low across the board, and the only way to advance is to frequently change jobs."
good,Typical workday is 10-12 hours and weekends are expected. typical manufacturing environment. Its not a bad company to work for if you don't mind putting in the time.
good,The environment at business division I worked at was scaled down to the bone in terms of human resources. Too much responsibility was put on the small group.
good,Boeing is just like any other big name company. Just worried about sales and making money. Unless you're in management or an executive position they truly don't care about the people on the production floors building the product that makes the company money.
good,"I have observed a non professional workplace culture in my area as a structure mechanic. For example, often I experienced a fowl language by many mechanics and some managers. I could not believe it until I was on the work floor where aircrafts were built!"
good,Boeing provides a lot of opportunities once you are in the door.  Make sure to pursue a mentor that has influence and that will help you get ahead in the organization you want to be a part of.
good,I worked really hard and smart on projects but highly competitive and only sometimes rewarding...good if you wear dockers.  The upper management is disconnected to the workers and feels top heavy.  Middle Management struggles for purpose. Cool jobs or projects but you run Into so many barriers and old timers like to stop you from making a difference.  Critical thinking is seen as outside the box and not in a good way.  But super smart people who are trained to not have passion so they give up.  Kinda sad as so much potential.
good,"stressful, too much overtime, unfair treatment of employees. lower management is good but upper management is not. great benefit package but turnover of management very high."
good,"good money"
good,to many managers.. to much stress. to many required overtime hours..not a good place to work if you expect to be able to spend time with family due to production quotas
good,"While the Boeing Company is a good company to work for overall, it does allow for ego management to prevail.  Upper management is so stressed that they feel threatened by new ideas or ways of managing.  Its unfortunate."
good,The security is not good. Layoffs happen. The advancement is difficult. You have to tell them you want more. You have to say you want to move up. You can be a great employee and nobody knows. You must be aggressive in self promotion. Sad but true.
good,"Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems. We are engineers and technicians. Skilled scientists and thinkers. Bold innovators and dreamers. We all work together to do amazing things."
good,"I have worked maybe 7-8 total years on and off at Boeing as a contractor, usually as some type of Analyst, and appreciate that Boeing pays more than most other jobs available to me.  So I work there when I can.  Contracting is all right because I don't need benefits."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work for a entry level job. It is a good place to work if you use the educational benefits and work hard and you can advance like all companies it is what you make it,"
good,I was contracted to Boeing by another company. My experience with the employees at Boeing was always a pleasant one and I made many acquaintances. I left the job because I was working 7 days a week and never seeing my family.
good,"My organization is held to metrics, metrics &  dead lines. Due to the downsizing in the company it is extremely difficult to perform my job in providing the internal/external customer with a timely response,"
good,Very often they make changes that are not productive. The group I work with there are very often numerous organization changes each year.   Very often not for the good of the employees.
good,"Working for Boeing had some incredible moments... but there were also those events that completely negate the good. Being laid off after 23 years of ""exceeds expectations"" level performance was one such event"
good,Great corporate leadership. Don't worry if you don't like your manager...you will get a new one in a few months. The incentives are worth daily grind.
good,It's a good all-around aerospace company for engineers to go into before they decide to specialize. There's also room to specialize within the company but the pace may not be favorable to younger generation.
good,"Not a conducive environment for a happy work/life balance.  Boeing protects management and above, but does not recognize the struggles or frustration of the typical 9-5 worker."
good,Roles are very specific regardless of skills.  The environment is necessarily very process driven.   Oftentimes it is not what you do but how you do it that matters.
good,Not sure if I can really give a complete review as the organization that I was in no longer exists.  It was merged in with Lockheed Martin to create United Launch Alliance after I left
good,Management doesn't do anything or care. They act they will help you advance but the lack of advancement opportunities is frustrating. The benefits are great but it feels like they are slowly taking them away and costing more for health care. The work culture is horrible and filled with a bunch of grumpy old men.
good,"With 100 years of history, there are many lessons learned that have shaped processes and business practices. This can be an impediment when trying to be nimble and relevant in today's global economy. Boeing's CEO is driving the right culture, however the message is getting lost one or two levels below him."
good,"I thought Boeing was going to be my forever job out of the military. But quickly I learned that the leadership was not interested in who was the best fit for the job, but how much can they get away with. There were managers on the assembly line of final assembly that had never been in aviation in their lives. But because they were a woman, and Boeing needed to meet certain criteria for EEO, this lady was put into place as a manager. After 6 months of applying to manager positions, with 10 years active duty military and aviation experience, manager / leadership experience, not one single interview was offered to me and several of my counterparts, who all fit the manager role requirements and more."
good,"It's a big company. Your work group and manager can make a huge difference. There are some stellar people, and also some leaches. Benefits are still good but degrade each year. There is no maternity leave (they try to pass off a combination of short term disability and FMLA), which is their largest disparity with comparable companies benefits wise. You will get bogged down in processes and electronic paperwork. Pay is reasonable. Transparency is limited. Be prepared to be your own advocate."
good,"A typical day includes attempting to use applications without training to accomplish tasks targeted to a shifting set of priorities.  I have built strong relationships across department lines, but that is counter-cultural and takes time away from my duties.  This has put me at odds with management on more than one occasion.  However, without those relationships, I would not be able to complete my tasks."
good,"it all depends on what group you work for at Boeing that determines your work experience. Boeing is a collection of many companies under one umbrella. "
good,"Poor management, favoritism, lack of advancement, low morale, depressing work environment. Coworkers were great to work with, but everyone was struggling with poor management and wage concerns."
good,Boeing pays well for hourly represented employees. The problem is the culture. The majority of people dont really care because they feel the company has wide open pockets and will cut you at any time it feels necessary.
good,"Management was not very strong. I felt they moved in quickly and hired a lot of unqualified people. The Boeing employees as a hole did not work very hard and several times they hired contractors to get them caught up and then just let the very good contractors go, and kept the poor Boeing employees. Good old boy plant you have to know someone to get anywhere in the organization"
good,"During the last 10 years as the company got into trouble with ethics issues and the economy got tight and the employees who were not unionized paid the price.   Bonuses, awards, recognition programs and raises suffered.  HR became any office only interested in protecting the low level managers, personnel below them waste their time complaining to HR and have no anonymity in the reporting system. Employee survey results are questioned by management and leads are forced to have shop meetings to determine who is doing the complaining.  Facilities do not meet contract requirements for safety, OSHA, ESD requirements, particulate testing and more.  On-site Safety and Facility personnel work together to smoke screen findings, likely for profit reasons."
good,Overall good pay and benefits.  The company has changed and limited promotions and opportunities.  Management needs to be people focused.  The ability to relocate for other opportunities is present.
good,"Great place to work overall. The most nepotism I have ever experienced (hiring managers kids with zero experience and hired them as ""senior technicians"" most of them didn't know the names of basic hand tools or which way to turn a bolt to tighten it) Only opportunity for advancement is if you got into the corrupt management clique."
good,There is no future here.  Boeing does not promote their employees.  Only Managers get promoted.  I do like the time off at Christmas.  No future for Engineers.
good,New CEO- exciting changes are being made to reinvigorate the company culture. Hopefully it will result in a culture of team work and a feeling of security that fosters innovation.
good,you just have to be in the right group as there is a lot of autonomy in the organization and lots of chaos when there is an enterprise wide change that gets rolled out
good,"From the start, there is no sufficient training on their internal ERP system.  Many of the employees are overworked and are unable to support or train new employees.  The lack of support causes frustrations among new employees which causes many of them to leave the company or department as soon as another opportunity is available."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Boeing, had opportunity to learn a lot and acquire many skills,  Was constantly called on for special assignments because of my ability to handle large assignments,"
good,Working for BR&T can be rewarding but the job quality varies depending on your project. Some projects get a lot of funding and support and you can make a difference other projects lurch along from crisis to crisis with the constant threat of cancellation.
good,"Typical day at work includes being pulled in several directions at any given moment and having to make a decision on which hot topic gets precedence. At the end of the day your main task usually is not accomplished if you were required to spend your dayin reaction mode. "
good,"I love to get the jobs done that no one wants to take on, Boeing let me do that everyday. Great group of people to learn from and work side by side with."
good,Everyone is wonderful and diverse and the atmosphere is amazing. Boeing really nurtures you and your skills and personal interests and offer a plentiful range of opportunities.
good,"Family day was always great, but it depended on who your manager it was not great. Most of the managers only care about themselves and not the people that worked for him"
good,"I actually liked the work I was doing and they have great benefits, but it's very hard to get raises and promotions there. Sometimes you can get promoted without compensation.  Fewer satellites are being built so there were a lot of lay offs."
good,Boeing has excellent training programs and is an excellent company for someone just starting their career.  The benefits are good too.  Excellent for someone with a family and just starting out.
good,"Great company to work for,stressful environment with a lot of management changes. Great people to work with. Long work days avg. 12  hour per day with no paid overtime."
good,"Every day is a new day of opportunity and challenges, Boeing became like a small city of different types of jobs and persons that is there working to maintain their life style building 787 dreamliner"
good,Great place to work for a single person that doesn't mind relocating and dealing with layoffs and chasing a job.  I would probably still work there if I had not been laid off due to plant closure.
good,"It is very easy to get lost in all the policies and procedures.  You are not valued, you are a number.  If you want to stand out and make a difference, this is not the company to work for."
good,I was working 9-10 h. a day plus 6h  Saturday and Sunday. a productive days of work fun work place until the end. Tide schedules due to minimum work force.
good,"My co-workers were one of the best parts of the job.  There are many very talented, personable people who work there.  I admire their professionalism, and enjoyed becoming friends with some of them."
good,"Very little change, very little advancement.  There is an attitude of ""that's the way it has always been so that is the way it should stay"".  There is minimum room for innovation."
good,Increasingly managed by inexperienced leaders that are not qualified to manage the people they manage.  Benefits continue to get shaved away.  Experience and performance takes a back seat to being able to talk a good PowerPoint presentation
good,"Going through a great deal of change, be unsure of future roles. Many employees are nervous about the future. Can actually be positive. Change is needed."
good,"The fluctuating workforce makes you always feel like you are a sitting duck in duck season. The hardest part is the constant change, management rotations occur frequently."
good,"40 hr work week with paid OT if you do work it. There are career opportunities, but it's entirely dependent on your management. Airplane life cycle is extremely long and production rates are very low, which is standard for aerospace industry but still frustrating when you want to put in the extra time and you can't."
good,Lots of experienced people around to ask questions and learn from. Such a large company that there are many different positions to gain experience from.
good,"Constant state of change, very few opportunities especially as a consultant.  Very good work life balance is possible and there are many very industry knowledgeable people who will assist you if needed."
good,"The work itself is fulfilling with a good sense of accomplishment. There is a high level of stress as management struggles with work place reality and unrealistic higher management expectations. The hardest part of the job is coping with the unrealistic ""do more with less"" philosophy of higher management. What I learned was that as an individual with 35 years of manufacturing experience the Boeing company didn't consider me very valuable.The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a team that builds the best airplanes in the world."
good,"Boeing builds some of the world's most advanced and exciting products, but it seems only a handful of individuals get to work on those products. When you are brought in you are told there is so much room for promotion and growth and you can move all over the country or world. I haven't seen any evidence of this. Boeing brought in a large number of young talent for the IT department, but doesn't know what to do with them and is at severe risk of them leaving since they don't give them any chance to grow."
good,"Compensation and benefits were incredible, culture and the people are not so great. hours aren't the best, on 2nd shift your there till past 10, on 1st shift start time is very early ( good if you like getting of earlier in the day)"
good,Company culture is not employee friendly as the management is not looking to the future to create jobs; they are only interested in the short term profits.
good,"Company culture is outdated and micromanagement ran rampant on a daily basis (little autonomy and decision making power for newer employees).  Also, compensation was lackluster for any position other than in management and engineering."
good,"The benefits appear to be good relative to other companies. The company is very big so there are opportunities to move around and gain exposure to different parts of the business. Getting promoted can be a challenge however. Also, Boeing has been doing layoffs at least once a year so job security is always uncertain, particularly if you are an older, experienced employee."
good,"Slow to change and behind the times. Looking towards making changes for the future, and if they do they will be in a better place to compete in the market and keep the company alive going forward.  Makes for an unstable and anxious workforce.  Size and complexity are problems.  Often work doesn't feel like it is adding value. "
good,Multi-Tasking to place several contracts with different programs. Management is matrix driven. Compensation is not competitive with the job market. Very flexible and understanding when it comes to accommodating personal schedules.
good,"Management pulls a lot of bone head stunts. Myself...I have a three strikes-yer out! policy. Strike three was them wanting me to build an airliner with drawings that had no dimentions. Yep...I asked if they had been drinking ""Electric Kool-Ade"" or smoking rope. They got that first 787 built...but it took three years."
good,"Great place to start a career and grow your skill set. But like any other aerospace company, tons of red tape and it can be hard to advance."
good,"People at boeing have changed due to job insecurities, what was once a team oriented work place has changed to the feeling of everybody for themselves. So sad that management ruined such a great company. Upper management rotations cause directional changes too often, never getting to the goal of the previous manager. Great people who are just trying to survive layoffs year after year."
good,"-A lot of fire fighting; solving recurring daily issues"
good,I would not necessarily recommend working at Boeing. This company does not provide a stable work environment. The ever changing direction of the company does not provide their employees with any sense of security. Work statements seem to be moved without thought of the effect of its people or good transition plans to retain the knowledge. lack of faith in the Leadership and the direction of the company. I feel more like a contractor rather than a full time employee
good,"Decent pay, good benefits, and pretty good job security, but little upward mobility. Best employees end up making up for the shortcomings of other employees. Lots of bureaucracy and little room for creativity. Lack of employee development."
good,I believe my star-ratings say it all. They are trying to turn the culture around. Working in this role overall was like stepping back in time 10 or more years.
good,"If you like making a fair amount of money, and working 56hrs a week or more than apply away."
good,"The job has amazing benefits. They do rely heavily on sales now and practically force you to give off a shopping list to every customer. Management was poor and often would take away opportunities for employees to earn sales credit, by handling a situation themselves."
good,Nice place to work once you become an Boeing employee. The hardest thing about working there as a contractor you have no rights
good,"To many meetings daily."
good,"Good salary and benefits. Excessive red tape, hidden agendas from management, and very political upper structure in this company. Leadership is lacking. Competing work priorities among departments  and engineering groups. Overlapping job functions favor a wasteful work environment. Unclear job responsibilities in many cases. Backstabbing environment when things get difficult."
good,"I loved working on airplanes and being around this culture. However, Boeing is going through a lot of changes and will have some pains associated with that."
good,The work load would change week to week due to the work being all scheduled maintenance. I learned a lot about maintaining eng trailers. People at work were all good to get along with and we all work well together. Being in a shop of eight people was the best part of the job because everyone in the shop is retired Air Force so we didn't require a manager because there was a lead who would give out work assignments and the workers would take their assignments and go work.
good,"flex hours and great work locations with parking, lots of job ops as long as your field doesn't get outsourced.  always got great work reviews and pay raises.   Excellent benefits"
good,It is a good place to be if you want to get stock on the same position for years. You are not getting a promotion unless someone else leaves the company.
good,It was a great place until they implemented their 2016 vision.  It was in response to management problems in  programs that incurred backbreaking cost overruns.  This resulted in restructuring that forced moving programs out of the area to where labor is extremely cheep.
good,"For a place that I spent 7 years at, My only complaint is how poorly management treated people. Management seems to be more worried about completing jobs no matter the cost."
good,"Lots of work, however there is a lack of detailed training and work scope."
good,work environment is too bad super visor and manager will apply their own rules they will not follow the management. They will not report to management properly all of employees opinions
good,Boeing Oklahoma City is a good place to work if your a aircraft electrical design engineer or a supply chain person. This is not a place to work if your a aircraft structures or systems design engineer because they have very little work for these disciplines. What work there is entails installing avionics boxes and drawing sustaining work on very aging military aircraft.
good,"A very ""caught in the 1950's"" work culture"
good,"the management will not think about employees safety and satisfaction and their opinions only for the sake of telling those words to show the market."
good,"Over the past 27 years at Boeing I have been able to work in many different parts of the company.  From inspecting parts at Suppliers, to working on the production line in the factory to certification of the airplane and the delivery process."
good,As a Calibration Specialist it was busy work be much obtainable and manageable. I learn everything is attention to detail and being pro-active. I work with some great people who work as a team. The hardest thing about the job is locating tools to send them to calibration. The most enjoyable was the pay.
good,building 4818- the Highbay. The job was amazing but the leadership was very lacking. Management is fairly new and has no real grasp on man placement or necessary skills.
good,"Boeing really needs to do more than pay lip service to the following:"
good,"The Boeing Company builds amazing products.  The manufacturing site in Everett is vast and dazzling in its scope but at ground level, there is a lot of confusion and wasted time.  Change comes slowly or not at all and 20% of the people do 80% of the work.  There is very little work/life balance and compensation continues to erode."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the combination of internal and external engagement with employees and customers all over the world.
good,unpredictable. poor leadership. Upper management takes to long to improve on anything.My coworkers on second shift is could use more money due to the fact that a lot of the times we worked into the third shift shift. Zero work life balance
good,"Warehouse Lead"
good,"Typical contract work, poor communication between all levels of mngt. between all parties involved. New programs always hard to get started and become a smooth operation."
good,"Work load was constant which is great for a payroll officer, however the management did not support their team members. This makes failure within many teams and productivity very low."
good,"a typical day at work ,I've learned a lot at this company, my co-worker fantastic.management need a little work with there employee on  communication"
good,"Heavy reliance on (well paid) contractors. We got hit with mass lay offs eventually, but it was a pretty good gig while it lasted. The real-employees weren't very inclusive of contractors (not that that's uncommon), but I think they got laid off too."
good,"It's a engineering company, IT is looked as another expense. No technology long term vision, on the IT perspective. Trickle down management objective does not work, daily work does not matter as much as you filling the management objective of Lean +..."
good,"- Great developers that adapt quickly to customers needs."
good,Very flexible work schedule and great benefits. Pay is not good and promotions are impossible to get. It is like any other large corporation.
good,"Working at Boeing has been a great way to learn and expand my knowledge of working with a diverse culture of people. I have worked all 3 shifts, and have liked 3rd the best. I have learned how to be mature with my peers, and learned how to work well with others to succeed."
good,"All in all, a fairly positive experience. Life/work balance is not a main focus. Management on the 787 program is less experienced and less efficient than legacy programs."
good,Work environment not treated equally. Too much fighting between management and union. Workers are put in the middle and made to choose a side instead of working as a team. Workers need a safe environment to do their jobs.
good,"Days are flexible as in this position you are on call 24x7x365.  Typical day will be working with virtual meetings and telecommunications from global clients on various problems and issues relative to their IT environment.  You work daily with a diverse global located team with multicultural experiences and working styles.  "
good,"Two years at Boeing Company was a tremendous experience to me. I have the chance to become an Engineer in Electronic, but by the management's choice I was terminated because I'd experience mental disorder and was absent for three weeks. "
good,"While I truly enjoyed the work I performed, it became obvious over the years that the culture of the specific group I was associated with was counterproductive. In the end, they performed a sweeping upper level cut of highly productive senior engineers due to age and salaries and tried to convince junior-level engineers that this was to open areas of advancement for them. These engineers did not believe them and are being rewarded with further cuts at their levels now."
good,Lower defense spending along with lack of new business is causing Boeing to reduce resources.
good,I enjoyed working with talented co-workers. The job was challenging in the aspect of meeting business goals and objectives both externally with customers and internally with management. I learned how to handle myself in adverse conditions. The hardest aspect of my job was the transition of knowledge to co-workers although I did enjoy the aspect of training.
good,"Potential is ruined by company values; especially ""does what it takes"" which is code for ""works long hours, including time on the road, for weeks on end"""
good,High Stress work environment with lots of challenges - Have had a very long career with the compnay with many opportunities for variety in work experience.
good,would not consider unless not much in other options available.
good,"This company has a lot to offer it's direct employees. But has jumped on the contractor bandwagon with the rest of the industry, and actually refer to the contractors as ""Industry Support."" While I do understand the need for some temporary employees, to make temporary employees a  permanent solution, puts them in the ""take advantage of people"" situation. They will even use the elusive and vague promise of becoming a direct hire to squeeze every bit of energy out of their contractors, and it works! As a result, be prepared for lots of backstabbing, condescension, and lack of cooperation on many tasks, from your fellow contractors.(industry support) As they try to establish themselves above you. But the bad news for these people is they will be going out the door with you,(if you are a contractor) when the company feels it is time for everyone to go, which they do often, and without prior notice. However, if you are looking for a direct hire position, it appears to be a pretty good place to work. If you can catch them in a hiring mode. Good luck! (three stars for direct)"
good,A typical day at work for me is coming in at 3:30PM and getting my computer set up and all of the sites ready that I use for work. Then monitoring the call board for inspection calls. The hardest part of the day is trying to get pertinent information about the job that is necessary to do my job from management. The people I work with are great we have a lot of fun together. Even spend time together cooking out away from work.
good,"I personally enjoy the company Eurest who employees me. We are the food service provider for Boeing. Boeing is a very fast pace and challenging environment. They expect all staff, vendors, and contractors to be available to them at their every beck and call. There is constant change on Boeing side with little to no communication."
good,"No comments at this time.  Learned new software, for the most part co-workers ok, I had new management most was trying to learn their job."
good,"Every day was different from the next, I learned a great deal of knowledge of planes. Management is one of this companies biggest issues, they are behind the times. Like any other place you had a variety of personalities, mostly good people. The hardest part with this place was dealing with management, they really killed productivity, and moral, lack serious training between just common sense, interpersonal communication skills, professionalism, ethics both in business and personal. This company in most aspects is behind in the times and is not doing good business. Boeing could easily make 3X what they are making right now if they just woke up and realized they are hurting this country by doing such poor business and simply not caring. "
good,"In my short time with the company I can say that the benefits are great. You can not beat the health coverage you receive. But there is a push to get younger on the IT side of the business and with that comes some negatives such as lower yearly raises for everyone and lengthened time between promotions (if they even do promote you). Also, the pay is less than what you would receive in other tech companies. "
good,"Maintained C130 type Military aircraft IETIMS."
good,"Do not ever not do work, even if they have nothing for you to do.  "
good,I am not sure I should have stayed my 20 years at this company.  I think maybe the signs that I was not advancing after speaking my mind a few times should have let me know it was time to move on.  Lots of talk about being forthcoming and holding people accountable but not a lot of actual reward for actually doing those things on the management side.
good,"I am not impressed, as a quality inspector Boeing is not too interested in producing a quality product. The metrics are based on how many jobs can ""be sold"" in the pursuit of bean counting. The quality managers are not concerned with process improvement but rather meeting the, out the door schedule. The balance is far in favor of getting it done as opposed to get it done correctly the first time. I am only speaking in reference to the P-8 quality program"
good,"Boeing is a fascinating company, they stand on the forefront of innovation and technology yet they don't really practice what they preach."
good,All depends where you worked at.
good,Tough Defense environment is making it difficult to see a lucrative and advancing career path for Business/Finance employees.
good,"- A typical day at work consists of knocking down specific technical tasks, interspersed with meetings.Rather typical. The meetings rarely start on time and many people are working on their laptops doing other tasks during the meetings."
good,"Some challenging work depending on the work load, can be very slow at times. If you are a new hire the job security will not be there."
good,Good place to learn. Your just a stick person owned by the clock at work. Why do I have to write more than I want in this space? Things forced to do because some BOZO wants 150 characters.
good,It was a ok job had fun company is having issues not  looking great but to big to fail go for hopefully better in the future  anything else read the other reviews
good,"Good place to work"
good,I had no issue with whole process. I left the company because I had job mismatch else profile was good. Very slow paced company and lack of transparency.
good,The company provides excellent compensation and benefits. Overtime expected of employees can be extreme. Twelve hour days and constant weekend work is the norm.
good,"The job is busy and there are always deadlines. You are expected to work over your hours but for no extra pay."
good,"If you are looking for an entry level job or want to work at the same company for 35 years, Boeing is your place. If you are looking to gain functional and transferable skills, you will not get that at Boeing. "
good,"Boeing offers a good benefits package, the medical in particular is a good deal for a lot of people. Work life balance is also usually good, around 40 hours per week. But poor culture, management, and tough path for advancement."
good,"The work is cool, I was able to work on some really challenging and interesting problems during my time at Boeing. That being said, I often felt that I wasn't be allowed or encouraged to grow professionally. Management was mostly non existent and I felt that my peers were not interested in developing."
good,"union and management was what killed it for me, co workers where ok, the work was back and forth never knew what you was going to do. one day very busy next nothing but cleaning the bays all day."
good,"A lot of walking, going up ladders, Working items that nobody has ever worked. Good working hours, good people, but they had people in charge that didn't know what to do, the bad direction at times."
good,"The work is intriguing and interesting; however, management does not understand the work and wastes time with meetings and is unable to make decisions"
good,My work is fast paced and interesting. I work with motivated people. That makes the job bearable. But management that isn't properly engaged makes the work stressful.
good,"As a developer I found I was able to make a real impact and add value to the products I worked on while maintaining a work life balance. It was very rewarding. "
good,The management is not just poor but non-existent. There is zero accountability leading to non-performing embittered and disgruntled life long employees creating a hostile work environment for new employees who try to improve the process. The morale is extremely poor. This culture leads to extreme rates of turnover in many job categories.
good,"19 years ago, but I remember having fun and the work was interesting and fit my skill set just fine. Internal politics and long commute were things that made the job less than wonderful."
good,"Company is okay. You don't have to work hard to get noticed. Most that work there are older and complacent with where they are at, and have been doing the same thing everyday for the past 10-20 years. Very resistant to any change or process improvement. Tends to suck the motivation out of the people trying to work hard. "
good,At Boeing the overall rating is good. The job work and life experience are good as well and the compensation and benefits are excellent. Management does a good job of taking care of their team of workers.
good,Love / Hate. Early in career very satisfying.  Since the mid nineties very disfunctionally managed. The culture has become more non value added practices with not much attention to priorities. Hiring practices based on college degrees excluding on the job experience and the tribal knowledge acquired to produce and maintain.
good,"Lots of corporate buzzwords, corporate training mandates, etc that seem un-impactful to the actual employees. Lack of training for the actual tools you use day to day. The work is varied and enjoyable and can vary from slow to fast paced. Manager competency is hit or miss and they're rarely do a lot for you ""cause their hands are tied"" or ""they can't do anything about it"" but then HR will tell you it is their job to do those things for you. It's a good place to work despite these things. Every place has its upsides and downsides."
good,The greater Seattle Area is a very expensive place to live. Boeing starting wage is 17$ per hour or less for most Union positions. Benefits are better than most companies.
good,"My contract was there for 3 months. We were given an unlimited overtime to finish the product on time as promised to customer.  Because of this overtime, I made most money  in these 3 months as I ever made before. "
good,I would say that I enjoyed the time working at Boeing. I learned something new over there. But they laid off a lot of people in the Creative Service Department. Working there as a contractor didn't have much job security.
good,"Be aware that every site location of Boeing has its on Policy regarding attendance. Some manager disregard policy, which puts your job at risk. May sure to know what the policy is in regard to flexing your time. Make sure you manager also understands the policy to enable to you to be more proficient employee. Also, check to see if you qualify for FMLA."
good,"Nepotism, nepotism, nepotism. They allow managers to bully and disrespect you. They promote whose in “the click”, not whose best qualified. Lack of support so the big wigs can stack their bonuses. Managers put their responsibility on the entry level workers, causes high stress for a position that gets paid peanuts, while the managers are getting huge salaries for doing nothing. Bad culture that’s acceptable to this facility, and the nepotism runs deep. That being said, if they restructured from the top, that’s all it take to make positive changes."
good,"Good place to work for. Department I was in people were very friendly and helpful. "
good,"Over the years, Boeing, like most companies, has started to cater to the millennial over the seasoned employee.  It's as if the company is betting their entire future on what these new employees may be able to provide vs. what the current employees do provide.  If you're in your 40's, or above, your future is pretty much set in stone.  Reaching a technical level 4 is probably it.  Level 5's and above, as well as older level 4's, are always at risk of being tossed out due to the salary they're being paid.  The company is trying to migrate to an average technical level somewhere between 3 and 4.  Once you move from reviews that 'exceed expectations' to ones that simply say 'met expectations', you know your time is limited."
good,"Easy work, very repetitive."
good,"I worked there once.  You either love it or hate it.  If you love it you will go far, if you just want a job this is not for you.  If you get involved you will be thanked over and above for doing your job."
good,"Management at Boeing is a huge problem and is perpetuated by the poor managers who higher poor managers, this is a problem aknowlaged by HR, I experienced a racist manager who openly aknowlaged he was ""going to do to me what the white managers did to him"", to get promotions with Boeing you need to transfer into those positions, not unlike most companies, and like all other companies, politics will loom as a large part of a carreer at Boeing, and if you all go to the same church they will find a way to retain you. If you are dependent on a clearance then ex-Boeing managers will lie to the government investigators to try and hinder your job retention, and Boeing will do nothing."
good,"You'll hear mixed reviews about Boeing, and it does have the usual big company problems (poor program management, you feel like just a number, promotion process is poor, etc.)  But if you're in this business because you love it then you'll be met with incredible resources to do your job and you'll feel like you make a difference.  They're very slow to promote people (painfully so, it's why most people leave), and a lot of us get stuck with a bad boss (someone who doesn't care about your career advancement, more that you're kept in your seat performing in your role to make them look good). But if you get a good manager there you'll be set."
good,Big difference between Boeing Defense and Boeing Commercial. The commercial side has better pay and overall better work environment. If you are considering this company go for the commercial side.
good,"Even thought the compensation was great, not being a full time employee caused us to be treated poorly by management and other employees.I left once it got too bad for me"
good,"The Boeing supply chain sustainment organization (military aircraft side) is not agile and is not responsive to customer needs. Management has talked for years about culture change and growing the business. Sadly, most people in a management role at Boeing have little idea what management skills are, and fewer have or comprehend leadership skills.  The sustainment team is buried in Boeing Procedures born of previous poor decision making and the legal burdens placed on them by the largest customer, the federal government.  All of the processes that mire the organization are not created by Boeing, though MANY are."
good,"On paper, Boeing looks like a great company: great 401k match, prestigious brand, and flexible work hours. But on the inside, there's a lot of room for improvement. Boeing operates on a backlog of work, so there's always something to do. But the back-to-back hard due dates means jumping from one task to the other without the time to tie up loose ends. This means work never gets documented and stuff (machines and software) constantly break because it wasn't adequately tested or debugged. The constant hours dedicated to maintaining and repairing a poorly documented project also adds to slow down the development of new projects."
good,The culture is very different depending on which Manager you were to report to. Each manager had their own way of developing the culture under them. Which then allowed many people upset because some could get more benefits than others as to what they were allowed to do or not do.
good,"There are lots of politics in the work place, company leaders are disconnected from the realities of the business. Pay and benefits are above average at best."
good,"At Boeing where I work, we deal with supporting customers 24/7 daily and this requires us to be focused in reacting to their needs. There is high levels of stress and one needs to stay on top of the situation. It is always comforting to know that you can find help in your colleagues but you must not be afraid to ask when in doubt. Customers can be difficult but it can be handled tactfully when you are professional. Once you know what to do, work is manageable. Best thing is that work can be handed over to the next shift when the end of day end. Hardest part for me is the shift system where we have to run for 2 months duration; morning, afternoon and night."
good,"Not all departments are the same, but overall the company is very top down heavy and old school way of managing and working style. It does promote from within so if you like you department depending on openings there is room for growth."
good,"There were more managers than workers it seemed, and at times you felt short staffed and under the gun to produce."
good,"Boeing is a good company with great pay and benefits.  The company offers educational opportunities, tuition reimbursement and career enhancement.  The 401K matching program is better than most companies."
good,"They are a great company but nowadays the only was to get in is to go through a staffing agency or a contractor agency.  They have very few jobs available at this point as they are trying to lean out each department to make more money while building the planes faster with less employees.  Its a great place to work but they put their business before their employees in a lot of cases. If you voice your opinion about working their and are not happy managers say well there is the door if you don't want to work overtime or don't like something go somewhere else, we have thousands waiting to get hired and we can replace you easily.  But the money and benefits are good if you stay off the radar and keep your opinions to yourself."
good,"Boeing has a lot of opportunities at the moment, but they do not hesitate to fire even top level experienced workers if it will save them a little money"
good,"No future for Admins at Boeing. They don't keep you busy, which means you are always worried about losing your job, which I did. They let me know about my job coming to an end about 6 months in advance, but wouldn't give you a hard end-date. Very stressful."
good,I really like being a mechanic there and the people there are nice when they paid on payday. The management needs to just not let anyone be a person in control and instead should reward the ones that do deserves it.
good,"Boeing is an okay place to work, you'll make good$$."
good,I really enjoyed working at Boeing. The friendly people and the work environment. The appreciation they show for the average employee is great. Hated to leave.
good,"A good place to work. The environment has begun to change from employee-oriented to company oriented. Boeing stresses training and encourages the employee to have a good work and life balance."
good,"There are some great groups to work in with lots of mobility in skill development and responsibility, as well as good leadership and individual development. However there are also lots of groups with dead-end skill sets and little to no management oversight or care. The company as a whole is great for being able to move around to find the right spot for yourself so build a good network for yourself once you are hired. Going the technical route in career development plans is recommended. Management career plans are precarious in that benefits are lower, no pay for overtime, 1st lines are treated horribly, and the politics of higher level management is fit for only those with a ""yes sir"" type mentality."
good,"Some groups had great chemistry and work well with each other and management.  Others (including my former) had a lot of turnover and lacked cohesiveness. This stymied career advancement and movement, frustrating..."
good,Boeing bottom line is to only make the stock holders money.  Boeing does not care about the welfare of there employees.  The immediate management has there hands tied and will not go out on a limb to assist their employees.
good,Good company. Job security is not very good. Production worker mechanics are threatened with lay offs yearly. Engineering workers are threatened with lay offs yearly also.
good,"Fast paced, labor intensive line work. Long days and lots of competition. Communication skills are important. Have to be able to work with lots of different kinds of people. Must know how to work alone and as a team to get jobs complete."
good,Poor managers all the way to the top. They are unwilling to let there specialists manage their sections.  An IT person heads the department who has no idea how to manage the entire security disciplines.
good,In the beginning I love working there. Because they have so many people lineup to work their they don’t care about anyone.tey didn’t care about the workers.company is a great.
good,"The company brand speaks for itself but stagnate growth and pressure to achieve customer satisfaction with 2 year production delay.  Refused to recognize my engineering degree because West Point wasn't ABET accredited, very politically biased."
good,"Managers tended to pick on the female assemblers."
good,"Good communication and collaboration in the workplace."
good,Easy place to work but management has a lack of knowledge in most departments. Some workers end up with life long injuries because of the same motion of work for years.
good,Boeing in process of down sizing and changing culturally. also too top heavy in management positions. A lot of employees feel under valued due to large discrepency in performance reviews vs pay raises.
good,Core admin for a large defence contract. High level meetings daily. Could be a pressured environment. Workplace culture was good for some functions with good management engagement
good,I enjoyed working for Boeing for the most part. Co workers were very nice. And were willing to help explain things when and if they could find the time. The jobs I was assigned were fun but the process takes a lot of time. If you are not in a hurry to have your jobs bought off and don't mind being indoors for 12 to 16 hours for 7 days a week then you may love this job. Not enough time to safely complete jobs in your position and it make it difficult to do after other systems are installed
good,"* A typical day at work is made up of daily tasks sandwiched between many meetings. "
good,"The EHS Program is excellent.  Great group of highly professional, knowledgeable individuals . I would highly recommend the 777 EHS team as a career choice."
good,There was too much drama and office politics the higher up the food chain you get. My last manager hated conflict and had no backbone where his direct employees were concerned - meaning he did not have anyone's back if you worked directly for him.   That was not   the norm for the execs I supported.
good,"While the benefits are better than most companies, it's simply time to move on to other career challenges.  I'm looking for an opportunity to become immersed in some of the newer technologies."
good,Boeing is a good employer that offers career growth and decent pay and benefits. Seattle is a big market place that has alot of competive salaries that are as good or better than boeing.
good,Decision by committee because current management is afraid to be accountable. The Puppet Master at the top of the org has the director and management running scared.  No outside leaders brought in because they would rock the boat and make legacy team make improvements instead of run the same old paradigm.  Never voice your professional opinion if you want to succeed.
good,"Seems like a lot of churn happening. Drives uncertainty and stress in the workforce. There are areas of amazing though, so don't be afraid to move around."
good,"Great people to work with and fun projects to work on, but management and company direction seem to be fuzzy.  The company performance is great, stock is up, and people are getting laid off.  It is confusing"
good,"When I first hired in the work was hard on my body but the work environment was good. My crew worked together as a team. As time went by people were getting frustrated with the changes management was making. And in the end I didn't even like going to work anymore. Its hard to explain the way it is there to someone who has not been a working person (mechanic, sealer, plumber, or electrician) Because you can't build an airplane with ""paper"" and that's how it seems like they think"" if it works on paper it works."""
good,Typical B2B challenges in that space.  A lot of competing priorities.  People are working together in a collaborative manner.  Goals are often vaguely defined.
good,This was not a bad job. Just a bad location mostly to get to. Low pay and no job security. The half day on Fridays was great. Climate controlled and the on-site gym was terrific.
good,"Overall ""mama"" Boeing takes care of its people.  It's a solid paying place to work that doesn't require you to break your back for the money.  The lax atmosphere is changing and been changing for over a year.  More is required for less in this aerospace world these days, and employees are treated the same way.  You're expected to do more with less people."
good,"I enjoyed my work, co-workers and most of my managers.  Typical day was 40 hours sometimes more.  Direct lead was a good guy and fairly assigned jobs and tasks.  As my skills grew I was f=given more challenging tasks which made the days go by fast and improved my skills even more."
good,"Taxing walks as a technician, not long enough or scheduled enough of breaks for influx of people. Diverse and spanning knowledge base that employee must know how to navigate, coupled by excellent quality, all about fun skilled craftsmanship and safety first. Expenditures that were available to help quality at a readily available notion and vast employee recognition. No personal life because of opportunity to make money. Team environment was so diverse that it was sometimes great, and sometimes terrible. Managers were often brought in from outside the company which reflected in their lack of knowledge of shop orders and critical information. Leadership was such that mistakes would get people promoted, yet if you did a ""good job"" you get stuck with whatever you were good at doing. Too much overturn, not enough accountability. A lot of movement. Unfair treatment due to effort vs. reward that unfortunately is often driven by the union but everyone gets treated the same and is therefore paid within equal means, it's just not based off of a person's actual contribution, worth, or understanding. Sometimes too strict on what didn't matter, and not strict enough on what did matter. Overall a job easy to take pride in, worth the time but not your life."
good,It is a very clicky environment. You need to know someone to be advanced in salary or in the ranks. College is a good thing to have for advancement. They promote from within and is very hard to get in management from the outside so you will need to start low and try to rise to the top.
good,"Boeing is a good place to work, it offers great benefits and provide a balance work-life style. Most of the work will revolve around certification, the documentation of requirements and events can be a enjoying activity under the correct training."
good,"Good for someone who wants a good work life balance."
good,"They company has many locations around Seattle, WA.  These locations are not in the city limits of Seattle itself.  And the company rents office buildings from time to time."
good,Economy and several other factors have lent to a stalling business model at Boeing South Carolina.  A new approach is necessary to make the site a profitable and a self sufficient branch of the fantastic company that Boeing is known for being.
good,"Boeing is currently one of the largest companies in the world, but years of complacency and arrogance have sent them spiraling in the wrong direction.  While most current platforms are healthy, they are failing to expand their foothold, losing most competitions.  Leadership continues to look downward for improvement instead of making changes at the top.  Boeing is very top heavy, and does little to develop leaders. "
good,"Boeing has changed significantly over the years.  Like many old large firms, the evolution of Boeing during the recent past has been required to effectively compete with the influx of market disruption.  The stock performance has benefited as a results.  The corporate culture is not as great as it used to be; however, it is still good."
good,"When you work at Boeing, it's so big that every division you work for is like a little company in and of itself, with their own sustaining budget."
good,Management is a pond to the executives. Support of the workers is contingent on the policies made by the executives and is often not in harmony with employee satisfaction
good,"Boeing engineering is one of the largest collections of smart people anywhere. You will have to opportunity as an engineer to learn from the best in the industry, but it can be a challenge for a new hire to be taken seriously, especially out of an academic environment. It is also remarkably difficult to move up quickly in Boeing. If you are looking for a luxuriously steady job doing really interesting work, Boeing is a great place for that. If you are looking to have upper management really care what you as an engineer has to say and be willing to reward you in kind for it, do not expect that at Boeing. Some engineering positions also require extensive and prolonged time away from family, and it is hard to get the company to acknowledge work/life balance due to acceptance by the legacy engineering workforce that has grown up with pensions and being ""dedicated to the team."" There are many other industries that are rewarding and valuing engineers more than aerospace can afford to pay. But they do not build exciting things like spacecraft, fighter jets, etc."
good,"There was a constant threat of employee cuts and it was always targeted at higher level employees at higher cost locations. There was a lot of fire and re-hire at lower cost locations (St. Louis for IT). Not great atmosphere and the environment didn't foster any company loyalty. Not very future seeking and not many daily benefits (no provided food, group outings, etc.) If you are interested in getting an education while working, Boeing does provide a great benefit for that."
good,"Great products however limited job opportunities because of downsizing and work placement.  A lot of different types of work and projects from IT, engineering, manufacturing, and project management."
good,It was a good place to work besides the parking and the fear of getting laid off.The people that I worked with are great people and take their job very seriously. A good place to work.
good,Boeing used to be a unique employer with loyal employees.  Now it is just another company.  With each benefit takeaway and round of shipping work to a cheaper location or layoff's with no work transition Boeing is not the place to be if you have marketable skills outside of aerospace.
good,There is not a clear line of promotion and job placement. Leadership doesn't seem to care about the work you accomplish. They care more about how you work them.
good,"Good place to start, not a good place to finish. They will pay for your school which is nice, the 401k match is good, but the mid leadership tends to not be overly talented and is not merit based enough. Culture is very old school and not incredibly effective."
good,"Seriously, you want a review from this long ago?  I will say it again...redundant and completely non value added to any job seeker given the time frame."
good,"In my function they've recently been hiring people into middle-management and executive positions who have zero to very few years of people leadership experience. It's challenging because they have no idea how to lead people and make rookie-level management mistakes that ripple across our team causing disengagement, mistrust, etc."
good,"No room for innovation, culture was often retrogressive and much of the work was repetitive and uninteresting. I learned some and gained experience, but learned more about how work shouldn't be done."
good,"Rewarding if you find yourself on a program you love; stressful as the job security is to be desired. People are thought of as numbers in a spreadsheet more and more, and not like people."
good,"slow paced work place, poor management. No competitive pay. Ideal for someone looking for stress less work and decent payscale. Team has limited aggressiveness towards work"
good,"At Boeing there is a good culture, but unfornately there was a lot of stress to meet deadlines that were not obtainable. The pay was competitive, although the hours were 12-14 hours a day 7 days a week. There were no time for breaks or time off. There was not a lot of organization. Many favorites with management, no room for advancement, and policies frequently changed."
good,The recent downturn in production along with more layoffs has created a very low moral within the company. Lack of advancement makes it very difficult to want to stay working for the company.
good,I started as a Programmer but was steered into project management. I found that Project Management was not for me. Later I was moved into a staff position with little responsibility and was finally downsized. I would do things differently if I could go back.
good,"Very productive company pay attention to detail. A versatile programs, and a variety of job duties involved.  Diversified culture.  Management fast paced environment.  Some people make it funny."
good,"Depending on your relationship with your boss you're work life can be very stressful.  Sometimes things can get very political and it can hinder one's ability to focus on tasks."
good,"I started out with motivation and couldn't understand why senior employees were so unhappy. Three years later, after seeing the way management functions (or, rather, doesn't function) I understand. They say that the union has tied their hands, but a good manager knows how to have difficult conversations and document them to get rid of the dead weight. 5 guys will do all the work while 8 guys play games on their phones. Ethics and human resources refuse to do anything other than inform the manager. I like to earn my pay, so I'll be out of there soon!"
good,Encountered corporate culture while managing various projects in support of factory production. No opportunity for advancement since this was a contract position. Unable to be hired as a permanent employee due to workforce reductions and layoffs.
good,Focus is on minimizing cost maximizing profits.Tech jobs are being outsourced. Younger less expensive employees are desired. Good medical.
good,No job security.  Layoffs are frequent.  Stress over whether will still have a job is common even if have excellent accomplishments and performance record.
good,Pay was acceptable but micro management off the minutes on the time clock was ridiculous. Company has potential to be great from the employee's perspective. Often needed a favored advantage with management for advancement.
good,Boeing is a typical massive corporation where you are simply a cog in the machine.  Processes are highly redundant and bureaucratic.  The would rather cut costs by getting rid of people than by getting rid of processes.  Job stability on union sites is highly lacking as there seems to be a drive to break the unions (no one will admit this of course).
good,A good team goes a long way in a job like this.  When year end comes around and everyone is expected to work upwards of eleven hours a day there can be no toxic personnel.  There weren't any on my team.
good,Management style is abstract. There seems to a lack of accountability and proactive action in return for settling for the status quo.
good,"Compensation:"
good,"In the three years I've been there, they gotten away with pension, paid overtime, and made it hard to get a new position thanks to ""Engineering Optimization."" A way for then to use you where they need you, without letting you apply for a new position and get a salary increase."
good,A company that believes that younger inexperienced personnel are the key to success while pushing out the more experienced personnel so the company can remain more competitive. In my opinion a bad stategy that may in the long term negatively impact the stablitity of Boeing.
good,"Very cool place to work with a number of intelligent people sharing ideas and creating value.  The culture could use some updating as it is typical Fortune 500 big business with little to no ""fun amenities""  Overall the work/life balance is refreshing."
good,Many opportunities for professional development although they are going through a perpetual reduction in force. Fantastic benefits and generous 401k.
good,"The day varies depending of your function. You may need to be available 24/7 when waiting for the US to take a decision on something."
good,"A typical day at work is ""putting out fires""."
good,"The company provides outstanding benefits, to include tuition assistance, paid training, health care, and a fair salary.  However, the culture of the business leadership is generally unwelcoming to new ideas to cut cost and increase profitability.  The multiple layers of management typically act as a filter, leaving most good ideas from employees on the desk of a mid-level manager somewhere, decaying before it can reach someone capable of funding the idea."
good,"A typical day at work begins: with a brief discussion with team members about what is to be accomplished that shift. work is discussed and we walk out without a clear understanding of what is going on or what is expected and who is going to complete what."
good,"I've worked for Boeing for four times now as a contractor.  Offered me perm twice, but I declined.  One recruiter at a contract house I was speaking with said to me, ""Over here, Boeing is known as a place where developers go to die.""  "
good,The work there was nonstop. Hardly any time off. Very strict. This place is high on security and safety and its growing fast.
good,"no exercise ar allowance to wonder far from work stations, had to endure excessively loud noise.was forced to leave after one years its is totally ran by machinist union."
good,"Boeing was like many other factory line jobs.  I worked there so long ago, it is hard to give a fair review about a company that has changed so much over the years."
good,"Market based affordability targets has forced Boeing to make continuous reductions in the there defensive segment workforce."
good,Good people to work with but limited resources for professional development and extensive company mandated training is on your own time.
good,"Boeing is a big company and it's easy to lost track of people. It's enraging for people like me to watch so many people in the company get away with doing little to nothing and even though we're not union, it seems impossible to get let go. Very easy to coast by. You'll get a decent pay, and great benefits but job satisfaction is low, morale is almost non existent and lay offs are cyclical."
good,Great benefits and rewarding Job. Great location and lots of knowledgeable people. Work environment o.k. depending where you get to be.
good,"Work is challenging, diverse co-workers, flexible schedules, open culture. New skills are constantly being learned and implemented. "
good,"Boeing offers a work environment unlike any other. You're constantly being pushed to your limits and always working to meet deadlines. There are a lot of perks to working for Boeing such as competitive pay, 401k, dental and health insurance and so forth, but on the other hand the work is very taxing on the body and some times stressful. "
good,"Unfortunately, the company is losing the C-17 product line, work is hard to come by."
good,"I was hard to complete assignements due to communications issues. "
good,"With all the layoffs and changes there is no Job Security or Growth opportunities."
good,"There are many opportunities with a company as large as Boeing, however, there are also many political battles that create an environment that is difficult to work in.  Sometimes the simplest tasks take months due to poor management decisions or lack of budget."
good,"In CDG technical publication department, everything is measured and process driven. Most of the coworkers are highly self-motivated but not recognized by their leaders."
good,"They want weekday overtime, but you can't do it pre-shift, they want us to sign a ethics form every year when the company doesn't have any."
good,"Good place to work out of college, good resume name recognition, but poor employee retention. No room for advancement. If you work hard and do a great job, you get punished by getting more work that lazy, incompetent, or disgruntled employees don't want to do. Good work-life balance."
good,This is a great company with awesome people. We do great things here and make amazing products. I do not personally care for the direction the company is going and how leadership is going about doing it.
good,"This position provided me with many opportunities to learn multiple"
good,"♦ Execute and achieve objectives of the Integrated Materials Management (IMM) at the Asia"
good,"While I take great pride in being able to say I work for The Boeing Company, and have since I started there in 2012, after the transfer to my current position, I realize that 8+ hours of mostly silent cube life may not be for me. During a typical day, I arrive at 7:30am and begin the usual process of checking emails and listening to voice-mails. We have a 9am ""Tag-up"" every morning, which I do find usually beneficial. This is a time for us to tell management what we are working on, problems and help needed. After that I would go back to answering emails, writing contracts, contacting suppliers and a myriad of scenarios that may arise. I often learn more about more detailed contracts via other buyers emails and occasionally the manager, than through training. While that part may be less than exciting, I do find great joy in the employee involvement groups that I lead. To be able to help new employees meet and network with other new and existing employees brings me great joy. Through the group I lead we bring employees together with development, community and networking events, both during and after work. It's seeing these other employees grow within the company, that really makes it worth it."
good,"Quite flexible in terms of start time. Manager and co-workers are good people. Salary has increased at a rate that is below the cost of living over the previous four years, in addition to health benefits costing more out of pocket every year."
good,"The day at Boeing Defense Systems is comprised of a status I have developed to inform other related functions of pertinent data.  This data varies by day.  I participate in review of procedure and policy review for the Supplier Management organization and review peer documentation for accuracy and adequacy.  This allows me to mentor along the way and how to best deal with supporting the different personalities in my organization."
good,Government Facility no information will be given. but a great place to work
good,I am always busy and learn something new every day.  Management is very helpful and easy to relate to and co=workers are friendly and likeable. The hardest part of the job is the work load at times and the most enjoyable part of the job is doing and learning new things every day.
good,"Aircraft design is pretty much set in stone, so there isn't much opportunity for original thinking. The funnest part of my job is coming up with ways to automate the boring repetitive tasks. In my department schedule is king. If your not willing to work as much overtime as management wants, you won't be fired, but you'll given such boring work that you'll want to quit. Pay is not bad, but it isn't great either. You also get insurance and a 401k w/ matching. The 401k options aren't very good."
good,"The company is now getting rid of long-term employees and bringing younger, lower paid employees. Good luck with that!"
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for but my goal is to advance, and they place little emphasis on developing and promoting within."
good,Overall experience is good. Productive work place. Helpful management.
good,"Planned maintenance jobs"
good,"A great place to learn and grow."
good,My typical day at work is always a challenge and keeps me busy. I’ve learned many different tasks along the way and how to accomplish each task in a timely manner. My Co-workers and I have excellent teamwork when it comes to each task at hand. The hardest part of the job is waiting for management’s approval for new engineering tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a task is accomplished in a timely fashion
good,"Some of the thing that is important at Boeing!"
good,"Typically unorganized production daily activities was hard to control. it gave support people lot of challenges along with they learned new things from interface production desrapancies with engineering, supplier, scheduling, planning, lean dept. shop floor, cost, quality, customer activities and their area of expertise. management kind of putting out fires from data input by production and engineering and become reactive rather than proactive. co-workers are sometime supportive but due to large turnover they were more protective. the hardest part of the job was implementing the new process through production due to involvement of government  buy of and cost associated with it. considering everything overall it was fun and rewarding manufacturing the high -tech commercial and government aircrafts. Benefits were good."
good,"A good place to work if you are mechanically inclined, like to work and are willing to put in extra time to make money."
good,"Typical day-- Run the metrics for daily meeting/tag up. Sift through tons of emails to weed out the ones I need to respond to. Check the ticket queue. Assign tickets to SMEs. Work my own tickets for a while. Work on setting up users in the database. Get to a few emails by the end of the day. Through out the day I get phone calls, Instant messages, emails, walk-ins which disrupt the task at hand."
good,The work is nice to do but no one really communicates with each other.
good,Remove and Replace parts Airframe and Powerplant mechanic
good,"Different than represented. Weather terrible. Great people to work with, lots of talent, the one saving grace of the place."
good,"A typical day is logging into my computer and open all my software I use daily. Then I check all my emails. Respond to all the emails or telephone. Then I check the software, named KANA to see if any new tickets need a response asap. I learned how to use KANA (ticket system), Then I open Total Access, My Learning tool, which confirmed if the employees are current or not current in taking all mandatory and required training. Trained employees to use the new system. I learned how to use so many tools which are included in my resume"
good,The hardest part of the job is it is dependent on economy. It has mass lay-off
good,"I did'nt particularly like the fact that we were drilling and sanding on carbon fiber shims and making them at a rate of 20 a day some nearly an 1"" thick and was not allowed to be issued a respirator. This is very troublesome.The answer after asking many times was the levels of carbon fiber in the facility was not a risk. Well, in my particular dept this was not the case. All I can think of was that by issuing the respirator they were admitting there was a risk. Well it was obvious to me so, I quit."
good,"From what I've heard, only 10% of all the jobs at Boeing are ""great"". My job classification feels like a job and not a career. Wages are average or less than average for engineers, but health benefits are great compared to other firms. At this time, I'm looking inside and outside the company for a different position. The pension is average for a private company, and less than most public positions."
good,Huntington Beach facility comprised of many buildings. Difficult to get around. Management culture was defined by building their own fifth Dom.
good,Management has some challenges but fortunately there is a great group of talented people working to make things work. The bureaucracy can be difficult to navigate for new employees.
good,"The IT Department included a Windows side and a Linux side.  Both groups work together well.  I only wish it included more cross training, so we may be able to assist one another during times of Staff shortage."
good,"I have worked in various areas in finance for The Boeing Company for almost ten years.  I have significant experience at the Pudget Sound sites, Seal Beach, and Saint Louis sites.  The actual work you do from day-to-day ranges from incredibly menial, non-value-added tasks, to financial modeling and sensitivity analysis needed to provide insights to leadership.  "
good,"Several positions, experience varied dependent on program.  Better experience working on larger twin aisle aircraft.  All of exp in interiors (payloads).  Can't relate to other disciplines.."
good,Flexibility is a key attribute woking here as a manager. Assignments change sometimes without notice depending on program requirements. Makes things interesting.
good,"Boeing of course does really interesting and prestigious projects.  However it was the first really stern and cold environment I worked in compared to other comparable companies.  I can barely get a hello from anyone.  Everyone walks around looking at the ground or worried or stressed.  It is for some reason hard on the soul to work here.  When I first started no one had time to help me with anything at all.  It took 3 days to learn how to get my computer, programs and phone all set up. I dare not ask the Office Assistants for anything if I could help it.  They are very snarky and lazy.  It wasn't a personal problem because no one knew me yet to make any judgements. Its just the environment they have established for all and its just that others are not interested in helping you for anything.  This is a company where you will learn to train yourself and get resources where you can.  Co-workers and managers do not have time to hold your hand at all not even on the first day. You are expected to figure it out on your own.  It was extremely disheartening to get our bonuses taken away this year.  Muilenberg said it was to show our integrity to the victims of the plane crashes yet his own integrity was brought to question and he made off pretty good because that's what happens when you look out for self right.  It would have made more sense to maybe forfeit manager bonuses because they get paid enough all throughout the year, lower level common folk and their families depend on their bonus.This is a very high paced environment to the point that it is unhealthy.  You have to be a self"
good,"Lots of opportunity to work on great products with great teams, but execution is slowed by poor corporate structuring.  Typical day tends to be filled with more meetings than required, but the culture and people help minimize the negative energy.  Most positions have above average start and finish time flexibility, which is big bonus."
good,"Good Company with some outdated work practices, who state they put people first over profit or to save money, but still trying to figure it out. Hard to find good/great teams as it is easier to transfer around  than it is to rank up in current position. Great work Flexibility."
good,"it used to be a great company but since merging and outsourcing, the culture has changed .  it seems like the workforce has lost momentum.  it is also having trouble attracting the best talent"
good,"Being such a large company, Boeing offers its employees to move laterally into other open jobs quite easily.  this is a benefit to those looking to relocate given the vast company footprint in the US."
good,"I was a Hughes Aircraft employee for 17 years when Boeing purchase the company so these question and rating are not a true account of my Boeing history. I would not recommend Boeing.They are only interested in there bottom line, not the employees and you will get a layoff at some point no matter how much talent  and hard work you put into that company."
good,The work itself was easy. Just dealing with the Boeing employees and lack of management wasn't the greatest. Easy days with a straightfoward Monday through Friday schedule.
good,The company as a whole is difficult to work for. There are too many meetings and progress is slow in my opinion. The 'people on the ground' are a lovely bunch to work with but in my experience there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,Most enjoyable part of  the company was our product. Liquid Robobtics is a start up company that became a Boeing company. Positive group of people. Motivated.
good,Micro management favoritism and if you’re a contractor there is no love . Pay is ok. The work detail is okay. Charleston is boring. But other that it’s an ok place to work
good,If you are motivated the sky is the limit.  They pay for schooling you may want to take to advance yourself. There are also numerous classes that you care take to imrove yourself.
good,"Nothing to share really. It’s a good company, but large. Depending on where u are located influences your chances of being promoted. So there can be certain limits of career advancement."
good,Good place to work overall. Lots of job security and interesting work. Work/life balance can be a bit tough sometimes. Management also seems to be focused on short-term goals rather than long-term stability.
good,"Overall benefits are great:"
good,"Good, just good, you have free coffee, and a very nice schedule"
good,"30% meetings, 70% Data coordination and analysis plus creating presentations. Great benefits, calm work environment.  The cafeteria is pretty good.  Hard work and production isn't always what gets you ahead."
good,I worked in a variety of jobs at this company but had a difficult time moving up the ladder.  The culture is very slanted towards engineers and people willing to have very little work/life balance.
good,"Love the company and what I did but just like everywhere else management can sometimes fail to be understanding and sometimes harms your motivation to be there. "
good,Boeing is an engineering company that is not longer run by engineers.  The people are fun and the work is exciting.  I just got Tired of the day to day management shake down.
good,"Too many meeting, too little opportunities for an interesting projects. Management is the key level in the company. Not engineers, not programmers. Regulations prevent from using new tools and programming environment is obsolete."
good,"It was a decent job at a big company.  I started off in a rotational program in accounting.  Working in accounting at a big company like Boeing was not enjoyable.  Then I rotated in to contracts and pricing, and this was more enjoyable."
good,"Generally great people to work with but let down by inefficient and outdated processes. Management are confused and have limited direction."
good,"Great benefits. Educated, accepting workforce. Executive leadership sets and communicates high standards. Mid-management is underdeveloped.  Work/life balance is fair.  Boeing products are stellar."
good,"This is one of the best jobs I have had in my life as far as benefits and pay are concerned. Unfortunately, this place employs some of the most lazy and entitled people I have ever worked with. If you're not a sycophant, you might as well forget about management even looking in your direction. Boeing Salt Lake is a small site so management tends to let things slide that would not at one of the bigger Boeing sites. Additionally, I had conflict with an employee and HR was going to make me continue to work around this employee who was causing a hostile work environment. If you ever get hired here, keep your head down ,work your 8 hours, go home,  and forget about this place until it's time to come back to work."
good,"Fast Paced environment, friendly co-workers, multiple functions allow for variations in roles that employees can work and develop into, defense industry work"
good,The job is enjoyable but leadership is not the best.  Not a great work environment.  Don't feel like skills are being used to full.  Not a team effort
good,"Would rather not comment too much. Typical day at Boeing consisted of inspecting parts of the aircraft and writing Non conformances on a daily basis. Trouble shooting, meetings a times, training, overtime, measuring, safety and trying to figure better ways of doing things."
good,"I do not have a comment regarding my employment with this company as I cannot understand its management and the decisions that they make. Some are good and just, based on true facts while others are just difficult to understand and plain stupid in my opinion."
good,"Enjoyed the innovation at Boeing and excitement about future plane projects. But lots of extra hours and not time for "
good,"100+ year old company and really shows with hierarchy and politics leading and innovation and creativity lacking."
good,"I think the interviewers need to check their previous employers or their co-workers about their skills and their performance.  They should not based on 10 questions that they ask during the interview process.  Sometime, people can answer their answers base on their thoughts and their honesty."
good,"A huge company so you do pick up the vibe you are just an employee number.  Pay is quite low compared to market.  That said, employees work together very well."
good,"Great place to work to finish or further your higher education through their Learning Together Program. Boeing will pay for your tuition, lab fees, books in an education field that can be utilized by the company."
good,"Workload is often very heavy, with little regard for manpower to get the job done effectively. Sometimes you need to do things in a manner that people would consider unsafe to get the jobs done on time."
good,"Lost in the system. This large company does not focus on the little guy. Union sucks, protects the slackers and does not allow for those that strive for success to be recognized."
good,Large range of opportunities. Company is willing to help promote from within the company. Big on training and very nice work environment. Must be ready to work long hours.
good,Boeing is a good place to work if you are content at your level.  However due to the high frequency with which management changes it becomes difficult to establish good performance history needed for promotion.
good,"Developed release process along with determination of document requirements prior to pushing code into Production."
good,"I work for a small part of the Boeing company, and we are field location, so my overall assessment of the company as a whole would not be very accurate.  It is a niche department so the work and culture are very specific to the location and job."
good,A lot of great people work at Boeing. Having said the work environment is very erratic. I worked on several programs and each of them were ran different. Its like there is no upper management deciding how and what tools the Boeing is going to use. Nothing is the same in all of Boeing.
good,The thing I most disliked about Boeing as a software engineer working on projects not directly related to airplanes is that the company really didn't care about such projects.  Boeing also felt like a really big company with lots of bureaucratic stuff to deal with.
good,"I worked for a Contractor  during construction as a PM and not as an employee of Boeing."
good,As a young engineer I was warmly welcomed and encouraged to succeed in everything in all challenges faced. I was well trained and provided with all the necessary tools to do my job. The management style was flexible and all team members were encouraged to provide opinions and solutions. You always felt you were being listened to. A technically challenging role but the rewards were tremendous.
good,"5 years since I worked at Boeing.  Can't really recall my experience working there but from what I can remember it was good.  Good people, good managers."
good,"Working for Boeing was a simple job. I enjoyed working for the company however, the manager was never around and it was difficult when you needed them for something when in training."
good,Very little flexibility when it came time to choose other careers.  Company shut down and the guidance and explanation of opportunities was horrendous
good,"Management was not forthcoming with information regarding the organization's change."
good,supporting the aerospace and commercial markets is something I take great pride in. Working in the supply chain is very fast paced.  It is a great way to be involved in something very important
good,A good company to work for retirement but slow growth opportunity. Good work life balance but not much opportunity to learn. very slow and hard to adapt culture
good,Find a group of people that you can get along with and try to stick with them.  The people around you really affect the experience in this company both for the best or worst
good,Pays low but I learn the most and was able to go back to school to get my BS and MBA.  The managers supported the staff.  The employees looked out for each other.
good,"Boeing continues to exceed the marks on business growth.  The departments vary in agility, mentorship and development.  Great place for consistent, daily tasks."
good,management does not communicate well with the employees. Employees will ask for help and management will redirect the employee else where for help and the employee will never get the help they need.
good,Nice place to work. You will enjoy the atmosphere . You cannot walk in talk on campus because of safety issues. If you can deal with that you will be fine.
good,Being that it's a aerospace company it was tough politically to really stay out of the way of the people that were trying to sidetrack your career. I made good money though and lots of OT.
good,Boeing was a difficult place to work when I was there. I went through several layoff cycles during my time and was always concerned I would be next. the best part about working here was the benifits
good,"Company compensates your income very well for how much work you actually get to do. This place is greatly over managed and bogged down with sub programs. They of course like any large company are more concerned with productivity compared to employee health and wellness. 1st level managers are nothing but ""Yes"" men. Upper managers care nothing about the people working under their 1st levels. You rarely get to be a troubleshooting mechanic and are forced to wait for engineering to bless you even turning a wrench. If you don't mind being a mindless zombie and are not easily frustrated by being held up by management I would recommend working here."
good,"If you can handle the constant change and the lack of clarity about what they actually want from you vs what is written in reviews you will be fine. Not a bad overall place to work, just lots of unskilled middle managers."
good,"Decent place to work, would recommend it if you like a safe, slow paced job. Otherwise, move on to bigger, better things! I switched industries altogether"
good,Its a giant manufacturing company. Think automotive move than tech. The boomers that work there are largely entitled. If you want to sit in a cubicle for 8 hours a day and collect a check its the place for you.
good,"its good if you like big organizations, lots of meetings, lots of annual training, but lots of opportunities if you are willing to move around and change positions"
good,"A  place for growth carrier wise."
good,"Too many groups and they don't works together well, everyone for themselves. Management only want a good number on the chart but have no idea if it true or not, most reports are fabricate to make it look goods. The jobs usually get bury and forgotten after awhile."
good,love it  great company to work for looking forward to join the company again hate i quite the first timey so i will be appling once again hopefully ill be a a part of the tinme again.
good,"Boeing laid me off just a few years before I could retire."
good,I did not work at Boeing very long due to my boss being relocated and there was not much direction there.  I also received an offer from Sperry in Albuquerque which interested me more than working at Boeing.
good,Its a good company to work for with great benefits.  It's consistent with hours.  There are a lot of people that work there.  It's nice to be off during the Christmas.
good,I don't have a response to this question. I did not work there long enough to form an opinion.  I have had family work for Boeing and had long careers.  So I would assume it's positive.
good,"Like any large company, there are lots of pros and cons. My experiences varied greatly depending on the team I worked with. The upside of working there is I got to move around a bit and experienced several sides of the business. The downside is that I'm not always fully engaged so my skills go underutilized. The pay structure is fair for now but will never be fantastic unless you get into upper management. The benefit package has been going downhill in recent years."
good,"Senior Financial Analyst with proven record of accomplishment in financial planning, budgeting and analysis and reporting within financial and manufacturing service industries. Recognized for providing excellent support to business units and bridging the gap between operational decisions and financial targets. Strong GAAP knowledge. Core professional strengths include:"
good,"Boeing is a company with good health benefits, gym on site. It is a labor union site there're if you are not familiar with union work environment it may take some time to adjust"
good,"Over the span of my career, I have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience within the manufacturing and assembly areas.  I am very interested in moving my career to the next level."
good,"Boeing is a decent company to work for, they have good benefits, and over all family values. They do need to work on giving employees the opportunity to advance within the company, before going outside and hiring a new employee."
good,"Pretty good opportunities to contribute but your satisfaction with your individual job is largely dependent on what team you're on and, importantly, who your manager is and what their considerations are."
good,"Boeing is a very dynamic and advanced technology environment.  Many new processes to learn and apply.  Many opportunities for direct employees, but not so much for contractors."
good,Great emphasis on employee development! Very conscious about treating employees well. I was at the company for a year whilst i was on an internship and gained a lot from this experience
good,"I liked working at Boeing for 40 years.  I worked at the same basic job for the F18, T45, AV8B and P-8A programs. The people were easy to work with. I retired due to the long commute."
good,The culture and focus at Boeing has been changing over the past ten years.  Boeing said in the 90's that their employees were their most valuable resource.  You will not hear anyone in senior management say that now with any conviction.
good,"The culture over the years at Boeing significantly changed while I was employed there. Being a single father, I could not take advantage of certain off hour benefits,"
good,Great benefits and pay.  Stressful.  Management doesn't know what you do in your job or how it functions and changes process not knowing how it affects customers you support.  New changes were followed only to know that a month later things would fall apart and you would have to work OT to correct the month of the previous changes that didn't work.  Employee's opinions were not taken into consideration.
good,"I believe my last day at Boeing was February 8, 2008.  Although I worked there for approximately eight years, I can't remember too much about my time there."
good,Boeing was ok i am no longer with the company.  I’ve learned a lot from this company shows a lot of favoritism. Mangers don’t always know what is going on on the floor
good,"There are brilliant people who do have new ideas, but sometimes the ideas overtake the planning and it becomes confusing and difficult to work in that environment."
good,"Pros:"
good,"In Washington state the races are high and getting a good job like boeing is amazing, but that's the price. take your beatings because the pay check is better than what you'll get in any other job."
good,"If you don't get along with Union Reps, you can have a difficult time. I don't always take breaks and that didn't sit well with the indivisual thus causing him and I to butt heads."
good,Very difficult to advance within the company. The company tends to hire external for senior positions rather than promote internal employees. Old processes.
good,"World known. Exciting missions, and receptive management. Great company culture. Challenging, exciting work. Good benefits, and pay. Very excited to see where the company will go."
good,"Worked Mon-Wed 10 hour days, Thurs and Friday 8 hour days.  "
good,Joined the company to start at the ground level and learn all about Boeing's airplanes.  Looking to use my knowledge to advance within the company. Hoping to use my understanding of 737 airplanes and my electrical engineering degree to fine a Boeing engineering position.
good,The Boeing Company has an extensive footprint in the Seattle Washington area and it's too expensive for most employees to live there. If you work outside of Washington State the compensation is very good.
good,ok company to work at. Good opportunities as a lot of people are in retirement age. Salary is not competitive. Managers are not compensated properly at all.
good,"The program I was hired for got its funding cut. I was then shipped around from one meaningless job to another until I just had to leave. It was nice that they tried to find a home for me, but the work was very boring."
good,"Worked for Boeing 32 years. First 25 years were fantastic, they recognized and appreciated my and others skills and promoted accordingly. Managers new how to run the machine shop, sheet metal shop and paint and ID.    The last years were depressing. Managers had no skills in manufacturing. Quality went down, production went down. no discipline and moral sank. Complete mismanagement."
good,I was only at the company for a short period of time so don't have strong feelings either way.  Work wasn't very structured and there was a significant lack of training.
good,"I worked for them too long ago to remember how it was.  Although, I did get laid-off along with 3000 other people.  I'm not sure if SSL is getting more contracts than Beoing - good idea to check."
good,"Boeing taught me the bases of what I know today. I learned different assembly lines, from harnesses to circuit boards to rework and conformal coat to logistics."
good,"I was only a sub contractor working for vendor support, but the employees I had an opportunity to work with were great and very knowledgeable. If given the opportunity to work at Boeing in the future I would gladly take the position as I have no negative work history within the company."
good,They wanted 5-s teach it but it is not really in play. Too many managers-and trainning is limited most of it is OTJ  trainning if someone bothers to help you out.
good,"Boeing set the bar for my career, it taught me the structure of a fast pace manufacturing company. I learned a lot and it has been valuable for my future careers."
good,"A typical work dat could be long siting in a cab running heavy metal parts it takes 15 days to run thru the cycle to makre 1 part it can be very boring tools break and can scrap $100,000 part . Managers are pitted against each other to succeed and rated by employees and they are stressed and take it out on employees that work for them."
good,"Good office arrangement for coordination and meetings with different job departments."
good,"Too many diverse teams trying to meet their goals and objectives. limited support from members of your ""team"" but high expectations of you exceeding standards set for you"
good,"Developed and managed project plans, and integrated schedules for IRC Stow Bins, Ceiling & Sidewall, and Balance Package moving lines. Defined WBS, cross-functional responsibility matrices, activity dependencies, communication and resource planning."
good,"The culture and work environment was largely dependent on which manager you had. Some managers were great, some were misogynist and dishonest. The company experienced some downsizing recently."
good,its changed over the years.  Some stay while others leave rapidly.  In order to survive you must network like crazy especially with how large they are as a company
good,Boeing needs to get back to their core business of aircraft by promoting from within instead of from outside. Management needs to be aware and have the ability to manage groups which they have knowledge of their work and processes.
good,"Boeing offers a competitive compensation package including an excellent 401k match, and has a great work-life balance with relatively low pressure placed on individual contributors.  That being said, the work was not challenging and there was limited room to grow in the role or advance in the company."
good,"My last 8 years Boeing I worked remotely, I spent very little time in the office. My responsibilities a Boeing were as a financial data ware house designer and developer. I was involved in all aspects of the creation of the data warehouse at Boeing. I evaluated the ETL and BI tools that would be used, I created the data warehouse data model, I wrote the ETL processes, I tested the data and came up with corrective action when source data was not of good quality and I even did production support."
good,This was a temporary contract assignment.  It was an interesting and challenging position requiring long hours.  Accomodations were very good for dining and restroom facilities.
good,my position was bad timing the flight software was not mature enough to interface with the ground software therefore I had a difficult time as liaison for the ground and flight software. Very interesting work ... someday their 'StarLiner' will be an amazing product.
good,"Boeing management had too much politics.  Need to focused on the employees and provide vision and mission.  Management flow down was poor.  On the good side, job was satisfying and benefits  were excellent."
good,"Boeing was a average paced workplace, when coming to work you would sit down in a team meeting and discuss the goals for the day and we would sit around and find the most simple plan to complete the task at hand. and after that its pretty much smooth sailing. My only problem with boeing is that its based upon acquiring a blue badge and if you have a grey badge your expendable."
good,"Due to changes in the work culture over the past couple of years, I strongly feel a move away from what I provide to the company.  First and second level management say we are sorely needed, but every move, every statement above them screams a different story.  I very much enjoy the work I do, and feel I provide an economical and very viable service, but Boeing has implemented changes that have completely destroyed a very productive team dynamic that used to exist and is now a dog eat dog environment."
good,"quality control of military equipment and aircraft components ( CNC manufacturing), aircraft maintenance mechanic in a Maintenance and repair organisation"
good,"Boeing is a large, old company. Only certain people excel in the bureaucratic environment. At the core, the aircraft products are world class, but the business overall is under serious pressure to reduce costs. This affects valuable programs and initiatives that would ultimately benefit the company over time. At Boeing you may often feel under valued or ignored, but you can be part of a well known company."
good,Programed CNC Machines. Worked with some good people. Hard to get training. Some management where good to work with some where not. Hardest part was some of the people that worked there.
good,"Working at boeing was exciting because of the ability to see what goes into building aircraft. Especially a brand new style of aircraft, and to be a part of it"
good,"Not what you may expect from a major company but as they say a job is a job and not a career, I really do not have anything more to say just doing this review."
good,"The Boeing Company was a great place to work but now the company is strongly outsourcing or moving work out of state, very disappointing. Not as good of an employer than it used to be."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work if you have the right manager and organization. The pay is amazing, and the benefits. However the Administrative employees need a union."
good,Boeing typically pays to get an employee but compensation as an employee is minimal. Process orientated with a culture of collaboration and respect it can be difficult to make any direct contribution which as typically viewed as Team efforts or Team successes.
good,This company was a good experience.  I learned how to work with military airplanes and submarines.  The pay was not what it should be.  The quality of some assemblers was not to what i expected.
good,If you're an engineer Boeing is a great place to work.  Other skills are not very highly regarded and are not compensated as well. The company is going through changes right now to make themselves more adaptable to change but culture change is slow resulting in high turnover and low moral in most functions.
good,"Good working environment and great bunch of folks previously from McDonnell  Douglas (Boeing Acquired many years ago), Long Beach.  Work was fast paced and PO's  placed in expedited manner."
good,"It's a good company but we are outsource workers inside the plant, so our employer is actually the Xerox Corporation. I would like to work for Boeing the company itself."
good,Not enough work to keep everyone busy.  Lousy contract and low job security.  No accountability for lazy overpaid employees hanging around to watch their 401k plan get fatter.
good,"The pay and benefits are great. Management is definitely lacking as most of them try to ""Play the Game"" not to get fired. From a new employee standpoint the company is enjoyable but you must play politics in order to succeed. Management definitely is aware of the situation but most of them are old school from McDonald Douglas. As a new employee with < 5 years of experience you will preform many job roles and have lots of opportunities but work can be boring at times as their isn't enough to do. Picking up extra work only results in staying busy but does not add to job advancement."
good,Learned manufacturing skills. How to self pace my work. How to be a teammate. The amount of overtime that is required gets to be too much. Best part are the coworkers and benefits.
good,Company takes a very internal focus to the point of where internal politics and optics distract from the focusing on the customer.  Culture lacks team work.
good,"Jigbuilder. Built Tooling for Production. Used all shop equipment, optics, and Computer aided measurement equipment. Building and maintaining Tooling."
good,"Great people here, but a tough dynamic with jobs being moved all over the country. Facilities are dated and policies are overly constrictive. Very few amenities."
good,"BGS is a new venture for Boeing.  The company is in its first months.  Work is always challenging and fun, allowing you to use all your best ideas."
good,"Over my 14 years at Boeing, there was never an extended period where layoffs weren't being evaluated or conducted. This created a very stressful work environment."
good,"Excellent benefits, tuition reimbursement, competitive pay, I could not handle the clique-like high school like feel of the job culture. there is opportunity for international travel if that's something you're interested in."
good,I do not wish to answer this and this is irrelevant to what I am trying to do with this site. I don't think this is adding any value to my job search.
good,"The upper management expected a lot from Engineers and did not delegate their supervisory responsibilities and direction. "
good,The Boeing Company does not appreciate or value loyalty in their workers.  They are quick to layoff experienced workers with no warning or explanation.  The culture is one that can be cut-throat to show your value at the expense of a fellow worker.  Jobs that have been staffed with experienced workers for a reason are not being replaced or replaced with lower grade workers with much less experience.
good,"I do not believe it is acceptable to state info about the company. "
good,"There seems to be an increasing trend to non-technical management and short term performance. As a result, when project cost go up, blame is shifted to the technical employees who no longer have a voice in management."
good,"It's a great place to work. Lots of opportunities to take advantage of, tools/resources provided to implement innovative ideas. Would recommend to anyone that has an interest in aerospace."
good,it was great experience to be an intern at Beechcraft. I got to learn so many skills and experience from the engineers and people on the shop floor. I would definitely work here again.
good,"Boeing is a great place to retire-I would recommend finishing your career at Boeing. It offers a slow-pace, great benefits, and amazing people. Truly a place you can be proud work."
good,"Boeing environment was a 'bullpen "" type with desks joined together,  Not the best working environment.  People did not share information if conflicting ."
good,"It was a contracted position. Boeing was paying a very fair and reasonable amount for the contracted position. But, the employment agencies discriminated the Network Technicians.  We were very poorly paid, with no vacations, benefits, and lots of work."
good,"aircraft work production environment first, second and third shifts"
good,I was a contract ME and was allowed to work across functional lines. I found the work to be very challenging and exciting. Hope to get back in this role again.
good,"If you're just slightly above average, you're basically a rock star at Boeing. The work life balance and benefits is great but don't come here expecting to feel fulfilled. "
good,"Managment a big problem."
good,The people work together to make the magic happen.  Great team spirit and wanting to get the job done despite any impediments to the processes or directions provided.
good,"Much to improve, but progress is slow.  Competitive benefits package.  The hardest thing is driving expectations and keeping young talent when CBA rules retain less valuable talent."
good,"Enjoyed working here as an intern, but wasn't happy with the type of work I got. It was boring and repetitive and I wanted more out of the job. Other than that people were great."
good,"Boeing has, as any company over time, evolved and changed.  Cultural shift have been more Progressive, but at the expense of quality workmanship.  Layoffs are more common, and the micro-management tendency has increased, while accommodating a more 'socially just' approach to candidate employees. It's a mixed bag."
good,"Very ""not invented here"" syndrome.  Highly qualified, focused people wah want to change the world.  Finance & business areas are overbearing on Engineering technical expertise."
good,"No Comments - well, probably no different than other aerospace companies.  No 2 days are alike - but a typical day starts early and is fun and exciting working with pilots, engineers (government and contractor) and people are diversified.  Management usually does not bother us or stop us from doing our work and help when we ask for help and there are no easy days on the job.  It is demanding and requires good team work to be successful"
good,Good work environment. Working with other EEs rather than typical IT staff was good change.  Commute was bad because it required 405 if you live NORTH.
good,The project was plagued by numerous delays which eventually led to the project being placed on hold.  This is inherent of large companies where business units work in silos and cross communications is difficult.
good,"Not as fun and exciting as t used to be. Advancement is cut throat as nearly impossible unless you're a brown noser. While the company has great benefits, the day to day is stressful and tumultuous."
good,"Such a large company.  There are great location and locations that need help.  With so many ways to move internally, it's easy to find the best fit for you."
good,"Very competitive, almost cutthroat environment.  Many employees are trying to get ahead with a ""whatever it takes"" attitude that is bad for business and morale."
good,"I think being a Armed Security Officer for the boeing company was challenging and rewarding.I enjoyed working with the diversity of customers from other countrys and understanding the difference."
good,A typical day was good. I learned to be aware. Management could be challenging. Workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job centered on leadership lacking the necessary skills set. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching your program evolve from beginning to end with positive results.
good,The ideology is applicable to most major aviation manufacturing firms. They have all the standard necessary compliances for contractual purposes. The people are knowledgeable and approachable. Overall good working environment.
good,"Generally, the place is a good place to work if one is in a good team. However, some leads engage in power tripping and they aren't reigned-in by management."
good,Very tedious culture.  Full of protocol and assessments.  Takes long to develop new and innovative products because things are so complex and hand-offs are numerous.  Difficult to see self-value within the company.
good,"In my experience, The Boeing Company has a decent work environment.  There are opportunities for advancement, but they seem few and far between.  Pay is lackluster but coworkers and managers are friendly enough.  Overtime is not required except in extenuating circumstances."
good,The company is making decisions that do not make sense in a manufacturing environment. They will step over a dollar to pick up a penny. The employees are all treated like a number unless your a senior manager. First line management doesn't get enough help to build the products resulting in a very negative work environment.
good,You can be lazy or hard working here. It's such a huge company it is easy to be forgotten. You really make your own destiny at this company. But great benefits and pay.
good,I would honestly say it has been so long since I have worked at the company that changes and growth within the business would make my evaluation of what I experienced part of the past.
good,Old culture is resistant to change. Young people get frustrated and leave. Things move slowly. They talk the talk but don't walk the walk. I work in BCA Headquarters which is different than the factory.
good,"A good place to work. Good benefits and 401k.  Good people to work with.  Interesting projects and learning experience.  Not a lot of travel involved, except occasionally."
good,Boeing Ridley Park is a great place to work but all depending on the sales so there are frequent layoffs. Very good company with consistent raises and bonuses to keep workers motivated.
good,.A typical work day varies from day to day.  Usually involves putting out the hottest fire of the day.  Many layers of management makes it difficult to communicate.
good,"Great Pay and Benefits and if money is all you are after then this is a great place for you. Boeing has grown to a company that is too wrapped up in the process and let's engineers make the process too over complicated. Their software systems are woefully out of date, every dept makes their own software tools so data sharing is impossible. The IT department is unhelpful and grossly understaffed. If Boeing doesn't get a handle on their digital assets, they will be left in the dust."
good,"Very stressful job, with low pay starting out. Good thing is guaranteed $1 raise a year and working indoors in a climate controlled environment. Management is very poor and often times you are stuck doing a 2-3 person job by yourself. I was last doing a job that used to be a 3 man job by myself and was expected to keep on schedule or ahead with nothing extra for accomplishing this. It didn't give me time for a break or vacation because I knew id fall behind and maybe never get caught back up. Also because of poor management in the summer of 2016 on a Friday afternoon they announced we were being put on mandatory overtime (starting that Monday mon-sat, 10 hr days mon through Friday and 8 hrs on Saturday This went on for 3 months and you weren't allowed to take vacation unless it was previously put in."
good,The benefits are excellent.  I will go into greater detail as needed in the interview process.  I will not give intricate details on this form as I do not understand how it's necessary.
good,"Little incentive to do a good job resulting in low motivation among some employees.  Extreme resistance to change at many levels.  Can feel like you can't make a difference.  Good compensation, many opportunities for learning new skills. Union controlled salaries and retention results in many good people leaving the company and some low performers making a good and secure living. Easy to feel like just another cog in the wheel, you get the feeling that corporate just sees you as a statistic."
good,"Easy going atmosphere"
good,"In addition, I believe that leadership is a big deal in the work place. Boeing definitely enhanced that extra go getter bone inside of me. We all know the phrase lead and set a good example,  I don't mean to beep my own horn but I know I have that part of leadership in the bag!"
good,"I start my day off by greeting all employees and start our morning stretches, i then head to our management meeting and get the daily operations that need to get completed that day. I analyze data into our computer system and give feedback to higher management. I love working in a diverse area with my co-workers who are all amazing individuals. The hardest part of my job would not have enough time to complete all tasks needed to be done."
good,"I would still be working for Boeing, but they decided to leave Wichita, KS a couple years ago. A lot of good people were effected by the move and it was a shame that the company left the city where it all began."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work for the benefits. It has great compensation as well, but if you are looking to feel have a sense of satisfaction this is not the place. The overall culture is cancerous, as people feel entitled to great benefits without hard work."
good,"There are some very challenging and interesting jobs at Boeing.   However, it is a big company and financial interests can end up dominate over technical."
good,"Productive and fun workplace in general."
good,"love my job, learned fatigue and damage tolerance skill, ther eis no hard part, enjoy to communicated with customer and team player, work on the same task to get it quick and on time"
good,"The pay is great and the benefits are good. Decent work atmosphere. However, the processes can HDTV really clunky and redundant. Also, bad management can really reduce your morals and desire for the company."
good,Good place to get started on your career or continue to have a career while learning an interesting domain that keeps it interesting on a daily baisis.
good,It is what you would expect from a large corporation. Where there are lots of good benefits but you are just another cog in the wheel a number that the corporate executives fail to see as beneficial employees.
good,"I was very proud to be a Boeing employee.  The company overall is a great company to work for, however, I was on the defense side of the company's business which is very different from the commercial airline side.  This site was very understaffed and most employees had more work than they could accomplish in an accurate and efficient manner."
good,"There is no more pension offered, but they are matching a percentage of money you put in a 401. "
good,"In construction you work yourself out of a job.  Once the contract for which you were hired for is over, you are laid off.  Nothing new, typical and should be expected."
good,"I was at the company for 25 years total (including my Rockwell time). I was making very good money and thought that I had more years to work - however, like most companies, Boeing wants to get rid of people that are older and make too much money. It is a shame that they no longer value longevity and loyalty."
good,Working at Boeing was o.k. But the politics that went on there made it kinda stressful. Most of the time you were walking on eggshells around other people. But when you got a chance to work alone it was great.
good,"It is fun to work around airplanes, but unless you are an engineer, the pay is not competitive, but the benefits are pretty good. The work/life balance is good depending on the group you work in, but management is very weak and don't know how to be leaders."
good,"I enjoyed the daily challenges of working on complex problems involving the design and build of aircraft, and working with highly skilled professionals.   The benefits are great and the workload is manageable.  I do have concerns regarding the trend by management to layoff senior professionals, which has also caused a serious decline in overall morale at the workplace."
good,"The work I had to perform was very interesting and a departure from my regular work tasks.  The managers were fine, the co-workers were too.  Their computer systems were somewhat difficult to work with because the security they must maintain is so stringent."
good,"Inspected tools for quality. Delivered them to appropriated departments. Temporary Manager, assigned tasks, corresponded with mechanics and other department heads."
good,"you either love it or hate it. good pay with great bennefits but it can be stressful worrying about layoffs. We are lucky to have Boeing in our state, it helps alot of families"
good,"I gained work skills and experience that helped me through my career. It is a structured environment, that identifies performance. Very big company with a lot of people to coordinate with."
good,A lot of change and uncertainty in the enterprise IT organization over the last several years.  As a manufacturer it is subject to the ups and downs of global and domestic market realities.  Staffing levels are affected by the down turns in the economy and the cost cutting measures that ensue.
good,"Working for Boeing is kinda like a 9 to 5 job.  Great people, good benefits, good pay, some long hours but overtime pays well.  But is you want a family type of business this is not the place to work.  Here you are like a number that isnt important, it is such a big company that you can be overlooked"
good,"Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas, and the culture shifted from emphasis on the employee to emphasis on company profit and interest."
good,"Lots of work, plenty to do, but plenty of bosses. diminishing employee benefits. Stable work,wer're talking about some pretty long term contracts."
good,Currently this company is trying to outsource many jobs to India to where they may need to  downsize the staff within the next years. Along with outsourcing they have taken many benefits away from the staff like a healthy work/life balance along with expecting the staff to work many overtime hours without compensation.
good,Boeing is the company and Chipton-Ross is the Contract shop. They are out of South Carolina and I know very little about them.
good,"Was introduced to a lot of cool new things and the Boeing system, LSIE was interested to learn about.  The work environment and system could use more structure and better explanations in general would have been good."
good,"Other than the lay-offs and having to work 2nd shift, it was a good place to work. The pay and benefits were very good. I especially enjoyed working in MTGRS."
good,The Boeing Company is moving much of its business overseas and to other areas of the country in an effort to reduce its liability of its aging workforce.  The new business environment does not support the benefits and retirement that it once did.
good,Almost whatever job you wish to do  can be done here. Collaboration is a skill highly needed. Computer knowledge as well as mechanical knowledge are beneficial.
good,"Most of the people I worked with had a sense of community, worked well with together and help each other out when needed."
good,"Boeing Healthcare benefits are better than average. For a single employee coverage, there is no cost to the employee. Family coverage is more reasonable compared to other companies."
good,"Daily support of network and workstation printers.  "
good,"after the last contract extension and loss of the defined pension, it is not the same company it was 5 years ago when i started."
good,"boeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractor"
good,Typical day would involve a variety of duties.  The job and the co-workers were enjoyable.  The politics and uncertainty was stressful.  Flexible schedule was a plus.
good,Boeing has sustained my employment for 28 Years. Some times you are doing really well with the team and leadership. Then without notice you are the outcast. The experience and all the skills acquired and education I attribute to staying on board all these years.
good,The employment environment was as expected based upon known history. Considered professional in nature and staffed with highly knowledgeable personnel.
good,"Boeing's culture is changing to be a more cost efficient work place which will benefit the company's bottom line but, hurt the workforce. They are making it harder to advance and progress. Work hard and run in place."
good,It has been a good experience. There definitely seems like there is a lot of work in the states/cities that Boeing is very established in. The people in my workplace were great. I hope to always work in that type of environment.
good,"Boeing (IT specifically) is a good place to launch a career, but don't count on advancing even if you are walking on water. Too much bureaucracy in management will stifle your growth. On the flipside, if you are a minimum effort type of employee, Boeing IT is a great place to work. You will be compensated the same as the guy next to you pulling all your weight!"
good,"Good work environment, learn a lot, but can tend to be slow so if you are looking for a place where you can wear a lot of hats, Boeing will not always provide that.  Pretty bureaucratic given the current environment of DOD funding."
good,Large organization with ample opportunities to move into areas of interest. Standard work hours for the most part. Can be slow to promote change due to size and structure.
good,"Boeing has a strong set of benefits to offer, the IT environment is large and complex. Work is challenging and people working at Boeing are great to work with."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Not the best place to expect to  advance.  Procurement is a demanding field, with a lot of responsibility, expectations and reporting.  Very high expectations, approvals of decisions can be slow and laborious to obtain.  Experiences can be hard to beat."
good,Overall Boeing is a good company to work for. I would say that the aircraft side of the company is the better side to work for.
good,Days are usually repetitive. Constantly changing procedures and documentation. Communication can be difficult. Coworkers are a pleasure to work with. Advancement can be difficult.
good,"I enjoyed working for many many years there. The job security was good, but management could have been better. Good benefits and wages and pension plan."
good,"Internal audit has good background of many businesses.  The exploration can go to many programs, business units, and functions."
good,Boeing is a great company if you like security in your job. The cons are you are not rewarded for hard work and lose incentive to perform at higher level quickly. You have to put in the time to be rewarded.
good,"I enjoyed being productive each and every day, I was able to be in a position that allowed me to be able to change up my days. Also enjoyed having the ability to temp up off and on for the experience."
good,"Boeing commercial airlines is in a all out fight with Airbus and other competitors entering the market. I am not confidant that Boeing corporate is in touch with their labor force and knows how to inspire the employees to help the company compete more competitive. Saying that, I am confidant Boeing will be around for a long time but like most large corporations they have gone from being a great company to work for, to a company that is struggling to figure out who they are, and how they can stay on top."
good,"Above average work environment"
good,"fast paced, long days, reduced force and ongoing training"
good,"Long history of a successful product, with a long history of varied manufacturing in the Mesa Plant, certainly in the news for their many successes."
good,Great people to work with.  Quality of management can very greatly from organization to organization.  Have the opportunity to work on exciting products and utilize new and exciting technologies.
good,"Fast paced, earned a lot of commercial aircraft experience.good work environment.Management was there to help you your work"
good,"Boeing was a high energy,huge time demand and understaffed work environment. This was exciting place to work very interesting projects, customer relationship were keep to success."
good,Being a self starter will help an employee get where they want to be. There is a big focus on diversity and you will gain experience working with multiple cross functional teams.
good,"Boeing Space started as Hughes Space and Communications.Once it was acquired by Boeing the culture began to change? Now it became a profit-driven enterprise, no longer was quality the top priority, now it is about double-digit profits. Product lines were taken out in order to sell only the products that assured those double-digit profits. Along the way, people were being laid-off and forced to retire in order to increase profit and shrink overhead. The y do provide a great benefits package and a good salary, but don't get comfortable, you are expendable?"
good,"After 3 years of working for Boeing, it was clear they do not care about their employees. I was let go and was not asked to be hired full-time for what I thought would be a possibility for the length of time I was there for."
good,"just like any other company with high  number of employees, different experience since is my first company have worked for where employees are unionised"
good,"A great place to work at, enjoyed working there and received lot of exposure working with a multinational company. A great place."
good,"Got to work on very advanced prototype aircraft.  The hard part of the job was trying to understand the management bureaucracy!"
good,My co-workers are a great group of people.  My first line manager is great and encouraging of my career and personal growth.
good,"Process oriented Organization, make job harder than what it is. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers wiliness to help and get involved to finished the projects on time and budget."
good,"A good job for the most part. Nowadays hard to keep it, but the benefits are excellent. Management ensured we had a good work flow of production."
good,"While Boeing has offered me a great career, it has changed over the years and focus is not on employees, but how they can cut corners in order to stay ahead of Airbus."
good,"Boeing is an okay place to work, however as a buyer you have very little say anymore. It takes an act of congress to get change accomplished."
good,"My last position was as a shuttle driver WITH A CONTRACT FIRM providing transportation services to Boeing employees. I also have direct employee service with Boeing totaling 15-16 years. I've also worked for government agencies, a Wall Street firm, and several other manufacturing/engineering/aerospace firms both in Seattle and New York. I can say without hesitation that the best and worst (unfortunately the more recent years emphasize the worst) persons I have worked with or for have been at Boeing. From a shirt sleeve, ""lets work together"" atmosphere  to a predatory, ""need to make an example"" of some employees, work place, Boeing has become what McDonnell-Douglas was (or so a former McDonnell-Douglas employee told me). They had and still have some impressively talented and committed people there; great to be around. But there has become a quality of rancor between management and labor that did not exist before 1996.  And the predatory practices attendant the desire to ""prune the workplace of deadwood"" (as they would term it) has produced a nastiness that years ago buried the ""old"" Boeing.  Time marches on; Some would call it progress. I'm not convinced."
good,"Interesting project, fast pace environment.  Management changed and did not seem to care about their employees.  Work at the client site so no contact with HQ office.  Environment was as if working for the client and not for Boeing."
good,"It is a dog eat dog culture. Not a day goes by that a person is not personally blamed for another's mistakes. "
good,"Accomplished professional electrical engineer with extensive experience in the aerospace industry.  Unit, sub-system and system level hardware/software design, integration and test and launch experience supporting government, NASA and commercial programs."
good,Production Managers vary in attitude from following rules and procedures religiously with no exceptions to making allowances for individuals with unusual needs on a case by case basis.
good,"While an interesting place to work considering the type of product that we were building, it was very characteristic of a typical large corporation.  Things tended to move slow but overall it was a stable work environment."
good,"Great work environment, great place to work, however no guidance and no set rules and regulations. Nobody knows what specific procedures need to be done for certain jobs"
good,"The company needs to get contracts before they make hiring."
good,"Descent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.  Opportunities to move up are available but will require you to move."
good,"The work environment is pretty good, the people are okay, the benefits are incredible.  I look forward to seeing what else the company has available."
good,"I loved everyday there. It's a great company to work for. I learned a lot from my team. We worked hard and together as a team. I really liked my manager, he was the best manager ever. I think the hardest part of the job was our parts not being there sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new everyday."
good,Great opportunities and benefits.  I learned a lot while working here - able to move around the company.  I had a lot of opportunities - able to be part of AIW (Accelerated Workshop) my first year at Boeing.  Boeing paid $15K for my leadership training.
good,opportunities were great various opportunities to mentor new employees while building the  best tactical fights in the world
good,I enjoyed what I did while at the company doing compliance work. Not much to tell except the company doesn't feel we senior experienced employees are worth getting paid for what we do. They would rather hire young college grads with no experience and pay them a mere one quarter of what we make and allow them to make mistake after mistake after mistake. The company seems to think that's OK in running a profitable business.
good,The business had great hours and pay for contractors some what organized and new jobs everyday management was some help and you worked at a steady pace.
good,"Jobs tend to be very specific making it difficult move around the company or outside of the company. It is such a big company that it is hard to feel like you are making much of a difference.  Culture feels ""old school"" and not very progressive."
good,"Very fast paced position where one had to time manage ones self to review engineering drawings, and requested changes to documents to ensure that technical changes were correctly incorporated into the documents and delivered in a on-time, on budget manner."
good,"Worked in a large team and did lots of cool stuff. Mostly in the HR applications."
good,I am highly motivated and disciplined to get the job done efficiently and correctly the first time. I highly respect those I work with and the population I serve.
good,Delivering the needed production assets on time so that I maintain quality and customer satisfaction that helps us support our war fighters.
good,"I wouldn't recommend this company to employees who are just starting out in their careers, it isn't the best place to learn as the culture is really laid back and you won't attain as much depth in your profession as you would with other companies. With that being said, the company culture is great, they take care of their employees, and the benefits are excellent."
good,I enjoyed performing my job at Boeing but I wasn't a big fan of the work environment and the general attitude of the place. I learned a lot about commercial jets so I would say that overall I enjoyed it.
good,My manager is effective for Boeing but imagines a threat from people around him that rise to his professional level.  He has deliberately undermined me and isolated me from visibility - yelling and intimidation are his currency. Basically a horrible boss over experienced professionals.
good,"Responsible for purchasing the components for the manufacturing of dyes used in the manufacturing of drugs and food products. This was another industry that I could add to my resume."
good,Great management and exciting work place.  Gained experience in aircraft manufacturing
good,working at Boeing was great.  Working at a large world known company like Boeing was nice.
good,"company climate changed. it is now low morale,"
good,With many airframes have the ability to work on many different ones
good,Mostly customer service in all capacities online training emergency response getting the job done in a fast safe way for all customers internal and external it is like a big city whatever needed to be done did it no external complaints 29 years..
good,Continue to support management to all office activitieson day to day and fun in the work place
good,"The people were nice, but you were just one person out of millions. Not the type of place you will advance unless you have the degrees and experience behind you."
good,decent work environment buy currently a lack of realization that people are not simply a HR file.
good,Good place to work. I just wish they would figure out that they need to be able to manufacture thier own products and quit trying to outsource everything.
good,"Lots of work, Great benefits, lack of safety concern, Worked with alot of great people."
good,Large company with many opportunities; overall a good experience.
good,Get on a new program if you want to do interesting things. Some days can be bad with boredom.
good,I learned how to prioritize and what was important; how to embrace lower level management in their absence and inform them of key points.
good,Good health care and benefits.  Advancement is curtailed to shrinking defense work.
good,I learned and accomplished so much at Boeing as a contracts Professional.
good,fun people svdjhfvsuhflsjbf guadjlscagxhdv gkbfslauwehff
good,Good work assignments with all sorts of skill needed to complete the work while some work assignments are still fun. Some assignments  may last hours. Some assignments may last for weeks. Some assignments last for months.
good,Some work assignments are hard work and some work assignments fun. Some assignments last hours. Some assignments last weeks. Some assignments last for months.
good,The same thing everyday with too many politics. No way to move up unless you brown nose. It steals your soul.
good,customer service with time management served necessary when dealing with a wide variety of International clients and their needs
good,Fast pace environment .  Don't have to worry about heat because you are in a temperature controlled building.  Co-workers are very helpful.
good,don't complain about people not doing their jobs managers 30 year plus guys!
good,"Boeing Houston is a good place to work, but has been on a downward slope sense 2008.  With the economic downturn it reduced alot of funding to the space program and after shuttle was canceled Houston site took a huge hit.  The Houston site has been on a steady decline as Boeing struggles to bring new work into the site.  Boeing is a good place to work with good benefits and working on very challenge projects.  The Houston site just need a influx of work."
good,Full time employment working on aviation contracts. Good training classes.
good,Made use of different applications at work. Worked with people from different cultural backgrounds.
good,Was able to telecommute some of the week.  Pay and health care coverage is great.  Morale is poor because of so many large layoffs.
good,"Productive, educational and challenging place to work at. working with different aircrafts."
good,"Typical day:"
good,Statement of Work moving out of area but the employees are not being offered a move.
good,Great company at one time with great pay and benefits.  Leadership makes it very stressful with all the demands for lowering cost and schedule.
good,Development opportunities are limited.  Employees are underutilized.
good,"Fast paced with long hours. "
good,I have learned to adapt to the demands of the workplace.  I trust my co-workers for guidance and direction.  They have a very competitive benefit package.  And management can be very support.
good,"Boeing has historically been a great place to work.  However, over the years they have been chipping away at what were industry-leading benefits, work/life balance and pay in order to cut costs even though they are experiencing record profits."
good,"I worked in auburn, seattle sucks I would never go back there unless it was my last option ever."
good,It wasnt that of a place to work. There was a lot of things that I would have changed
good,"aid well, underutilized people"
good,"Boeing offers a variety of compensation and benefits, making it nearly impossible to get fired, however, the fact that it is a union job creates lazy workers and bad work ethic which build lazy planes, lazy planes aren't built right. and it can cost lives. i would not trust my life to those who work under the name boeing"
good,This is a great place to work the only problem is that the work is tied to the government and their budgets.
good,"Great co-workers fun to work with and learned a lot from them."
good,The best part of working for Boeing was interacting with the variety of customers from all over the world.
good,"I enjoy demonstrating my ability to obtain information quickly. It is my first priority to ensure I complete each assignment, quickly, and precisely. Giving attention to detail and also organization, is the key to my success, and if given an opportunity I will be certain to give 110%. I have learned, working with many different diverse personalities, is it important to communicate and be open to understanding. Management leads way to great success, to ensure the team is, and will continue to be productive employee's, with the understanding of ""The Open Door"" policy, keeping the communication open. Having a passion for my job, helps me appreciate, and preform with great execution."
good,"Nice co-workers, fast paced environment. Great place to work, unfortunately has no job security."
good,opened at 3AM prep and cooked breakfeast. assisted customers. broke down at 9am to get ready for lunch. very busy.
good,What I enjoyed most was being left alone to accomplish what ever task was given to me. Having to learn how to be resourceful was a big part of my personal growth.
good,"Customer Service Team CST / Manufacturing Engineer (Boeing 787-8)"
good,"Liaison Electrical Design Engineering: "
good,"A typical day at work at The Boeing Company is very paced. Several brainstorming meetings, deadline driven, must be able to multitask several tasks at once. Also teamwork involvement is key. Must be able to work with all ethnicities. Working with people and completing tasks was favorite part of the job. The hardest part was being subjected to the politics but at the end the the day it made me stronger."
good,"Engineers are hired and fired in large bulk."
good,Positive and interesting work experience.  Great co-workers.
good,"The work expected of a mechanic is physically demanding, however it is capable of being completed (even if it means working a bit of overtime).  You couldn't ask for a better group of coworkers, at least I feel that way about the ones in my area.  Management views its employees as numbers designed to sell more numbers (jobs).  This is the big downfall, however again, coworkers help keep each others morale up.  We really do have a ping pong table!"
good,"Learned logistics as parts were delivered and shipped."
good,"The working environment is enclosed and standard for factory work. Arrive, complete scheduled duties and end shift.  Aside from regular scheduled duties, there is little potential for additional projects and customer service."
good,"Only for Ridley Park PA location:  Teams did not work well together, supervisors/managers had little knowledge and direction for team.  Supervisors did not make good use of some team members and overload others.  As a result work that was produced were not thoroughly checked, and pushed out the door.  Schedule became the only driver, quality of work not emphasized enough. "
good,"Maintain various manufacturing plans, Bill of Materials, work instructions and define and document as-built configuration. Investigated and resolved manufacturing issues. Provided input to manufacturing processes, and manufacturing technologies to meet cost and schedules. Develop work statements and sequencing of events to support delivery commitments"
good,"Enjoyable place to work, nice coworkers alot of overtime during holidays"
good,"Boeing Charleston is a huge site located next to the international airport in North Charleston, SC. Although spending several years at Boeing Charleston I was never able to get comfortable with the long hours, leaving me very little personal time with wife and newborn. The poor management decisions and commitments to customers and general inconsistency of everything going on in the plant only made the union look sweeter and sweeter and someday I predict there will be a union in place, as many disgruntled employees there are at that site. The work was primarily clean and the building air conditioned year round making it pretty comfortable working temperature for me. The benefits were great and among the best I've ever had along with the site offering many unique convenient services including a gift shop, Boeing store, cafeteria, catering company offering coffee/breakfast/lunch (for purchase) in the break room, eye glasses/safety glasses services, uniform services and dry cleaning, fed ex, HR serice center, and florist delivery service. The majority the convenient services offered were expensive and seemed to be put in place with the intention of keeping workers at the work place for longer amounts of time. Overall I am greatfull for the opportunity and experience I gained there, but I am glad I am no longer working there. I believe that life is precious and a gift from God, weekends and overtime should be optional to enjoy the outdoors and to spend with family because you never know how much time you have left. We are not robots, nor are we slaves, we are all humans and equal."
good,"Long hours with no work and I wasn't too keen on sitting around all day, I'm a hard worker and Boeing isn't the place for hard workers."
good,Boeing would be a great place to work if management would let the employees do their job. Things are constantly changing which leads to less production.
good,Managed 600 member union production team. Inventory control.
good,"•	Experienced troubleshooter of multiple business applications in a help desk environment."
good,Second shift was not for me but it was a good place to work and you couldn't beat the benefits.
good,workplace provides challenging opportunities with good co-workers.
good,"Worked as a contractor and had mixed feelings about the company. "
good,My work day consisted of building inboard trailing edge of F15 aircraft.
good,"Work load are various and challenging with facing new Tasks everyday."
good,LOng term employment. Good benifetts. Execellent pay room for advancment close to home good people to work with
good,Worked on the commercial side and the federal Govt. side.  Too many managers who look after their own needs vs the employees under them.  Great history and a good feeling of satisfaction to belong to this history.
good,"I work with a great group of people. My coworkers are supportive and cover each other when needed. With such a young group, the group dynamic is very fun and easy going."
good,From the time that I set foot in the door someone is literally asking for something like tools or help of some sort. I've learned how to multitask a lot better. Everyday brings something new. I enjoy working with the mechanics and learning everyone's different personalities.
good,"As an intern, I was given a well-defined project and achieved my goals by the end of the summer. It was a great learning experience. "
good,The things we work on at Boeing are challenging and necessary for the safety of our country. These are complex systems that are highly valued by our customers.

good,Clean place
good,Washington Mutual was absorbed by Chase. This was a good place to gain mortgage experience.
good,Good Solid Company
good,"I've worked the military side for 32+ years as a Test and Software Engineer primarly in leadership roles. Each development project is unique with it's own challenges and rewards. I've had opportunities to work on some high profile product development projects. Since the McDonnell Douglas merger in the 90s, the company has evolved from a customer/product quality focus to more of a bottom line approach today. 1st level management is a difficult underpaid job, higher levels of management tend to be rotated quite often leaving little continuity or established relationships. My co-workers have been the most dedicated and trusted people I've ever been associated with."
good,"Responsible for 747-8 FLOORS planning and sequence of operations specify procedures for the fabrication of tools and equipment utilizing PDM, CAPP, OWI, SHOPVIEW, IVT, and REDARS engineering system.

good,Lots of issues right now for a start up site might be better in a few years
good,"Company offers great stability and benefits, but is risk adverse and too vertical in structure."
good,The hardest part about the job was dealing with the different government personalities and their tendancies. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting an awesome team lead to work for as well as having valuable team members working alongside me was rewarding.
good,The Boeing Defensive & Satellite Division is one of the Satellite companies that's doing better financially compared to other satellite companies in the industry.
good,"Overall a very good company to work for, but lack typical job experience for an A&P mechanic. If you want to go to the flight line you must have some type of maintenance experience. As of now I'm a high paid assembler so if I want to advance to the flight line I must somehow find another job to get there."
good,"was a contractor for a while, its very good money and good training but people are very political and sensitive."
good,This is a very conservative company that has been around for a long time and is trying to make the transition from paper to digital.
good,"I worked on the wing build for the Boeing C-17, Globemaster III. This plane is a military cargo ship used to deliver troops, equipment, and and aid. It has also been used as a hospital ship for wounded soldiers."

good,Boeing Aerospace Corp. is a great company to work for they build so many amazing products. I enjoyed the people I worked with and had very smart and respectful managers.
good,"I worked at Boeing when they were going through severe changes in culture, management and markets. They were struggling with it, but management was pretty sharp at the time and they came through pretty well."
good,"compliance is a challenge, short of man power, lack of knowledge transfer"
good,Review new proposals.
good,"A good place to work, with good benefits, hands-off management and great co-workers."
good,"Great company with incredible benefits and competitive salary. Good job stability, but very competitive for advancement. I've had the same title for 4+ years now, with minimal raises, but get great reviews from management and above. Go figure."
good,Allowed sub par employees to stay employeed and let above par employees pick up the slack
good,"Innovative company with great leaders and employees. Fast paced environment, going through a lot of change. Overall, good company to work for."
good,"Always a rush for a deadline, working with a team of people to accomplish that goal. Working in enviroments such as that always makes you appreciate the work of others and the teamwork everyone puts in."
good,Its ok but they need some changes in management to keep people there. Its a good starting place for military.
good,"Company has great benefits, but work environment is poor do to a weak work/life balance."
good,"Solving issues. Working closly with others identifying roadblocks, and implementing positive changes. Getting buy ins from all levels and organizations. Working long hours. Seeing results and smiles from changes we made."
good,"Implemented planned changes to the production line that introduced new technology, tooling and design improvements."

good,Boeing is comprised of two divisions - Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Integrated Defense. Offers great opportunities for interns. Lots of interesting programs and projects.
good,"Good company, basic 8-5. I learned about the Boeing AWACS systems. Good co-workers. Working is Seattle was hard, gray all the time. Nice people"
good,Worked on the defense side of the business. Good workplace with good benefits.
good,Great pay and advancement. Thou your job can be offloaded and eliminated very fast.
good,"Boeing is a great company, with alot of opportunites. However it appears to be in a current state of flux, which lends to disorganiztion at times. I am in the quality control department, and feel that it is the most critcal sector of any organization. Here at Boeing, they tend to place the correct amount of diligence in quality assurance. This is a great place to work, but I am open to new opportunites at this time."
good,"I had a great supervisor, the environment clean and very organized. The cables I built at that time, the setup layout was very nice to control 150 ft. cables all material came with your kit except the blue print layout, at that time you used Micro Fish material."
good,"Good place to work. Management does a good job of keeping employees informed about workplace changes. Down side, too much business group and personnel relocating (mandated) within company."
good,"working for mcdonnell douglas was alot of fun. good bosses, great teammates,and good friends."
good,"Boeing is a very big place. You are a little fish."
good,"Benefits and general employee treatment continues to decline over the years as the company's only true focus is stock price. Not all of management are clowns here, but there is an alarming percentage."
good,Takes a long time to implement anything. Very management heavy.  Lots of politics.  Change is not what most people are used to.  I do recommend this company to start your career.
good,"Boeing is a great place to work with some caveats. 1 the pay is competitive and great benefits. however they have a quota to fill. so mandatory overtime happens, which may be weeks on end. In addition people get moved and laid off regularly. As a result I found myself falling farther on the list to move to a day shift. Night shift is ok, but work life schedule will suffer. Benefits have changed recently, so I expect to see newer people coming and going more than in the past. As a result pay structure will be less. Ultimately it is a great place to work, but I wouldn't plan my future there."
good,"It was a good company before shareholder value became more important than quality.  Working directly for the company, employees care about the product.  Outsourced employees do not care.  And as any seasoned professional can tell you, you cannot become a professional within 8 weeks out of college.  Thus is the folly of shareholder value versus quality.  You can lay off employees and keep shareholder value high until you drive the company out of business.  Thus the current customer base is suffering dearly for Boeing shareholder value.   And thus, being outsourced and supporting Boeing, we were laid off to increase CSC shareholder value - further damaging the Boeing customer for CSC shareholder value.  H1B cannot do classified work.  So our contract was dumped.   "
good,"Don't go there ever, It's a place with large windowless buildings and will just suck the life out of you. Don't go there ever, and it's not the place it once was"
good,"ASC2 in OKC is disorganized and completely off the rails. Everything is always behind, no seems to follow their own processes.  If you apply, stay away from surveillance."
good,"In previous decades, Boeing compensation attracted better talent. Recent Boeing policy drives employee compensation to average, resulting in an average ability to hire average employees, particularly experienced personnel."
good,"I have plenty of coworkers that I look up to as good, solid software engineers. However, all of us deal with constant obstacles that exist in this entire industry, not just at Boeing Defense."
good,"No free stuff. Bring your own consumables or use one of the many cafeterias."
good,"Very challenging job, well paying job. Shift job. very demanding customers and operational.  good exposure in various region; South east asia; middle est and Europe sector"
good,"Considering you are often treated as a number, I found I best to just show up and not make waves.  The money was good but the amount of overtime in my area make it tough to have a personal life outside of work"
good,"The best 11 years of my work-life.; I have worked with a diverse group of people, learned so much about myself, others and the industry. Management supports growth and movement; hardest part of job is lack of teamwork in my field; I like to think we all work for the betterment of a company and the ""not my job"" especially in my position is very frustrating.  The culture in my current area promotes growth and development.  Most enjoyable part of my job is all of the different people I get to work with and have met over the years."
good,Overall the group I worked in was very lazy.  More than one person took more than one nap a day.  I desired a different working environment one where I could design more and grow more.
good,Run like a company in the 50s. It's slow and the company enjoys talking about advancing to keep up with the times but will not take action to do so. Cannot recommend.
good,"Working as a contractor to Boeing often let me feeling out of the loop with the competitive pay, benefits and such, but it's a really nice place to work otherwise. People are often very friendly and interactive."
good,Direction changes frequently and there is little accountability for employees and a lot of finger pointing. There is a sense of favoritism and it shows in who gets who promoted.
good,"Boeing is a large company."
good,"Typical Aerospace company work environment. "
good,"Plenty of chances to work on cool things, but a fairly bureaucratic environment at times. "
good,"There was a time that Boeing would have been a great place to work. Earlier in my career, it was a great place to learn your craft and develop your skills. Now, its a place where people spend the day, trying to do the least amount of work as possible. People stay in their area, and don't collaborate. Lower-Level Managers are usually young and experienced, and got the job because of diversity quotas. Mid-Level Managers stay in their offices and rarely come out of them. They manage through emails and travel to show their importance. "
good,Boeing Computer Services no longer exists as far as I know.The role was taken over by Lockheed Martin - and then things turned for the worse with extreme downsizing. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation has been shrinking ever since.
good,"Typical large, bureaucratic organization with very talented workforce.  As with most larger organizations, much time and effort is focused internally.  Process oriented business culture"
good,"Pros:"
good,"The Boeing Company is a good place to work.  The employee benefits, however, over the years has begun to decline, including the soft freeze of salary and additional medical costs."
good,Boeing is a great place to work.  I was able to complete my education and try various job tasks.  It is a very diverse and complex company.  It has allowed me to work in the aviation industry which is a passion of mine.
good,"Some things are better left unsaid. Just watch your back and make sure you're ready to learn things on your own. Training is scarce. Other than that, it's a great place to work."
good,"Flexible schedule, understanding however, very segregated in that so long as you are part of the ""in"" crowd, you will advance, if you are not, you will stagnate and eventually leave as your career is dead in the water at that point."
good,Could have been more relevant to the Australian workplace. I felt like another number and it was very hierarchical. I think it would be better if Boeing was a little more in touch with their companies outside of Seattle in the US.
good,Aviation Partners Boeing was a nice place to work.  The work was interesting and challenging and the culture was relaxed and enjoyable.  There was a good work/life balance and it was supported by senior management.
good,Boeing is typical company in my opinion. Depending on leadership the focus changes.  The constant is change.  Some of the change does not make since and at times upper management does not flow down items well.
good,"This was a great company to work for.... over 10 years ago.  Leadership used to seek input from employees on  technical decisions.  This has been lost and it doesn't seem much gets completed anymore.  Now leadership will tell workers what to do, even if it is wrong.  Raising a concern can be a risky proposition with some managers.    Not a bad place, but skill growth and morale are not great here."
good,Good company to work for. Manager skills are lacking. would work for them again. great time off for vacation and sick. great 401k match. good health benefits.
good,A typical day was just removing parts from the rack and getting them positioned to be delivered to the right department. once you got them ready to be transported you would then repeat.
good,"As the title states, the program I am currently in feels like it is on its last leg because the sustainment contract can easily be out-bid by other capable companies. The job culture is not competitive, but at the same time not welcoming. A lot of tribal knowledge was lost when a combination of lay-offs and retirements occurred. Propriety tools that are not very intuitive are actually a hindrance in working efficiently, along with insufficient training opportunities. I'm sure the opposite can be said for all the other Boeing programs that have plenty of funding."
good,"Boeing is a 100-year-old company, with the associated pros and cons.  You can have a solid career at the company, provided you live in one of the areas to which it has migrated its jobs.  The old salary and benefits program are not available in the new job markets."
good,The company is slow to compete in salaries with the IT industry.  It is difficult to run a manufacturing facility while trying to keep up with the IT industry.  Our old time management structures and philosophies are too outdated.
good,"Nothing can beat the pay and benefits you can get from a place like this. The structures work that I personally did beat my body up and on occasion would have to work 10 plus hours a day and weekends to stay on schedule. Management rotates often to help other areas out and as a result of that things get shaken up within different shops. My advise to anyone going there would to get your foot in the door and try to move to a higher paying job code. Don't get stuck on waiting to ""max out"" like most do and loathe their jobs."
good,"Don't get comfortable with your job at this company. During my tenure here I could easily see the downward slope of the employment status. Sadly, I became a casualty of this company. It was good while working there, but definitely not a place to get comfortable with."
good,I was an aircraft mechanic for Boeing Louisiana.. We were working on KC10 refuel aircraft. We were doing depot maintenance for Boeing. Small repairs that the KC10 needed.
good,"Let me start off by saying that overall, Boeing is a good company. The company pays well and there is some amazing engineering that is developed in the company. That said it is very group dependent and be prepared to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and very poor management. To move up, you do need to suck up to upper level managers, most of whom are not very good leaders. Your day at Boeing typically starts before 8 AM (some engineers show up as early as 5 AM) and the office mostly vacates by 4 PM. Not very good food options, at least in the factory settings and parking at the Everett Factory can be so bad that you can expect to walk for 20 minutes or more from the parking lot to your desk. Also you have to pay for office coffee, which is very bizarre even if a cup is only $0.35. If you are in an engineering role, you can learn a tremendous amount, especially in structures engineering, but there is a tendency for the engineers to be way too conservative and scared away by new technology. Example, many groups actively avoid doing FEMs and rely too heavily on fleet data and things that have worked for half a century. I was expected to read stress notes from 1979 and come up with solutions that were acceptable using nothing but pen and paper. Not all terrible, I really learned the fundamentals, but it does make for a culture that is very risk adverse and makes some engineers just know the ""Boeing"" method rather than really understand structure. Lastly, politics are very pervasive in the company. Managers vie for their favorite engineers to go work on the newest projects and to give"
good,Boeing can be a fun place to work. Coworkers are usually very helpful. I had a great  team leader and manager.  They fought hard to simplify our jobs and to get us hired on . I miss the crew
good,"I love being able to organize my time the way I want and answer only to my client as far as what they want and need for me to help them succeed, but it's scary not knowing if I'll be around next quarter."
good,Process continues to over burden employees and forces them to work longer to achieve sub-par results. Management is constantly changing which makes it difficult to develop a good working relationship to overcome unnecessary processes.
good,"All of the Benefits I have and enjoyed at Boeing were all attributed to a) The Labor Unions I belonged to"
good,"Boeing has great benefits, but has far too many processes and procedures. It takes nearly a year to secure a large procurement, which is far too long."
good,There is a lot of blame to go around in Boeing.  Productive and inventive employees are often not recognized.  Good engineers get very discouraged when managers stupidly treat them like rookies and overburden them with clerical work.  After 24 years of high calibre work at Boeing I ended up reviewing drawings for dotted i's and missing commas and counting number of fasteners needed.
good,I had a good career but seldom to you have a mentor to guide you. Up and down yo-yo employment cycles are a real pain. Periodic reviews appear to be good seem to show that managers are wonderful rather than actually benefiting the employee.
good,"Contractor with Boeing company, I do not have direct connection with the company and benefits. "
good,Typical work day work study. What I have learned how to build a aircraft. Ups and Down management. Work place culture were very different. The hardest part of the job looking for change and checking for the IRM of the job for the change. The most enjoyable part of the job work got done.
good,"There are many aspects of Boeing.  In an office enviornment, it very stark.  White walls and beige cubicles.  The culture is ultra conservative.  Follow the line, don't go outside the box."
good,You will learn a lot from the people who has been there for 20+ years and how they advanced into their career. The best place about the job is the work life balance.
good,The employees at boeing sc found out that other boeings with unions are paid on average $10+ more a hour and have more people doing jobs which at boeing sc an one man job is a 4 man job at other boeing facilities. Raises were just cents not dollars and upper management were getting either fired or layoff by the hundreds. The only thing i can say was exceptional were the benefits. cheap but well covered
good,"Boeing is a great place to work because there are so many ways to learn.  The Management knows what they want, they just don't know how to get there. Good initiatives and philosophies,,, very low ownership and weak and inconsistent tactics... 5S isn't leveraged as it should be... The culture of perpetual churn of people at all levels is what promotes the lack of continuity, accountability and lack of standardization."
good,"The workplace culture is in flux. Right now, it seems like no one knows where that will lead to. It is a hard environment to work in when you don't know who will have a job from one day to another."
good,"You are told you are not doing the work for your job code, but manager refuses to give you the type of work you need to meet the job code, instead giving you administrative work while the male techs are given more technical work and better pay."
good,"I hired in to teach.  I loved the teaching.   Most of my time was spent revising manuals and fixing outdated teaching material, not teaching.   I also found out I was paid significantly less than my male co-workers and taught more aircraft types than they did.  I found I could not advance to a higher pay level because I had not been with the company 10 years."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work if you want excellent benefits.  However, it is very old school with advancement, work/life balance and management.  Overall, the experience at Boeing was average."
good,"The company culture is very lackluster, compensation is competitive within aerospace, but not in the puget sound area. Overall not a very exciting place to work."
good,Best employment job so far. Just had a couple issues with leave of absence and I'm currently in process of discrimination lawsuit. Got wrongfully terminated.
good,"needs union management not so good work not hard"
good,"Boeing allow you to take extra curriculum classes. You get paid fairly well, compared to other employers in the region. Work is not challenging. You have the opportunity to learn and apply learned leassons."
good,Great programs and limited reconization despite significant contribution on programs. Too much expectations and too many hours demanded from an engineering leads by senior managers.
good,"*If you have worked in a union before, you know it can be a double edged sword regarding worker motivation, and making daily work progress. The same goes here."
good,"Boeing is the well-established, and big company for aerospace, you can learn a lot definitely, and I have increased my expertise in aeroacoustics and aerodynamics. But it may be lack of enthusiasm for new idea as a start-up company has."
good,"The culture, job growth within, old ways need to change.  Time to be competitive for hiring young talent and keeping the talent.  An overhaul is needed to compete and be competitive.  Benefits and savings plan are strong, however needs to be more to keep young talent."
good,"Work with some great people"
good,"Everyday work is good"
good,"It's ok place to work for. Your value depends on the manager. Pay raise is not that great. Company encourage employees to move up level, but once you move up, you have more chance to be laid off as your pay get higher"
good,"Boeing is turning away from trusting their management and their employees. When I started the company could compete competitively with benefits and career options. The company has since changed their focus and no longer can compete like they used to. The people are great and if you are an engineer, this is the place for you. If you are not, there are better options out there."
good,"I have worked at Boeing for over 10 years and i'm in my 30s.  They make a great product - airplanes, but the work culture is very archaic.  They have a very laid back mentality and are technologically backward.  If they can change their culture and attract more young people by changing some of their policies, they can do better."
good,"great opportunity to dive into the up front planning aspects to many projects and program opportunities.  Work with Program managers on directives that will change the way the company operates.  You can get a good feel for how Boeing is managed by working here."
good,Large company with large bureaucracy. If you work in military industrial complex you will work at government speed with similar bureaucracy.
good,"I was enchanted when I first came to Boeing but soon found that it was just like any other large corporation despite the fact that from the outside it appears to be on the forefront of technology and makes exciting products. Most days at work are dull and everyone is either bored or overworked. It is hard to get anything done due to the level of ""red tape"" around everything and the company as a whole moves at a snail's pace. If you are an engineer who is excited and passionate to work at a fast pace on the cutting edge of technology, Boeing is not the place for you. If you like a fairly stable job environment with decent work life balance and benefits, then you might be a better fit."
good,A review will be given post-employment. It would be unfair to give an assessment before my work there is done. Who knows what the future holds...
good,I learned a lot in the duration of the time there. I didn't like the management and the way how the business of the company was ran. there was to many chiefs and not enough indians. Management always lied and talked down to the mechanics
good,"Work life balance here is good, however culture here reflects that of a large company.  Career advancement is slow which can become difficult to deal with on a day to day basis."
good,"The company is a good starting point to learn about Supply Chain and Aerospace. The environment is dynamic, filled with youth and you get to work with people around the world."
good,Comfortable work environment with a generally good group of fellow employees to work with.  Products are interesting with good potential for engaging tasks but floor level management is a bit weak resulting in many times saying to yourself how things could be much better.
good,"The benefits and compensation at Boeing are highly competitve thanks to the continuing efforts of the union, SPEEA.  The management is very impressive."
good,"Team atmosphere.. Always encouraged to put forward ideas for improving work methods and safety. Overall, a really good group of peolple to work with."
good,"Good place to work, fun co-workers and good benefits and a company gym. Office environment is also a good plus. There is a also a lot to learn and many seasoned employees."
good,"The company culture is deteriorating, what used to be a people driven company has become a dollar driven company.  ""What have you done for me TODAY?"""
good,"Good compensation and benefits"
good,A company that has changed their culture in order to stay profitable. Job cutting has now cut into bone by letting go of knowledgeable employees for sake of profit.
good,the most enjoyable part is seeing the product fly.I learned the importance of a uniformed processes and timely training.
good,"Benefits were great but continued to decrease.  Although they are starting to let younger employees move up, it is slow."
good,"Its a large company, and like any large company it comes with positive and negative points.  Good job security, but advancement and benefits are very prescribed."
good,Fun working environment with opportunity to growth in manufacturing category.  Great amount of politics and bureaucratic but friendly management. Learning is limited but a lot of variety in what i did each day
good,"Boeing operates on the buddy system. If you are not in the click or in someone family you don't look for advancement. As far as making a living you can do that. You learn your job well and do a excellent job, but you end up training a family member who will one day be over you. But you just adjust and do the best you can, because as far as pay, its hard to find a better paying job with benefits as Boeing"
good,While working at this site I have found that it is extremely difficult to move up or be promoted while staying the saying group. In essence you must move around to move up. I am also finding it very difficult to find jobs elsewhere because of the nature of the site and the way the business is structured many of the manufacturing related disciplines are not in line with industry standard.
good,"-Manage, build, package and deliver software to test and production environments"
good,"Day to day I worked with many fine people, and the pace was generally reasonable for a good work/life balance, with good opportunities when times are good.  It is possible to learn a lot depending on one's role.   The downside is when times are bad, there can be a lot of unneeded turmoil and strife."
good,I have not been afforded the opportunity to enhance my skill sets much. Working Boeing Defense can be extremely different then Boeing Commercial in terms of culture.
good,"I enjoy the work I'm doing, the people I work with and the professional relationships between employees and management. Boeing is an exciting place to work, watching a 737 take form is amazing."
good,"The company is a predominantly male-dominated institution that struggles with the acceptance of diverse viewpoints, culture, age and gender. The company seemingly struggles to retain young, creative and innovative thinkers in certain areas of the company. Boeing, however, is a great place to work especially if you are in a vocational field. The benefits are fairly competitive.  Management tends to be very supportive of their employees and very humanistic. However, movement within the company can be limiting. Despite the cons, working at Boeing has been an overall positive experience."
good,A good place to work with industry standard pay and benefits. Career success is dependent on your current manager or must transfer internal within company. The hardest part of the job is dealing within the bureaucracy of working for a large company.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with good coworkers who want to do the right things.
good,"I've worked for the Boeing Company for over 12 years.  This company has the best benefits I think I have seen in a long time for a company.  I love the 10 days off at the end of the year with pay.  The pay 100% of your tuition and include books and some materials. "
good,"Work/life balance can be a challenge at times.Very cool to be part of building airplanes.  Opportunities available to move between organizations and try new things.  Schedule and budget constraints can lead to high stress environment.  Benefits are competitive, but not as good as they used to be."
good,Very Challenging Work Enviroment. Very demanding schedule. I had established myself as a strong leader.
good,During my time here I worked on many different programs  which gave me a large amount of cross training and a chance to expand my skills
good,"There was a variety of days; development, searching for work, testing, organization, communication, but most days were 8 hours long and went by very quickly. "
good,Need better management and more appreciation for their labor force.
good,Prepare aircraft from factory on the flight line for delivery to the customer
good,Enabled employees to have input in developing and implementing Lean initiatives.
good,"Boeing is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets and satellites.  Boeing is the world’s largest aerospace company and the leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and military aircraft combined.  The company is also the second-largest aerospace and defense contractor."
good,"Although the pay and benefits were nice I found BAA to be very disorganized from a finance department point of view. Lots of changes without reason, a lot of management fads followed for one year and given up the next."
good,"Was very satisfied with Boeing and the growth I was gaining from my experience to my educational goals. Boeing paid 100% of my education from Associates to my Masters. But when time came to lay off or let employees go, although my hard work and time that it took to achieve my position and education, Boeing said ""sorry"". gotta let you go.So disappointing."
good,If you really want to learn the aviation Boeing is a good company to start with to learn and expand in aviation.
good,"Large corporate company.  If you are a college graduate, it is a great company to work for after 10-15 years, they don't want to keep you around"
good,"Long Beach site is very behind on times, and boeing as a company facing stiff competition from airbus is really opting for lower conpensation. As a result the quality is lowering in the selection of engineers since they do not offer appropriate salaries, great company to gain experience though and move one."
good,"work was a daily routine in most cases. The goal was to get the work done and get it released. Relatively mundane in most cases. Management was involved but not too concerned overall. Co-workers were generally interested in accomplishing the task at hand. Hardest part was lack of advancement opportunities, while the best part was chances to learn new software and to be able to help implement and train on said software."
good,"Boeing is a tough place to work for those early in their career. The average employee has been there for about 20 years and because of that they are very ingrained in processes and procedures they've been doing forever that are not efficient and don't work anymore. It takes A LOT to build credibility and impact change. For some reason, the company has decided to make internal ""tools"" rather than purchase better off-the-shelf solutions. Which means Boeing has very outdated tools that are extremely difficult to use. Even those employees who have been here for years dont know how to use them very effectively. There are some billiant people that I work with, but all in all, I've been relatively unimpressed. We are not as rigirous about who we hire as other companies. If you are intelligent and work hard, you will advance, which is refreshing. But we don't deal effectively with under performers and it is very hard to get fired. Leadership needs a major overhaul. Some managers are very good, but others were just promoted for technical skill or political reasons 10-15 years ago and are still clogging up those jobs for more deserving people. It will be several years, but eventually a lot of the workforce here will be retiring and that will start to change the culture more dramatically. It's just a question of if you can handle working here long enough to see that happen."
good,This was a great job but the Boeing company offers no stability and the threat of being laid off looms over the horizon constantly.  Great pay and benefits but of course getting laid off mean no pay and no benefits.  I'm among the many getting laid off.  Many of us gave the company the best we could but we ended up being outsourced anyway.
good,The Boeing Company used to have some of the best and brightest engineers in the world.  But that has faded. 
good,"This is a great company if you are looking for the most stability, a decent salary, and ultimately are seeking a career for the sake of providing your family with the salary and benefits necessary for you to enjoy a marginally decent life. This is a company for those who are not living to work, but working to live, and moreover have no innate commitment / compulsion to making a personal 'dent' in this this world."
good,Large corporate structure with regular hire/layoff cycle. Not a good long-term employer.
good,"Nothing Special, Good Place to Work, Benefits were Very Nice."
good,"Slow moving and union oriented, but like being part of a large family."
good,"Great place to work. The people make the company all being the tops in there fields you can,t help but learn every day."
good,"When I was transferred from my beloved 767 , where I was SO HAPPY, To a terribly unhappy, low energy unfriendly shop at 777 under an  obviously stressed and incompetent manager where the atmosphere was that of distrust gossip back biting and "" every man for himself"" mentality, I no longer desired to be there . Hypocritical actions and double standards ruled"
good,A job you have to make the best out of it. Not to much pressure on employees. Work to life ratio is pretty good with plenty of OT if needed. Would recommend to someone.
good,"A lot of people with very structured business requirements.  Many different areas of organizations and many different job titles, lots of room for growth if placed in the right spot at the right time"
good,"The work-life balance was great. The quality of work was good as I got to work on the latest technology stack and frameworks. The team lead was really knowledgeable and helpful. On the manager side, I had a bad experience, most of the time he'll pass on his responsibilities to us and never really appreciated or understood technology much. Yearly hikes were not so high and lots of office politics. Overall a positive experience but the quality of work will depend on which team you are. selected for"
good,I feel management has lost its focus on quality and the customer and makes decisions based on the good of stock price and not the needs of the customer
good,"Old technologies, slow paced and not very Agile. Leadership doesn't support SAFe, but they claim to practice it. People are friendly, but not motivated to improve or change. Status quo is acceptable"
good,Boeing in the beginning years was interesting. You really see the separation between hourly and salary. Job is not difficult if you don't slack off. Everyone expects you to pull your weight. Management from time to time can actually help out but most of the time they are just in the way and throwing you under the bus. I've only had maybe 2 managers who actually helped my group succeed and show what we were capable and ably to accomplish.
good,"Specifically for a software tester, revising documentation and constant sprints can be pretty numbing. That's why it's important to assess whether the environment and coworkers you will mainly be with is a good fit for you and the company. Luckily, I had great co workers who helped me, and in turn I was happy and more productive."
good,"The Boeing Company is an amazing place to work, but it can also be a difficult place to work just the same. "
good,"Boeing is a great Company as far as benefits, compensation. It's very demanding but you are well compensated for that. The negatives are-"
good,"Not a lot of job security but great benefits."
good,"I do not wish to give one and do not understand why this is a portion of my submission, this seems stupid. Please change this and make it optional because I should not have to do it."
good,The work isn't too hard. You go through about a month of training and then have on the floor training after that. The workplace is pretty laid back just as long as you do what you're supposed to and follow the safety rules.  Management is good and understanding. Most positions you have to start out as a contractor and the process to get hired on permanently is unnecessarily long and very drawn out.
good,Great company to work for but there are politics like most big companies. My last group was a good group of people and decent management. Benefits and pay are wonderful.
good,I don't feel that I would accurately be able to describe the current work culture at Boeing as it's been more than 5 years.  The company I understand has gone through several changes.
good,"Very little job security, and company is clique-ish. Management is micro managed, engineers are given priority. Regardless of how hard a supoorting group may try to support engineering, despite road blocks that the company refused to rectify, little if any kudos went to supporting organizations."
good,"You get to work on some really cools stuff and the comps & bennies are great. But as with an massive company, you are just a small cog in a huge machine and they will discard you at a moments notice."
good,Good way learning new jobs everyday. Fast pace work and lots of ot if that's what you prefer.  Education is available if needed to continue.  Other then that you have to see for yourself on how it really is.
good,"Work days never the same as the day before."
good,"Your work group and manager dictate your experience at Boeing. Sometimes you stand out and can do amazing work, other times you are told to keep your head down and to not ask questions or rock the boat. I tried to advance to be an analyst; went to school for my masters, earned a few certs and networked consistently, but was told I needed a degree from Carnegie Mellon to have a chance. After the newest analyst (my prior year's intern who had a BA in Management from....not Carnegie Mellon) was hired on and asked me to write some queries for him I learned quickly that Boeing doesn't know what to do with the employees they have."
good,"I worked night shift out on the 787 flight line. It wasn't too bad of an experience, and your coworkers are relatively friendly. Though their aircraft scheduling is all over the place, it's starting to slowly smooth out. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work.  Lots of good people, very friendly.  Good of great opportunities and challenges within several business units.  Good work life balance."
good,Boeing took care of me while I was there and for the most part I have few complaints.  Of course being the Aerospace Industry it is highly dependent on market economic outlook and progress of Major Programs.
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for. I think they can do better with the accumulation of vacation for newer employees. The pay is okay I think they can do better with that aspect as well. The managers I have had so far were great but I keep telling them where I want to be and end up in jobs that I have no desire in doing. The current job title I have is deceiving, it is not the job that I am doing, I definitely thought I would be doing more hands on work."
good,lost its way after being taken over by McDonnell Douglas with our own money. Tragic really that a company so important to the US would fall so far from its position of power in the 80's
good,For the position I held the pay just wasn't enough to afford a one bedroom apartment near work. The benefits were great however the doctors were still too expensive too afford even with insurance. Great work life balance and coworkers.
good,I was a contract hire for Boeing. The pay for being a contract hire was great but becoming permanent required taking a pay cut. Management played favoritism but  my manager personally was awesome. As a contract hire I didn't receive any benefits from Boeing and at meetings with everyone from my department upper management made it a point to let everyone know that I wasn't permanent. Something else I didn't care for was the fact that everything that went wrong was always procurement fault. I know other people that worked in other departments and they didn't have the negative experiences that I had. So if you go work for the company do not go into procurement.
good,I spend most of my day reading blueprints and looking up processes in order to get everything we do correct the first time.  I've learned a lot of information fast considering I've only been here for 6 months and feel I've learned so many new things with this being a project that's never been done before.  The hardest part of the job is getting here in the morning!  The workplace culture is great and I enjoy working with such a diverse team.
good,"Reviewed communications material in preparation for department meetings. Made sure graphics were in alignment with ""tonal message"" my team wanted to send out to business partners."
good,The hours here were great and the management were very supportive.  I found I learned a lot about managing accounts and password resets for active directory.
good,"was trained on a system I ran in St. Louis , good people to work for."
good,"Some days very busy, which is good, and some days move very slowly.  People executing the work are the same ones required to support constant proposal activity.  RIF constantly going on over the last few years keeps everyone on edge."
good,"*Learned a lot about complex problem solving with limited resources."
good,"I was hired as a contractor shortly after 9/11 attack had occurred which made the work stressful.Much business had been lost. They announced two weeks after I started that a third of their Engineers would be laid off, which, of course meant most contractors. I worked diligently to complete my assignment before my contract ended and was successful; my supervisor was happy with my work but there was no work available for me so I was laid off. My general impression was that it was a better than average place to work but it depends on what group you are in."
good,"If you like to get work accomplished in a timely manner, Boeing is not the place.  It's pretty much like the movie office space.  Most people in management are the very people that you don't want in management."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind the same thing everyday. Great pay and good benefits. Down side is they don't let go of people that are slowing production down.
good,"Support customer and business segments on a daily basis."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Boeing is the people. The hardest part of the job is the morale. The ""Working together"" attitude championed by Alan Mullaly and the 777 development years has past. I learned that people teaming together for successful outcomes can make work life something to look forward to everyday."
good,"Great if you are older, not so much for the young.  Like most aerospace companies, the benefits are declining.  Luckily they are almost always a little better at Boeing."
good,"Boeing has very talented and skilled work force but there skill,  experience and knowledge is not being utilized where they can benefit Boeing the most. It is due to the middle management fail to recognize the skill and talent of the employees resulting in poor performance for the company and employees."
good,I would work here again if possible.  It is a good place to gain experience and learn about he job perfoming aircraft mechanic.  I would like to go back maybe.
good,Volume of work is unrealistic for the staff in place. Incompetent managers put into roles they are not prepared for nor receive support to grow into the position once promoted.  Definitely who you know helps to navigate climbing the ladder.  Employees that have had real ethics violations are still on the payroll....despite it being public knowledge of their actions.  Erodes trust and confidence in SLT.
good,Boeing is a disciplined and process driven company as it should be given the products.  There are typically many opportunities for new challenges and assignments.
good,"As with any big company, employee experiences will vary drastically depending on the team/org/division. BCA overall was very relax and employee friendly. However, it is prone to sudden layoffs."
good,The top name in aerospace engineering.  Boeing relies on its market position for security and less on innovation.  Engineers here will have a tough time advancing and learning new skills once lost in the sea of jargon and red tape
good,The company is currently in the processing of consolidating the jobs to be primarily in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast part of the US.  If you are an Engineer you have better opportunities
good,"A typical day at Boeing was 6am-2:30pm"
good,Workplace culture is very old and traditional. Needs to continue to push for major culture change. Don't have freedom to make decisions due to the hierarchical nature. Good benefits and pay.
good,"This company has good employee culture but depending on the location, the promotions can be slow, the diversity in management is lacking, and the turnover can be high because of the lack of promotions."
good,The job was interesting and I learned new security procedures. The drive was stressful and time consuming. Room for job growth. Nice people to work and interact with.
good,It's a good job and a good place to work.  Management can be hit or miss depending on which area you work in and for the most part the people you work alongside are great as well.  It can be difficult to progress within the company though and many workers have had the same job for 10-20 years.
good,this is a very nice place to work and its not beoing its GCA its contract im a supervisor duties because i have  to a route to clean everyday because the manager wont hire help
good,"Company tries to maintain a good work-life balance, but corporate demands places more priority on production quotas, designated over time, and personal sacrifices. "
good,I work in the engineering department. The people in my cube are great to work with and quite fun. I have learned a lot working here especially about composites manufacturing.
good,The work was interesting and challenging as I had not worked on a Boeing 747 commercial aircraft before. The management was very good about helping me learn the day to day computer programs that I had to use on a daily basis.
good,"Work is not hard, just have to pay attention to detail. Met a lot of new friends from Boeing people I still associate with. Benefits and pay are very good for this area. Would recommend anyone apply."
good,Boeing Defence was a good place to work and a company which is continuing to improve. It is a progressive company which is looking to the future and would be an ideal employee for a young person starting out and looking for a career in IT.
good,"Company has good benefits, holiday pay with overtime, non union.  Multiply shifts, work area for production line can be pretty tough as you work in cold and hot climate, AC and Heater sometime not available during my time depending on the program being worked."
good,"I didn't like working on the flight line in the winter when it's cold, rainy and windy.  Working in the factory was ok, but it was usually too warm in the planes."
good,"Workman compensation rate in the upper level, in comparison with other companies in the aerospace industry. Nice working environment, most employees find enjoyment in working at Boeing."
good,"Boeing is definitely a large corporation. There are many opportunities, fairly good job security, and good benefits. If you love airplanes, there's a good chance you'll get to see, work with, and walk around on them on a regular basis (at least on tours). However, you can find yourself working through lots of bureaucratic paperwork and complications when you try to implement changes. I saw these as necessary for the company, but frustrating as an engineer."
good,"Pros: great benefits (health, continuing education, training seminars)"
good,"Because of its size, it's really easy to spend an entire career inside Boeing. I've had several jobs within the company and while there are similarities, no two are exactly alike in tasks."
good,so so company to work for. Style of operation is a bit antiquated. Boeing will need to make some adjustments to stay relevant in travel.
good,always new challenges to support the customer. Expect to adapt to ongoing changes and I have learned many things as I have worked in different positions in the company.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the pace of work.  This is the only company I have worked for that everything is done via email, even when you leave the company, everything is online."
good,Large corporation with opportunities in many different engineering areas available.  Compensation mediocre compared with the high tech industry.  Superior workforce planning and employee retention policies.
good,Very typical of a company culture; you advance by who you know; lots of stress recently due to workforce reductions and defense environment. Benefits are great and so is work life balance depending on your manager but overall company culture is changing
good,"Average Company - Most of the Boeing Managers are good Leaders.  I would work there again.  With all of my experiences, I wish their pay increase would have been better.  I worked really hard and felt that I did not get compensated fairly."
good,just not for everyone. I did not enjoy all the drama amongst coworkers and being stuck in a chair all day inside a clean room with out enough work to keep busy required 6 months to certify for fairly simple jobs with the instruction book right in front of you as you work.
good,They promote continued learning and provide tools for career growth within the company but it is up to you to make the change or career jump. Switching roles in the company is often the only way to be promoted to a higher level.
good,Favorite part of the job is solving complex problems quickly with talented teams working together.  Additionally the overall work/life balance is great!
good,"Fast paced and wonderful people. I enjoy the work and how respectful they are to family time.  Plenty of opportunities to grow and flourish, should you be ready to learn."
good,"The people I worked with were fantastic, but as I get exposed to the upper levels of management one become dishearten with the disconnect they have."
good,"I think uncertainty and a transitioning workforce will do Boeing good. The benefits are great but work life balance and job culture are at extremes (either too lazy, or workaholics)."
good,"Not a good place to work if you are looking for advancement in the space system sector because it is a sustaining contract. However, you do learn a lot on the job."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work if you would like to exercise your technical knowledge. The projects are interesting and challenging, and you will learn something new almost everyday. Boeing gives their employees plenty of opportunities to expand their technical knowledge. I was lucky enough to land a spot with a multi-disciplined team of electrical, mechanical, and software engineers. The team I work on is unique in the sense that it gets exposed to the entire life-cycle of new (and old) aircraft. My coworkers and other Boeing engineers are extremely intelligent and talented individuals. The problem I have with Boeing is that it is stuck in its old ways. Senior engineers are reluctant to try new technology/software/tools, and it feels like they have tunnel vision on solving problems. I also feel there is a disconnect between management and employees. Management sets up unrealistic expectations and then it looks bad on the engineers when the schedule slips. If you start out at the bottom it is also difficult to move up within the company, promotions are few and far between."
good,"As a new hire at Boeing, the excitement is palpable. But as you finish your training and sink in to your day to day work grind you find the difficulties in your job range for learning and applying new skills and training techniques, to the hardest part of all, to getting along with all of your coworkers. All the while doing your best to adhere to and maintain the strict rules and regulations set down by HR and upper management which all seems designed to make you fail and be terminated by the very company that just spent months training and educating you. Yet if you can navigate yourself thru the landmines of your new job and interaction with your fellow co-workers, you will find that your job is satisfying and fulfilling every time you watch a Boeing aircraft roll off the end of the runway and into the sky carrying folks off to their destinations. The best made aircraft in the world."
good,High paced production with good comradery. Fair management. The most difficult task in my job was tuning combline filters.
good,"New products, new business proposals, new work environments, diverse workforce, multi-site locations.  Always something new to learn; new regulations, new technology...  always something to network and leverage amongst teammates."
good,"Cons: Low Pay(outside of engineering) Everything is slow, lots of politics and bureaucracy. Alot of inefficiency throughout the organization (processes & people)."
good,Gained experience on the commercial side of Boeing after having worked at Cape Canaveral for the Defense side for almost a decade.
good,"The healthcare benefits are excellent. The company has a generous retirement-matching plan, also. "
good,"1.	Collecting all financial data of the contacts."
good,Boeing Satellites El Segundo currently going through a slow work load but traditionally very stable work and interesting.
good,"Worked in the Weight and Balance Manuals group with great people who trained and were available for help at all times. Challenging and productive work, receiving a positive feeling of accomplishment on a daily basis. Multi-tasking and organization a must in this position."
good,"While there is always a debate if Boeing is an engineering company or a manufacturing company, one thing is clear it is not a lazy company.  Most often you'll work a 8 plus hour day and that day could start as early as 7:00 a.m. It is a little difficult to wade through the political pond but there are many opportunities to grow and advance.  Having two major unions influence benefits and compensation is mostly a plus for the non-union employee. At the end of the day the airplanes are magnificent and the people are top notch!"
good,"Great benefit package including medical, dental, vacation."
good,The was great. Loved what I did. The Air Crew were great People. People i work with got the job done and did what was needed to accomplish goal. the Interaction with the Pilots was rewarding
good,"Great Benefits"
good,"Work day was very laid back"
good,A very nice company for job security and stable job position
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for, decent salary and a good balance of time off. Not much chance of advancement. Boeing doesn’t have a tendency to hire from within. The only method of advancing is to apply with your resume and get in line with all other applicants. From my point of view it is fair. But it doesn’t garner any sense of loyalty from the company. I guess this is the future of disposable employees. "
good,"This is a place that is hard due to the contracts.  The feds changed the contract requirements two to three times in a month and a half. "
good,"Function test and repair avionics systems in Final Assembly."
good,My work was repetitive.  I've learned to use blueprints and its computer system.  I recommended management staffs should get more educational training for their position.
good,There is a big disconnect between management and their respective staff.
good,"*This is a good place to work. A typical day at work is getting a job       research what the job is about and working working with QA to complete the job."
good,"Good wages and benefits but not loyal to its workforce."
good,Boeing is a good company to work for with different locations and room for advancement. 
good,"We have flexible 80 hour pay periods. Really good benefits, but they are taking many away over time. Really, if you want to work somewhere the rest of your career and retire here with little desire to advance and make a difference then this is the place for you. If you are ambitious and want to get noticed then don't bother."
good,You know what is expected of you and how you are to go about doing your job.
good,"A typical day cooking at Boeing starts with assessing who on your crew has shown up.If someone is missing, has management been informed, then discovering if that person will be replaced, and if so, for how long. You then will go through your supplies to find out if you have enough supplies to make it through your shift(if not, can it be delivered on an emergency run and hope that it makes it there on time to cook). The workers come through steadily throughout the day, with rushes at the dedicated meal times. Management is sparsely communicative and seldom helpful, but it's a large facility."
good,"A typical day at work consists of disassembling parts of a whole unit. Inspect, clean and test each component (critical to the process)."
good,"Each week was like groundhogs day, everything was very wash rinse repeat."
good,"See above comments, Was a great place to work when the satellite industry was booming."
good,"Good company- great benefits, hard to get off of second shift and you feel like you haven't a life. I couldn't really plan anything- because we had most of overtime that was manditory for all. So, hours 2:00pm to 10:30pm turns into noon to 10:30pm. If you do not have family or are single- this is the place to work."
good,I worked for Boeing Irvine division for 6 years as a mechanical engineer. Engineering managers at Boeing are not very educated and they are not very smart in engineering. But they intend to interact with engineering work. If the engineering managers were smarter in engineering Boeing would be an ideal inspiring place to work.
good,For engineers starting out it is a good company to get trained in an speciality.
good,"Boeing has changed dramatically since I hired in almost 9 years ago.  Most of the talent has left my work area, either retired or took on better opportunity.  Management used to care about the hourly employees, because they once were hourly employees, but now it's everyone for themselves and climbing the ladder is all that matters.  It's not what you know or can do that matters here; your seniority date is all that matters.  The benefits used to be world class, now there is no pension and medical insurance cost is at an all time high, plus procedures that used to be covered are no longer available."
good,The people are nice but you can't really progress or rise. The dress code is relaxed so long as you do your work. All the managers like to talk to everyone and get a feel for how their teams are.
good,"Worked there 35 years ago so I'm sure things have changed. There was a lot of sitting around and make work.  I felt like I was over qualified for the job they gave me.  I watched my job skills disappear from college because I was not using them. Some programs were well managed and professional with very sharp people, while the final group I worked in was poorly managed and we were behind schedule."
good,"They are making big strides to update their processes and work environment, but it's still a throwback to a more strict workplace.  For example, telecommuting is still frowned upon and often not allowed (even for jobs where it makes sense like software development).  "
good,"If you're part of the union, this job is amazing . It's pretty monotonous and you'll be doing the exact same thing all day every day but there's a pretty open amount of overtime so you can pretty much work as much as you want. There are a lot of people who will try to stab you in the back to make themselves look good though so be careful who you befriend."
good,"Don't expect to do any actual work for the first 2 weeks there. "
good,"I really enjoyed my job with Boeing. In 7 years, I worked in two locations- Everett and Portland. Everett was amazing. Lots of overtime, learning opportunities, a very good work-culture, opportunities for advancement, and great management. I was being shaped to enter into a leadership role in the near future when something happened with my family and I needed to move to the Portland area. QTTP told me it would be easier to quit and apply at Boeing Portland than to try to transfer. So, I did. lost all of my progression steps. But, I was hired and started off at my previous rate of pay. Things started off great in Portland- was getting recognized for quality work, was usually ahead or on-time with my work, and again, being talked to for leadership roles. I had cross trained in many sections in my area and was pretty efficient in running any work station I was trained in. Many times, to keep busy, I would work in other areas. I made a mistake and had a couple of drinks before work. I was recently separated and saw some friends for dinner before my graveyard shift. I felt fine so I went in to work. (I also was out of leave for the year and didnt want to be written up.) some swing coworkers were tying in with me to let me know what work needed to be done, smelled the IPA on my breath from almost an hour prior, and reported me. BA .07% I was sent home and suspended. I made a mistake, I was also young but not an alcoholic. I complied with all terms to return to work. I complied with all terms once I returned to work. After that incident, however, it didnt matter how great of an employee"
good,"Awesome culture and great benefits. "
good,"A good place to work if you're just looking for a 40-hour a week job to pay the bills. Great benefits, they really care about their employees. The company's size, scale, and age makes it very hard to initiate any change you might think would benefit the business."
good,"Overall good benefits in terms of time off, especially around the holidays. However if you are looking for a place that offers virtual work that business has a long ways to go in terms of support of that type of work schedule."
good,"challenging, making sure things get done right, fixing a problem no one else  could , competitive workplace. hardest part dealing with people who don't know how to work or who don't know there jobs."
good,"The downfall is there no room to advance in your career. Excellent 401k, health, vacation and school tuition. The company is driven on a production schedule and not being real on real time of producing good to meet the customer needs."
good,"Boeing can be a slow company due to the size and the ""old school"" culture. However, there are parts of the company that are fast-pace and very enjoyable; its just finding it. Take advantage of the learning programs as they are free and they all translate really well to other future jobs."
good,"Boeing is a typical large corporation, very well resourced, provides relatively consistent job security and a very decent benefits package. Also like most large companies, Boeing is slow to change and adapt to new processes and embrace new technology. Boeing is a risk adverse company. Great at identifying talent. A very good company for an engineer to begin their career."
good,Boeing is a great place to work if your single and love working overtime. Family/ work balance is not easy to manage and they hand out a lot of mandatory over time.
good,"CNC machine shop operator, run various CNC multi-axis machines cutting steel, aluminum, titanium, and heat treated metals. Good working environment, limited shift preferences."
good,"Boeing had a great environment to actually work and work with others. Job was satisfying and how much you wanted to work was on you."
good,"Company provides plenty of training, benefits are top notch and pay is very competitive for the area.  Management overall lacks direction and cohesion.  There are some in management positions that are very good at their jobs but the vast majority seem to have conflicting goals with company vision.  There are many quality experience mechanics, but unfortunately there just as many hacks."
good,"Its crazy boring unless you're an engineer. However, if you can keep from putting a pencil in your head doing nothing, you'll get paid, and well at that."
good,"I still really like the company but felt it was time to move on. I spent several years waiting for a promotion. Even after high reviews for 2+ years and receiving out of sequence raises, My manager was still not able to get me promoted. The company is great if you are looking for a stable, well paying job with good benefits but I found it difficult to move up or gain access to meaningful statement of work. In my opinion Boeing is highly focused on years of service as opposed to performance as a basis for promotion. "
good,"Great job, great benefits, great vacation plan, medial and dental is great. I work in flight test and would not want to work anywhere else. If I new I could stay where is am at my entire career--I would definitely stay."
good,"Thick, calloused skin as well as personality is part of the laborer's tool bag.  If a person can't handle the workload and timeline allotted for the job, they should be warned for failure."
good,Pay is great benefits are fantastic and for the most part everyone there was great to work with but you are just another number to the company and sometimes it seemed that the union would side with the company more than the workers
good,Stayed for 26 years.  Good company to work for. Boeing gives employee's opportunities to learn and advance their careers.  Only thing Boeing needs to do better is have more experienced HR personell.
good,Great benefits. Some organizations in the company are better to work for than others. Needs work on the corporate culture.
good,"Great place to start if you are not a software engineer. Programming is something in the back of the heads, mostly working with old technology."
good,A typical day at work involves solving problems and analyzing bond paths for lightning protection.  Worked hard by self and with teammates in a group.  Worked under different managers and had to adapt quickly to changes daily.
good,"Pros"
good,High pace job with product traceability. Ensuring engineers have what they need on the floors at all times. Satellite development and dealing with direct customers to assist when help is needed.
good,Performing all phases of software development while interacting with some of the most talented and dedicated engineers in the industry. Upper management tends to be disconnected from the realities of engineering and design. Some programs operates like a well-oiled machine while other seem always to be constantly in reactionary mode.
good,"Lots of amazing opportunities for advancement, but equally high amount of bureaucracy and silos. "
good,"Team building, WebEx, Telecons, Reports, Staff Meetings."
good,"I was provided great latitude to bring creative solutions to the work place. Boeing believes strongly in Program Management skills (i.e. Earned Value budgeting, scheduling, and executing programs as estimated). Locally the management team was very involved in day-to-day operations which was positive. Co-workers were skilled and worked well together. The most difficult part of the job was the constant second guessing and direction changing from the leadership outside of Wichita. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people we worked with."
good,"A typical day consisted of screening calls, making travel arrangements for staff engineers, securing credit cards for staff use while on travel; handling expense accounting when staff returned from travel; payroll and mail disbursements; handled online employment database for chief engineer and coordinated staff meetings and luncheons."
good,Boeing is less subject to defense spending changes. They offer not only defense work but general commercial work also.
good,I liked working a Boeing - but did not like Wichita KS. The company had great benefits. Work loads were good.
good,They are going through a digital transformation. So there is good and bad teams at various stages. Ask about how they manage their work to find out about the team's maturity.
good,This is my 2nd position at Boeing.  The employees and managers are very nice and will work with you if you need more work-life balance. Working remotely once a week or 9/80 work weeks are options depending upon your manager. The job is tedious and has to follow specific parameters set by Boeing's internal team. The best part of the job is the continuous learning and working with others outside your region.
good,"My rate is at 3 due to poor management of team I was working in. Other then that I have nothing bad to say but also nothing good, therefore I stay neutral about this job."
good,I loved it up to the point of when they sent me to Renton and I was putting about 5 to 8 hours of commuting a day. I love up by Bellingham and hated commuting plus I got hit by a drink driver on my way home from work. There's allot more reckless drivers down that way.
good,"The company is contracting to locations such as Montana and other areas to take advantage of the cheap labor. They didn’t want Machinists, instead they wanted operators to run machines on multi million dollars products and pay you minimal wages."
good,Challenging work and seems like a good company but automation is changing the world of finance.  Our arrangement never met its full potential bc the job I was hired for got the axe.  I cannot much comment further.
good,"great pay but to many layoffs, a lot of downtime. one job to do for the whole day that takes 20 mins to do. as a sheetmetal assem. the work was pretty much done for you."
good,"Personal experience is great place to work, good managers, busy but enjoyable workload.  However, no advancement for support staff based on experience."
good,"a good paying job, great benefits.I worked on b-52 projects, and that is all I can say about that. I liked to travel to dayton and work with the air force people. Management in my case was very good. I did spend some long nights working on contract negotiations."
good,i loved it there i loved the environment alot of the people  alot of the jobs are fun alot of activities and benefits for family and employees great experience
good,"In Boeing you will either be a hard worker who is stressed out all day, and underappreciated or you'll be a union milker who does nothing. "
good,"They provide employees with a good benefit including health insurance and vacation hours."
good,"I enjoyed working for Boeing in a lot of ways. There were a few trying times and issues, but I feel they are typical to a large scale production environment."
good,Boeing is an excellent place to work. Benefits and job security are beginning to fall. Great opportunity for adancement.
good,Room to grow and co-workers that will help you get where you want to go. Would like to be re-employeed by this company. Great family owned and run company.
good,Exellent benefits! If you have a passion for food service you will love this workplace! Kind customers to work around. Work days are very busy as you serve over 500 employees per day. Management is lazy and pretends to do work. Very polite co workers expect a few of the leads that let  $1.00 more go to their head.
good,"If you're OK with working for the defense industry, then Boeing in St. Louis is an OK place to work. Personally, I got very frustrated working in the clearance-required environment and with the petty office politics that seemed to prevent people from working together. Many days I could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Pay and benefits are good."
good,doing a good job and getting paid every week. how to follow a routine and getting it done right.good people to work with. and some things were hard to inventory outside but got it done.if you needed help you got it from someone on the team !
good,"productive workplace, customer oriented, individual freedom given my managers, looking for job more suited to my skills, good benefits, workplace culture"
good,I loved working for Boeing as a painter. Great breaks great management. Many benefits and opportunities to grow. The only downfall to me was the pay! They try to start you out at $12.00 an hrs.
good,Only a few managers who really care about the company and success of their employees. Still a lot of people who really don't add any value to the company and no one does anything to take care of that issue. A lot of bureaucracy. Takes forever to make a decision.
good,"Awesome place of employment and was a great learning experience for me. However, I felt as if the opportunity to advance was difficult. It was all based on a buddy system(who you know and not what you know). Ive been  there for 10 plus years and was stuck in one position. Applied for many positions,  had interviews and was told I had the job for a few but never got the positions. I got discouraged and felt like it was time for me to look for other opportunities elsewhere."
good,"When I started the Boeing Company, they cared for it's employee's but after the years Boeing bought & merged with several other companys."
good,"Boeing is an excellent place to work, especially right out of college. In the area in which I work, we move from project to project. For example, one day I may be building or testing a cable in the electrical shop, and the next day I could be working in the mechanical shop. This has allowed me to learn many different skills, in many different areas. Management on site is communicative and keeps us informed without micromanaging. On top of this, the people that I work beside are also very helpful when needed and confident in their job. The job can be challenging from time to time though. Working with such small tolerances and the critical space hardware, will always keep you on your toes."
good,"Pros: Lots of fun people to work with, cool projects to work on."
good,"Typically everyone hears the company name and decide its the best place to be. But its still what you make of it. Job Scope changes very consistently and it can be a confusing environment to assimilate into if you don't have the right team, mentorship or management supporting you. High turn over and last man in first man out environment. Work life balance, benefits and compensation are all very good. Many programs and opportunities to expand your professional network. You just have to land in the right space and on the right team."
good,"This position was great. Got to meet new people, setup meetings, new hire, etc. Down side to working with this company was catty coworkers who wanted to make your day there terrible."
good,Great company with good benefits but the OA pay is not all that great for some.
good,"Stay focus at work, learn all you can to excel, manage fairly, get all the facts, don't misjudge your people, respect, good attitude, be a good listener, avoid gossip, drama. work as a team with all your coworkers, hardest part of my job is running behind schedule but will do my best to finish. Most enjoyable part of the job is finishing an 8 hour day safely."
good,"very great to work as a team member building the best cargo plane in the world,,very pround of that!"
good,do NOT get sick or have ANY medical emergencies if you want to keep your job. They do not care about your medical issues or if you need to take personal days. You will get fired
good,Poor incumbent management place poor light on future culture for Boeing STL.  Need a revamp management direction to encourage members to invest in direction an outcomes of the business success.
good,behavior problems with some employees were covered up and when other employees end up dealing with them bad employees the good ones are 'let go' and the bad ones are kept.
good,Forgot about the people are the biggest asset. Without the people a  company won't succeed or growth without a lot of turn over. Out sourcing and bench marking isn't always the answer. The people made the company what it is today from its history.
good,Boeing is a great place to work. They are very safety oriented. Provide great benefits to there employees and provide adequate training to complete assigned tasks.
good,"The work was great and most of the team are awesome.How ever Boeing opened then plant in SC to get away from the union and to take advantage of the lower pay scale in the south east. With that said there are managers from other industries brought on board that really beat teams down for scheduling and bonuses which really caused a lot of issues. As a whole Boeing is wonderful,as far as the facility in SC we went through alot of vice presidents and managers while working the build packages and did the best we could with moral.The long hours and days was not an issue as the work and team mates were all great."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment and can be very stressful to meet daily and weekly production goals."
good,"As a contractor there are no benefits offered through the company as to be expected. However, Boeing Commercial offers a great benefits package for employees. Work/life balance is lacking overall. "
good,"Call center position - Assisted retired and current and contract Boeing employees with retirement, health, vacation, sick leave and payroll inquiries. Educated customers when looking for specific information on the Boeing website."
good,"Work day starts at 6:00AM, Review E-mails, Work schematics, Wiring Diagrams and Harness, or Specifications as required for assigned project. Answer questions for other engineers, assist shop personnel and give directions as necessary.  Since starting at Boeing I have learned to operate Visio for block diagrams and Mentor Graphics as the main drafting tool for wiring diagrams and system schematics. Co-workers are great, most are younger new engineers and are eager to learn new and old methods of researching needed data. Working with some of the upper management is very hard as they do cater to their favorites, ones that are in the click."
good,"The crews were great, management was pretty good overall. It was a great job for many years."
good,This was a temporary job for me through an agency. The equipment was very old and worn out making it hard to do the job.
good,"Three manager is 3 years, they did not support the cyber security requirements. The managers were scared to approach the customers for guidance for security short comings. They would rather try to negotiate away security than to meet it."
good,Its a good job but could be so much better. The people that make all the big decisions are so out of touch with whats really going on. No progress gets made.
good,Good place to work.  Deficiencies with management and work schedule coordination.  Flow of work was demanding at time but was manageable.  Training was readily available.
good,"Worked there 28 yrs and was laid off so they could boost their stock prices."
good,Directs are lazy and management is clueless. Contact life is wonderful due to laziness. Compensation is rather low but good money overall. Management doesn't care about individuals.
good,"People are knowledgable, fun to work with. Boeing will pay for your advanced degrees while you work there. Lots of opportunity to hone and advance your skills. But sooner or later the Volunteer Layoff Opportunity monster will crush your group, or the groups you enjoyed working with, and later the Involuntary Layoff Opportunity monster will wipe out anyone who was knowledgable (they specifically target level 4 engineers and higher, although they've made promotions hard for most and impossible for a good deal of groups in the past few years). Great place for a first job, but you WILL get axed if you stay, so I highly recommend getting out on your own terms."
good,The last four years of my father's Boeing employment were an effort to get him to retire early; until then he had good-excellent reviews. Same with me.
good,"Working at Boeing, I have had the privilege of working with some of the best and most professional technicians in the world. They are constantly striving to produce a high quality product."
good,A typical day at work would be make sure that engineers completed tasks that were assigned and to oversee all seats tech data for meetings.  What I learned about management is that management isn't as concerned about product delivery as should be.  There's lot of room for improvement.  The hardest part of the job was management support.
good,"As a contractor it isn't ideal to work for Boeing. However, as a direct it's a great place to work a lot of benefits and they do nice things for their employees."
good,"Typical day at Boeing, pulling reports, spreadsheets, meetings and making sure all paperwork is recorded and filed.  Checking in vendors for the products that came in.   Co-workers were not helpful always covering their own back.  The hardest part of the job was unloading 1000's pound creates.  I enjoyed the hours there at Boeing."
good,"A typical day at Boeing is more work than you can possibly complete in one day.  But it's always challenging and I'm always learning because the targets are always moving.  Lots of management and personnel changes on a monthly basis.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the policy changes that affect how you procure and document the purchase of product.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the sourcing of the parts themselves, learning about the manufacturing process, assisting suppliers on how to navigate business with Boeing and working with internal stakeholders.  Over all I enjoy working here because I'm never bored and in my lifetime I will never know all there is to know here so the job will never get old."
good,"Much work with many hours...overall enjoy my job for the time being, but this is not the place I plan to remain."
good,"See Pros and Cons"
good,"I had to work between 60-70 hour a week, in order to keep up with the business.  It was too much and I didn't have the support I needed.  "
good,"Fun place to work , just no room for advancement, or no benefits offered to employees who are contract"
good,Boeing was a great place to work with great people to work with. It was busy and challenging.
good,"Typically inept working environment"
good,"A fast paced environment, yet highly inefficient. It was not very often when I had a day where I was not sitting at my desk with nothing to do for an extended period of time."
good,Work at a place that makes a difference. It has interesting products that support the military and the culture is very proud of that. It can be high paced depending if you are on the production floor
good,"If you're willing to stick it out, don't get laid off it is a great career. It can have some long weeks and days of mandatory overtime, but the overtime rules are fair."
good,Boeing is a great place to gain skills. Although once you hit a certain level there seems to be a glass ceiling. Currently there seems to be a trend of hiring externally for upper position.
good,"it was fun to work in a team base environment ,work is easy but fast pace,lot of over time and it seems like its always mandatory ,in turn you do not have time for family or vacation also your always behind schedule . because of various incoming issues from down the line ."
good,A typical day at work very busy schedules for getting deadlines done which is workplace culture. Work life balance was not conducive for manufacturing.
good,Yhe job was great until I started having problems with my manager.  I loved the work and staying busy.  I enjoyed the challenge of the job and being busy.  I like being challenged
good,Overall a good company to work for.  Open and honest culture.  Fast paced environment with the need to handle multiple projects and meet deadlines. Opportunity for advancement increases with the ability to relocate.
good,I do enjoy working at Boeing but the Janitor pay maxes out at $20.27 and I have been maxed out for almost 3 years. I also drive over 3 hours a day and would like to have a shorter commute due to gas prices and lack of free time.
good,Boeing is not the same company it once was. My dad is a 30 year Boeing guy and has agreed that the company has faltered in the the way it treats its employees and runs them into the ground.
good,"Not much to say. It's been years since I have worked for this company, From what I can remember this place was decently run during the day but the stat tracking was poor and unrealistic."
good,Flight Safety Training Boeing International no longer exists. It was bought out by the Boeing Company and is now Boeing Flight Services. Job stability continues to plague the company.
good,I enjoy a good challenge and love the feeling of accomplishment at the end of my day. Boeing gave me a vast knowledge of airplanes and commputers and working a detailed work package and working with customers and managment to deliver the plane on time.
good,"It's a great place to work. I have nearly 19 years of experience and have been blessed with them.  However, I was targeted by an unethical manager and was not support by the zero-tolerance policies."
good,"Loved working with boeing, however myself and collegues got kicked to the curb because they could not get us more work. Management was questionable at best. If you were not one of the in people you didn't get very far. The reasons most of us stayed was because of all of us vets that made it great. The people doing the work daily made it fun but because the management dropped the ball and only cared for themselves the team we had got broken up and laid off."
good,I would highly recommend a job at Boeing if you can get one... They do take safety seriously and make quality products.   Just set your standards for leadership VERY low.  Managers are shuffled around in shops almost monthly and generally are there to use the shop for their own advancement opportunities.  They're there to make charts look good and impress their bosses... and that gets in the way of the actual job.
good,"the company is a medium size with 290 employees, divided as technicians, engineers, managers, and HR. the culture there is really good unless you start talking with one of the managers.."
good,"Overall Boeing is a good company to work for.  They have recently hired a lot of younger people and let the more experienced employees go.  "
good,"good clean atmosphere, majority of workers are intelligent and responsible individuals. Management confused between theory X/Y type system. Was and still is advancement determined on relationships not whether a person is qualified or not. The last few years, good people have left leaving the untrained to manage and/or run the company."
good,"If it weren't for cost-plus contracts, the space contractor part of the company would not exist."
good,"A typical day at work is checking emails, running a couple meetings, problem solving, looking for better more efficient ways to do your work and working on assignments."
good,"The employees are fun to work with, however the management does not support the worker.  You have to take your goals into your own hands as management is mostly very young and dont have the experience to be a managers."
good,"The typical day was nicely planned out. Kept me busy continuously. I enjoyed working there. I felt proud and felt I had some purpose, that what I was helping build, would be around still after 20-30 years."
good,"Electrical Engineer with combined 7+ years of experience in design, development, and maintenance of electrical components of aircraft. Able to handle multiple projects simultaneously with professionalism and accuracy and thrives in high pressure and challenging work environments. Adept at short-long-term electrical system troubleshooting"
good,"Boeing is a great company with opportunity for vertical or horizontal movement within the company. It is not for everyone. Boeing is a large company with many micro-company units. If you thrive on stress, Boeing is the place for you."
good,"Boeing isn't a bad company to work for.  But, sometimes they get their priorities mixed up.  Depending on the department, you will have all the overtime you can handle, or none at all."
good,"The Boeing Company is a fine place to work. You will find the pay and benefits to be beyond what most will offer for the workload (Amazon/Microsoft excluded). If you get an offer, take it."
good,"Tough place to work.  Numbers driven, performance based with little technical management. While there I learned a great deal about workplace politics, manipulating performance reviews and number crunching.  "
good,Overall this a good company. Benefits are great and discounts are plentiful. Little room for advancement in the Admin field. Pay is average but the benefits package compensates.
good,Rewarding work with the troops. Benefits are good depending what contract you're on. Management tends to ask/tells you where you are going and is an automatic resignation if you decline.
good,Looking for different opportunities. I came to SC with the intention of growing for me and my family. My family has struggled with the change and after some thought I need to consider the family over my growth.
good,"A very fast paced, stressful, environment. Deadlines are to be met, with no exceptions.Everything rolls downhill. Great benefits package, Fair wages. Management needs significant work."
good,"The company is very large and you have to find the right fit for you, which can take some time.  But once you have a place its enjoyable.  The hours are great because you get off so early."
good,"Great if you are in, ok if you are not. There are great opportunities for advancement if you are in with a manager. This is essential for you to advance."
good,"Friendly environment, and free meals. Pay is lower then what you would expect to get for a company of this magnitude. Working security time flies by because you are constantly moving."
good,works for the company not the person very cut throat has to follow company brass at all times. people are great living culture is great just company  culture is poor. hardest part of the job is making sure there is something to do that is current and not getting lost in backlog.
good,"Great educational opportunities offered by the company at the time, but no mechanism in place for taking the next step.  Great system of quality assurance for parts manufacturing."
good,Very nice place to at i like to work at i would like work back at boeingbecause it is nice place to work at would like go back work for them soon as they give me a call
good,"Boeing has potential, however is mismanaged for the most part and does not allow opportunities for talent to advance.  If you are good at your job they put a ceiling over top of you and trap you where you are most useful to them."
good,"Pro's Cool Products, Smart people, good benefits, "
good,I am not saying anything bad about Boeing they were and are a good company.  They have stock holders to report to.  So cut backs were a necessity once work had lagged.
good,"A typical work day is busy doing my trade. Management didn't have a clue as there were in charge of areas they didn't understand."
good,"Awkward positions and dirty hard work. Aircraft Heavy Structures is not for the faint. Long days that get longer when a manger says two little words, ""You're DESIGNATED.""  Because they're ""DOING"" their job."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy a lot of overtime and extra money."
good,"The job is what you put into it, and thats what you get out of it."
good,Managers do not provide opportunities for employees to grow with the company. I have requested several times to receive Six Sigma training. They would not provide me the opportunity.
good,"Great place to gain knowledge but advancement opportunities are slim.  If you don't mind working in a call center environment, this may be a great place.  The pay was decent and the staff is friendly, but the lack of advancement opportunities was discouraging."
good,"The company as a whole is great. You have pretty decent benefits and depending on how well the company did in the previous year a sizable bonus. The systems are a little outdated and there still seems to be that ""good ol boy"" mentality among upper management. No one seems to want to retire so you have employees that are hanging around well into their 80's which just mucks it up for the younger folks. There is an elitist mentality between programs with F15 folks refusing to acknowledge anyone outside their bubble is worth talking to. Which is humorous when you think about it because their work is shriveling up fast so they won't be the big dogs in town for much longer."
good,"it's ok job, but no job security what so ever, they will lay you off anytime. if you want to work here be ready to find another job. they are really good in layoff people"
good,"I did a lot of different jobs while employed there. I assembled many different components, assemblies, and aircraft for the company. Went on 3 different field trips to Seattle, WA. I worked a LOT of overtime!!!"
good,Much of my time is sitting around waiting for others to complete their tasks. The work is load mismanaged and unfulfilling. The hardest part of the job is the boredom and the lack of management who actually know how to manage people. There is no guidance for all the new hires and they are left to figure things out on their own with sketchy training. It's time to move on
good,"I've been working here almost 8 years, the benefits are amazing but what's not is salary and management. I have every certification under Boeing but if you put my experience next to another Assembler with less experience  you would see the same in our base salary. I've worked hard to get to where I'm at today in my life and this company has taught me a lot.  Im getting to the point where there's no enjoyment and it's now just a job."
good,"Multitasking, busy, interesting.   Sometimes challenging assignments"
good,"Sitts & Hill Made me believe if I did well I may  have a future there."
good,My typical day at work involves answering about 100 emails and scheduling all the audio/visual/photography and webcast. My job is very busy and is detailed orientated because of all the schedules that I am working with. I work with all departments and managers to make sure that all scheduled events  run smoothly and with in budget. I enjoy dealing with all the people and vendors to get the jobs done right.
good,"the best job I ever had with aircraft"
good,A typical day at Boeing over all was great. Knowing the type of people that you were going to work with everyday and knowing that we all worked well together was a plus....
good,"Boeing is a world wide company, who's values of the individual were sometimes overlooked."
good,The management is very screwed up there they let the position go to there heads and have no type of respect for the employees.
good,Boeing is the Aerospace leader. Boeing promotes and utilizes leading edge technology that the competition is unable to produce.
good,"I would work 7 - 4 p.m. 1 hour for lunch."
good,"I've had a number of jobs at Boeing flight test.  They were all challenging, interesting, and exciting.  Flight test is unique in a way that with every new program you work with all different people and may actually do a different type of work.  It takes lots of effort and dedication, including shift work and weekends to accomplish certification of a new type of airplane."
good,I was a contractor compensantion/benefits where not offered
good,"Complexity, fast paced, cross functional, integration with many other work groups and or functions, labor relations, etc."
good,"as a test engineer, one would go and ensure good quality testing was performed by following written instructions. When failure occured, one would troubleshoot test equipent, PCB's, etc.."
good,The work was enjoyable. For the most part I looked forward to going to work every day. The 1st line managers always made time to listen to the employees. My co-workers were fun to be around and always willing to help.
good,The Boeing Company produces awesome products.  To do this it requires a major life commitment.  Often you must get up early (4AM) and work 12 hour days and weekends.  This makes it a hard place to have a family.  The people are great and love the product.  Quality is very important and the company has a great product safety record.  The management is very short sided and more interested in bean counting than personal development.  Processes are very tedious and bureaucratic.  Making a difference is very hard but very rewarding when you do.  Change is like an act of Congress.  The company does support continuous education and will pay 100%.  The benefits are very attractive in todays business environment.
good,"Responsible for maintaining overall schedule and budget "
good,"Get assigned a job daily with a tight timeline"
good,"although working for Boeing was very mechanically educational, you were never sure what or where you were going to be the next day. there never seamed to be any structure on how you work your jobs just whatever seamed to be available with most of the time you would research and still come to a dead end and not able to preform my work. when i actually did get to work the technical complexity of the work was fascinating. I loved building, assembling, and working with my hands and brain at the same time. i did not enjoy being part of the union either, they took almost 150$ a/mo and when it came down to actually needing their assistance the stewards were less then educated about their position and not any help."
good,"Many talented, intelligent people doing great work. The company offers great benefits. There are many processes and procedures in place which at times results in shirking by employees hiding behind processes rather than getting work done. Things also take a bit more time than in a smaller or mid sized company. IT is a cost center and treated as such. Career growth outside of IT management or technical fellowship is limited; very few chances if any to transfer over to a business, revenue generating role."
good,My position was processing employees who had their service career discontinued.
good,The work environment was personal and serious. The people were proad to build the aircraft that protects our country.
good,Great company to work for benefits products and culture.   Advance opportunity to further education.   Holiday work schedule off last week of year  good bonus
good,The field operations branch seems to be and exhausting place to work if your not a technician working on aircraft. Upper management is in such disarray that everyone trying to support the technicians is constantly going around in circles to provide adequate support.
good,A very interesting and fun place to work and advance if you have the drive to be willing to learn and work along side others and contribute to problem solving issues.
good,"Overall great place to work, however you must be willing to work any shift until you gain enough seniority to choose, as it's union. Uneven work loads, and layoffs contingent upon major contracts."
good,"Some people are okay to work with. Management is non-existent. I learned to utilize a lot of engineer tools to aid in my problem solving. Workplace culture was overall a pleasure to work with, except for a few individuals, which is to be expected in any workplace."
good,This company provides the opportunity for employees to work towards becoming more qualified in their respective occupations. I have spent the majority of my time their training and learning about more other aspects of my occupation than any other company.
good,"A nice place to work for someone just starting out. "
good,The importance of customer focus and concerns.  To know that there is always someone their to pull knowledge from. Keeping everyone’s focus the importance of following details that are a direct impact to safety
good,"i am not challenged and not doing what i love (Painting) i am not happy do to the fact i am just a number and they talk safety but dont fallow threw, i also dont like the fact that it is all about numbers we have to work overtime even if there isnt any work. that makes for a long boreing day"
good,"Great company, just wish the wages were better. The coworkers are great and are willing to help with task. The benefits are decent. The opportunity for advancement I think could be better."
good,Boeing was a great place to work when I first started in 1981 and there was a sense of family between management and workers.  That culture changed when the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas happened.  Our jobs were being outsourced to contract companies and we had to train the people who would take our jobs.
good,"My experience with Boeing over the last 10 years has been positive. I was able to start consulting as a Solution Architect then later was promoted to Enterprise Architect, all while under remote contract :)."
good,Boeing from the company perspective definitely good. But few leaders need to be changed for sure. good work life balance and all well with One boeing philosophy
good,"25 years with company.  Really enjoyed the work and people until new leadership came into my organization and disrespected/devalued long-standing contributors.  Lots of good organizations left in the Company, so would recommend overall.  Competitive benefits, challenging and important work.  Generally good people, though some leaders are idiots."
good,You have to be sharp and great at being on a team. There are many opportunities if you apply yourself. Top notch company to work for. Great work hours.
good,Lots of intelligent individuals and challenging obstacles to confront. It's a great company that is fueled by passionate individuals who love what they do.
good,"Culture and environment was very relaxed.  Enjoyed going in to work.  Employees', peers, and management were all very easy to get along with.  Being a contractor, was still able to join in meetings as to learn more about the department and company."
good,"Cut throat company; profits are all that matter to Boeing since they have to report to stakeholders/shareholders. Its a business, nothing personal. Massive layoffs are just part of Boeing's strategy to be competitive."
good,"Loved my HR peers, but there were some HR leaders that were questionable in their integrity and ethics.  A lot of nepotism and cronyism at work.  Still loved the company and think highly on my time there."
good,"I enjoyed working for Boeing.  Most of all, my co-workers I worked with.  We all had great working relationships with each other.  We supported each other when problems arose."
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job was to integrate with other organizations and work in a common cause and direction.   I liked the ability to be creative and be encouraging others to think outside the box with new ideas.   I believe its our mission as leaders of our respective industries to design and innovate new ideas to advance our people to a more productive and progressive existence.  "
good,Not only me but others spent 6-7 days per week at work. Hours averaged 12-14 hours per day.  No home life and was required to work weekends and if you did not you would be reprimanded by management.  Employee Involvement meetings meant nothing to Building 20 Cell 40-50.  Management was rouge to a point and felt it necessary to choose there favorites and give them the easy work and the actual workers busted there butt and got Zero relief.  I understand now that there has been a flush of old management things have gotten better.  If I had the opportunity I would return and continue with a great company.  I did not quit Boeing I left the management.
good,Great place to  begin career and get your experience. Plenty of training and learning opportunities. Difficult to advance after a long period of time.
good,It is a good place to work. most of the team worked from home and they we all over the United States. We often worked evenings and week ends. The work was challenging.
good,Frontline management was not very skilled at their job. Corporate came in and cleaned house helping the situation through interviewing employees the work necessitated overtime to complete projects but was denied through management for reasons unknown causing significant delays and dissatisfied workers and customers
good,"It could be very repetitive but if you stick with it you can go a long way. There can be a lot to gain by showing initiative, a little hard work and some patience"
good,"Boeing was an exceptional company to work for during my time for these reasons:"
good,Been with Boeing for a few years but where the company lacks it makes up in generous pay. Theirs some disadvantages but mostly pluses. The things that make the company difficult is how they hold people accountable and then business decisions that effect your schedule.
good,"My managers who used to be Shift Workers were out of touch and has become yes persons. The hours were long and tedious. "
good,"It's a high paced and numbers driven place to work. It has good benefits and fairly decent wages for the area. Just like anywhere else, things could be better on the upper level management side."
good,"Boeing as a company is a great place to work at. Boeing San Antonio is a totally different case. With poor management, bad decisions, and unwilling to listen to its employees for real improvements, the work environment becomes one of very low morale, stressful work, and unappreciated employees. The on good thing is the on site cafeteria, and that gets old real quick."
good,I learned how to manage test equipment for the 787/747 commercial planes.  It was a good work enviorment but they were quick to fire you.  At one point they let go of 300 people at once but my overall experience was exceptional.
good,Excellent co-workers; direct manager was excellent but upper management within and outside of the department did not understand the manufacturing processes.
good,"Good company to work for with many careers opportunities. Analysts have the opportunity to sit in the same meetings with VP, Directors, and other Senior Managers. This helps be part of the discussions with clear guidance on strategic planning."
good,"Great benefits, except for the pay. you will find out soon that even though they claim they pay more than similar jobs, that is not true. There is also a huge difference in pay between working in Commercial Airplanes ( seattle, WA and therefore Union ) than there is in Military Aircraft (st louis, Philly, Alabama...all the ones that dont have union representation ) the difference is about 10K more between engineers. You could be a level 3 engineer in seattle (Commercial and in union) making 10K more than an engineer level 3 in any other state working in the military products. I am not a big fan of unions, however, the pay is a huge difference. It is very easy and relaxed to work at Boeing, amazing products and projects ( you wont be bored ). But be very careful, because as i mentioned above, there is a huge difference between working In BCA and in BDS. Althouhg, both are boeing the projects and work circunstances are very different. the expectation are also very different. Advancement in BCA is quick, and well compensated. Your raise on average  wil be about 5%. In BDS advacement is none to zero, you could be a level 1 engineer for 5 years, whereas in BCA you will get promoted after your 2nd year. In BDS the raises are 2%. Here is the interesting part, BDS has the coolest projects! you will be working on many different projects and jobs as an engineer (because they are non union). the benefits are great ( no other place offers what Boeing offers ). I believe most of their management are good ( a few here and there are bad ) but overall the majority are well picked and trained."
good,The loyalty is no longer there. Need to offer more stability especially to senior roles. A person strives to increase their levels only to force themselves to the chopping block.
good,I have no comment to make. This is not applicable and can not be skip or opt out so you have to put something ind here even it is just junk to fill th required spaces.
good,"you definitely get to change positions a lot and learn a ton of new things all the time. Depending on the position, it is fast pace and educational. The buildings are enormous and almost a city within a city."
good,"This company is very large and has lots of opportunity based on jobs that are available since they may have different types of contracts that are private or US Government funded. However, some of the management is either really good and experienced that helps employees or the complete opposite just horrible and does not care about employees."
good,Good if you're competitive. Many managers have no clue how to lead. If you're competitive and willing to work your way up you might make it where you want to go.
good,"great benefits, however management tends to micro manage and doesn't reward for work well done.  older employees are not valued for their knowledge and skill.  layoffs are looming."
good,"Moving work statement out of the Puget Sound."
good,Not a bad company to work for. I believe they could do a better job of hiring individuals based on their experience and not by how much they interact with higher level management and likeability.
good,"Salaried employees work long hours. A lot of lazy people that managers overlook which puts stress and pressure on those that are hard workers. Hard dealing with union represented employees. Have to be careful. All and all, I enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"This is a good company to work for. The only issue I have with it is it depends greatly on the company group, project and manager. A change from one area to another can greatly change your view of the company."
good,"Good place for design engineers. A lot depends on the program and location. Good benefits, and great people to work with. BDS has better management than BCA."
good,"Good job that  has both defense and commercial aerospace projects to work on. The benefits and pay are decent, but the company has become very lean and there isn't enough work/life balance. Management is not properly trained for their positions."
good,Boeing Company is a good company. Management is good. Work place culture is great. The hardest part of the job is to work long hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see success in building the final product.
good,Lower level management much better than upper level management. People I worked with were some great people. Hard to be appreciated at management level.
good,"The Boeing Co is a great company for young persons to work with. It has a good pay and excellent health insurance. "
good,"Enjoyed my time at Boeing.  The people are incredible, the benefits are good and you can learn a lot.  You must take the initiative to get involved and network."
good,"Appearances can be deceiving. Walking in to the office for the first time, you will see a very normal cubiclescape, like any other tacky Bauhaus office building anywhere in the world, but underneath the harsh 1970 flourescent lightbulbs, uncomfortable cold desks and bleak sea of gray walls, lurks a wild frontier of outlaws, bandits, factions, wild gangs and frontiers of science and technology! Everyones hustling and lying and cutting throats, while new lands are being discovered out over yonder hills filled with knowledge and all kinds of technological wonders I'm not allowed to tell you about. You will learn a lot, and if your boss likes you and you make some good alliances with the winning side you can go far, but beware, these people have no shame! Also, the pay is actually not that great these days, even though I know they used to pay really well in the past."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work. However, the managements are something you have to be aware of. There is no such thing called ""Job Security"" at Boeing."
good,"Boeing has been a good company for the years I have been there but the environment has changed so much, everything is schedule driven, the threat of layoffs is ever lurking, they are hiring outside people who don't understand Boeing policy and process and are truly unqualified to manage.  Its hard to watch morale right now knowing layoffs are eminent, Boeing has always been the gem of aerospace  and I would like to see it rise to that again and become the family environment it once was and for employees to love what they do and want to be there to make the difference they know they can make."
good,we have start up meetings and then we get where we will be working and then get our work assignments and we work through online work instructions  I think it is a good company to work for but the pay could be better and everything should not be at the managers discretion
good,Great company to work for.  I developed a good tool set while working there for 25 years.  Met a lot of great people and learned a lot about production and technology.
good,Started my engineering career out at McDonnell Douglas and it was a great choice.   I learned so much while working there.  I experienced the transition from McDonnell to Boeing.
good,Initially Boeing was a great place to work for. Management valued suggestions for improvement and employees too. Over the years the company became more about the bottom line dollar and layoffs were frequent. Work life balance was totally out of wack. My position (no offer to move) as well as a lot of other positions were moved to St. Louis. Not a place that you want to think about longevity.
good,"Great Benefits - pay, 401K, and insurance. "
good,"I worked at Boeing in Annapolis Junction for 9 years. I worked on labor type subcontracts in support of NSA prime contracts. The typical day was repetitive and stressful. It was a business that was not Boeing's core competency, which is of course building airplanes. We used policies and procedures designed for the commercial airline part of the business which was very frustrating. The company would not spend the resources to create business specific policies and systems for a business that didn't produce a product but rather provided a service. I did learn about how to be flexible and work independently. Management changed often. Low moral among work force.  High turnover. Made a few good friends that I continue to correspond with."
good,"Boeing has been a very good company to work for.  they have great benefits including an awesome 401K and health benefits and educational benefits."
good,"Great working conditions, room for advancement, but low wages. They moved to Charleston for cheap labor, and they're getting it.New program with lots of growing pains. Building an awesome airliner !!"
good,"Boeing is a great place to work. But if you expect to spend time with family, you will find it is hard to do. You get sucked into the overtime mindset. If you're not required to work overtime, you'll be tempted to for the money and vacation. But many people die from cancers related to the chemicals and dusts in the air and work place."
good,"This could be a great company, but management is poor.  Lower level management pretty ineffective.  Middle management hides from decisions.  Upper management insulated from reality.  Most decisions made based on HIPPO rules (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) regardless.  Despite all the lip service about honesty and speaking up if you see something wrong, being honest is career suicide (usually).  For IT, there are no promotions or advancement unless you happen to find another job at a pay scale above yours.  If you are West Coast, forget about that as the company is serious about killing IT jobs out west... but that will likely change in the near future as Boeing constantly circles back to rediscover ""the better way to do things"".... at least until they try the next ""better way"" they already tried and abandoned before."
good,"Nothing better then contributing to the highest standard airplane in the world.  Boeing is going through cultural changes that will take time.  For an HR professional, culture utilizes as admin support - would not recommend.  This will change - but again, will take time."
good,"Play by the rules and stay ou of trouble and you'll be fine.  They have there issues like most large companies but not a bad place to work.  And of course, it will depend if you have a good manager or bad.  Managers ruin companies."
good,"I was with the Boeing company for over 10 years.  It is a great place to work and grow, but it is hard to advance in certain areas or to even get employed with the company.  "
good,"The summary says it all and is even written on some of their high level executive stationary."
good,"Great Place to work, if you can get past the good ol'boy gang. Most of the supervisors have their stuff together."
good,"Once you're in, it's a great place to work.  I would be cautious about getting on a product that is on the decline because chances are you are going to be laid off. "
good,Good Company to work for. The most enjoyable part is the people I worked with. Management was great and so were the benefits.
good,Company going down hill as for how things are run now compared to 2008 when I was hired. They are NOT a EEOC company and will retaliate against any employee who stands up for themselves.
good,"I enjoyed and learned a lot as a Quality Engineer/Quality Assurance Rep.  This was my first civilian job after retiring out of the Marines.  It was a big adjustment but, I felt that I was made to slow down to meet the pace at the company."
good,"Over-all, a good pace to work with lots of opportunity for advancement and education.  Benefits are excellent, and the folks in the trenches are very dedicated to their craft."
good,culture is different from other aviation employers....takes quite a bit to get used to....but pay is nice...management is mostly clueless..spend all their time in meetings
good,Great place to work for the money and benefits. People there are best to steer away from and politics are very heavily known in the area.
good,"The one constant about Boeing is change.  Never get too comfortable with your current work packages."
good,It is a great working experience as you get to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and cultures. also the work exposure is huge as you learn something new everyday.
good,"Sales, merchandise, cleanliness, customer service."
good,"I've worked all over the company for 25 years in various locations and on a variety of programs.  I've enjoyed working in the space industry, military airplanes, missile defense throughout my career."
good,"For the first year Boeing showed great promise in my search for family stability.  As I furthured my way through the Boeing system, I lost a personal relationship with family due to an ever changing schedule and 15 plus hour workdays.  They have many different programs to aid in employee family relations but when you actually try to take advantage of those opportunities they where never able to be obtained or used as they where advertised."
good,If you are a full time employee the pay is low but your future is bright. Contractors are not highly thought of and are not treated well. The full time Boeing employees have great benifits though and it's worth sticking it our for a full time offer if one comes along.
good,I only worked here during summers. My experience was limited. Any comments I make about working at Boeing probably aren't conclusive.
good,"Management can sometimes be... disconnected from the people who roll up to them.  This is especially true when you get above your skip level manager.  But the company is, overall, a solid one to work for.  The only major downside is a lot of older management doesn't seem to be interested in moving on which hampers career development in the middle ranks."
good,"I would start work at 10am and go where ever i was needed. i worked the deli, grill, entrée or register. i would stock, clean, and do prep during our down times. my coworkers would leave at one oclock pm . my coworker and i carried out the duties til lunch and set up for the mechanics breaks. than break down and clean everything at 7. customers were my friends i have known for years."
good,"Outside of the new management, this is a great place to work. Upper management is a terrible group to work for, and very untrustworthy."
good,A good place to work but it really needs to get consistent. The product being so far behind does not help anyone.
good,Tour is a staged presentation that you have to make as your own to keep the tourist interested
good,Depends on the job (and boss) that get.  Some jobs have been great but others have been like working in sweat shop.
good,"Long, lots of OT. Hardest part was management. Always something interesting happening."
good,Do whatever it takes to Safely build the Aerospace Company of the future.
good,"fun workplace and productive,overtime , weekendsoff, safety focal, acting lead.tool focal, safe walkaround."
good,"I had to build airplanes per blueprint. I also had to become certified in crane, torque, sealant and more."
good,"work thru a agency called volt and while they were very professional, my encounters with the boeing management team was at best lacking.Not all managers seem to be team players. There was a lot of threat managing to point of threat to loose your job and some did.This made it a very hostile environment to work in.I would like to think that this is isolated to the san antonio site. This lack of leader ship has tranlated to quality issue and also slow dilevr dates.In concluson i think more training in middle management and also lead training ."
good,Given very little instruction but had ability to learn as we went
good,"The hardest part is that after working for a big company, itis very hard find to job in samall and mid size company."
good,"If you can get hired by Boeing, stay there at least until you get layed off."
good,"A curious mix. Very cutting edge technology, but a lot of old school thinking and corporate politics. Things usually move at a glacial pce, but they can also move vcery quickly. Pretty good benefits mixed with terrible job security."
good,The projects and teams are amazing. Management doesn't really care a lot about you and can potentially have no idea what you're working on. Promotions are pretty difficult to get.
good,A typical job. Do what you're told and follow and adhere to policies. Boundless opportunities. It's a great place to learn and grow. You can really find meaningful duties and responsibilities.
good,"this is to take up the minimum amount of characters, my experience is not really relevant to this review. One final sentence for good measure.  adjective."
good,"Decent place to work. great people, nice location, decent work/life, leadership is decent, but there are several people that deserve to be leading. It's all about who you know."
good,Boeing has been a great place to work. They train you on pretty much anything you need for your job. The management so far has been helpful and attentive.
good,"work with people all over the world and work with people at office who are knowledgeable and extremely helpful, and the offices are extremely well furnished"
good,Friendly /caring staff .wonderful place to work !the job was very easy the manager at the time was very helpful and always was there to help if needed
good,A decent company it has issues understanding person Complications and HR system is  flawed but pay is fair the work is consistent and easy to complete and understand
good,"The Internship Program was very informative and collaborative. It was insightful to experience working in a corporate environment and manage a team of other interns, as well as develop skills with databases and computers."
good,there were days that it was stressful but overall in propulsion it was enjoyable to work there.  Management was easy to work with.  The culture was very enjoyable.
good,"Great place for career advancement and training opportunities. Continuing educations are supported and encouraged, strong employee programs from medical to personal support are available for all."
good,"buena empresa para trabajar, es un buen lugar de trabajo"
good,"Team Builder, Trustworthy, Consistent and innovative."
good,My experience at Boeing was for the most part positive and rewarding. The education benefit was probably the single biggest benefit I took advantage of. The opportunity for advancement is limited unless you fall into a certain class.
good,"Great company. Makes great airplanes. Otherwise, sweeping administrative decisions are often made at too high of level. This creates obstacles that make things harder for people to do their job. That said, this company has been good to me."
good,"We had so much fun, played board games, ate gummy bears, ran in the halls with scissors.  I remember one time I brought my cat to work and he flew an airplane.  It was so much fun!"
good,"Enjoyed working with cross-functional team and Project team."
good,"Worked there for 5years as a direct employee, and almost 2years as a contractor.  Contractors are not treated fairly or with much respect.  They are paid almost twice as much as FTE employees, so the difference is almost felt in the meetings.  I really think Boeing should increase their FTE payrolls."
good,"I would like to have more money, better health care and a lot more opportunities throughout my career to better the company. Thank you for your time and help."
good,"Great place to work - Tapestry Solutions integrated into Boeing. Software development was a big push prior to hiring freeze within the organization, which became difficult."
good,"If you are desiring a place to go for great benefits and pay structure Boeing is it.  A huge company with multiple programs and environments to get settled into.  Management is not a good place to be or involved in as they are not treated well nor do they treat others well.  Management becomes self absorbed and reacts instead of being proactive.  You get lost in the ""bigness"" of Boeing and the culture needs a lot of work."
good,"Excellent place to work. I did not want to leave. I worked with some really good fellow employees. more like a family in S25..then Boeing space had this idea of ""cheaper"" labor as if the people there did not earn  their pay over years and experience. We were told basically in a nutshell we were too expensive. literally. also Boeing wanted out the  high wage earners.. so with that the buyouts and mass"" on purpose"" exodus began. literally telling engineers you make to much money. not assigning them any jobs I.E forcing them out of the company by default. Laid off all techs with massive experience, been out since the reduction in force since middle of 2016. the ones that are left employed are being moved all over the US to different sites. some stuck because all the years accumulated and close to collecting their retirement etc 50-54. So stuck. the managers and leads that are left are stuck. knowing that they need the talent in the future  that younger will not supply but yet being told just to cut. don't ask questions just cut them all. We will call them when we need them. the secret is Boeing el Segundo reputation is "" don't go there. everyone is expendable. and I mean EVERYONE"" super sad because we really did some amazing things and the friends that have all scattered and said they are never going back... mind boggling. I  am talking amazing technicians, engineers,mangers.. gone.  so they want to go young. good luck. there are things /knowledge- that books/slides/presentations cannot teach. experience does only.  I miss it but its never going to be any resemblance of what it"
good,"We see the best engineer in the world, the biggest workshop, and huge aircraft, our proud of product at Boeing here. definitely only here, even in Europe,AirBus company."
good,Hard to beat the stuff we get to work on! Bureaucracy and politics can get in the way. Amazing benefits and great opportunities for continuous learning
good,"My daily routine mostly involved emails setting up times to meet group to look at their devices then having to reschedule several times before anything got done."
good,Boeing is a good company to work for because there are many areas in which you can work  - Has great benefits.   There are times when things are not equal or fair.  Favoritism sets in.
good,"As a whole, Boeing treated all interns relatively well as it is one of the top rated internships in the country.  All team members were great and management stood behind me."
good,Boeing is a great aerospace company that has so many engineers and talented machinists to make these amazing planes. I was very glad I got to work on the factory floor to experience these planes.
good,All of the benefits are in line with current aerospace industry. The work experience is dependent on the group and management. This seems to be either excellent of very poor.
good,Boeing in general is a great company with a lot of cool projects. It depends the group that you become a part of. the people make all the difference. they either support you or throw you under the bus...
good,"Boeing is a great name brand company that has had a historic impact on the history of mankind. Though bureaucratic, it is staffed by well intentioned and intelligent individuals."
good,"Boeing is having to hire many managers to replenish their workforce and are doing so with untried college graduates who don't know their jobs or the business. As a result, they cannot and will not make decisions."
good,Recently Boeing has been going through a deal where they are dumping anyone with seniority and keeping the young folks.  The last ten years or so there I felt like I was just a cog in the wheel.  A faceless employee.  I used to love working there.
good,I've learned a great deal about management in the civilian world through Boeing.  I been a part of many very interesting programs and have met some really great people along the way.
good,Productive and highly competitive work environment.  Pricing airplane parts for many of the biggest Airlines in the world.  Highly stressful at times.
good,"I was very young when I worked for Boeing as an intern, therefore my responsibilities were very limited. However, it was my first full time working experience and gave me the opportunity to work in an environment with professionals who guided me and were very supportive."
good,"Not a fan of the hierarchy system. I would like to see a culture change. Especially in regards to tension between different shifts and management. I would still take my job back, under circumstances if it were ever offered."
good,"I had an annual contract as a 'supplier' of Engineering and Technical Training support 'on-demand plus scheduled re-training'."
good,I got to manage the satellites through the assembly stages. I worked with a diverse group of people and had to keep with constant communication through out all 3 shifts.
good,"fine place to work I work in the production end of things, I Have learned aa lot from the company and the pre-employment  class of 400 hours I was required to take"
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Being a part of something as large and important as the F-15 program is invigorating.  Not many jobs have that level of ""cool"" factor."
good,"Boeing is a high-paced technology company.  I wish they could provide adequate support to the engineers to get their work done, but there is still an overriding system of managers and more managers.  They seem confused when large numbers of younger engineers leave for better positions, but despite exit interviews that tell them what the issues are, nothing changes."
good,"Pays well and people are pretty nice, but I will tell you that the hiring process is long and detailed.  No matter what position you're applying for,  make sure your credit report is up to par, otherwise,  you will not be considered. The background check is extremely in depth. I had no problems,  but I know that some may run into some issues and I would advise not getting your hopes up and apply elsewhere, because there is no leniency."
good,"Hectic, challenging, rewarding I choose not to provide any additional information. I need to fill in more spaces in order to complete this process. Here we go."
good,"Excellent Benefits."
good,"Contract work for Dell Computer Services at Boeing. This does not reflect as Boeing directly.  I was one of two Technicians that supported the 777 Line Move Process at the Boeing Factory. I worked with no supervision, and maintained the networks and computing devices during 777 Production Line Moves. I was also responsible for maintaining a healthy service relationship with Boeing management and work-crews on site. During my two years working on this contract I repaired damaged systems, replaced broken equipment, maintained network connectivity, and monitored / verified the production areas Dell computer hardware and software functional reliability. My shifts started at 10 pm and ended at 9 am, and I was wholly responsible for the veracity of my reports to Dell management."
good,"If you're looking for good pay and security, Boeing is great. If you're looking for advancement/ acknowledgement, look elsewhere. They have a lot of money and not enough sense."
good,"Clean and safe work areas, dealing with engineers looking for parts is sometime stressful onsite fitness center is helpful, other employees are usually pleasant to work with"
good,Great flexibility regarding work schedules. The benefits are solid. The airplane industry is interesting and Boeing is the most profitable aerospace company in the world.
good,"Boeing is a big place, so you'll get a different experience based on where you land. In my particular role, there was not a lot of engagement with employees. My role was to develop engagement opportunities for other employees and counsel executives on this matter. However, no one is ever watching out for us."
good,Boeing was a great place to work providing much flexibility for working. Lot's of interesting and developmental work opportunities. Very friendly workplace for people with families. Not a good place for in-line advancement. It is challenging to be promoted without applying and interviewing for a new job internally.
good,Spent most of my time on design and analysis which was good for me. Saw too many good people laid off after being moved across the country. Lots of work to be done but ended up doing a lot of re-organizing and moving people among different buildings.
good,Stable company to work for. Can be fast paced and overwhelming during busy periods. Many opportunities to learn. Not much opportunity for growth outside of procurement for procurement agents. Growth and development needs some work.
good,La empresa se enfrenta a grandes retos ya que cada proyecto puede diferir bastante uno de el otro siendo asi que sus trabajadores están acostumbrados a los retos y comprometidos con el aprendizaje constante.
good,"This is a really stupid thing for Indeed to do in that small companies will instantly target who posted the review."
good,I enjoy working for this company. It has offered me many opportunities to grow and succeed. I enjoy  working on the latest technology and being an industry leader.
good,being big often means being slow.  For a lot of people that is fine but when I ran out of hard things to do at Boeing it was time for me to leave.  Great people who love their jobs even when they don't get all they need.  I wish there was a stronger focus on the research and development areas at Boeing but as outsider I no longer know what their investments are or if they are or are not adequate currently.  They were not in my humble opinion when I left the company n 2014.
good,good job til pension was lost by 51% majority vote. Working either swing shift or the early morning shift can bekind of tough and requires some getting used to. otherwise its a great career
good,"I worked with a lot of contract workers. People were on edge about being let go a lot. We worked in the defense segment, so everything was pending on huge contracts with other countries. Things could change quickly because of politics."
good,很人性化的500强，但是升职机会很渺茫。工作环境极舒适，如果是混退休的话很OK，但是作为有抱负的年轻人，很定希望得到更多锻炼的机会，抱歉这里没有看到希望
good,Great position on your resume and a good place to work.  You are expected to be the subject matter expert on your project.  You will be left to perform or fail with little to no help.  What you say you can do management will expect you to do.  Deliver on time daily is important.
good,I worked for Boeing/Hughes for 22 years. Boeing pays for their employees to go back to school to enhance their personal knowledge and improve career possibilities. I worked on space programs and others interesting projects.
good,"Boeing provides what ever we need to do our job right and on time."
good,"I worked on 2 major rotor-craft trainer design efforts."
good,"Good work, good people.  Exec leadership misses it sometimes.  they are so focused on cost, they forget there are people down there getting them their IC bonuses."
good,The rate was very good for the cost of living in that area. The overtime was ample and they were willing to let me work all the overtime i wanted for the full six months.
good,"Learned a lot at the beginning since the work is interesting, but as you doing the same repetitive design, it is getting to become unproductive if you want to advance yourself."
good,"It depends where you are in your career and what you do. Boeing is a very large multidisciplinary, multi-market, international technology company that is constantly reinventing and resizing itself in a complex, changing world. My experience in helicopter production engineering support exposed me to one tiny facet of the company.  This involved hands on experience with  the people and processes required to produce military helicopters."
good,I don't have anything to say. If you have a specific skill you will do great. If you have consistently moved up by On the job training its kind of hard advance into specific jobs
good,Too much government cuts caused our division to be cut and thus I had no more work for the rest of my internship. This basically allowed me to explore everything else and see how boring the company truly is.
good,"Its one of the coolest companies to work for ."
good,"Typical large company I guess where one becomes a number, and too much time wasted in meetings."
good,"Go get it approach in all aspects of the business."
good,Great place to work  and provide for your family. Learned alot through them how big business is ran and how technical the work is for build aircraft. Great Place
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot from me peers. great manager-supportive. Typical day learning new stuff. most enjoyable part of the day, getting off work."
good,I enjoyed the work the people were a good team loved the area but some did not understand the work life balance need to be successful in aerospace and the respect needed for your work force'
good,Very structured and  process oriented environment. Hard to break into other areas for career advancement. Hierarchical and lots of approval levels for getting work done. Doesn't embrace risk and failure.
good,High  tech role. Learned a lot while I was there. Cutting edge technology. Wide range of machinery. Benefits were good and the pay was average for the area.
good,In my arena of work to much micro management. either let me do my job and leave me alone or do it yourself. I left due to much over the shoulder watching. UGH let me be to do my job or do it yourself...
good,"The Company is now working on relocating their employees to low cost centers to reduce payroll and eliminate highly skilled long term employees.  Challenging project management work, but geared towards more structured processes."
good,Enjoy on work electrical assembly on helicopters and good co workers work team and ...... amazing pay well. ....…!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..........
good,"Why is it neccesary to rate a company I currently work for and am planning on leaving."
good,"The site I was at was for repair and maintenance of navigation systems, which had been a military base, Boeing won the contract when privatized. A majority of the employees had been government employees prior to privatization. The culture was a mix of expectations from government employees and Boeing management. I received additional training on government contracting and FAR regulations. I changed roles a few times, giving me new experiences. Their benefit and compensation packages exceeded other companies in this region.  If they weren't forced to downsize I'd still be working there."
good,"Very much a team related special project.  We  all worked together with the goal to finish our part in the special project assigned to us. We succeeded with flying colors before our dead line. All of were celebrated every Friday with a pay check and a pizza lunch, complete with pop and ice cream bars."
good,"At initial hire experienced, skilled workers were offered no more in pay than a kid straight out of High School. I was send through five months of training and had 92 certifications upon completion. They were promptly removed at my job assignment because our class was divided into groups of five and send to an area without consideration for skills or experience.  My area was high effort, low skill, repetitive work."
good,A typical day at work consisted of listening to management telling us how badly we were failing to achieve production goals and  not offering any solutions to bring us to the point of where we needed to be.
good,Good job where most employees were pretty decent. Projects moved so slowly that it almost made a person bored. Not a fan of some of the military projects.
good,"On a day to day basis you can expect to work on varying tasks from new contracting, assertions, new strategy, or other various tasks. Management makes a large difference on your experience. One thing is for certain is that change will happen."
good,Working with this client is a pleasure and all the challenges look fine as there is a proper recognition to all the hard work that I have done. Working extra hours was a challenge.
good,This was a field engineering job with a limited employee level that had various skills in overall engineering but limited ability to transfer and/or be promoted into another job position unless you leave to a different company section and/or location.
good,I am not interested in providing this information because it doesn't pertain to the future that I am creating and it isn't something that I should be required to provide
good,"This company will allow you to take on as much as you can handle while expecting very high standards of performance. You will work along side very accomplished people who will challenge you to match their work ethic.  I found that the environment allowed for personal growth and there was a high sense of teamwork, since that was the only way that the challenging goals could be met. The hardest part of the job for me was to not spend too much overtime trying to insure that we overcame all obstacles and met our goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with quality people who pulled together to successfully accomplish very difficult and technically challenging goals."
good,"Culture needs to change to improve work environment but met a lot of good people.  Depending on the package, your work load will vary.  Benefit is you are able to learn a lot."
good,I learned a lot at this job.  We had a great team and worked together very well.  the hardest part of the job was being on call 24/7.  I was very happy to retain my job when Boeing was bought by Spirit.
good,"Streeful, thankless, always adding new work and cutting cost. I feel at my age, I was encouraged to leave by adding enough work to make it impossible. They are hiring 2 college grads for the price of those older, more expensive workers."
good,"Good place to work. If you like a fast pace and exciting workplace than this is the company to work for. They have excellent benefits like healthcare, dental, vision, and they offer education benefits after you have been employed there after one year."
good,Typical Schedule driven work environment in which schedule drives productivity and deadlines create stressful work situation. The part played in being part of the manufacturing environment is very rewarding
good,"Good Place to Work"
good,"Normal working day normally starts at 7am. The company has a cubicle working places, there are not enough shelves for books and folders, I take my lunch from home. A weight room in the building is a plus."
good,Great place to work despite constantly changing management. Boeing effectively divested itself of my division to create ULA so that was turbulent. But the people were great and also the benefits.
good,"Great place to work, I even had a wonderful mentor that trained me for my job which I think is rare now. Definitely an aging workforce looking for younger talent."
good,I had the opportunity to get trained and get hands-on experience with interior design in the payload organization. I developed my skills and talents using and increasing knowledge of new design tools. I got higher leadership experience as result my level of involvement in different projects.
good,I do not care to release this information here. I will not disclose my personal opinion on this site in respect to the company that I currently work for.
good,cool place to work very diverse atmosphere very competitive and fast pasted challenging and fun a lot of incentives and benefits are good as well very nice job for the Charleston area
good,Boeing Long Beach plant location closed and layed of thousands of workers. It was a great working location with very good benefits so sad now it is shut down and closed so no real review
good,"The Boeing Facility in Philadelphia is a very tight knit community of employees. You will find groups that do many things together simply for the sake of team building, and some that do things together because they share a certain bond."
good,"Good place to work."
good,Il y a peu d'évolution sur cet avion mais c'est une bonne machine pour apprendre.
good,High performance and superior results are key in this culture.  The business is amazing and they create solutions that are integral to the aviation and defense industries.  Great people who work in an intense environment.
good,Overall good company. Promotions to management are tough unless you can massage the correct prostate. benefits are great. they paid for my bachelors and masters degree. There is tons of opportunity to grow....just not in management.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Boeing in the 90's as an Admin. assist at different locations; food services, facilities and education.  It is hard to review when I have not worked there for a while, but like all big companies management is always an issue."
good,"Pays good, but job security fails badly. Management is unorganized and Union cannot be trusted and no help at all in keeping your employment at Boeing or getting rehire after lay-offs."
good,"Large number of engineers and technical staff."
good,"My co-workers were great, but my boss was terrible.  The stress level with my boss was almost unbearable but I did not let it  affect the quality of my work.  I enjoyed the work I was doing, even with the stressful situation with my boss."
good,"I enjoyed many of my years at Boeing. They have good benefits, but advancement is not always available. They pay well and if you have a great team, you can accomplish important work."
good,"The Boeing company created work environment where the hourly union employees had more authority than frontline hourly managers, which forced managers to become very creative in employee motivation."
good,"For the most part, Boeing engineers tend to be more reserved than other places I've seen.  There are pockets with more interesting and outgoing groups, but they are not common.  Other than that, with the homogenizing of the workplace, it's becoming very similar to other large aerospace companies."
good,"Company goes through many changes and very suddenly almost with no warning day to day is normal no stress with management but taking your own intuitiveness can payoff, overall good company."
good,"It's a great company to work for with lots of opportunities for development, growth and good benefits.  Big corporation with many organizations.  Depending on organization and/or leader(s) - employees may not have equal opportunity for advancement.  Innovation at the lower level may be suppressed at higher levels due to legacy status quo cultures.  The cloud of uncertainty with aerospace industry doesn't always foster secure, high morale working environment. Lots of company speak (e.g. people are greatest asset), however, like all companies, its a business and loyalty to their employees only last for so long."
good,Boeing is a nice place to work that offers opportunities for growth. however company is known for layoffs. One must be willing to relocate to move up.
good,I was fortunate to work within a group that was tasked with work that was exciting and allowed us to be innovative while using each of our individual skill sets.
good,Good people in a great community! Workload is becoming somewhat stagnant and antiquated. The most challenging part of site leadership is working with less than qualified government oversight.
good,"Technology stack was very closed, little room for new leading edge technology"
good,"Great company to work for , many great people willing to teach and help, great company to move around and learn many different careers. The hours changed a lot and a lot of mangers left."
good,Great pay and benefits. They change managers all the time which I think hurts the company in the long term. Politics in the workplace also take a toll in the work e
good,Boeing is a great company if you have been there for 40 years like most of the employees. The company has changed according to what everyone has said about it.
good,"Positives:"
good,"Unless there is a war about to happen, working at Boeing would be tough to keep due to lack of work. Great benefits and schooling options. As soon as I got hired, though, I was told to ""prepare to be laid off."""
good,It's a good job. Decent pay although low to start. The company has been doing allot of cutting and cost saving. This could be looked at as good or bad if you're laid off. I have a secure job and it shouldn't be cut any time soon. So I like it there. They do have a 401k match that's pretty good. Most employees also eligible for an annual bonus as well. One great thing about Boeing is their tuition plan for current employees.
good,"They are currently more likely to hire contractors than regular employees for all non-essential personnel. Like all companies, they are cutting back in order to remain competitive with other countries."
good,"Boeing's culture is the midst of change, but isn't quite ready for 2017. If they fully expect to keep their top young talent and minds, then they will have to improve on advancement opportunities."
good,"Out of 28 years the worst management ever in the last couple of years....Loved my job, i was the best at my job, and going to miss it and all my coworkers. I so wish I could go back but not going to happen."
good,Good place to work and participate in highly challenging and rewarding projects.  I had the opportunity to work with international customers and publications and lead the donation of a highly valuable test aircraft.
good,Great Place to work. Multiple facets of the Aerospace Industry exist within Boeing. It's amazing to see all the steps and effort it takes to create an airplane and working at Boeing has perpetuated my love for the industry.
good,"* Sit at desk running CAD"
good,It's a great company for the young and family person to make a good living. Medical and dental coverage is great and vacation and sick leave when accrued is easy. Union sucks but we have one.
good,"Procured major subsystems for Military fighter Aircraft.  Developed bid packages, selected winning proposals, followed and reviewed progress for completion of contract.  New experiences every day.  Worked with minimum supervision.  Hardest part of the job was keeping the supplier on schedule.  The most enjoyable was delivery on time."
good,"Many opportunities when willing to relocate.  Leadership program offers many opportunities for training, shadowing, mentoring, round tables, and many more."
good,"Boeing has excellent benefits and great jobs, but poor management.  Oriented toward management and not workers.  To big to bid on smaller contracts that would expand their business base in space related industry."
good,"For a manufacturing facility, Boeing's plant is by far the cleanest and safest one I have observed. The work culture is very positive."
good,"I am on a short term contract. It is a good place to work, every day is a different challenge.The hardest part of the job is the fast pace of getting everything done."
good,"Nothing bad to say, large company with various opportunities. Great benefits and generally speaking, reasonable management. Decent work/life balance with great holiday time off."
good,"I worked for Boeing for 5 years. It was a very interesting company that has some of the brightest minds I ever worked with. I truly miss so many of my coworkers. The company itself is very big and as such, a person can transfer around and try out new areas until he or she finds one that fits. A typical work day will vary by department but consists of early meetings and reports followed by alleviating day to day operation problems and followup meetings for projects. It is a very relaxed company that doesn't force you to do too much. "
good,Daily cost and financial detailed satellite work which included working with all levels of work areas and departments
good,"everybody is proud of the products we design and build.  work environment can be stressful,  management appear to be make decision based on limited facts."
good,I have enjoyed working for Boeing South Carolina since joining the team. The management and fellow co-workers have all been pleasant to work with. The team has taught me new skills I did not have before I started with Boeing.
good,Great engineering internship experience. I was able to experience many different aspects of the company and work with many different people all over the organization.
good,Wonderful company to work for. Benefits and work/life split are great benefits. Very large company with many opportunities to choose from.
good,"A place where high performance and skill is recognized."
good,"I worked there a long time ago and the work culture wasn't the best, but the benefits were really good.  I got to work lots of overtime.  Sometimes it was mandatory overtime, so I didn't have much of a family life.  I am sure there is more diversity now.  There wasn't much back then."
good,"Laid off after 31 years. I'm grateful for the opportunity. they moved my job to Oklahoma, which is what happened to my basketball team as well. One day I'll figure out why it is that Oklahoma has it out for me."
good,"This was a pretty good organization to work for.  For the most part we had really excellent managers and challenging assignments. As the organization evolved, we lost a lot of good, key people to retirement and layoffs.  Their staff is now bare-bones."
good,"Lateral, advancement and training were always available working for this company. Continued education along with travel were also choices an employee at Boeing was offered along with low co-pay for medication, medical, and dental priorities."
good,"I enjoy my time working for Boeing, I really do. It's just with my mothers health declining, I feel like I should look in to career opportunities a little closer to home."

good,"A great company to work with lots of stuff to learn and challenge every day."
good,"Its an ok place to work for, i have never worked anywhere else for this long so im not really sure how the coworkers were great and the management was bad. The hardest part of the job is that you have to figure out what you will do on your own and there is no teamwork even though its expected."
good,"I learned alot about airplanes while at the job. I also held many "
good,"Decent benefits, wages get better the longer you have been there, in the mean time most departments have a ton of overtime. Problem is there is no real security. Boeing tends to have layoffs."
good,Working at Boeing was an enjoyable experience.  Have many co-workers that have become good friends.  The best part of the job was troubleshooting with different areas of engineering.
good,"Large corporation with many diverse opportunities, the more you embrace change and technology and understand your place and technology;s place in the future, then you may thrive."
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet my inspectors, Check my mail and support my customers either be internal or external"
good,"Very busy with a workable job load most of the time, however You need to stay cool because the going can get tough. Overcomming the challenges can be the most rewarding times."
good,Great company for retired military.Moving up will be an issue.  Folks are set in their ways. Working in the Philly area is harder than working in the DC area.
good,"Typical place, Not sure what to say here.  Just try to get a Job there and see for yourself.  It's a personal kind of thing and everyone's experience will be different"
good,"family oriented and great benefits, interesting company because of space company.  lots of employee functions and recognition."
good,It can be a productive and fun place to work.  The pay scale is very competitive and there is  opportunity for overtime if you're looking for it.
good,Typical day was at first replacing old printers with new Lexmark printers. The people I worked with were great. The end of the time I was there it got really horrible.
good,"Work is schedule and customer driven.  Very exacting, with many last minute revisions to assumptions or groundrules.  The site is growing and with that many changes, new folks, and challenges in mentoring and training."
good,Boeing is an established and stable company that is particularly proud of its practice of hiring the best in their fields including veterans.
good,Excellent benefits packages. Very supportive Management. Slow growth opportunities. Probability of job re-locations.
good,"An analyst position or Business Management position that utilizes my experience in leading and overseeing the implementation of Business Processes, Earned Value Management, communication skills, and working in a team environment."
good,I enjoy the people. The organizational culture of consistently leaning out process and headcounts is left to be desired.
good,massive company with lots of potential opportunities with sites across the U.S. that make some of the most advanced aerospace products in production today.
good,"Interesting projects but suffers from bureaucracy."
good,"Global corporation with employment opportunities world wide. Commercial side pays well and has rewarding, challenging jobs."
good,In my time aerospace was difficult to work in many layoffs and found job site a nervous experience with feeling job security was at risk.
good,"This company affords the opportunity to work with highly skilled people, professional, and experienced.   The company provides generous benefits (401k, vacation, heath)."
good,"Enjoyed the work and Teamwork involved."
good,Boeing enabled me to teach others my philosophy in working smarter not harder in order to reach a given goal.  Not only in the workplace but in private life as well.
good,"Interesting job to have, no where to grow in the company.  All young kids work there.  I have nothing else more to say about this job"
good,"After spending 15 years with same company at same location, I decided it was time to expand my experiences. Based on recent management changes and changes to site culture helped me decide it was time for a change."
good,A normal day started with breakfast in the downstairs cafeteria.  Usually would go to some kind of training every couple of weeks and apply what I had learned to my Technical Designer jobs.  I got along well with the Engineers in the group and was treated well by Management.  I learned about Designing Installations that would qualify for all the FAA requirements.
good,"Worked in a team based environment with limited supervision, management was fair and we valued diversity. Trust and respect was a requirement for each employee. This was needed to achieve our goals and business objectives. We all were leaders, regardless whether or not you were a manager or an buyer. I valued my time with Boeing and wanted to finish my career with Boeing, but due to business decisions the facility was down-sized."
good,while management is sadly chosen and only cared about how they looked with numbers without recognition to us for making numbers and dis-organized the work place was great and clean. all up to date tools. our manager did not respect us but my coworkers where top of the line and made it easy to work with due to experience and respectfulness. the hardest part was having to do our mangers job for him due to incompetence the most enjoyable part was traveling for repairs and our second level management was very respectful and always recognized us for our hard work plus the benefits and pay made it enjoyable to a point. shift difference was very easy to work with.
good,"Good company to work with great benefits, lay offs always a risk but opportunities exsist there if you make them. the company does a lot for the community."
good,I enjoyed my 10 plus yrs at Boeing! It was a life long experience and I wish I had the opportunity to work there again. My goal is to get another great job like that one so I'll be able to retire there.
good,made good friends with co-workers & management. start day with a meeting in the morning. then we go get are tools and go to are work station. then start working on selling jobs.
good,e-SWAT an electric schematic and wiring diagram analysis tool used in airplane maintenance by the airplane buyers and the flight service engineers. This tool is delivered to the customers of Boeing who buys the airplanes.
good,"I always performed well, took on difficult tasks and volunteered for special projects. Enjoyed a challenge. I didn't like the work/life balance here as much. High demand for overtime."
good,Two thumbs up. My best work experience ever!  I would love the opportunity to go back there. However my job there was farmed out.
good,"great place to work, benefits, good crews. always a new challenge everyday that you conquer. Great place to learn new skills that you can apply to your everyday life and your professional careers."
good,"Fun working area,meet a lot of diverse people. Friendly atmosphere . appreciates their employees had a lot of free lunches."
good,"Loved working here, great people. Set Schedules and advancement opportunities. Enjoyed working for the company and would go back to working with them in a heartbeat."
good,"Given Boeing's reputation for up and down cycles for employment, I am happy overall with my 10 year run at this company.  I would have liked to stay awhile longer, however."
good,A normal day at Boeing is good I do a lot of Lab time testing new software loads and then the documentation and process flow insurance associated with the System's Engineering part of the job.
good,"This is a good company to work for with excellent benefits.  Fast-paced environment, must be able to multi-task; minimum travel required depending on the job position and responsibilities."
good,"Boeing is a fun and instructive job to have but with all the managers that are involved, a person has to either make friends or know someone in order to move up regaurds to past experiences."
good,"One of the best manufacturing companies in Winnipeg. You can learn a lot about aerospace industry while working with experienced employees (from shopfloor people to office staff). This depends on the team that you work with, though."
good,"IT is going through a new reorganization for the past 4 years.  Goal is to reduce the number of employees at or about to reach retirement age due to new benefit structure and cancelling pension plans.  Leadership has been struggling with going from IT as a service to centers of excellence due to the number of experienced employees being replaced with new college hires.  When goals and objectives of the leadership team are not met, IT goes through a major reorganization to justify missed objectives.  Many skilled and experienced managers, directors and executives have been forced into retirement or have left voluntarily do to the excess and poor planning.  It is common to have multiple new managers in one year.  Most time is spent training managers on the required job, then actually getting work done."
good,Great company and employer to work for.  The company is strong in the US and international markets.  They have good benefits.
good,Enjoyed working with a diverse group of people.  I had the opportunity to add to my background as Technical Writer in the Engineering field.
good,Exciting products and diversity of work to do within the same company. Flexible workplace and great benefits. Coworkers are great  but in general you see an older crowd.
good,"Excellent workplace for an iconic company in the northwest. The company is focused on building a team environment and really taking pride in your workplace. The problem with any large company is the pace of work can sometimes get tied up in the higher levels of leadership which can be challenging for the employee who wants to always be moving. However, you work here to be a part of something unique, a company that manufactures airplanes."
good,Boeing is a great place to start a career. High pay and responsibilities quickly add to skill and experience. There are a lot of older workers here that resist change. It can feel a little stagnant when compared to other high tech companies.
good,Boeing has been a great place to jump start my career. Along with outstanding benefits they have allowed me to work on many unique projects.
good,"Many of my co-workers became my mentors as they taught me how to become a good planner and a good leader. The facility is beautiful, the weather is amazing, but the people made all the difference."
good,A lot of areas to expand your career in as long as you have the willingness to learn and challenge yourself. There are many people here who are very helpful in providing an abundance in information and further enhance technical skills. Attention to detail is very important.
good,- Interns are given many opportunities to tour the facilities and conduct informational interviews with employees
good,"Normal business hours 8-5"
good,"Culture is oldschool, the hardware is incredibly impressive.  There are learning opportunities on campus fairly often including Lunch and Learn technical lecture series and systems overview courses."
good,"Boeing provided me with a multitude of free training classes where I was able to improve my computer, phone and customer skills.  This was a very supportive and great group of people to work with!"
good,Great work environment and provides opportunities to attend conferences and trainings.
good,"Pay and benefits and provided features, etc. are all great but the work was frequently incredibly slow and boring and too skill-specific. In addition, it was easy to feel detached from other departments and from the big picture. Boeing works to foster a friendly, inclusive environment, and I was on good terms with my coworkers as friends and/or as teammates as well my manager."
good,"Program design, perosnal training, group exercise, corporate wellness programing."
good,"I work autonomously, releasing kits for electronic assemblies to be manufactured in-house, following those all the way through Sell Off.  Also do high-volume kitting for assemblies which are outsourced. "
good,"As a production based company, you know what's expected of you on a daily basis.  Management and leads enhance learning by guiding you through the steps that need to be taken to evaluate a particular component or assembly.  Co-workers encourage growth by sharing lessons learned and time saving applications.  Learning a new tuning or assembly technique may be difficult at first but the best part is after having mastered the technique, that's one more thing to make you a more valuable part of the team."
good,Buena experiencia adquirida durante mi estancia en la empresa. Participación en grandes proyectos de investigación y desarrollo de nuevas tecnologías aeronáuticas.
good,The shift begins with a daily production meeting in a round table format. Jobs are handed out and we clock in shortly after our assignments are give to us. I work on the tail section of the aircraft installing the Door Surrounds. The hardest part of the job is having to wait on the barrel to be given to us on time so that we can meet our production. The best part is meeting our production regardless of when we receive our barrel...
good,"It's a good company, there are a lot of opportunity to to become involved in projects."
good,"Almost everyone that I worked with at Boeing was extremely intelligent and were always coming up with innovative ideas to improve the quality of our products.  However, the contract acquisition team really did not have a wide-enough market base; focusing on one government contract and nothing else, so when that failed to become a winnable contract, it pretty much shut down our domain entirely."
good,I worked with a classmate 3D modeling landing gear for Boeing's software testing department.  The project was a nice challege and we were able to deliver a satisfactory model within the time alloted.
good,The people and atmosphere are excellent. Management is good except they are located in another state. The most enjoyable part of working for Boeing is helping people get stuff done. The simple thanks you's are enough and everyone I have supported always is appreciative and says thank you.
good,I enjoy my job and the training that I have received while working for the Boeing company
good,777 Flight Controls and V-22 Avionics - Flight Test Validation
good,High pressure work environment eminent layoffs and rewarding in the fact to help serve and protect army personal in a combat environment.
good,"At work I fulfill multiple roles such as develop, analyze, review and maintain resource forecasts and/or Estimates at Completion (EACs) at the control account, budget, function or pool level (financial operations); financial statements forecasts and/or financial EACs at the contract, program, business unit or enterprise level (financial planning).

Also, I analyze business opportunities by assimilating strategic plans (financial planning) and business cases. Lastly, analyze external financial statements results and projections to provide visibility of financial performance to internal/external stakeholders (financial planning)."
good,Great benefits and challenging tasks help employees grow.
good,My first overseas contract job. Can't compare it to anything else. I walked away with more experience in patience and determination in what I do.
good,"High Technology"
good,Review work done the day before to line up work for the rest of the day. Work diligently under a Lead engineer and with other student engineers to create drawings and models as needed by different customers.
good,"Again, this was merely a senior design project at VT, where I worked as team lead and maintained contact with a Boeing Employee (industry mentor)."
good,Very knowledgeable employees. Great benefits and very competitive pay.
good,"This workplace is just like another typical workplace. I learned the new process of design, documentations on different aircraft platforms and how to certify the aircrafts compliant to FAA regulations. "
good,"With the exception of the up and down thoughts of job security, THe Boeing Company is perhaps the best place to work in the northeast. With the great union benefits and compensation, it can ensure to provide for a lifelong opportunity. Boeing is a very laid back place to work. When I first started the work seemed infinite. After the change in the economy and government cuts due to our wonderful president, work and production has slowed among the defense side of the company with multiple site closures nationwide. I always enjoy coming to work and putting in a ten hour day. The hardest part of the job is the shift changes every six months or so. I have about 9 years in assembly experience and entered the Boeing Company as an assembler. I took on the role as an aircraft sealer becuase of the endless overtime opportunity. I recently started the road to obtain a bachelors degree in computer forensics with tuition paid for in full by Boeing."
good,Boeing is a good place to work.  The work force is balanced.  I supported large groups of people and enjoyed working with each one of my customers.  I became a very social individual in the process.  Benefits are competitive as is compensation.  Job security is not as stable as some industries as there is heavy reliance on government support in some components.  I accepted several of the opportunities I was given to go school and learn additional skills. This is probably one of Boeing's best offerings for their employees.  I am willing to pick up and learn virtually anything I can.  Our team was a close-knit group and we worked extremely well together.  The people are truly one of Boeings greatest assets.  They are my second family.  I am a regular and a big fan of the Boeing Fitness Center.

good,Was very process driven.  Always knew what your next steps would be.
good,"There are various areas to work. A typical day can be crazy, productive, full of meetings, progressive or unproductive."
good,"Good place to get an education and learn. The software engineering opportunities are limited, there is no sense of an Agile processes. Not the best place to program the latest and greatest technologies."
good,"Not a good company for long term employment."
good,I learned a lot about the business basics at this division.  We worked hard but were rewarded.
good,"The people are great to work with, they are very knowledgeable"
good,Overall good place to work good management from top to bottom.
good,"Boeing is an awesome facility. Coming from BMW in the upstate I expected a lot and thats exactly what I got, but on two ends of the spectrum. On my first day i was dropped off to my ""area"" and told id there wasnt much for me to do yet. A week later after no trainers or process sheets, just FOD training; I was placed in a tool crib with no computer access or proper training. After a few weeks i have learned a lot but only because i have asked questions and searched for answers. Numerous times i have done a job and someone else has takin credit for it, being a temp you have no say or youll get accused of something and fired. Hopefully soon enough ill move up to management of my area and start to turn things around. The hardest part of the job is standing up which is not hard and the most enjoyable part would be when i actually get noticed for a job i did."
good,I really like working for this company.  The company offers their workers great benefits.
good,High turn over.  Poor management.  It's a fight to do work the correct way.  Mechanics argue with other mechanics over tools because of the poor support.
good,"From the perspective of an engineer, work at Boeing can be a rewarding experience.  The subject matter can be challenging and the pay/benefits are competitive."
good,"Family friendly company, a lot to learn,  multicultural place which is so enriching. I loved Boeing."

good,Boeing is a strong aerospace engineering company with good benefits.
good,every morning we start on the schedules  at the white board and then  we talk about the technical issues of the system trucks of the customers with my co workers technician..after the meeting im goeing out and go to customers and see what is the problem of the forklift .sometimes i troubleshoot the system or the electrical part or i actual check the mechanical of the unit...everyday this is my routine at my work....
good,I have managed and trained 100 plus personnel in safety and fire fighting procedures on board aircraft carriers.
good,"Boeing has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for "
good,"Boeing is a really good place to work but, the job security is very questionable as they are always laying off."
good,"Rockwell was truly a great place to work. The company ideals always put worker needs first. When Boeing bought the Rockwell Autonetics and Space Systems division it forced the closure of the Duluth GA plant and a merger with other Boeing sites in PA, CA, AZ, AL, and MO. I accepted a transfer to St. Louis/St. Charles, MO. Part of the culture I had experienced in GA was missing in Boeing-St. Louis, largely due to the shear size of the corporation. In addition,  the former McDonnell Douglas-St. Louis division had also experienced a similar merger with Boeing leaving an overall feeling of resentment among the St. Louis personnel. There are some benefits to working in a large corporation like Boeing. But, these benefits come at a cost, particularly to the social setting available within a smaller company. Everyone knows everyone and to the high achiever, this is an open door to success and good reputation. While the large company does not foster individuality, its talent pool is much larger making the distribution of specific skills sets possible."
good,Typical day involves proviing deleverables on time.  Review of indirect budget (labor and non-labor).  Customer interface for capital requests.
good,Airplane manufacturing company.  Decline further discussion.
good,"I interned for Boeing, and even though it has a reputation for having an aging workforce, my team was very young."
good,"fast paced work with constant training and good management . Co-workers are friendly and I would say the hardest part of the job would be to remind yourself to pay attention to detail . Plenty of perks to include but not limited to free lunches for completing ahead of schedule , awards , free ""Boeing points ""and so on"
good,A typical day at work was getting work orders together and getting tools ready for each job.
good,Boeing is very family oriented and takes very good care of its employees.
good,"Inputting data into Medical Information System (MIS) and distributing to the nurses.  Coordinated with nurses and attended meetings as well as a member of a Employee Involvement Team (EIT).  In charge of medical records.  Sent and retrieved medical records to/from iron mountain.  Records Information Management (RIM) focal."
good,"A job which is hands on and productive. never a dull moments."
good,"Great pay and benefits, but I got laid off after 14 years for injuring myself on the job, I got laid off because I could no longer do my job."
good,"A great thing about working here is you will rarely ever encounter the same thing twice, and you will constantly learn new things."
good,Performed general office duties and entered the Planning on aircraft into the Data Mainframe. High accuracy a must.
good,"Typical day at work ranges from client meetings, staff direction, solving problems, providing value added solutions."
good,"Fun, if you don't mind being owned and operated by a sadistic power-crazed, male dominated environment... and conforming to an underground drama machine. "
good,"Boeing offers a wide veriety of opportunity, hard work will take you and your career far"
good,I led a talented team of individuals that consistently exceeded progress goals.
good,"It's a good place to work, but they're cutting down on a lot of benefits and there's too much work uncertainty. They do a lot of lay offs, outsourcing and relocation."
good,If you can make it past the first year its great. Depending on the job you apply for the job can be very labor intensive. Mandatory overtime (10 hour days 19 days on 2 days off)
good,My typical day at work was reviewing blueprints and making corrections on installation plans.
good,First job out of college. Great benefits co-workers were great mentors.
good,Boeing is a great overall company to work for. I worked for internationally as a Staff Analyst in Qatar and now as a Business Analyst in St Louis MO. The greatest assets that Boeing has are its employees and strong leadership. The hardest part of my job was that my customers were located in different time zones.
good,"Meetings and phone calls, training classes, scheduling, documentation, consultation are all typical days."
good,"Work day started at 6:30am at production test team meeting area, jobs are passed out to technicians, once job order is obtained, technician must log into job via Boeing internet, technician must review job order step by step. Technician then will perform job following a detailed engineering document, once job is complete technician must have quality assurance verify completion of job. Learning was an everyday event at Boeing, new skills, and how important it is to preform work with quality and safety in mind. Management was very difficult to deal with due to the constant changing of managers between teams, however adaptation is a skill also obtained in that type of environment. The hardest issue was time away from family due to the excessive over time worked. The most enjoyable thing is knowing that I have had a part in manufacturing an aircraft that will revolutionize the air travel industry with cutting edge technology."
good,"I was a contractor, simply unboxed and installed new computers and laptops."
good,I can't really explain but its your basic aviation work. If you have worked at Boeing then you know what I'm talking about!
good,functional test of military aircraft originality built buy McDonnell Douglass including C17 Globe masters and Apache helicopters.
good,"Analyze and implemented work load from sources such as email, database reports, spreadsheets and initiative projects. Constantly changing priorities kept me busy switching from one project to another."
good,"I really liked this position. I liked not knowing what each day was going to bring. I liked the challenge of organizing the needs of a work group, getting them moved and settled and handling any challenges they may have. It was also fun coordinating the efforts of several vendors at the same time. It really made you feel good knowing that you have successfully moved a group of 100+ people and settled them without any disruption to their business. At times, the hardest part of the job might be the logistics themselves, or severe time constraints. I really enjoyed my management. They trusted me to get the job done, and then let me do it. I appreciated their trust in me."
good,"Good company to work for. The one con is that their is little job security, but i liked the time that I was thier."

good,Very intelligent and professional group of people and management to work with.
good,"As an employee of PDS Tech working for Boeing (contracted), a typical day involved me supporting the Inventory of Chemical Data Management System. The work requires lots of attention to detail."
good,"always busy,you can always learn something with all the experience, to cut corners without sacrificing quality.Management work with everybody as a team just like a coworker which makes work a pleasure(you want to go to work every day).Honestly their is no hardest part, I love what i do.When i get to bring my kids to the factory on family day."
good,"good place to work, great benefits, poor climate"
good,"People oriented managers, good benefits. Project oriented workplace so sometimes employment outlook is uncertain."
good,"A typical day at the office for me would be leading my team into completing projects and working with managers. The hardest part of my job is balancing work and school, but the dedication is within me to do so. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we complete difficult projects and are recognized for all the hard work we as a team put in to finish tasks."

good,Really enjoyed working with my co-workers
good,"A typical workday would be spent at a computer terminal, processing computer hardware and software orders for Boeing's internal clients. I had knowledgeable coworker that I could lean on for processing orders through different Boeing applications if necessary. From time to time, requests would come through that didn't have the necessary information to process and that would require a phone call to the client for verification. Otherwise, it was business as usual."
good,Working with boeing is one of the best i would say. The best in team coordination.
good,Under globalization pressure and ever changing industry dynamic.
good,A wonderful place to work. The hours are usually flexible. There's a lot of diversity. The people you work with are top notch.
good,"This job is what you make it. If your a hard worker and enjoy working, do just that and you should be fine. There is a lot of gossip and back stabing. Don't get caught up in that stuff because it will kill your job."
good,Good benefit and good working enviroment.
good,"I always looked forward to go to work each day, it was fun and full of challenges. Surrounded with loving people and the hardest part of the job was anytime we had so much to do, but it was also interesting doing all the work. the most enjoyable part of the job was playing ping pong every break period."
good,handled major customer account;scheduling;vendor visits;inventory management
good,flexible work schedule and location
good,overall a great company to work for...
good,Exciting place to work with challenges and limited growth opportunities.
good,"Retired-  Boeing was a good place to work. Management had their problems. Benefits were great in the 80's and 90's but after that the union pretty much lost their bargaining power. After that, what ever the company couldn't gain from the union, they messed with the benefits of salaried non-exempt people. Worked there 30 years and was salaried non-exempt at the end, and was put in a position of retiring or lose out on some of my pension and health benefits.  If I chose to stay working for them, I would have lost 1/3 of my benefits and 25% of my pay. I chose to leave with what I had for benefits."
good,"Worked at boeing for almost 30 years retired at 55 wanted to do something else"
good,"I honestly can say being  I can build troubleshoot or improve from start to finish . Nose to the tail of the aircraft .. good passion, blood , sweat & tears.  I’m probably many of few  i learn all I needed to a bird we put together that flys."
good,"Good Worklife balance most of the time for individual contributors.  Lots of growth opportunities touted, but can be difficult to achieve.  A lot of promises made of promotions that never come to fruition, the bar keeps getting moved.  Overall I believe w it to be a good company, but as anywhere your leaders make or break your experience."
good,"pros- great challenging work, much innovation, and being encouraged to improve skills. con- the management could show less favoritism within employees. very little job/work security."
good,Great company to work for and great pay. Many job opportunities for the skilled aircraft mechanic looking for a long career with an established company.
good,I love working for the Boeing company but i feel like the road to advancement is not very fair. I also feel that the pay scale is not very competitive for the skill and quality of work that I put forth.
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. They take pride in their employees both at work and at home. I would recommend anyone who is wanting to look into a job at Boeing to go ahead and apply.
good,Boeing has great pay and benefits. Their culture of diversity is probably one of the top in the nation. The bad is they treat each person like a number. Management is not the best that recognizing employees for doing great work.
good,Good people fast pace. They do not pay as well as you think.. The responsibility for a part worth six figures should pay at the very least a living wage.
good,"Good place to work for young professionals.  Older, higher paid workers are normally the first to be reduced or downgrade.  If you can navigate the lay-off cycle,"
good,"Enjoy working for them.  Salary and compensation top in industry, but career advancement in current position doesn’t look promising.  Education programs to return to school are excellent."
good,"Being is a great company to work for. They really make wellness an important part of your life. Plant has an on site wellness specialist, healthy eating an fitness activities."
good,The company is growing but is now being a little more deliberate since the  two plane accidents.  They have all of the benefits that most companies have but we receive little to no discounts.
good,Clicks ...good ole boys..  management is decent.. if your contracting your very expendable.  Very very difficult to go direct . Very very competitive attitude.
good,"Boeing is a very large company, and as such, you won't get much achieved on a day-to-day, or in a greater personal sense, unless you seek it out. Maybe 25% of managers will keep your professional goals in mind, but it's easy to get complacent at Boeing."
good,"Overall, good company to work for.  It's large with many positions that would allow several career changes at same company.  However, relocation is offered less over the last several years, reducing job changes to broaden career to a geographic area or specific Design Center.  Twice a year there is a re-organization or management change (or both), difficult to excel in task accomplishment, when you may not be on the project after next re-organization.  Generous continuous educations through Degreed and tuition reimbursement.  Many promotions seem based more on years than actual accomplishments. In Seattle area, compensation is lower than big tech and coupled with rapid rising real estate market, 30% salary spent on housing will be in rural areas not downtown Seattle condo or home near Green Lake."
good,"The only reason I left was because I was sick of the rain and overcast skies. It is a good job for hourly interested people. Management is bad on the shop floor, so look for Salary management positions."
good,I was pleased that Boeing was flexible and allowed me to work remotely a few days a week. The office I worked out of was environmentally friendly and has recycling bins everywhere. The office also had self-service vending machines. Getting my documents in for onboarding took almost a week. I had to get my badge at a different location. Upon leaving I had to turn in my laptop to an employee and my badge at the badging office. Getting my laptop on the network took a few steps and action by the hiring manager. Expect to get on the network the next day.
good,"Nice place to work.  The headquarters is located in Chicago which is a nice town with an endless list of restaurants, theaters and any other form of entertainment you may be looking for."
good,"No work life balance. Can be forced to work 19 day straight. Inflexible Hours but work was enjoyable, stable and the people were great. You will have not life outside of work at all because shifts either start at about 3 and go to 11:30 or they start at 5:30 and go to 2:30."
good,"If you have a great manager, which there are many, than you will enjoy your time but politics as a contracter working at Boeing is always with an end date. This is stressful as if you do a good job and impress your direct boss they will work hard to keep you but the level of personal cuts that go through the contract work means even this is uncertain."
good,"Built product subassemblies or final assemblies and monitored and adjusted production processes or equipment for quality and productivity. Prepared production documents such as standard operating procedures, manufacturing batch records,"
good,"The company itself is great, they really try their best to take care of their people and there business equally.  also they have great benefits and bonus programs"
good,"All american company, "
good,"The work culture depends on the project and mostly not a bad place to work at."
good,I got some good experience in WorkDay and International Payroll and had hoped the assignment would have been longer but they were closer to meeting their deadlines than originally expected so no longer needed my temp services and I was told there was a hiring freeze in process at that time regarding permanent positions there.
good,"They are ok, pay is good. I really dont like writing forced reviews, not a smart thing for indeed to ask for. A couple of more characters to go and I can click through this screen"
good,There is very little to no room to advance. Candidates for open positions (other than entry level) are almost always pre-selected. Matrix org results in some managers with no real job while others are drowning.
good,A typical day was stressful and led into the evenings as parts were needed 24/7. The compensation was incredible and it was a diverse environment. I enjoyed the challenge of the job.
good,"Great place to work.  Fun place met a lot of good friends, and leadership is fantastic.  recommend working at Boeing if you are ok with a slow-paced, bureaucratic company."
good,Being protected by the union was both good and bad having to do with people who did not want to work with bad having your job protected was good. Rotating managers at the never had to take accountability and responsibility was to be somebody else's problem in a month. The most difficult part of working there was putting up other people. Too many people at the I'm protected by the union I don't need to work hard attitude. That being said if you showed up your paid. If you showed up for work or if he showed up and didn't work really didn't matter as long as you showed up as part of the reason I left
good,"It has it's positives and negatives. Culture is slowly catching up with the times but the company also mainly aims to please its shareholders. I found that starting pay is higher than normal but they have also stopped making raises and promotions as easy to get as in their past. "
good,Nice to work for such a well known and respected company.  Bureaucracy heavy but that's understandable. Work life balance was excellent.  Very procedural in some aspects but flexible where it was important.
good,"treated like an adult which means unrealistic deadlines without the over bearing pressure from management. it is your choice if you want to be there to step up and perform. management will sit back and observe how you handle their expectation."
good,"Although there is room to grow, senior people were not competent nor encouraging of younger people to advance their skills. "
good,Good company to work for.  OK benefits.  flexible hours. good people.  Not an IT company.  not the best management.  lots of different jobs.  high stock price
good,"Large company always looking for ways to cut costs,  If it deals with work space, phone costs, processing costs, production costs but usually the first cuts come with the employee layoffs leaving more work to be done by fewer employees or outsourced."
good,"_check the flow chart on how far along a particular station has progressed from the day before and pick up from there to complete at the assigned station and move forward  _production and the importance of meeting schedule per contract to our customer(s)  _on average, the management gave us our job assignments and where he/she would hope to be by the end of the day and then get out of the way  _camaraderie among my peers ie. we would pick each other up as needed  _ meeting deadlines as the product wouldn't always cooperate  _seeing the product go wheels-up and head to its base of operations"
good,"The job was amazing. Unfortunately, workplace politics and other issues allowed poor performers and toxic environments to flourish. Hard work is valued, but poor employees are coddled."
good,Not a dynamic place to work for. Management should encourage employees to grow from inside instead of trying to hire from outside when it comes to advanced positions.
good,"Boeing was a nice place, however the distance from where I live was not good. The people there were nice, but I wouldn't recommend taking breaks outside or taking the bus unless you don't mind the smell of cigarette smoke or people smoking."
good,"Good place to work and grow. It is one of the highest paying blue collar companies in the Northwest. Since you want more characters in my review, I would recommend Boeing to anyone....."
good,Boeing 787 South Carolina is a very challenging and rewarding place of employment.  The workplace culture is excellent.  The hardest part of the job was the very demanding pace.  I am proud to have been a member of the Boeing Team for five years.
good,"productive place to work, but long hours and back breaking work. I learned a lot about lean manufacturing and 5(S) while working here. Boeing is a great company to work for but it's hard to advance here without knowing someone that can help you move up."
good,"Pay not competitive"
good,"Boeing makes an exceptional product, and is poised to provide exceptional after-market support. However, although at the top of the industry, Boeing still struggles with schedule vs quality. It is a tightrope for each program to maintain an effective and efficient balance between the two, and senior management is keenly aware. Hence, support for either is available if one is moderately persistent. Compelling, challenging, and rewarding if you possess skill, stamina, and determination."
good,Have 2 daily meeting and 3 breaks so your not always working but fast paced work when busy. The management is decent they just follow what there boss is telling them though so its not much of there doing most of the time.
good,Had a great experience.  Would go back to work for them.  VPs are approachable and personable.  Atmosphere is challenging and rewarding.  Boeing has high expectations of all their contractors and employees.
good,"A typical work day starts at 7:00AM answering emails with the factory and other colleagues. Salving and answering any issues with projects."
good,The one thing I really loved about Boeing was their openness to diversity and inclusion. I also really liked that Boeing put on emphasis on providing mentors for early career employees as well as their interns. There was so much opportunity for growth and development.
good,Career advancement and management has been focused more on Business than on its people who work for it.  There are pockets of goodness but in general I feel that the culture and atmosphere is no longer what I am looking for.
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for if you are just starting out or are looking for a challenging position.  I started as a factory mechanic and have progressed up into a senior planner role.  Thee company has provided me and our family with many opportunities and experiences.  While I do not want to leave the company, I want to leave the area I am currently living."
good,it was a high pace work environment. Not hard to stay busy and also very organized when it comes to safety and cleanliness of the workplace. going in as a contractor you will not get paid enough to support a comfortable life style
good,"This was a great job for a college student to work at part time. The pay was pretty low, but overall, a great experience. This was a very team oriented company."
good,"-Great products and good benefits."
good,"The people are great, most of management is great.  The problem is the changing environment and requirements of the job, little or no training time and overall high stress.  Expected to work all three shifts and flex your time to meet the work load."
good,Good benefits but Declining over time.  Positive reviews for giving employees a chance to perform quality products on time.  You will be required to keep a very clean working environment no matter what your job title is.  You must share tools of which some co-workers don't understand the concept of that.  Loved some of the ongoing training classes.
good,"Great place for people who don't want to work hard. But still room for those who do. Management is squeezing out the old timers, making the moral and work environment toxic. But hey, the stock is at an all time high! "
good,"No Thank you, this is personal to me and I do not feel this is pertinent to this process. Culture at the B is not what it used to be, although a great place to work."
good,"Excellent place to work in terms of interesting things to do, and worked primarily as a contractor. However, the work-life balance is pretty much nonexistent. Get used to lots of overtime as projects usually are behind and somewhat poorly scoped before they begin. The two pluses of Boeing are compensation and benefits, followed with job security and management. The culture varies depending on your location. Had mixed-bag both good and bad, and one outstanding engagement where I was a star player, and one awful engagement where I was treated rudely and harassed to the point of being thankful for being laid-off. Bottom line: ask questions before committing to contract work. Full-time employment is always a much better business scenario at Boeing."
good,"In my opinion, Boeing continues to be in cut-throat winner take all type of aircraft duopoly competition with Airbus. Boeing's focus is to produce a quality product better, faster, and less expensive than the competition. Again, in my opinion, two of these criteria can be gained, but only at the expense of the third. With most global manufacturing component costs being relatively equal, the only real manufacturing cost where Boeing had any real control was labor costs. Who can complete the work for the least amount of expense? This precipitated the Boeing corporate executive management to relocate to markets where labor costs could be reduced, labor union representation was curtailed, existing union contracts were renegotiated, employee benefits and retirement plans reduced, among other actions detrimental to the benefit and welfare of the employee community."
good,"Boeing is still working to strive as a turn of the century company culturally.  There is still a very 1980's view on hierarchy and 8 hour work days.  With that said, there are initiatives to change this and it is happening slowly."
good,I actually worked for Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Co.  Boeing bought these companies out years ago.   I know several fellow employees that tel me the work environments have not changed much with the exception of MCDAC planes being discontinued and the Long Beach facility eventually closed.
good,I cannot reveal details....I signed a non disclosure agreement... There  fore I cannot disclose what my job there was... I liked what I did... My Manager was great...
good,Representing Boeing Procurement with the task of solving contract requirement issues can be satisfying.Travel and working with contracted supply base suppliers was challenging and enjoyable. Solving delivery and quality is to make both customer and supplier winners.
good,"Each VP ran each organization as an isolated kingdom, with little or no accountability across organizations resulting in many situations of sub-optimization.  For example, cost cutting process changes in procurement/supply chain caused 2x cost increases in manufacturing."
good,"Although the benefits were not great for a part-time software tester, the atmosphere and flexible hours were great.  In addition everybody was a joy to work with."
good,"Senior leadership may need a refresh and advancement opportunities in California are almost non-existent.  The talent is here in Southern California, not in other business friendly states."
good,"Though I found Boeing to be a good place for work, if you work on the floor building planes, it takes a physical toll.  Working in the offices and training users on the newest released applications for employee use or Microsoft Office, was a nice place to work."
good,The benefits are excellent but needs to allow for more advancement to others within the company. Also need to have a better work life balance this would improve the over all moral.
good,Great place to work With a lot of skill people well-educated personal and good opportunity to move around and learn different functions of the aerospace field
good,"Work balance is very hard to achieve, many of our benefits have been reduced or taken away due to a strong emphasis on cost cutting which has resulted in too many highly experienced employees taking early retirement or being laid off in the pursuit of higher stock prices. Morale is very poor due to all the reorganizing being done, no one is safe."
good,Boeing had a competitive work culture. The hours were fair and the compensation was fair. The company had excellent benefits to complement the compensation.
good,"It's a good company but certain areas of the company are union and pay great but the management is ify because of the size some areas managers are descent but most like anywhere else if they can throw you under the bus they will. Best states with Boeing IAM union pay are Oregon, Washington, California and Florida. The Midwestern states and southern states accept Florida because of NASA that have Boeing aren't union and they pay less and worker you harder. Texas is sorta ok. Other then poor management because of the upper top teir mangers Boeing's benefits outway the BS."
good,"Quality Assurance is the job to have at Boeing. I've tried other positions, which were fine but the best overall balance is definitely part of the Quality Assurance group."
good,Co-workers was the best part of the job.  We supported each other and overall between co-worker and the company I have no complaint.  The benefits we as good as you can get.  Enjoy my job task.
good,"For someone who is a go-getter, work here can be at times frustrating. You just have to maintain your own integrity in all matters. There is an existing culture that is hard to overcome; what is in your control is how much honesty and integrity that you bring to the table. One can work as hard as one desires or can do the minimum - I choose to give an honest day's work for a day's pay. There are different obstacles to overcome, with production aims being the biggest, but with a clear head and a focus on the task at hand, one can and should always be the best that you can be, ethically, morally, and with respect for myself? My work ethic is my integrity, and I will strive to maintain that no matter what."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work, great benefits, pay and a sense of pride. I worked there 7 years, your co workers become like family, There is always help and teamwork"
good,"It's a good place to work.  Policies need to be better explain to employees.  Poor communication between hourly EMPLOYEES, HR and ALL MANAGER  LEVELS."
good,Lacking advancement opportunities for qualified candidates.  Overall the working atmosphere was great.  My only reason for retiring early was to raise my son as a single parent.
good,Currently very stressful with a lot of layoffs and transfers.  There doesn't seem to be any job security for high performance - - just layoffs to cut costs.
good,"A very good company to work, fast pace to meet various deadlines. Very stressful environment, with long shift work hours. The opportunity for growth is unlimited."
good,"Good, stable company to work for although the glass ceiling significantly impacted women moving up the corporate ladder."
good,"Like anyone else in the defense industry, BDS is very by the rules, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because when you leave work at the end of the day, you leave work at the end of the day, you aren't supposed to bring things with you or work when you aren't officially clocked in, and you always get paid on time and for exactly the number of hours you worked, and you never really get assigned things that aren't in your job description (because they're not officially authorized) unless you really have nothing else to do, and you almost never have to work overtime, but if you do, you will be paid overtime rate. You start early in the morning, are off work by 2:30 or 3:30, and drive to the beach for the rest of the afternoon and all the stuff you were working on is locked away in some drawer somewhere back in the office building and won't be in front of your eyes again until 6:30 or 7:30 tomorrow morning. It's a bad thing though because the regulations and paperwork requirements are often outright obnoxious. Also, like anyone else in the defense industry, you get to work on or learn about some cool stuff: missile systems, sensory to detect submarines, safety systems and aerodynamic control systems, countermeasures, antisubmarine warfare, machine guns, advanced materials, afterburners and readying aircraft for launch in 15 minutes are all common subjects for discussion. On the other hand (and I suspect this is true at all big defense contractors) the culture can be a bit toxic, although John Deere was worse, and sometimes people really are out to get"
good,"The workplace environment is generally congenial.  The work is stressful but you generally can find the resources you need, and help as long you are seeking co-workers/peers. Management spends most of their time in meetings and are frequently unavailable.  Management, especially 2nd line and above, are considered a separate class."
good,"Boeing had excellent benefits and a lot of very good people. However, it is a very large company and the opportunities for advancement were not apparent in many cases."
good,Boeing is an excellent company to work for.  They provide excellent employee benefits and opportunities for advancement in your career.  If you can work there long enough to build up your longevity you will possibly avoid the frequent layoffs that happen there.
good,Boeing is a good place to work with great benefits.  Very competitive environment with multiple opportunities to expand your experience. Boeing offers opportunities to continue your education.
good,"Stimulating work environment, with accessible tools and resources to perform one's job.  Teaming attitude to make sure deadlines are met and expectation are exceeded.  Work schedules are negotiable to make sure a work-life balance is maintained."
good,Most of the people at Boeing were as good as you'll find.  The project that I worked on was a bit disorganized but that might not have been Boeing's fault. I think that working there under a different project might have been great.: Due to the disorganized nature of the project that I was on it would be hard to accurately describe a typical anything there since I don't think that what was done there is typical of Boeing. I'd like to reserve judgement until I worked there under a better management team. Boeing did seem to be a good company with good values.
good,"Fun and friendly environment coworkers are very helpful some days are fast paced work to get the job done other than that its a nice company to worked. Also they have to do more about safety and cleaning up their area of work for people to safe to work in their respective areas,"
good,"Boeing was nice place to work.  Hours worked were flexible during each pay pay period. They had great time off policy; paid vacation, sick, and holiday pay."
good,"Every Organization is different and the leadership dictates the day to day benefits of the job.  There are far too many layers of management, and advancement is extremely difficult."
good,I reviewed the MRB processes and tutored the quality inspectors in the the proper way to document defects on aircraft. I also reviewed root cause and corrective actions in an effort to prevent issues from happening to the aircraft in the futurs using Lean Six Sigma methodoliges.
good,As an inspector you are sometimes rushed to get work done. More focus needs to be put on making sure employees have the tools to do a good job. The management needs more involvement with people.
good,"Working with Boeing is a great experience. They have their challenges like any other work place. They encourage employees to learn and have some great programs to help further your career.  Boeing offers good benefits, however they are different from union and non-union facilities. If you have the chance to work with Boeing I would say it is a great opportunity."
good,"work day consisted of meetings and team management"
good,A good place to work if you can be productive and work as part of a consistent team or individually as required. You must be a serious contributor with Boeing and enjoy working in a large warehouse format
good,Boeing is a large company with many different opportunities.  They promote a great work life balance. They provide a great benefits for their employees.
good,"Huntington Beach location takes on a campus like feeling.  Friendly people, majority of management good to work with.  Diverse campus, motto ""People First"".  "
good,"Boeing was an excellent company to work for. Both salary and benefits were very competitive, and the work/life balance was second to none. Would recommend."
good,"This company is fast paced and can be demanding at times. They have multiple opportunities available for you to develop, enhance, and even change your career path. Management style is dependent on your manager and the work group within. Culture varies throughout the company."
good,Managements failure to properly staff a program has cost the company not only financially but also experience.  Many employees are quitting to find a better work/life balance.
good,"Boeing was a good company to work for. It has the potential to be a great company to work for, but for the lack of follow through on its initiatives, superior management training, accountability of those in charge, and clear paths for advancement."
good,"The culture at the Boeing Company is Engineering dominant, followed my Hourly workers, lots of change at times, and long hours to ensure schedules are being meet."
good,"prepare wheels or brakes, open work orders clean work area. There are many training exercises that keep individuals  up to date on what's going within the company."
good,"Very conservative info security , no longer keeping up with IT and industry."
good,Boeing is a great place to work if  you want to work on complex problems. The most rewarded are the employees who actively engage their leaders and teammates and seek out the opportunity to take on challenges. Along with being a top notch performer these are the attributes of fast rising team members. These are the employees that will find them self in unique circumstances resolving problems and developing new technology while working with all levels of the company.
good,Boeing has an excellent pay and benefits package for its employees.  They have a large variety of jobs available to match up to people with many various skills and abilities.  The main negative would be long term job stability.
good,Decent place to work. Benefits are steadily being eroded. Management is hit or miss. Pay is not too bad but promotions have been frozen except for executive management.
good,Provided me with a great career and the knowledge that was acquired will benefit me in the future.  A typical day included challenges and continued growth.
good,"If you like pressure, this is the place for you. Good pay, benefits, retirement....32 yrs experience, mostly in parts support positions, manufacturing and assembly"
good,"Overall great company but still in some improvement in some area.  The company has a lot diverse project to exercise one's technical skills.  In additional, offer a lot educational opportunities to improve   one skills."
good,"The work really depends on which program you are supporting and which organization and team you are connected to.  I have had the good fortune to work in multiple programs/teams and projects over the years to develop an exceptional base of work experiences.  I have learned about software development, contracts, manufacturing, supply chain strategies, procurement systems, quality systems (AS9100, D1-9000, FAR, DAR), commercial and military aircraft, specifications, metals, composites, design tools and the list goes on.  The culture has been one of building teams across organizations and functional roles to achieve the results necessary to meet production commitments or deliver new products to our customers.  The most difficult challenge is maintaining relationships as roles, people and business constantly change and knowledge is critical to success and people have the knowledge and knowing who has it is critical.  Meeting people is the most enjoyable part of the different roles as you continue to build your career and connect with so many different team members over time and build solid relationships, which stand the test of time."
good,"The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, and satellites worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aircraft manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2015 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
good,"On a daily basis my job was challenging, my Leads new of my capabilities and also new that if there was a job that needed to be done I could do it. I enjoyed working as part of a team."
good,"I have been working at Boeing for over 8 years.  The opportunities are great, except that lately the job security is somewhat lacking due to the ever changing way that the economy and competition is."
good,"*****Managers are decent and overall the company is a good one to work for, Not really sure what else you want to know or what I'm actually going to say about my current company.********************************************************************"
good,"Change in schedule hourly, supply chain product delays.Numerous meetings that start at 6AM and continue all day. Hardest part of job is collecting earned value daily. Most people have the required technical skills but have minimal understanding of cost, schedule, meeting spec, not exceeding, delegation  of authority, span of control and how to motivate team. Most enjoyable part of job is working with all levels of employees, meeting or exceeding customer expectations, under cost and ahead of schedule. Management is abundant but leadership is lacking. The culture of the people is dependent on the type of leadership. Any reasonable schedule with qualified people and sufficient budget is achieveable but often tenure and nepotism create more problems than solutions. Being able to identify problems not symptoms and come up with team solutions will always be rewarding. Management that provides support, supports challenges up and recognizes people who think out of the box."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for but i thought that the management was very harsh and provided very little training towards your job duties.
good,At Boeing you are always looking for your next job. They hire you onto a program and when the program is nearing the end everyone bails to find a new program to work on within Boeing. It is rather crazy since they quite often loose good knowledgeable employees. But if your good at finding new programs to work on in the company then you will make a decent living.
good,Great company in 2002. Benefits and work environment eventually declined. They seemed too worried about their bottom line. My division was ran more like the military than as a business.
good,"A great company to work for and improve your skill set. A plethora of resources available for employees to utilize to provide for not only themselves but their respective family members. Constant discussion about reducing headcount can be deflating, especially when the company keeps emphasizing the importance of people. Unfortunately those two messages do not add up, but Boeing has an opportunity to lean out processes, find new means for growth, and continue expansion. I hope that growth trickles down to the employees that are boots on the ground in the process..."
good,I left McDonnell Douglas in 1988 so I have nothing to say of any relevance here. I am sure it is a completely different company than it way back then.
good,Great place to work if you value Benefits over Job Satisfaction. The managers are very non Technical and won't be able to answer any questions you have regarding your work. Great place to retire at but not to grow your career. Skills will get stale fast.
good,"When its good, Boeing is awesome. But aerospace is typically cyclical. In general, first and second level management is great. Above that, the company lacks transparency and/or clear direction."
good,"Labored, but productive depending on where you were working on the airplane."
good,Really was able to enhance my skills as a financial analyst.  Worked with some really dedicated and hard working individuals who thought me a lot. I also made some great friends.
good,"The work is fun at times. But most days are pretty dull."
good,"The Boeing Company manufactures the best products in the aviation industry.  Opportunities to advance and / or diversify are abundant, especially for Engineering disciplines."
good,"I have worked in about every area of this company and have learned from the ground up, so I am sure that I can contribute to any organization"
good,"Good place to work, but don't see a long-term job with Boeing. Need new and innovative work to compete for future contracts."
good,"Overall Boeing is a good place to work, Boeing Charleston is still in a growth stage, they have made some managerial choices that are not what one would expect of the industry and/or a company with the history it has."
good,"My typical day consisted of short meetings. Some machining and some table work, such as locating mating parts with various types of gauges. I also did physical labor, lifting up to 35 lbs. Creating stencils and engraving to ID parts."
good,Got to control all the robotics in the manufacturing plant and work along side repair technicians. Long hours on the night shift made it impossible to have a social life. Im sure Day shift is alot more fun.
good,"Procurement has insufficient processes, procedures, and tools. Constantly put in the heat and given the blame for poor performance of suppliers and deliveries. Lack of training"
good,"A typical day at wok:"
good,"A typical workday would find me developing solutions to complex issues.  I enjoy fostering relationships with my co-workers and building productive teams.   My satisfaction comes from achieving goals and meeting customers needs."
good,"It is a great place to work, great benefits, great pay, lots of overtime if you want it."
good,"TOP NOTCH intern program"
good,serious about supporting employees' decision on the further education. I've received the company stocks after completion of MS.
good,"Intake of work tickets"
good,"Boeing is a great company if you want to ensure you have decent job stability, like attending meetings, and enjoy the general work culture of most other large companies. There's a mixed bag of managers but like many large companies they are limited in how flexible they may be as company policy tends to trump all."
good,"Multiple resources that result in aircraft certification,testing and operation. Availability of training in basic aircraft production and maintenance processes. Opportunity to gain experience that allows an individual to advance through production into aircraft flight test and delivery."
good,"A good first-choice to start out your career. Long term career depends on having a ""upper-level"" management mentor."
good,"Boeing is a fast paced very interesting place to work .  Good benefits and wages ,with above average working conditions."
good,"Great experience working with the Navy, very rewarding. Sometimes it could be challenging working some of the restrictions on everyday work planning."
good,The benefits are amazing. the airport and West Jordan facilities are great locations in Utah. My management were very bad at saying what they want and what they needed. They just wanted someone to blame.
good,"I learned a lot, had a great experience.  During an economic slowdown my department was outsourced overseas.  I see jobs coming back State side, however I've moved onto better opportunities."
good,The Boeing co. is a great company to work for and has many opportunities for advancement and educational development. Many world class people work at Boeing.
good,"Good company in general; nice people to work with; flexible hours.  Reasonable job security, opportunities for additional training, company-paid post-graduate education."
good,"Coordinating efforts between revisers and delivery drivers, insuring all materials are delivered to airlines on time.  "
good,"8-12 hour workdays 7 days a week"
good,A great place to work but job security is always an issue.  Excellent benefits but the start out pay is extremely low. The work day starts early/.
good,"Boeing is a good company with a decent work/life balance. The benefits are good compared to competitors, but the work in the government sector isn't all that exciting. A majority of the employees at this company are much older and experienced leaving little room for career growth as not many of them are retiring just yet. Boeing also seems to have a problem attracting and retaining millennials."
good,"It is good place to work if you were hired before the change in wage scale. It takes forever to reach top of pay scale the way it is designed today. Steady work and good benefits. Be careful of mis guided managment, that want to weed out older employees."
good,"Great company, overall good culture.  I enjoyed my time there.  My coworkers and management team were always supportive and pushed me to advance in my career."
good,"Great company with competitive compensation and benefits. Lots of opportunity to move around and gain experience, while figuring out where you belong."
good,"I was challenged and applied my self accordingly. Great company training with a dynamic team and drive. Focused on safety, quality and scheduling. Lean concepts and a politically correct environment. Hardest job was the one you didn't learn yet. Company provided training got us ready and able for the most difficult task.Being a part of a product  that rewarded you by seeing it utilized in the military to protect and serve and also for humanitarian efforts is awesome!"
good,This company overall was fun and flexible in every way.  The management for the most part was one of the best of my experience.  I learned a lot from the get go and was given the time to learn what I needed to do the job.  All of my co-workers were like family as well as the management.  They were always there for us as much as they could be on our level.
good,"Wake up 3:00 am to be at work earlier than 5:00 am ( no tardiness tolerated ) 20 minutes crew meeting. Start the day Moving fixturing for airplanes or other needed jobs that need to be done to support assembly crews on the floor. Possibly aquire entry/exit stands from outside or on the flightline assist Crane crew in tool moving operations by moving things on the floor or controlling floor traffic."
good,Its Great Experience to work for Boeing EA team. It has a great work culture.
good,"Been with this company for over 23 years and have been able to do quite well with them as my job. Owned houses, cars, built several hotrods and now am looking forward to retiring with them in a few short years!"
good,"Job used to be good but then they decided to move people to St Louis and Charleston and either you move or you get laid off - need I say more?"
good,A typical day at work in IT UNIX integration is a daily all hands status meeting for management and project managers to monitor progress of major software releases and problem resolutions.  Then meetings with cross-organizational teams for process improvements and coordination of daily work activities.  Responding to hot production issues and troubleshooting.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with top people that keep a sense of humor.
good,Great company! Always challenging; Changing to meet the economy and Government spending restrictions; Advancement opportunities exist for much of the workforce.
good,"DOD work is too unstable.  You never know if a contract will be terminated or funded from year to year due to budgetary cuts."
good,"Prioritized work packages and modified and changes drawing as per engineers request. Learned to work as a team a brought a good attitude to the work place to improve team production and moral."
good,"Assigning task for the day to crews and making sure they had every thing they needed"
good,"normal"
good,"Productive meetings"
good,"Much of the work was repetitive and work was done with SAP software."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to go ahead and improve various processes, which was welcomed by the management."
good,"Great work experience, good work environment. Able to apply my skills, use time management, work within specific processes. There was a couple turnovers for our site manager, part of that went well, part of it didn't. The managers that left the employees to their work were great, but some micro-managed, and there was one that wanted the work done quickly, and didn't care how it got done (short cuts, skipping procedures..ect) The last manager practiced unsafe work habits, and put employees in hazardous situations. This lead to me leaving the company."
good,Will be a great workplace when it becomes more stable. I like the company but not this particular location as it's a green field location with a very inexperienced workforce.
good,"Jeppesen is in a transitional mode moving from paper to digital product line.  Those that make it through this growth process, will enjoy a great career."
good,"it is an excellent company to work for. what I have learned from my position at Boeing is a good way to be ahead of the techonolgy that apply to the program I worked for. Management are not the way a good company should conduct and encourage their engineers to be productive and creative to make an ideas to be realized. Overall is who is your manager, and if he/she are a good manager you will be in the right place, but if the manager is a bullies like a street way of thinking forget about your career and any advancement."
good,Worked as an electronic tech building and testing spinning earth sensors. layoffs where pretty regular due to lack of contracts. good pay no job security.
good,"Typical Day at Work - Receive device under test (DUT(s)) and the appropriate Acceptance Test Procedure.  Test the DUT(s) in accordance with the Acceptance Test Procedure.  Deliver DUT(s) to the next level."
good,"I started  as a temporary office worker.  In a typical day I opened up resume, did data entry, and TDD lines which gave me a good feeling.  I was there a year then went to the Micro graphics office where  we updated maintenance files; filed then on camera, duplicated film and loaded them into cartridges then shipped them to customers. Our delivery time improved by 1%.  I learned to work the cameras and duplicate film and used the loaders.  My co-workers at Boeing were in a cut-throat situation and our bosses reflected this also.  Maintenance is the  last line of defense before the airplane flies safely, they were taken over by digital and computers.  That sent me looking and I went back to clerical work for the bosses at the parts division.  I enjoyed filing, making airplane reservations and learning Access and working with Excel to make charts.  I left there and joined the Interior's Department.  That was also clerical and I finished up my ten years got my two year degree and my retirement at the same time.  I am happy overall with the results."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work,  but as all work places there is a big variety of co workers,  and in a place like Boeing co workers are being transferred all the time,  this is usually caused by individuals that are not getting along and a simple way for supervision to get rid of problems instead of solving them."
good,Very heavy work schedule and my wife will only live in Mississippi
good,Not totally impressed with Boeing in San Antonio hired on as general mechanic but later on wanted you to to perform more and more structural mechanic work which I told them when I hired in I did not do. Plus it seems they preferr contract mechanics over direct mechanics.
good,"Whether starting at 6:00AM (or earlier) or 11:00PM, one is never short of work to do at Boeing. Working with shop floor personnel, engineers, managers, attending meetings, and trips to Tully's coffee in between are all par for the course during a typical day."
good,"Start of shift is 530 am come in and log into computer monitor a sat's page for parts request from mechanics, order parts, move parts, and inventory stock on floor. Learn something new everyday all types of different programs from vipers, HMS, Gold, Kits, and Microsoft. Management would only come out once a day everyone knew what to do to get job done. Hardest part of job is the part cant control and the most enjoyable part is working in fast pace while earning good money."
good,A typical day at work is super busy and in reactive mode. I have learned to be patient with our management team. Most of my co-workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is knowing that it pays more if I worked at any other site. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction I get by helping others understand their task at hand and receiving an occasional thank you for my efforts.
good,"Typical day: one hour pre-briefing, 4 hour sim session, one hour de-briefing, then  paperwork."
good,"Good work place, info easy to find. Co-worker veary helpful . guns do need upkeep and  paintpo.ts."
good,"examines parts to ensure they are effective and free of defects; uses computing program to access job information; reads and interprets blueprints and schematics; drills, reams, countersinks holes; installs fasteners; applies sealant; disposes of hazardous materials in an approved manner; uses various hand and power tools; checks work for completeness. "
good,"Worked 37 years at Rockwell / Boeing as a test engineer/ Facility Engineer. Qualification testing /Failure Analysis for Space Shuttle components as  well as Delta rockets. Never knew what the next job assignment would be from testing cryogenic to Pneumatic to vibration to structural components, classified programs to routine maintenance."
good,Oversaw manufacturing of 787 program with a lot of hard working people learning a new build process
good,My day start at 7 am at boeing cutting cardboard and putting in recycle bin large 36 cubie meter then after driver forklift inside cleaning all the rooms all 5 large then take bins full of rubbish outside and putting in differnet large bin with the forklift all day than got to toilets and check toilets papers and hand towels papers clean sinks then check if anymore cleaning to be done before I go home at 3pm that all
good,I loved Keybank the only thing is if you're not in a sales role you have very limited possibility for advancement
good,"On the phones all day, every day doing technical support here. Had to complete so many calls per day, week, and month. Very fast paced with hardly any breaks."
good,I love airplanes and if you want to work on them then this is the place!
good,"Boeing is good company to work for. i like the hours of work. i love the over time hours , its a clean environment to work."
good,"I enjoyed it tremendously,"
good,"My typical day at Boeing, was working in the sand blasting both, to steam cleaning of parts for rockets, to assiting in getting parts ready for painting. What I learned was the many different process for these jobs. I enjoyed working with the many different managers and co - workers that I had."
good,Very structured work day.Learned to do drafting. Great management.Co-workers were great help.Hardest part of the job was leaving.
good,"Typical day at work would entail interesting research programs and good co-workers. I've learned from over 20 years in this industry the importance of working together with my co-workers and a relative independence in the research efforts I have worked on (i.e., being able to pursue extenal contracts without alot of red tape)."
good,The safety culture within Boeing delivered the 737 MAX disasters.  Too much influence by company lawyers enabled the safety community to become excessively overbearing on daily operations.
good,Work hard and will go far with this company. In the beginning the pay is not that great but in time it will pay off. Benefits are among the best. Once in many doors will open to many different job opportunity.
good,Boeing treated me well. They give you every opportunity to succeed. If you are a laborer you can only go so far unless you further your education. I imagine it is a great place to work for engineers.
good,Boeing is a great place to work. Its a great place to build experience with awesome benefits. I like the education benefits especially because it allows you to pursue a degree in engineering and business.
good,"I've been pretty happy with my time at Boeing. I've worked diligently and been compensated accordingly. My biggest peeve with the company right now is the the tiered cost of insurance. The lower tier employees get ""free"" insurance while the two other tiers are now required to pick up the additional cost. For this past year that meant my entire ""pay raise"" went to cover my increase in medical insurance."
good,I feel that my past professional and educational background will allow myself to come into a company and make a positive contribution in a short amount of time.
good,"good benefits, decent wages, I made my work day fun and enjoyed the people around me while being productive."
good,The company is a great company to work for. The benefits provided are wonderful. The paid tuitions are my favorite. It can be alot of hours most of the time but the compensation is fair.
good,Underpaid for core engineering deciplenes where as IT and software guys are paid high although engineering challenges are high compared to softwares guys..
good,"Great opportunities and a diverse list of jobs. The Boeing company has many contractors, employees, and sub-companies for a great experience. all around great job."
good,Company offers growth opportunities and has an excellent continuous learning component.  New HR Business model promises to enhance more strategic interaction of HR with business.
good,Working for Boeing provides an opportunity to work different jobs while staying at one company.  Downside...internal employees have to apply like an external candidate.
good,"Good Company, good people and interesting work."
good,"Boeing is a very strong and great company, but the production area is very aviation based, and works best for pilots, something I am not.  Our source is what we get our data from, and sometimes is hard to understand, but my enduring years there, have learned alot.  I am ready for a more people-oriented job, and looking to be on a regular day to day basis with clients.  Accepted to move to sales/marketing, and was quite excited, however; recent events have caused a slowdown in hire."
good,Boeing can be an exciting place to go every day if you are one who likes to learn and grow in your career. If you have these two qualities this company will be an enjoyable place to work as it was for me!
good,"Being an Executive Office Administrator at Boeing gave me the opportunity to work in many different organizations and learn a lot about  leading groups, facilitating meetings, logistics, event planning. One of the best benefits was paid education. The Learning Together Program allowed me the opportunity to attend college with no student loan fees at graduation."
good,"Great salary and benefits. You can have a very fulfilling and comfortable career with time for family life at Boeing.  To succeed, it requires thinking through your current assignment and watching for future opportunities and not just going with the flow."
good,"The company is great to work for as a whole, but in our plant it seems very chaotic at times. Some manager need to learn how to talk to people and some should not be managers at all. Though the people on the floor and the engineers are great to work with."
good,"This company is a great foundation for developing people, processes, and teams.   "
good,It's union shop and people new to boeing will be laid off  first during cutbacks. Overall it's a good company to work for. A good opportunity to further your education.
good,Company was a very interesting place to work. Unfortunately head office decided it was in their best interest to close to the Toronto location and rely on the Winnipeg location.
good,"Boeing is a company that offers a competitive compensation package for a company that offers a truly incredible work-life balance. However, in the Seattle area, the aerospace/defense simply doesn't pay quite as competitively as other tech companies. Overall, the pay is reasonable for what is expected."
good,Be happy and excited and honest. Answer the questions to the best of your ability and skills. Ask questions at the end and smile. Shake everyone’s hand. Prep for the interview!!
good,Boeing is still one of the better places to work although they are reducing some of the benefits to be more in line with the rest of the industry.  Depending on what department you are in regulates the promotion and growth potential.  In certain departments work is cyclical and therefore you can be very bored for a long time before the work pores in.  Still an old boys club culture exists but it is getting better.  Great Resource groups.
good,"Worked in defense. The pay is great and you will travel to support the customer. Work can often be boring and it seems like the position would fit someone who is closer to retirement. Position is somewhat specialized so it is harder to achieve career advancement but that isn't a fault of the company, just the nature of the job."
good,"I no longer work at Boeing so I don't feel the need to review and share the details of a typical day at work, workplace culture, what I learned, management, etc."
good,I had so many opportunities to work outside the scope of my position.  I supported various engineering week things most importantly the STEM engineering opportunity to share with young girls.
good,I'd work there again. The problem with Boeing is the boom/bust cycle that causes fear and uncertainty about job security. Smart people with good hearts.
good,"Over all a rewarding experience"
good,"Great environment to work.  Everyone is very nice and professional."
good,"great company with great benefits. From personal experience, management was very supportive and very open to new ideas.  The work schedule was very flexible as well."
good,Productive and important to be able to work with all cultures and customers. DCMA and Management to protect all who use our products to be safe.I have been both a contracter and direct employee and have over 20 years with Boeing.14 years as a direct employee.I started as a sheet metal mechanic and moved to Quality over 8 years.l have 3 years as a production.    Coordinator.I loved my Quality inspection in San Antonio l worked KC 135 and C 17 as both sheet metal mechanic and QA. I worked the KC 10 thrust control program and LAlR COM on.  C17.I took the job in 2010 on 787s and have been here since.
good,"My experience at Boeing was good. The pay was good. The benefits (401k, overtime, shift differential, health care) were outstanding. If these things remained the same with opportunities for career advancement, I might still work there. However, in the intelligence business, that was a very small part of the Boeing mission. Often, it felt like our division was somewhat of a red headed stepchild. Boeing is a production oriented company. I worked in a services oriented role. Eventually, our division was separated from “big Boeing” and combined with a company Boeing purchased to create a subsidiary. When this happened, employees lost all of the perks working for Boeing. Without those benefits, it didn’t make sense for me to continue working in such a stressful environment anymore and forced me to find work elsewhere. Also, there was little to no room for career progression."
good,"There are few other companies better than Boeing.  Opportunities are endless if you are willing to work hard and take chances.  Benefits are excellent.  The only drawback to Boeing, just like any other Aerospace company, is the ebb and flow of business and restructuring can and does lead to lay-off.  But don't be afraid... use the years you have at Boeing to fill you quiver with skills that can relate to other companies looking for highly skilled people.  While I was laid off after 15 years, I would go back in a heart-beat."
good,Work life balance is good. Tech stack not so good. Job security is good. culture is not so good. Ok Benefits. Work location is not close to center of city.
good,Boeing is a solid company and has been a great place for me to work.  I've raised a family with 7 kids on one salary in the Seattle area.  I've worked in 6 different areas and have always been blessed with a good Manager.  There is good opportunity to work at various jobs in a large number of locations and countries.
good,"Has its negatives, but still the best gig in town."
good,"I found out during my 21 plus years at Boeing, that management needs to be better trained for their jobs. Being a shop Steward I had a better insight of the relationship between myself and them. I have only hope that Boeing takes the statements of the people here and make better judgements on putting  these inexperienced  people in charge of leading . We  ( production )  will work happier , be more open to change if we knew we are being respected for what we do for the Boeing company .I loved working there and many people do. I want to thank you , Boeing for being able to have a great life style and enjoyed the benefits working there."
good,"Management all about pleasing big boeing, not supporting the people doing the grunt work. Upper management recognizes each other for progress and program achievements, not the folks on the hangar floor."
good,"I work on the F-15 Program selling sustainment and modernization updates to the United States Air Force.  These updates include AESA Radar, ADCP II flight computer and structural improvements like new wings and longerons."
good,I was given classes to take that had nothing to do with my job.  I think the manager should have more descretion on which classes he/she requires employees to take. I was given an opportunity to restart a Diversity Program which had been discontinued.
good,"Culture is one sign of a healthy work place - unfortunately, at Boeing their existing culture is their one main distraction. There is a saying about Boeing workers - they are a part of the ""Lazy B"". While this does not hold true for around 60% of the workers, there is that other percentage that takes advantage of a culture that does not promote individual accountability and they drag down the overall satisfaction of the job for the remaining 60%. It is hard to have to take up the slack for others that get paid the same as you to do a job but only barely go through the motions. It wears on you, and drags one toward the morass of apathy, which is a dangerous and destructive place to be - it causes one to lose sight of their own integrity. It is hard to work harder than others and see no real appreciation for the efforts you put forth, while those who slack on the job are rewarded simply because they have seniority. But for me, my integrity and ethics on the job outweigh the negativity around me. I get paid to do a job - and that is what I do. 8 hours plus of work for 8 hours plus of pay. That is how I survive the ingrained culture."
good,Careers are great at Boeing. Corporate culture is a large part of daily experience. Opportunities exist for advancement tied very specifically to your organizational goals.
good,"Boeing is a company that treats employees well, but the culture of taking too long to make decision cause a lot of rework, thus depreciate the value of working there."
good,Work can get really busy for awhile then you can go weeks with nothing to do.  It is easy to get pigeon holed into work you don't like if you don't communicate what you want to do.  If you don't like the group you're in you can move around and do different types of work.  It can be a really great place to work if you find the right fit with a group.  You can learn a lot but you have to have initiative to actively pursue what you want.
good,"Boeing builds quality products from  military and commercial needs, one of many goals is safety . the challenges of manufacturing with vendors and meeting customer needs."
good,Steady and interesting work as a contractor but no upward mobility. Management was good and allowed some overtime but did not demand it.  The facility was new and a good place to work.
good,Challenging experiences and a lot of learning on the job. Worked with some  very experienced people. Was never a dull day in the working environment I was a part of. For the most part the management team was decent.
good,"I worked at Boeing as a contractor 3 times and really enjoyed the work and people, not to mention the training classes available even for contractors."
good,Day consists of working to assess Risk vs rewards for projects and timelines. Schedules needed to be established. One on one meetings to maintain progress reports and alignment with business needs.
good,"Lots of thin gbc s to like with the company, however seems like middle layer (the belly fat) of the company does it's own thing and not aligned with the direction or best interest of the company."
good,"Boeing is a strong company with great benefits. On the downside, they will work you to the bone if you let them. The combative relationship between the union and corporate management leads to a tense workplace. The benefits to working there are countless, but you pay the price for it in blood and sweat."
good,Lots of technical work to be had at Boeing but the pacing was low.Great people to work with and for the more difficult part of working there was defiantly the pacing and the best thing was the people.
good,great place to work only if you are a union member.  thanks to a good union contract it is a great place to learn and advance through union/company joint programs.  the company has no interest in a good workplace culture as manufacturing and moving product is their top priority at any and all costs.
good,Trabajar desde casa es un beneficio para el empleado y la compania porque pones mas tiempo eficiente and produces mas para la compania.
good,"Good Job, great place to work. Training was available and part of the culture resulting in advancement and career development."
good,Very fast pace with little time off. Still is a good place to work. You are allowed to make mistakes and get the right assistance to help you improve. Great comradery.
good,"Enjoy what I do as far as my job, but the job culture needs alot of improvement. Employees are too focused on what others are making instead of performing their jobs and working on improving their skills to advance in the company to make the money they desire."
good,I enjoyed working my 25 years at Boeing. The Company made advancement and educational opportunities available to me in my early career. It's an awesome aerospace company.
good,you work for the union so everyone teams up together. sure people don't like that policy's change. but the only big reason I would stay is cause of the people and you get a great pay raise depending on your grade level. get a 50 cent pay raise every six months for 6 years and once you hit the 6 year mark you suddenly get capped to the highest pay in your grade level. which is between 35 to 46 dollars an hour. the longer you work the more benefits you get. plus they will pay for your college after a year of employment. and the sky is the limit about college. they let you do whatever want at school as long as you keep on working for them. I would say to any blue collar working man. work for Boeing and they will work for you.
good,"Working at Boeing was just an average day. Nothing really stood out as particularly good or bad about the company. "
good,Preparing daily work schedules for employees.  tracking completion of weekly work preformed. Also making schedule and cost target on each plane in department.
good,had a great jobs and dull jobs.  really depends on the group and the manager.  make sure to move around every 2 or 3 years and always try to move up.  never stagnate and always try to get on projects that have meaning.
good,"Get in between 7.30 am good day you leave at 4.30 pm mostly 5 pm often 5.45 pm.Constantly monitoring service desk calls that had been assigned to myself as I  worked on a remote site  I needed to  my prioritize tasks my working day ruthlessly . It was vital to have a good  working relations with customers anticipating their demands to enable myself to identify difficulties likely to impede a tasks successfully being completed.  "
good,"I've worked at Boeing both as an employee and as a contractor. There are huge differences and also each division is completely different. "
good,"Boeing is generally a good place to work.  It's biggest flaws are that it is almost exclusively focused on manufacturing and how best to sell airplanes.   Which is to be expected, but it means there's little value placed on things like engineering and technology.  They're all treated as overhead. "
good,"Great compensation."
good,Fun place to work. Always something going on.  Interesting to watch the planes built.  Great people everywhere you go.  Parking is a problem.  And cafeterias are good.
good,"too many bean counters making poor technical engineering decisions. Executive management seemed more concerned with ""I can get somebody to do your job for less money"" employee attitude. Increase bottom line by decreasing labor force and employee costs."
good,It was a great place to work! Pay and benefits were great! It was a learning experience and very enjoyable and I would go back if possible. Downfall is layoffs.
good,Boeing was a fantastic company to start my career at.  I was part of a team leading and educating management and its employees in a paradigm shift to implement quality assurance and control from the top down.
good,"The benefits are good, but the pay is not there. Long hours and short breaks. Management is good at what they do. The culture is mixed between Boeing and outside contractors, so there can be issues there sometimes. The hardest part is doing the same thing every day over and over and over and over. The best part is that the management style allows some freedom in how you do your job."
good,"I worked as a contractor in two different roles and enjoyed my time there overall. The organizational culture could use some work, but no company is perfect!"
good,It is hard to describe these days with all of the new changes taking place.  Still the best place to work in the aviation industry.  Lots of opportunities for young engineers.
good,"Boeing was a good place to work, if you are not a contract employee. Especially if you were supposed to be assigned in one place but since that position was an ""open position"" and the person who wanted the job was supposed to train me, let's just say, I didn't get trained and was put someplace else."
good,This was a place full of growth. I you put in the work you'll be recognized. Most people are there to help you but first they want to be sure you are willing to help yourself. GOOD PLACE
good,"There isn't a company like Boeing.  Always growing. Management is ever changing.  Lots of areas to move around.  Mostly fun atmosphere, depends on the group you are in."
good,Boeing is a good job if you are working in the city you want to live in.  There is some mobility within the company.  The company changes rapidly and reorganizes constantly.
good,Good place to work especially when working from home. Traveled a lot to different locations throughout the country. Work wasn't boring. Always learned something new that was beneficial to project.
good,"the culture is changing and the work environment is highly competitive "
good,"Boeing has given me great knowledge in how to lead people and make great decisions for the companies needs. I have no formal education but, Boeing has seen past formal education and put there trust into employees experience and that is why we are so good at what we do. It is a great company."
good,Newcomers are always at the bottom of the performance and compensation chain regardless of performance. This excuse can only go so long before you demoralize high potential employees. Need more accountability on more experienced engineers with demotion and pay cut discussion.
good,"work responsibilities change frequently.  Jobs are not secured, especially, when you are at a high level. There are too many layers of managers and too much bureaucracy."
good,"Great culture with innovation and talent! The CEO and EXCO have done an amazing job of placing Boeing at the forefront of the global aerospace, military, and technology sectors."
good,I enjoyed my time at Boeing. Most of the people were great to work with and were longer term employees which says a lot of good things about the company.
good,Good company worked there for 30 yrs enjoyed the culture.  The salary and benefits were excellent. Enjoyed my position in a leadership roleand mentoring others.
good,Decent first job. Lacked excitement and interesting work. Culture was dull. Pay was well and PTO was easy to use. Management was usually not around. Spent hours at the desk
good,Opportunity to gain professional experience and learn a lot more beyond college degree. Great place to grow leadership and technical skills. Available career opportunities
good,Enjoyed interacting with different agencies and customer. Also being a part of history making advances.
good,"My work week was 6 days per week, 10 to 12 hours per day.  Situational awareness was very important, as was multi tasking and adaptability.  I worked with some very intelligent, hardworking people and cultivated life long relationships with them.  It was very high stress at times and quite frustrating at time."
good,Great place to work with amazing benefits.  Numerous opportunities to transfer to different jobs and or locations.  Current focus is on cost cutting and international locations.
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work. You just have to be ready for the stress that's all. The market has change and so has the company change as well."
good,Great place to understand and work with supply chain  and manufacturing related data. Complex  and challenging data environment.  Things can move slow at times.
good,Boeing treated great. Lots of training and if work was slow they allow us to take classes to improve us. they always gave us update on our performance and gave us the best equipment to do our job
good,Learned what to do in emergency situations. Learned about product prevention. CPR and First Aid certifications as well as AED training. Gun range practice.
good,"Boeing is a great place to work as an engineer.  In Finance our roles very limited to the organization structure.  This company is a huge global company that did an amazing job at making world class aerospace products.  But Boeing is really 2 companies- one commercial airplane company and one military company.  The One Boeing approach seemed to be a good company direction but it is a company that works in silos down to each department and site level.  I would highly recommend working for Boeing.  The products, history and people are second to none.  The inner-dynamics of the corporate culture made it frustrating at times- but as stated this is a major global company.  I learned a lot in my time with the company- I gained insight into Space, Commercial, Defense and Research & Development projects.  I took great pride in supporting a great company- the disappointing side is a corporate reality- doing business in Southern California is tough and it makes more financial sense to make products in low cost states."
good,"Temp employees are disposable at Boeing, you are nothing more than an employee number to the company. I really enjoyed what I learned there and would have loved to remain with the company."
good,"Total compensation tends to be good. 401(k) matching is one of the best in the industry. Good healthcare coverage. Base salary on the lower end of the market. Work-life balance is good too, depending on the group. Change is slow and advancement is hard to find. Overall, a solid place to work but can't compete (in compensation) with other larger companies."
good,Work was very diverse. Teams were highly integrated. Many different programs always in work; there is a lot of horizontal mobility. Company culture is good.
good,"Great place to work and grow.  Due to its complexity (# of employees and retirees, levels of management, global reach, competitive business environment, etc), you'll be challenged on a daily basis and need to possess strong collaboration, work ethic, and relationship management skills."
good,"I supported over 300 management and their direct reports with any of their needs such as travel, memos, emailing, set up and stock conference rooms, created and distributed reports for the Airplane Interiors Department. I learned to be quick on my feet and be able to organize my work day - prioritize. The culture was intense and fast paced with deadlines constantly changing.  I kept in close contact with my supervisor on how she wanted the department ran.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with several different cultures and ideas from the managers. The most enjoyable was taking some down time with the group doing team building exercises outside of the office."
good,Workplace culture was typical of aerospace environment.  Enjoyed bringing value to the organization and being part of the team.  Worked on the 767 Airframe Engineering and Tanker teams.
good,"Good pay and benefits. But the Boeing company, just like all large corporations, don't really care for their employees. It's about the bottom line and risk management. McDonnell Douglas (MDC) on the other hand was way better to work for. Totally miss my time the MDC"
good,Fantastic work environment. This was my first job out of college and I was in a basic project management role. Success and performance within my role provided me an opportunity to advance rather quickly which allowed me to see various parts of the business. Overall I would highly recommend Boeing as an employer.
good,"Good--Work life balance, culture, 1st line managers, co-workers"
good,My work assignment was  to analyze the Patient Treatment Area of the Combat-Search and Rescue vehicle.   I worked principally on the Environmental Control System which kept the temperature inside the CH-47 at reasonable temperatures.
good,"I would love to transfer within the company if I could, but the type of work I am doing at my site (OKC) doesn't excite me a whole lot and the pay isn't the greatest. I feel like this site has limited career growth potential and as a young engineer, I do not want to be held back in any regard."
good,Boeing is a very good place to work but it would be better if the management would say what they mean and mean what they say. There is a lot of talk about safety but some managers are willing to overlook some safety issues in order to obtain production rates. I am personally willing to sacrifice production for safety to a point. I say this with the utmost respect.
good,Good company with great benefits and fun to build products. always something to do and the shifts are pretty good as well. Support is always there and no pressure at all.
good,"Good place to work, salary, and benefits.  Airplane production production rates can go up and down.  Employee relocation within program and teams makes one need to be flexible."
good,"Enjoyed the challenge of new commercial program launch,                                                         military programs were kind of boring."
good,"Think Dilbert and you're most of the way there.  Lots of cubes, professionalism, time-wasting meetings, good job security, and management that does managerial things without collaborating with they direct reports."
good,"Boeing has very interesting work and challenges, however management has changed over the years from employee centered to profit only centered. Excellent place to move into many different procurement packages.  Boeing is moving employees out of state without moving packages to lower salary cost centers.  This has caused low morale in some divisions at Boeing."
good,"Stable job, good work life balance, sometimes very long hours. Great health benefits, 401, employer contribution matching program. Passionate workforce."
good,"Managers are required to work overtime but are not compensated for sad overtime. The average manager work 50 - 60 hours per week. the average rate of pay is between $95,000 - $120,000 per year. This averages out to $37.50 per hour. The hourly employees you supervise make more money with less stress; equal mental effort and responsibility and liability"
good,"The hardest of the job was meeting the matrix for customer satisfaction.  being on the phone %100 of the time with a high call volume puts a demand on you to feel as you can't make a mistake,"
good,Good place to work but the managers aren't very good. They don't care about their workers or their work/life balance. guess I need to fill up 150 to be done with this.
good,"Much of my work involved both internal Tooling and Intra-Organizational (Tool Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Engineering, Tool Operations,Tool Construction), coordinating designs both internal (Personal Designs) and external of the company through Moscow Design Center and India Design Center.  I also had to organize and track Fabrication of designs both internal and external to the Company within the Puget Sound Region.  I experienced the use of many systems through a major growth time in the Boeing Company.  We went from Drawing Tables and Steel Desks to Cubicles and Computers on every desk.  Much of that time I was fortunate to be a Subject Matter Expert for Migration from CATIA V4 to CATIA V5 working with Moscow Boeing Design Center and India Boeing Design Center."
good,Good Career if willing to leave California. Hard to advance in the Southern California area. Retention of young professionals a stuggle due to human resources.
good,"Overall Boeing has been a great place to work. Yes, it is not perfect and they are trying to be more competitive and reduce cost which has driven a lot of change. But, they need to change if they want to stay in the phone book."
good,"For nearly 100 years, Boeing has been innovating to meet the needs of an ever-changing, fast-paced, worldwide environment. Our understanding of how to best connect and support people, businesses, and communities has been paramount to our ability to operate and create value in, and for, almost every region of the world."
good,A Great place to work as a Quality Assurance Inspector. worked a typical 8 hour day work with some required designated overtime. Management could have been better at managing workload to minimize designated daily overtime. Only hard part of job was working daily designated overtime. most enjoyable part was working with very minimum supervisory direction.
good,Productive and management doesn't micro manage your work. Benefits are excellent and you can move around the company if you're willing to relocate. It does seem like layoffs are constantly taking place.
good,"Working with customers on the manufacturing floor."
good,"Great benefits!  Work tends to become somewhat repetitive, with the usual red-tape and bureaucratic silliness you expect from a large organization."
good,"overall good company great benefits and pay, however be prepared to work second shift for a long time or be moved around a lot. management is very disconnected from what is going on"
good,"I am a Certification Plan Owner at Boeing in 787 electrical sub-system, had been working for a lot of projects that required certified, also had been worked in Avionics system as well."
good,Productive and fun place to work with multiple culture organizations and 24/7 gym w/ instructer at work place for before/after work or lunchtime workout.
good,"It is difficult to shake the feeling that you are a disposable asset. Otherwise it is a great opportunity. Advancement is difficult and while I perform the necessary tasks, never really feel quite like the environment is a good fit."
good,Enjoyed my time here.  Was not extremely happy with the per diem offered as the cost of living is high in the area.  Overall nice place to work with good management.
good,"good place to start your career, willing to train, they prefer people with  4 year degrees, they are downsizing currently. Benefits are excellent, retirement is ok"
good,"Overall, Boeing is a great company to work for. Unfortunately, during my time there I struggled with career advancement. I decoded to take a position elsewhere to learn new skills and earn a higher salary."
good,"I was a contractor at Boeing and enjoyed the work and office environment very much. The management was good and the office was clean, nice and if you needed anything it was provided. When you are hired you do the job that you were hired for, there is not surprises and unexpected jobs sprung upon you. The training is there for you to succeed at you job and there is room for advancement of direct employees."
good,"It was a good place to work, The management was supportive and the work was good. Unfortunately it was a short contract. I would eagerly go do this contract again. I can encourage anyone to pursue this contact if they like working in a computer program environment."
good,Enjoyed my time at Boeing doing a job I was very good at. Just the manager and the personal problems he had were making my job harder and shouldn't have to work for a person like that.
good,I enjoyed working for Boeing because it was a very diverse work environment. It was a very fast paced job that taught me a lot about aviation maintenance.  I enjoyed working with fellow employees and customers. Management was very down to earth and worked very well with the lower employees. I think the hardest part of the job was rushing our work to meet unrealistic goals of production.
good,"Providing a borderline salary comparing to German economy, personal qualification and job performance. Very difficult to grow, a perfect model of a US company with a huge structure.  Definitely promotions or retribution not based on performance."
good,I actually love working for Boeing however I just got notified I'm going to be laid off next year if I don't find another job in the company because they are moving my organization to Mesa. The pay isn't as great as other companies but the health benefits are awesome and totally worth it. Also they pay a commuter incentive on $60 a month so I live an hour away and Boeing pays for my commute VIA vanpool which is super convenient for me.
good,"This company has some of the best benefits for its employees. However, lack of contract awarded the company has been laying off people for several years and not being able to fully recuperate."
good,"Boeing has a relaxed work environment and is fairly flexible in terms of your work schedule. It also has pretty good salary/benefits and pays overtime. Most positions do not require overtime so you can have a pretty balanced life with only 40 hrs of work per week."
good,"Aside from cutting starting hourly pay scales back and removing key people in processes critical to program success without sacrificing schedule, and when all things like attrition are at rest, this company flies straight."
good,"Great exposure working with Boeing supplier chain on on-going basis. meeting and working with all level people while visiting suppliers, learning about their products and technology producing quality parts used on all Boeing commercial platforms."
good,"Boeing offered a personable, interesting and challenging environment.  Although I was a consultant, my colleagues treated me as an employee.  I am sorry that my department is being absorbed into a Seattle ""big I.T."" group.  We provided a lot of LOCAL support for the Mesa site that I think will be missed"
good,Typical day consisted of time clock check in. Working from a by the minute measured bar chart. Not easy to advance but pretty good benefits. Only down fall is job security.
good,You will work alot of hours and ther is a lot of stress .But can make a lot of money fast if they have a new contract od they are behind on a job.lots of 10 hrs day and weekends.
good,"Changes in the past 5 years have resulted in more relentless pressure on employees. Work/Life balance gets lip service but they don't do very well with it in reality. Some of the work is exciting but a lot of it is mundane and not really worthy of a college education, even in the engineering area. Much of the work that was expected of me could be done by a competent high school grad. Benefits are very good but are slipping downhill, headed toward the average instead of being the best. The airplanes produced are still the best in the world but Airbus is catching up."
good,it is very fast pace with too many bosses telling you what to do and can get a little frustrated at times. A lot of meetings weekly and overtime to get caught up on your work when there is too many meetings.
good,"Boeing is an exciting place to work if you enjoy a vast array of people interactions and wide list of products and services to support.  The locations are plentiful (includes International) and the job types are seemingly endless, which is a good thing."
good,"I have had two engagements at Boeing and they were both very positive."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is learning different work scopes I cannot include confidential information this is a very good and positive workplace.
good,"Overall good place to work although it's changing quite a lot and becoming just another company with regard to supporting their people and making them a priority...it's become ""numbers driven""."
good,"Working for Vertol for the first 4 years of my career was a blessing. I was given support for all of the difficult tasks given and advancement at early stages, even as a Lead Supervisor. I was also given a tremendous amount of support by my coworkers and teammates. My immediate manager had problems being at work, yet his manager was GM and gave the team all the support expected."
good,"Very secure job, is not quite up to date with the times as far as advancement/some compensations. Is a good company to start at, most people stay long"
good,"Typical day is 30% status meetings, 20% impromptu meetings & overhead, and 50% productive work. I've learned tons working at Boeing. They do have a large number of highly specialized employees who can solve some of the worlds most difficult problems. Unfortunately they also have some highly specialized management who can create some of the worlds most frustrating problems. Front line managers are hit or miss, in 5 years I've had 10 front line managers, some of which I would eagerly work under again, some of which I would quit before working under again. The culture is pretty old school; there are a lot of very high level meetings that make significant changes that affect my day to day. There's very little to no transparency at points, and it's sometimes difficult to do my job without understanding where the ""ship"" is headed. That's the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is the peers. The majority of the workers at Boeing are doing it because that's what they love. That comes through, and helps the rough days seem a little better."
good,"Seriously, if you want to build planes, design planes, help people or the environment, design computer software or take photographs or paint a plane, anything you can imagine you can do within this company anywhere across the globe."
good,"I came to the Boeing newly out of college, it has been a great company providing numerous professional developments, including my Masters. The culture allows for a great work life balance!"
good,"Start the day with production meeting, check in and discuss safety goals and awareness. Continue to work space and begin reviewing engineering drawings, PCM, MED and NCLRT for inspections. Inspect and document defects, NCR's and acceptability."
good,"Great business rotation program for entry level employees. Allows broad knowledge of company, products and processes. The defense side of the company has a welcoming atmosphere where employees want to share information and want to see you succeed"
good,"Boeing really cares about your work life balance. The benefits are amazing, 401K is the best in the business. 3 weeks paid parental leave. The pay is not great though,"
good,"Boeing is  a Good Company.  It needs good Management at the top."
good,"This is a great job, but it has a shelf life. As a part of C2 division you only receive 10 vacation days, 7 sick days and a portion 401k. Other divisions within Boeing have much better benefits."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits. Slightly underpays compares to the rest of the aerospace companies but the benefits are better. Overall I very much enjoy working for The Boeing Company."
good,This is a great place to learn the aircraft inside and out. Lots of variety of work. The one downside is the large amount of overtime you are expected to work.
good,"Boeing is a good company overall however it operates in a very slow, bureaucratic fashion.  Little room for advancement.  They are making changes to remain competitive."
good,I enjoyed providing technical support to my NC Programming customers and offered the products they needed to improve the productivity. I have received many outstanding awards for my products and support from my customers.
good,"A typical work days, it very easy going, but some manager are very old school management style, the hard of this job are people that you works with are culturally different."
good,"Good place to work at, just advancement is very slim. I have learned a lot with different systems, just looking for growth in my career progression. Boeing is a great stepping stone to catapult your career."
good,"Too many employee layoffs. "
good,"Decent company to work for with lots of opportunity to grow. However, they are not competitive with their pay. Great benefits, tuition reimbursement, work/life balance is decent."
good,Working here increased my knowledge of the working world.  I had recently graduated from college and took this job based on a recommendation from a friend.  The benefits and the people were great.
good,"A great place to work.  Very good pay and benefits.  Often stressful to meet deadlines for delivering aircraft on schedule.  The hardest part of the job is the fluctuating priorities.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working hard with excellent people that work together to achieve tasks.  I learned how to be very organized in a chaotic, high priority environment."
good,"19+ years with Boeing.  Good benefits but business decisions at all levels are questionable.  Very talented engineers and design folks.  My experience has been a constant churn of managers, many of whom are too inexperienced or unqualified to guide experienced teams of engineers.   also, way too much bureaucracy makes the workflow unnecessarily complicated."
good,Compensation and Benefits is great. Its the fact that getting laid off is always on your radar. I worked there for 14 years and in 14 years I went through 9 layoffs. On the 9th one they laid off the whole division.
good,"The people are great and they do care about their work they perform and support and encourage each other.  It is a great place to learn about which ever business focus you want to immerse yourself in for a year or many years.  The diversity of positions offers many opportunities to grow your knowledge and build a personal network across many businesses.  The hardest part of working at this company is leadership continues to repeat the same approach every so many years without using any lessons learned from prior initiatives.  With constant changes, you may feel like you are standing on shifting sand and need to adapt to whatever is next initiative.  Since leadership moves on without ever finishing the prior initiative.  The most enjoyable aspect is the people and the diversity of experiences and being open to having conversations and focusing on making a difference each day."
good,"I loved working for Boeing Commercial Airlines, but Oklahoma City Operations management has a lot to be desired. Work as spotty in our department and management played favorites."
good,"When I first started with the company everything was great. The only issue I have is major issues are not addressed and are usually swept under the rug. I have also experienced a hold in job advancement because Boeing wants to remain ""competitive"". Loyalty is not honored much anymore. They need to develop a plan that will keep their employees motivated."
good,Tasks throughout the day were varied depending on the projects I was put on. Huge hangars and underground walkways that connect each area. I was able to get the opportunity to see how planes are assembled from start to finish which was a unique experience. The sheer volume of aircraft being manufactured is worthy of awe.
good,Work for over 10years at Boeing.  Great people and good job.  Good benefits.  Nice culture of working professionals.  Started out as a liaison mrb engineer solving non conformity in the manufacturing environment.  Then switch to payloads design engineer the last 4 years or so.  I do enjoy both positions at Boeing.
good,"Productive and busy at work, but the fun and job security were lost because of too many changes in company's politics and the multible  diffrent decisions made by the Boeing company over the past 20 years"
good,"Other than management becoming more robotic in the sense that they don't care about their employees like they used to, Boeing is a great to work. Great pay, great benefits, and there's always the opportunity to learn a new trade through the Joint Programs."
good,"Mon premier contrat militaire m'a apporté, au-delà d’une formation militaire et aéronautique de deux ans, trois années d'expérience sur Boeing C135FR et KC135RG (GATM). En tant que sergent mécanicien dans l’armée de l’air, j’ai pu développer et parfaire mes compétences techniques en base et en ligne. Aujourd’hui, je suis en capacité d'intervenir sur la mise en œuvre, l'entretien et   la maintenance sur la cellule et les équipements d'un aéronef. 	"
good,Boeing was a great company to work for and takes care of their employees in the feild of compensation and benefits. One thing I would i would change is the frequency of company wide lay offs.
good,Overall good company to work for with good benefit package and nice team members.  The work is generally interesting and the employees have a real sense of mission in supplying the tools required to defend our country.
good,Always expected to do more with less.  Cutting down workforce.  High cost and schedule pressures.  Fun projects to work on. Not that many opportunities for new positions.
good,Interesting and challenging assignment working with bright and hard driving senior managers.  Enjoyed the autonomy and creative solutions we were able to develop within our business unit.  Did not enjoy the bureaucracy as we interfaced with corporate.
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for. In my position I am afforded the luxury of being allowed to flex my time, which works out great if you have small children in school or daycare."
good,"Boeing is a pretty good place to work.  It is a massive company so you can get lost in it, but it also does have great opportunities for growth.  Salary is ok but the benefits are second to none.  Also it fall victim to the big company bureaucracy and lacks innovation.  That being said I like working at Boeing."
good,"Boeing is a great place to advance your career, paid schooling and medical insurance. Teaches you how to work  as a team and staying on deadlines. Allows you to lean safety, handle chemicals ( Hazmat)  and all kinds of tools."
good,Overall Boeing is an excellent company with many different opportunities to excel in.  It often time comes down to the person and their goals within their career as to whether or not they enjoy their time with Boeing.  I have certainly enjoyed my time and plan on continuing my time with them.
good,Work is not very technical. Really laid back. Management can be something else at times. Would look elsewhere if you are looking for EE work. Benefits are pretty good too.
good,"Provides opportunities of growth and development with management support."
good,"Enjoyed working here but changes are needed to keep young talent."
good,"Boeing is a strong company with a century long brand, a variety of aerospace products and a global presence. The company has many programs to help people advance in their careers in either technical or management tracks and it is committed to connecting the world, helping to explore space and inspiring people."
good,"For the money that they pay, this is a very easy job to do.  With the training they give you, and the teammates around you, the work is clean, simple, and the workers are generally compensated well for their time.  "
good,"Great place to work , good people. Boeing is one of the best places I have ever worked for. The benefits were outstanding and the tolerance for understanding is excellent. Training department has room for improvement but overall the place is the best."
good,"My position is mostly doing work using a desktopPC. Meetings are conducted 2x a week, virtual and actual. Management is mixed political and average. Co-workers are mostly highly motivated and helpful."
good,The Boeing Company is a fantastic place to work. The employees work hard to make it the best aerospace company in the world. The most enjoyable part of my job is I get to help put airplanes in the sky and be apart of something I've always dreamed and visioned about.
good,Typical environment for a very large company. Things can be crazy with disorganization in one group buy quite a bit more organized in another. It is a self contained city. You can do many different jobs.
good,Boeing is a fun place to work. Its nice and interesting to see the planes you have build and the history you are making. Cons are the temp position and the chance of getting hired on seem slim to none. Management is fairly decent but could be better.
good,Job was ok. The first 30 years were great.  Gave me the opportunity to sharpen my skills. Built important hardware to secure the Nations Global Safety.
good,"friendly work environment"
good,"The people I worked with were excellent. As a Avionics Field Service Representative, I made 5 deployments on board USN Aircraft Carriers in 10 years. Working 12 hours on and 12 hours off for 6 months at a time."
good,Charleston has much to offer. Boeing is the center of the work force with many good paying jobs that are stable. Plenty of water to boat in and night life is great.
good,"Need to fall within a ""click"" to survive. I've worked there off and on for 9 years in various positions in engineering. Some groups are good while others protect each other."
good,"-  fast paced changing finance organization"
good,Boeing SC would be an awesome place to work if standardized processes were implemented site wide to prevent reoccurring issues which potentially effect profitability.
good,"I WAS ENCOURAGED TO THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND DEVELOP NEW APPROACHED AND DESIGNS FOR OLD PROBLEMS."
good,"Boeing is a Northwest landmark and many families either have worked, or know someone who has worked at Boeing over the years.  Since the merger in the mid-90's things have changed and it isn't as employee oriented as it used to be; some might argue that it is for the better - others not.  I have had a good career at Boeing for 25 years and had lots of different roles.  Boeing has had a great learning program and pay for additional college education. "
good,"Starting to miss the old VSI days"
good,"The day typically starts with a stand up meeting reviewing safety issues and new directives and policies if there are any, work that has to be accomplish such as Priority one and / or AOG's that has to be given priority, you learn something new from time to time which makes your work a bit challenging. While I can work as individual, I also work well in a team setting."
good,"Requires long work hours"
good,Great place to work if you're looking for stability and work life balance.  Level of stress depends on role you are in and program you are on.
good,"Learn something new everyday and expect change all the time."
good,"My typical daily tasks are screening all the new applicants that are selected by recruiters. I review resumes, Boeing profiles, and determine if the applicant is qualified based on the information they provided. I have a great team who work hard to meet deadlines and TAT."
good,"I love working here but there is not any opportunity for advancement from the position that I am in now and the pay is not competitive compared to other places you could work doing the same job. You do get free lunch, free gym, and benefits."
good,"It is a great company to work for. In order to move up, it is not necessarily based on talent, but more networking and taking on two or three times the work with the same pay. Change is not dynamic or quick but does happen over time. Great people to work for, but management often doesn't see the potential they have or where to apply it appropriately."
good,"Management likes to micro manage and overreact to challenges, pay and benefits are well above average, the job culture could be better, despite the occurrences of layoffs long term employment is possible."
good,"Work days very steady, would have liked more of a challenge. Co-workers were great, some managers were a pleasure to work for and some weren't. Hardest part of the job was keeping busy all day. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people and perks that Boeing provided for their employees."
good,i enjoyed being placed with older crew since they saw me hungry to learn and move production forward so they wouldn't hesitate to show me the tricks of the trade and also following the work planning to be able to work in any environment
good,"Was a great company to work for but has since downsized in in Texas and most the work is at the main plant in washington. :("
good,"There are many different areas to gain experience and skills through job placement.  Several managers and mentors recommend that you change positions every 3-4 years in order to gain a broad array of skills.  In fact, Boeing has a job rotation program that helps facilitate job transitions."
good,"We built the International Space Station, installed flight elements on the Space Shuttle, and trained the astronauts how to accomplish their tasks in space.  All I can say is : ""WOW! What an awesome job!""  I miss greatly being a part of history!"
good,"Boeing is a great place to work, You get to meet all types of people, an turn, allow you to be a well rounded person. Work was physical, mental and enjoyable. I grew up with this company, i became a man, husband and father. Management, co-workers, is people, you get the good with the bad, The hard part of the job is was both physical and mental. The enjoyable part, I know my job, that makes it easy, and I love people."
good,"Great aerospace products, fun job, great diversity of people, wonderful hours with day and night shifts, carpool enabling, easy to drive to."
good,Great place to work.Plenty of overtime.Good medical benefits.Air condition in most of the plant and very good parking.
good,"Boeing is a very large, slow moving company but there are plenty of opportunities for growth and career advancement for those willing to work for it."
good,"The company now has been sold off to various other aerospace companies. While it existed, the employees were treated to a ham or turkey for the winter holidays. The benefits were comparable to most other companies. The company was based mainly in the Southern California area and had various divisions. Among them were a division which built satellites for the military and NASA, a division which built radar systems for the military, and one did optical research using lasers."
good,Planning and executing high level management briefings including teambuilding activities. Event planning and execution.
good,"Many of the employees have been working there for 20+ years, so job security is really good. The pay is not that good, but it would probably be considered average for an aerospace company. Once you become a senior manager and above, you really start making a lot of money. There are a lot of levels of management and you can't even count how many levels you are away from the CEO. Also there is almost no visibility for a starting level employee to senior management. There is room to move around as it is a massive size company."
good,I enjoyed the work I did and the people and groups I helped. I'm in the learning together program. Always an opportunity to learn something new.
good,I learned how to spray the airplane parts for the military. They had to be sprayed a certain way. It took me a minute but once I got it. I was real good at it.when I first started my co workers helped a lot. They were fun to work and be around.
good,Boeing will take you where ever you want to go...slowly. And as long as you go where and when they tell you to. A good company with a large number of people who need to go.
good,"The benefits are still the best in town however they are slowly chipping away."
good,"as with all big companies, management can be political. Co-workers are mostly hard working professionals. But, you will run into the occasional slacker. The best part is being treated somewhat fairly and the company does follow its own procedures in place. It is a structured environment which I like because you know where you stand at all times."
good,"Many job opportunities are available within the company at local and different sites.  Most projects are involve interesting products and provide good work.  However, due to a workforce that is overbalanced towards the senior side, promotions are nearly impossible to come by."
good,Team Macon has a family type atmosphere.  Every one helps each other and very friendly.
good,"My day typically involves the review of Subcontractor proposals from a cost perspective.  I review and make recommendations of various cost elements drivivng the proposal bottom line.   The review typically includes a review of the proposed bill of material, the labor hours, the rates used to price the proposal, other direct costs and profit."
good,"There was a lot of confusion. The support of the new engineer was almost nil. I was able to work on just about all of the Planes that Boeing built. "
good,Not challenging enough and nowhere to advance. The management staff was very aloof and distant from the direction of the group.  Many people really didn't know what they were doing there to begin with.
good,Blessed to work for a company as prestigious as Boeing.  Certain positions can be harmful to your health and family life.
good,"I like working for Boeing. My position at Boeing is engineering focused, which is what I enjoy. I have worked on some pretty unique technologies, some of which you will not find in other companies."
good,Provided a lot of learning and advancement opportunities.
good,"Good Benefits but not the best in the industry"
good,"If you are young, just out of college with a technical degree (engineering, science, IT, etc.)  Boeing is a good place to start.  Be prepared to move to other parts of the US for maximum opportunities however."
good,Assist and assign multiple technicians job tasks daily.  Help mentor and teach younger A&P mechanics is rewarding.  The core management group is still young and they are learning as well.  I have watched the changes from day 1 till the present take place and witnessed the progression.  I get along well with most co-workers and learn from their knowledge and past experiences.   The hardest part of my job is knowing where to find all required information to perform a job.  Which is why I help mentor younger techs on the ways to navigate through complex programs to gather required information.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I do the final lead walk prior to launching the jet for customer delivery.  I come in stamp the paperwork after I am satisfied the jet is airworthy.
good,Lot of cutting edge technology and very cool end product.  Lost of opportunities throughout the united states.
good,It is excellent organization to work. It has nice work environment and culture.
good,"I worked for Boeing for 18 years. From the day of my hiring I always had an opportunity to advance career goals towards more responsibility and higher pay. Boeing will allow an employee to attend college. A new hire must understand one caveat about working for Boeing. Employment is cyclical due to the realities of the airline industry.  Layoffs are a fact of life. Jobs, if one is an hourly employee, are defined by specific job classifications. In order to transfer from one classification to another requires approval under the collective bargaining agreement."
good,"Trabaje tanto de Montador como de Sellador, en Boeing 737 timón de dirección, y Airbus 320/330/A400M y eventualmente me desplazé a hamburgo para efectuar tareas de reparación en el Airbus A380."
good,"Good place to get your feet wet and have a career if you like doing the same thing. It's not hard to move around, but Boeing moves like the federal government. Overall, great company."
good,each day work is performed to specs mandated by both Boeings strict guidelines and the militaries specs
good,"Boeing is a good place to work, especially if you can survive the layoff waves."
good,I learned ALOT more than I thought I would in a small amount of time.
good,"A great company to work for as long as your job felt relatively safe.  It seemed as though decisions were often made to save a buck and please shareholders with little consideration to the quality of work previously performed by those who might be displaced.  In the long run, it costs a company more, I believe, in productivity and quality up the chain of business."
good,It's a great place to work for young engineers. Boeing provides plenty of resources for you learn new skills. Management style is not optimal but reasonable and human.
good,Always Learning New Things. Excellent Teamwork. Comfortable work environment.
good,"HRMS processing"
good,"Great company if you dont want a social life.  But the $ is great! and if you plan it as a career, plan on being laid of more that a cpl times."
good,"The Boeing company is a great place to work from my perspective.  The work is challenging and the rewards are good.  They deal with political issues like all businesses.  All  in all I would say it is not the perfect place to work, but I would recommend it to any of my friends."
good,"One of my favorite employers in the career. Very productive, new technology to learn, invaluable culture, Strong in business."
good,"Great co-workers and management.   Change of direction relating to priorities can be confusing at times.  Overall, a good company to work for.  Good Benefits and excellent café.  Does a great deal to support the community."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Reviews likely vary from one internal business unit to the other, as each essentially operates as if they are independent businesses. My particular business unit is currently Corporate-Office of Internal Governance."
good,Wrote installation plans for Boeing Aircraft's and updated teams excel spreadsheets to measure performance and split up work loads. Working in groups is nice for support and to complete large work loads. 
good,Boeing is a good company to work for with a lot of different opportunities. 
good,I learned a great deal about airplanes and what goes into building and testing them.
good,"• Space and Military flight hardware design, test, integration of Digital, Analog, Power Supply"
good,"Boeing has been a pleasure to work at for almost a year now. Pay is only fair due to the cost of living in the North West. Benefits are very good though. I don't pay a dime for monthly health insurance premiums for the whole family. Work environment is more casual than I expected. I never thought I would enjoy sitting behind a desk, but for what it is, it's quite enjoyable."
good,"Structured and Productive enviroment everyday was a change nothing stays the same which is a good thing, you learn something new everyday to learn and grow with the company."
good,"The name is a plus to have under your belt! Working for Boeing so far has been a great experience; the managers are reasonable, my co-workers are fun, the hours suck but that is the nature of manufacturing, always go, go, go! For the most part, Boeing has been the best job I've ever had so far!!! It is an awesome place to build a stable career."
good,"I've worked for Boeing for 7 years, and in that time I've worked with an incredible team of loyal people. I've had the opportunity to work on compelling projects and grow my skills."
good,"If you can get hard baged it is a great plase to work, you get reconised fo wour work."
good,Have had an opportunity to learn and put my skills to work. Most days are quite engaging and I have really enjoyed working with my team.
good,Great Company to work for. Diversed gorup of employees and customers..
good,Good company to work for with competitive salaries and offers excellent education benefits.
good,"The role of a Senior Manufacturing Manager on the 787 program is very intense but highly rewarding in terms of the scope of work and opportunities to impact the program and develop better ways to get the job done. Benefits and compensation are competitive and their is room for growth for those who are willing to accept new challenges and display above-average to superior performance. Boeing, with emphasis on South Carolina, is a great place to work and an even greater opportunity for those fortunate enough to be hired on."
good,"Very Clean,"
good,mop and wax floors.took care of govt. building. little time to stop and take a break
good,"Boeing Company, with various plant/office locations in the Seattle area, is a very large ""Niche"" company. vis-à-vis the private and public Aircraft Industry. Few people outside this industry are familiar with what it takes to grow, maintain and manage the extremely large intricacies of desiging, planning, manufacturing and selling of half a Billion Dollar products. This makes it a challenge to bring in knowledgeable talent from the large pool nationwide available to other types of implementations."
good,"This was my first real job after college. The new hire program for college grads was exceptional. At the time Boeing was on a hiring spree, so I met many young engineers like myself. What I really liked about my job is I put my engineering skills to use everyday and honed those skills over 5 years. The most difficult part of the job was having to drop everything at a moments notice because their was an AOG issue to take care of. Airline services could be distracting to NPD projects."
good,I worked for Boeing for 6+ years - the first 4+ were AMAZING as I worked for the best Director EVER!!!! He made sure I was exposed to a variety of project and initiative types and was an honest appraiser regarding shortcomings and triumphs - everything was a learning experience. I then took a role in another group with was the most awful environment due to the FEAR that EVERYONE had of the horror of a Director! She has the people skills of the Devil and is certifiably crazy. Upper management generally has ignored her - to the detriment of the staff. Folks have taken demotions or have left an otherwise great company because of her!!! A SHAME!!!! I moved on but I still miss the Boeing Company!!!!
good,Great Place to work. Working for boeing for few months now. Overall good work place.
good,I learned about blueprint reading.Boeing offers a wide variety of jobs.its training opportunities are vast.
good,My found the company to be a open company and somewhat diverse in thought process sometimes if you disagreed with people it did go well from the management standpoint.
good,"It is a large Company and often employees can feel lost, but it is important to find your place and do not be afraid to ask questions and for help. Be bold in your position."
good,"Great place to start out at. Good incentives ,medical,and time off. Always chances to.move up , especially taken advantage of thier  incentive for paying for schooling."
good,"It is amazing what we create here...no other facility produces a carbon fiber airplane to the capacity that Boeing does.  "
good,I was called recalled back to work but some New Management need to lesson an know how to treat people who can help them learn about the company even if their older in age an have years working for the company you can learn something from anyone if you are willing to lesson. Know it all's no one knows everything beside that I enjoyed what I did
good,"Glad to retire after 31 years"
good,"Overall my experience working at Boeing has been great, easy to acclimate. I enjoy the benefits, flexible scheduling and my team. If you're entry level, it is a steep but rewarding learning curve."
good,"Money and schedule mean everything, management lies and sucks. When management gets slammed in surveys they create teams of already overworked employees to figure it out then don't listen."
good,"Nice place to work."
good,"The work/life balance is fantastic. The opportunities to move about the company are good. They are very flexible. The work environment is reasonably relaxed, but business moves at a snail's pace. The technology they use in the Finance department (computer software) is 20 years old, slow, buggy and terrible- and therefore the skills developed with it are not transferable to any business post 2005. Compensation is at the very bottom end of the scale."
good,I enjoyed my work there especially moving over to the RAMS team. There are many good people who will work with you if you are motivated. My last few years of employment the company was winding down so there was a lot of apprehensions about my next move.
good,"work is different always a learning place, work hours for the week are always able  to be discusses with your manager overtime is their always."
good,The expectations of the company were not clearly defined resulting in my termination. While I was there I did enjoy the work and the people. Supervisors did not check on their people.
good,they pay you every other week like clock work.  How successful you are is up to you and how hard you are willing to work.  It takes a lot of incompetence to lose a job here.  But if you are hardworking and dedicated you can go places.
good,"The pay is the only con,  This is great place to work, but I only wish they would change the pay in order for people to want to stay.  Everything else is wonderful"
good,The staff of people on my team are great workers. The trust on my team is very low and policy change is different from day to day. Management is united but very executive. The hardest thingsare team turnover.
good,"Boeing requires a lot of its employees and the work can be quite challenging. Knowing that, you will learn a lot. The opportunity to move around in the company is amazing. The people there are extremely helpful."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Boeing. But because I worked for Boeing Intelligence & Analytics, a subsidiary of the main company, I was underpaid. I worked as an FMV analyst and the running joke was that Boeing was just a stepping stone to get a higher paying job, which was true, and is what I did. I really liked my job and my manager, but when every other company on a contract is paying more, it doesn't make sense to stay with them. They have great benefits, and I would recommend the company to anybody, just not under my particular contract."
good,Boeing is a great place to work with lots of opportunities.  It is a large corporation with work places all over the world. Look for opportunities to re-locate to different locations and different positions and also take advantage of educational benefits.
good,"I love all the benefits I get from working and Boeing and we do very cool things however, I feel like many people hit a ceiling because they dont have a famil relationship then they or someone to sponsor them. I have worked my butt and seems like a lot of the time is for nothing because there is a ""golden child"" around who can do no wrong"
good,"Progressive business culture; challenging assignments.  Fast paced work environment that requires problem solving skills, team cooperation and management review."
good,"It was a great place to start work. However, they were not transparent enough in their job requirements. I highly recommend a better management structure"
good,Working at The Boeing Company is a satisfying experience for anyone that wants to be challenged and given the opportunity to work with very intelligent dedicated people.
good,"can be a bit stressful to meet deadlines, good culture, learned alot especially Lean Manufacturing.  I learned about operating overhead cranes, and the people I worked with were great."
good,"My experience with the Boeing Defense internship was great. Great people, great work, super supportive team etc. The downsides were definitely how slow moving the company can be and how many checkboxes you need to check off to get anything done."
good,"Great people-- some of the smartest on the planet-- and a very collaborative work culture.  Lot's of great innovation and technology, and many places to grow or cross train for career development.  Some of the best leaders I've ever worked with, I've met at Boeing.  Cost / Schedule pressures on quality, short term financial focus over long term company health, and over reliance on global outsourcing of jobs is tarnishing the company's image."
good,Boeing is a large ship that requires a lot of effort when they want to change.  Management is hit or miss and the work life balance is getting better depending on your manager but typically Boeing is about 10 years behind the times.
good,"Big company allows lots of opportunity, can be frustrating when trying to advance. Seems they prefer to have employees move around and get experience elsewhere"
good,happy with my experience with Boeing as a first stop out of college and through 2008 financial crisis. paid for my MBA and compensated me well above my peers.
good,It’s  was a great place to work at and to expand my learning. I will definitely work with them again if I get another opportunity too Based on a new contract.
good,"They like to work you short handed so you feel you need to do more work then you should "
good,"Difficult to get into their work force, but once you're in, there are opportunities to advance if you apply and push yourself. Good work environment, that while definitely still having the feel of an 'old boys club' network, it is working on changing it's appearance, especially in light of recent current events."
good,"You start the job by training and learning the Boeing ways and processes like all other Boeing jobs."
good,If you want great experience in the Aerospace industry this is a great place to work. There are wonderful opportunities to grow as Designer or Engineer.
good,Very good benefits and above average pay. Management is Old School and Culture the same Old School. I would recommend it to anyone who is considering it or who has been offered a job there.
good,"Engineering/manufacturing company steeped in union environment with traditional leadership model.  Culture is an area of focus, yet shifting the overall approach to employee moral and culture is difficult.  Great advancement opportunities."
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  Many opportunities for training and growth.  Lots of volunteer opportunities.  Several different business units means lots of exposure to lots of different cultures.
good,"Boeing has it's ups and downs just like a regular company. There are politics and red tape, but it's who you know  and how to get around them.  I have enjoyed my time there."
good,Benefits were a huge plus why I have continued to stay with Boeing.  I would say the only downfall I have noticed with Boeing is they concentrate more on the younger generation of new kids coming in and promoting them vs the older generation. It becomes very discouraging to come to working knowing you are at a glass ceiling because you can’t get out of a specific department.
good,"It's an ideal company to start at. There us a lot to learn and plenty of opportunities to expand your knowledge and network if you are motivated to do so. Wages are highly competitive, but you have to live in less that ideal locations like Everett. The benefits when I was there were great but I can't speak on the current state because of all the adjustments made after the last contract bid. I would recommend Boeing to anyone looking at a career in Engineering."
good,"Great benefits, less the retirement package. Great people, very diverse work force, a wealth of Knowledge, Advancement possibilities are exceptional. thanks."
good,"Jeppesen is a great place to work and has a great atmosphere and appreciation for it's employees. The chaos caused by the absorption into Boeing currently underway however has a lot of people on edge, seeming interference from Boeing trying to take control of initiatives and projects that are not under their control, creating havoc among upper management positions to where sometimes it is impossible to tell who owns what role or project, and so on. it is the only reason I did not give higher marks to the overall environment of the company. "
good,I have had a great time working for Boeing. As with all large companies all have challenges. I like the fact that there are numerous opportunities to grow and challenge yourself.
good,"My time at Boeing was very fulfilling and I honestly enjoyed myself. "
good,"Product Managers at Boeing have a lot of responsibility, are respected by engineering, and are encouraged to devise innovative ways to grow the business."
good,Working with various teams within the company to satisfy existing contracts with the department of defense. Find solutions to problems and solve them as quickly as possible.
good,"Culture varies from location to location within company.  Some sites are more progressive and employee-focused, others are more hierarchical and customer-focused at the expense of the employees."
good,"Boeing has the best 401(k) in the business (rated #2 of all Fortune 500 companies via Forbes). It was a positive place to work that utilizes your skills. You can choose to challenge yourself, or you can easily maintain a career with minimal stress. The opportunity is up to the engineering employee."
good,"Good place to work.  Management was not always consistent.  Salary was good along with working conditions.  Some space issues with small working spaces."
good,"Lots of opportunities and really god benefits. Culture is not great, but it may vary among locations. Very structured in all aspects. Good managers, not so good employees."
good,"1. PROMOTION - Only when you self-promote. You have to move to another team or another state. Less than 1% gets promoted."
good,"I loved working for Boeing. Great benefits, great pay, and great co-workers. My manager was the only issue. On the first day I met him, he informed me that with my position, there were no advancements which immediately discouraged me. He also had other issues with me due to my commitments to the army reserves. Aside from him, Boeing was a good company."
good,Easy to get your job done at this level. Big team environment. Lots of training to make sure you can do the job right. It was fun knowing that what you are building is going to be flying through the air.
good,"Being a large company, you can change groups until you find a good match. On the other hand, = you may have to move with a project and deal with large company bureaucracy."
good,"Boeing provided great opportunities to help shape the culture of the organization, to learn more in my field, and to travel.  I really enjoyed my time there."
good,Many programs and projects in progress which creates opportunity for growth and recognition.  Can be stressful at times due to demanding program management and constant pressure to do more with less. Workplace culture is usually friendly and collaborative but there can be competition between employees at times due to fewer promotions available and forced distribution of employee evaluations to identify below average employees.
good,"No one is ""killing"" themselves at Boeing.  Good place to ride a career. A fairly easy place to work.  It is interesting to watch and to build Airplanes."
good,"I am original from shanghai,China. Boeing shanghai is good place for working but only the salary is not good for me due to shanghai life expense is very high."
good,"high tech company, lot opportunity to learn."
good,"The company is fair when reviewing performance, sometimes irrational when revolving managerial staff, leaving uncertain leadership in some areas.  Rules are strictly followed, there is not a lot of room for personal growth within the specific positions."
good,"Learned a lot from the company, gave myself and my family a lot of support including medical benefits, 401K and company discount. overall i liked working for the company except my position is outsourcing to india for a cheap labor. at the end, its all about the business."
good,"Boeing aerospace operations is a subsidiary contracts division of the Boeing Company. It can be a wonderful lifetime career opportunity for most. I performed assembly/disassembly of Class III Training suit for astronauts and candidates. I performed maintenance and inspection on all components of suit where applicable. I was part of a team which also assisted in condensing Maintenance and Processing Procedures. "
good,I only worked there for a short time as an intern.  The interns were paid well but the starting salary for full time was only another dollar or two per hour after graduation so I left for another more competitive offer.  Having Boeing on my resume has been helpful over the years though!
good,Boeing is a great place to work. Employees are considered to be the company's most valuable asset when in turn its not a true statement. Performance is not valued across the company
good,"Aerospace Engineering Company primarily a U.S. Government contractor serving the needs of the Armed Forces with aircraft, spares and support equipment."
good,"As a representative of Dell that works with Boeing strictly, 80% of our work is client based. If you finish up with clients before your 8  hours, you go home with what you earned."
good,"great experience to open doors for aerospace."
good,Overall Boeing is a great place to work. My job was mainly overseas so it was challenging to keep what most would see as normal life. The only reason I left the company was because I needed to come home due to some family illness.
good,Productive Work atmosphere. Not very encouraging when it comes to promotions and pay grade is almost always much lower than market reference. Easy atmosphere to work though
good,"Boeing is your life.  The further down the assembly line you are, the less everything else matters.  You may have other responsibilities, but Boeing is your main one. If you like continual weekend work, then you will be completely satisfied. You may be married, but your family belongs to Boeing."
good,The work is steady and has a excellent work culture.  Always has opportunity to learn about other fields.  The flexibility in work schedule is a plus.
good,Not the most exciting work but seeing the planes was cool. Too many meetings and a LOT of paperwork. Spent most of your year working on your annual review.
good,"Your career at Boeing is whatever you make of it.  The opportunities are there and Boeing will pay for you to get educated or trained.  The management is burdened with constant status meetings and have little time or concern for the needs of their direct reports unless it directly affects them in a negative way.  Your advancement is up to you.  If you want something to happen that affects your job, do not expect someone else to do it for you.  You are that someone else.  Management will notice the employee who outperforms.  The recognition is they will ask you to do that job nobody else wants to do and may give you pride points which can be redeemed for gift cards, etc at the Boeing Store.  Remember, they only ride the good horses...into the ground.  Do your job, help your teammates, communicate well, be kind to others, smile, take advantage of the benefits Boeing provides for you to advance your career!  Invest the maximum amount in the 401(k) and get all the company match possible.  Retire happy!"
good,"Good team work, a lot opportunities to learn from different programs. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep the Lab available for multiple projects needed."
good,"Overall it's a great place to work.  If your seeking employment with a global organization  with a bright future, I recommend you apply with Boeing. Your ideas and input just might change the world!"
good,I was a contract labor. While Boeing offeres great benifits and some bonuses contrat labor workers do not get any of these perks. It was a great experience and I hope to find another team that was as amaizingn as the one I had the pleasure of woring with.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my twenty plus years at Boeing.   I was able to work in a variety of jobs with some really smart people.  I felt that most of the work that I did was valuable and gave me personal satisfaction.  The majority of my work there involved web applications development at a time when such skills were in great demand and we enjoyed some great success in advancing the technology."
good,The company needs to modernize its production and tooling to be more competitive. Tooling is antiquated and outdated as are most processes. Drawing system is in ad quit and cumbersome.
good,"Boeing provided ongoing training for both personal and job skill growth. Management was very supportive in recognizing positive employee contribution. "
good,"Great place to work with the opportunity for advancement. Management demonstrated life balance with my daily responsibilities."
good,The work environment is very good.  They focus on 5 S.(LEAN) issues to name some of stuff they do.  The San Antonio site is very big with several programs going at the same time.  Management will make sure work is done to time allot to paperwork.
good,"Proud to be part of Boeing Winnipeg for their diverse, talented, and creative, innovative workplace."
good,"Benefits used to be great but they are going down. I belong in a Professional Union and we are slowly losing benefits. Salary positions get paid overtime (awesome!).  Since it is such a large company there are endless job opportunities (librarian, engineer, doctor, etc)."
good,"The Boeing company has a very flexible work environment depending on which location you are in and which state."
good,"Exciting work, good company, but can be sluggish due to bureaucratic issues. A legacy mindset still exists to a certain extent that can be cumbersome to innovation. Current executive leadership seems to be changing the course and heading in a promising direction."
good,"During the end of my career at Boeing, I experienced numerous layoffs and increasing workload.  Changes in leadership as well as re-orgs.  It was pretty chaotic but I know that situation will eventually smooth out."
good,"Boeing was a good company to work for but must be very flexible with location, shifts and overtime.  Even with these difficulties I would still be an employee if it were not for personal reasons and hope to one day make it back to Boeing."
good,"While at Boeing, I had the opportunity to work as much overtime as I wished!  With that said, I can express that my workload actually required it.  We all worked more than 8 hours per day just to keep up with the work."
good,Boeing is a great place to work. There are many challenges and growth opportunities. Education is highly revered and there are many ways to get it. The people there are very bright and care deeply about making great products.
good,"Good place to work , good people, good salaries, good environment, but management allful they don’t have experience the jobs they do examples: cnc area , managers doesn’t know about  machining......."
good,Enjoyed the work pace and complex issues regarding repairs. Work hours constantly changed making it difficult for planned family time. Very little communication from management. Diverse team but consistently found racist writing on bathroom walls.
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, Learned a ton, Management was good, Worst part of the job was a slow advancement environment, Best part of the job was the pay and benefits"
good,"Boeing has been a great company to work for. The work life balance I currently have is out of this world. I am supported, empowered and have been developing here not only as a professional but also as a human being."
good,Opportunities for learning allot about the area of the aircraft your working on. You come in contact with employees with much experience and background about the aircraft's design and manufacturing achievements.
good,Boeing is great for offering work life balance and development opportunities for employees.  A typical day is dynamic in the fact that business needs change daily.  There is much collaborative effort needed to get the job done.  The flex schedule is very rewarding and is one of the best offerings the company has.
good,Priorities aren't always clear or are mixed.  Individuals decide what they want to work on/towards which isn't always the main objective. Benefits are excellent.  It is a global and amazing company to work for making anyone proud to be part of a company changing the world like it does.
good,Excellent place to work on airplanes.  Lots of jobs and sites to move around.  Great benefits and compensation.  Northwest also has an engineers union.
good,"As Material Handler Specialist was to maintain and move aircraft parts/sub assemblies, materials, work instructions and tooling from one level of manufacturing to the next level."
good,"Great job to advance in. Lots of hours available to work and even at home in some cases."
good,"Overall great place to work.  I learned about corporate business world and using Microsoft Office Suite.  I've learned accounting, financials, labor audits."
good,"A typical day at work involves about 2 hours of meetings, and then 6 hours of real work. Most days you are busy all day long with little time for breaks. "
good,I was a Technical Designer for the Boeing Company (Drafter). I worked in Commercial Airlines and also Military Design. I drafted parts from detail to intallation. The work was pretty consistant.
good,work is amazing great people pretty friendly management and fast paced I would recommend if you do not have a family yet this is the place to work at and its a very well protected job
good,"A huge company with a vast library of engineering data and methods.  A great place to start your career as and engineer, but hard to get ahead after 15 years unless you go into management."
good,"Exciting place to work. Boeing is good to its employees. Many areas to grow your career. Within the Industrial Engineering department, Management is sensitive to Work Life Balance."
good,"Overall good place to work, pay is good paid time off is good, they teach a lot about safety. Which makes you more aware at home for being safe. Rewards safe practice. I have learned a lot from the years I have been there."
good,"Most management is young and inexperienced, therefor unable to provide the adequite leadership required to lead the aging workforce."
good,In the Flight Simulator world is like be a Maytag Guy. but when thing go wrong (equipment breaks) your jumping thru hoops. I only have 122 characters.
good,"You can come early or a bit late as long as you work 8 hours per day and you tell the lead or manager know your usually hours at work.  The job is challenged, it is always something new for you to learn."
good,"Great place to work. Very good benefits and discounts. One major downfall I experienced is the lack of acceptance of change and new ideas. Two commonly heard phrases are ""Attendance is mandatory, work is optional."" and ""That's the way it's always been."""
good,Sometimes Management pitted people against one another instead of supporting team environment. Otherwise it was a great place to work as far as benefits.
good,"I enjoyed the staying busy with multiple projects.  I enjoyed the fast pace and multi tasking, and meeting with and working with all different types of people."
good,Development and Reporting requirements.  Providing supply chain management support.  Trouble-shooting issues and supply short comings. Ongoing SDLC and STLC stratagies.
good,"Good company to gain experience. Engineering at this company has, for the most part, always been ahead of its competitors due to the many extremely smart engineers at the company. But, since this is a company based on manufacturing airplanes and making deliveries, some branches of management begin to spend more time creating ""recovery plans"" for catching up on delayed work instead of actually catching up.  This forces mandatory overtime during evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays for not only the manufacturing team, but various engineering support teams as well."
good,"Boeing has a lot of cool products, but the opportunities to impact them directly are few and far between.  BCA is all about increasing rates, so if you are into working production issues it is the place for you.  Although there is a lot of talk about changing the culture, it isn't happening effectively.  Boeing is slow to move and very bureaucratical.  Things take too long to get done and there is little autonomy within leadership to impact change.  It is very frustrating!"
good,"As a big Company, Boeing offers lots of perks. Benefits are great, and comment moral also makes it a nice place to work. It can be a bit difficult for promotion and pay raises."
good,"started to notice that it had become more important to advance people because they were , either a particular race or gender and not because of experiance / or compatability with the job family, got to the point people were promoted that were obiousely not qualified and an overall detriment to the organization they were assigned to"
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for; however, the pay versus benefits argument can be made. There are a few opportunities to truly advance within the company. Bureaucracy plays a large part in the stalling of advancement. There are many discounts offered through the Boeing portal, and extremely easy to use. The learning together program (LTP) is a great tool that helps you pay for advanced degrees."
good,"Management is serious about and supportive of innovation and employee growth. The engineers and managers are excellent, and there's much to learn for those with enthusiasm. If you're new, this company will nurture your technical and leadership abilities. It's a positive, growth environment, where everyone truly wants to help the product succeed into its second century. A company you can be proud to say you've worked at."
good,"I really enjoy working at Boeing. It's a great company with excellent benefits.  Unfortunately, I need to find something with a better fit for my future goals."
good,Great place to work with exciting new research. Endless job opportunities are offered for all. Management structure changes often  without clear direction.
good,"Large organization, great benefits, generous pay, job security is good for hourly/union workforce, programs not in direct support of production can be unsecured."
good,I enjoyed my experience working at Boeing.  I felt challenged and respected.  I was able to perform a variety of job functions and had the opportunity to move within the company to gain new experience and learn additional jobs skills.  I enjoyed working with many different people and loved assisting them with their needs.
good,"Downloading and uploading flights as they coming in on daily bases, making sure baggages meet their connecting destination, worked at the air cargo hub, making sure cargo is prepared and palletized for outbound flights"
good,"The typical day started high paced wth a lot going on. The Mangers most of them really did not know the Airplanes. They were mostly concerned abut thr numbers and attendence. I liked it when it was time to deliver the airplanes, very rewarding."
good,"Boeing as a company, a nice place to work, the problem lies in it's management (certain areas).  Employee work collective to complete project on time."
good,"The supply chain aspect of work was good, but Boeing attempted to apply factory-floor work systems to desk employees, resulting in quiet hours, email sending restrictions, and management standing over people's shoulders/micromanagment which was not present when I started there."
good,Office based work environment in cubicle with some factory floor activity. Emphasis on integrating lean principles in the work environment. Had a good manager but needed to relocate.
good,"Good Benefits, Good pay, Company can suck the excitement out of the most interesting jobs.  Upper management doesn't know how to manage bid/major programs such as the 787 and tanker programs,"
good,"Boeing has it positives and also negatives.  There is culture that is changing and if you are not a person that can embrace this, Boeing is not for you."
good,The culture changed and towards my time there the Lt. and Captains would not correct or weed out the chaff. The rank advancement was political and most of the Lt. 's and Captain' s had no Police or Military experience.
good,The company is so large that it's hard to get any job that requires parts or engineering assistance done in what I would consider a timely manner. Some processes are in a rut because of the FAA requirement.
good,Working at Boeing was a good experience. I was an Electrician for a year and a half and then went on to be a Quality Inspector. Great salary and benefits. Good place to advance and to keep growing.
good,"It was an interesting environment, working here in Houston.  I worked IT support for personnel doing Space Shuttle and International Space Station support, and my time there was quite an experience.  Unfortunately, I was laid off due to downsizing, and am looking for a different sort of environment to work in now."
good,"the Company was good to work for, Just going through a divorce the x was not happy with my hour or shift. Work was not hard and the people was  great to work with. Just hard on family life."
good,"I couldn't be more proud of the products my work goes into, but the culture and processes haven't aged well.  The company is trying to modernize the culture and processes, but it will take time.  The benefits (at least in the Pacific NW) are fairly good.  I'm taking advantage of the education benefits to get a graduate degree and I don't know many other companies in the area that offer that."
good,In the aerospace sector of the company it is very competitive  and challenging.  The schedule challenges are real and meant to be made. Long days and weekend are a must to make sure that all deadlines a re reached.
good,"Boeing was a learning place from my perspective as I had not worked on Video/Photo scheduling and coordination. Gained much insight and internal support as requested.  At the time, internal restructuring was happening to reduce staff across the globe to be more in line with industry standards for labor hour outputs and budget realignment."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Boeing. I made good friends, and we worked well together. Boeing does provide for a professional working environment, with moderate social policies."
good,"Boeing offered excellent compensation inclusive of a full benefits package.  Jobs and all advancement oportunities were dependant on program awards from the various government defense agencies; so, the corporate climate was primarilary company profitability and customer satisfaction with program performance.  Enjoyed the flexability I had in the various programs with finding creative ways to support the various financial reporting and metrics."
good,"Mulitiple moving parts with field deployment, people, equipment, materials, contractors, sub contractors, military operations, security rquirements, environmental challenges daily. Team building, multiple skill requirements, diversity in the work force is key to success. All said, completion under budget, ahead of schedule, zero injuries, high morale and quality in work and perfomance...that's joy!"
good,"Great work environment but much depends on 1st and 2nd level manager.  Great benefits thanks to SPEEA (engineering union). "
good,"Good benefits.  Hard to get promoted.  Be sure to get the highest level you can when you join.  Management has lost focus."
good,"Started there when I was 22. Worked in many departments in various programs. People were mostly friendly. Management was competent. The pay was very good, as this is a union shop."
good,"Boeing is a cornerstone of American industry. It builds some of the most recognizable commercial products in the world. Working with and around these amazing flying machines is inspiring. Boeing's culture is outdated and antiquated. The Management philosophy discourages innovation, and is often lacking in skill compared to similar management structures in more modern companies. You will not find modern cultural elements like flex time. Pay is by the hour, plain and simple ..."
good,Overall a great job once your wages get up to where they should be. Process of gaining pay in hourly ranks is painfully slow and vacation time takes years to get up to a month off per year.
good,"I enjoy working with the company. With new technology, challenging, "
good,It's a tough schedule but the job itself is rewarding.  The scheduling is usually one month on and one month off rotation. The bonus is you're not the only flight attendant and you are working with at least two others while on your rotation.
good,"Boeing is a large, diverse, complex, and interesting company to work for.  It has a great history and culture, especially in the Pacific Northwest, and is a great company to work for."
good,"Excellent company to work for, lots of job advancement...depending on who you know. Great company to get extra education (which i highly recommend) with nothing out of your pocket. But like most aircraft manufacturing companies, layoffs are part of the business and you should be prepared in case it happens."
good,"Supply Management POC for Cost Reduction Ideas (CRIs) from suppliers"
good,Moving from intern to full time is critical if you plan on working for the company again. Otherwise it's very difficult to get in. The teams are usually well assembled and there is a nice range of talent for the projects assigned.
good,"Boeing is a great company which hires strong performers. The the contracts are large and can move slowly, but the projects are exciting (e.g. V-22 Osprey hydraulics, aircraft manufacturing)"
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for, like to travel CFT is a young mans place to travel and see the country. You have to be good at reading and under standing drawing and blue prints."
good,Not a bad job to work for but i do think the management team can do better in a few areas. Like talk t the employees with more respect. Other then that its a good job to work for and it also has very good benefits
good,Working for The Boeing Company provides the opportunity to support the U.S. military and to work with exciting developments in aerospace and related technologies. It is a fast-paced and competitive environment.
good,"Good environment safe place to work, Learning is encouraged. The average day started with a ten minute stretch and an assessment of the daily work load"
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Boeing. It was fast-paced, good learning and training experience and I valued my job. It was great to lead the teams and I worked with 1400 employees."
good,"I was able to learn a lot and gain some great professional contacts along the way. The workplace culture also allowed for individuals straight out of college to get acclimated with the real working world. "
good,"i feel like boeing provided what most people would consider a safe work environment, job security and culture. i enjoyed working with Boeing customers."
good,Never had a issue working here. If given the chance you should too. Nice place to learn as a  apprentice then go somewhere else or make a career out of it.
good,i would show up and clock on then sit for 20 min before i was given something to do. i mostly did production assist and was put on easy jobs. i really wanted to do tooling work but they were making us do production assist.
good,Boeing is a huge company to work for so obviously management and culture can vary.  I've always had positive experiences and enjoyed the work life balance.
good,Most of the people  there are great.  The physical environment is good. Working for a big company takes some getting used to. If you strive to be more than a number  among  thousand other numbers   you may want to look someplace else.
good,"needs work. Cut-throat competition gets in the way of morale, which decreases the productivity potential and personal growth. Management can help with this."
good,"position was challenging, great learning / educational experience, lack of care for injured on the job events, laid off / retired due to this situation."
good,Boeing is an excellent place to work.  The benefits are great.  The size is the only issue.  The secret is to find a group or type of work that best fits your personal and career goals.  The opportunities range from mind numbing work to research and development and management.
good,Good benefits but the cyclical layoffs makes it hard to work for the company. Upper management seems to be more interested in the short term gains and not the long game.
good,"BECU is a good company, the workplace can be stressful with calls in the queue overall. The hardest part is scheduling, working on Sat for those who have a long drive but it is a good place"
good,"The best aspect of working for Boeing is the diversity of careers you can develop.  If you want to broaden your experience and not lock yourself into one skill/profession, Boeing gives you the means to try roles from sales to engineering to manufacturing.  Moving up within any one organization, though, can take a while if you're not on high visibility projects."
good,"Once at work, There is a Team/ Shop /Section meeting."
good,Great people to work with and fun and exciting career in aviation.  Great to see how the process starts all the way to the finish of assembling and delivering of high tech military machines.
good,"Great place to work, but have little room for advancement. Great benefits and work hours. My only issue is I've been here 6+ years. I've put in numerous applications and haven't received one interview as of today."
good,"The company now places the stockholder dividends over the employees. The values is now the bottom line, rather than the products and services produced."
good,"Recommends"
good,"great place to work, good people to work with, three shifts to work on, profit sharing, on site gym, cafeteria. Bad part is they do lay-off people quite a bit."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work. They talk about work/life balance, but that's something hard to do in a job that wants 10 hour days. Not much of a chance for promotion unless you come to work for them right out of college. Hardest part of the job is promotions or lack thereof."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work.  The benefits are fantastic, I have other family members that work there.  If it were up to me, I would finish my career there."
good,"Day to day work gets to be repetitive, but is fun and busy"
good,"Work environment is nice and work schedule can be flexible depending on the group and manager.  The bad thing is that there is no job security.  Besides, a lot of decisions are made because of politics and not so much about job performance."
good,"Flexible work hours provided it syncs with customers."
good,It is very exciting to work at the Boeing Co. as it is a company that is designing and building state of the art airplanes to be sold around the world.  Their is a pride in the process and success of the company that is infectious.
good,"Over my years with this company I had two types of manager, those that I liked very much and understood, and those that I did not.  The later was very difficult to work with and excel.  My time working on NASA programs were the best years at the company. My time on military programs was not, due to the fact all my managers were retired military themselves and do not think like the corporate sector does.  I would recommend this company for the challenge and the excellent benefits."
good,Employees were a great source of information and friendly.  Everyone cared about the work they produced.  Management needed to listen to the employees more.
good,"I received most of my experiences at this company. More learning experiences that I can even remember. Boeing started to decline as I left, I cannot talk to what happened after I left."
good,Provides decent compensation and reasonable work hours. Provides the opportunity to work on a variety of projects Overall this is a good place to work.
good,"Sometimes the management is not fair in dealing with employees."
good,Enjoyed the culture and opportunity to be involved in international business pursuits.  Company is a world leader in aerospace and works on cutting edge technologies the help them maintain their leadership position.
good,"Boeing WAS a great place for engineering work, but the current management style is to build the stock on the backs of (outgoing) workers. Work is being moved to right-to-work States and open jobs are backfilled with inexperienced workers."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Excellent benefits.  Great company for all levels ranging from entry, mid career, or senior level employees.  "
good,"The production rates at Renton demand frequent cycles to everything that happens.  It is exciting, and you see airplanes getting put together very quickly.  You will go home feeling accomplished."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work for anybody who enjoys work.  If you are one of the 20 in the 80-20 rule, you will get projects that will engage you and keep you interested in the business for a lifetime."
good,always had a productive day. I learn how to work independently. Hardest part of the job was getting other employees on the same page and being a team.
good,They do a lot of things great and a lot of things bad. Production is production so you have to understand the type of environment you are getting into before going. Washington is much better than South Carolina.
good,"Great company, bad management. Boeing cares about their peoples safety. Safety and quality are what is the most important. A typical day starts with getting my computer up and running. Inspecting product while being layed up during production. If a defect is found after shop has inspected the part, QA will write a tag to get the part repaired in a rework process. All data kept and stored in a computer program for traceability."
good,Interesting blend of aerospace government and commercial programs.  Flexibility to move to numerous US and International locations.  Highly dedicated staff.
good,Great rewarding job. Being deployed to hostile locations and contributing to the war on terrorism is very rewarding. I learned that you never stop learning about the aircraft. The hardest part of the job is being away from family during holidays while on deployment. Managers were always there for morale and management decisions that were best for the company and me as an Field Service Representative. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that you contributed to the units aircraft readiness.
good,This job provided me with a profound professional experience which often challenged my thought process.  My fellow engineers were a joy to work with and the shop mechanics enjoyed me teaching them how to better utilize technical information during their repair processes.
good,"Started as structures tech and worked my way to Production manager.  Lots of training and support."
good,"A typical day a work consisted of challenging projects and multi-tasking.  I was able to advance with The Boeing Company in my 18 years, from contract engineer to direct hire; from data management analyst to Project Manager with learning a lot about data management, data quality and compliance to U.S. Regulations (in particular Export Compliance).  Management, at the beginning was very stable and helpful career wise.  Toward the end, we had a great turnover in managers, making it difficult to explain/teach the concepts of the jobs and projects being worked in the group.  Co-workers, in general, were personable and friendly and most were competent and hard working.  The hardest part of the job was teaching new managers who wanted to micro-manage but not really wanted to learn the ins and outs of the job, contending with manager (not company) imposed start and stop times, parking and shuttling.  Personal recognition was low.  Managers did not understand the job and therefore did not celebrate it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the type of work being done, the challenge, learning new things daily, multi-tasking, working with and building relationships with associates outside of my immediate group, being recognized by other organizations as a Subject Matter Expert in my field."
good,My favorite company to work at in my 40 years and I've worked at 4 different aerospace company's. Just do your JOB and management will be happy.
good,"Boeing overall is a great company. The benefits are nice with different options and big discounts for certain life changes. my current location is still nearing the end of the start up phase, so they have kinks to work out with how a business is really operated."
good,"Good benefits, good opportunity to further education, hard to move up. Not growing in Southern California. Would need to relocate to make it into management. Management encourages employees. However, you work hard and there the pay is under median pay for the work."
good,"Overall a good company to work for due to the opportunities that exist, benefits that are provided (salary with other benefits), and the training offered. It needs some drastic changes/updates to the culture but it will take some time for that to truly occur."
good,"Highly respectable large company.  Lots of opportunities with lots of employees.  However, tough to move up and pay lower then expected for this industry."
good,"Company makes great efforts to keep updated Technology to remain a relavant competitor."
good,"Boeing values its employees. Very good benefits. "
good,"Boeing is an excellent work place and a leader in Technology."
good,"- My typical day is: commute - conf calls with France - making presentation - BID - and communicate with my VP on site in Everett"
good,Up and down pace. Sometimes very busy and sometimes slow. Enjoyed work environment and co workers. Hardest part was not knowing when shop would load up the call sheet. Working traveled jobs down line on airplane. Rewarding to inspect work and verify parts are Installed per drawing and with high quality.
good,Good benefits. Company was based on the Shuttle Missions. With the Shuttles retirement the Company of over 3000 employees became a company of a few.
good,your simply a number at boeing there is no reward for good work attendance or attitude you are a number when your numbr is up your gone
good,You get to work with some great people and learn more than you can imagine. Management on the other hand contradict everything they say and you can't seem to advance in your career because years of experience rules and knowledge and performance are secondary.
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work.  I learned a lot and they really like people to continue to learn and there are many avenues for people to do that.  It does get a bit difficult and stressful when deadlines are looming, but that is true with every place."
good,"I was the early person in my Dept. so I would go around to check the classrooms for set up first, then when the contact person would arrive I would greet them and assist them with logging into the computer and any other IT or A/V needs. to really go above and beyond for our guests. Management was rather complacent, not really involved."
good,"documentation on daily workflows was incomplete and/or missing altogether, a continual WIP."
good,"Boeing makes some of the most incredible aerospace products worldwide.  Due to this, there is the opportunity to work in very advance and varied positions at the company.  This diversity offers the ability to remain challenged and passionate.  The downside is that often times you need to seek out the opportunity for change, which is not everyone's strong suit."
good,Its a very great company to work for Im looking for a job due  to the closing of the facility. I've learn alot working here leadership included
good,"Overall, a great experience with Boeing. Really have no complaints. Times are changing though and the company is looking for new and younger employees to pay less salary. For me, the benefits were outstanding. However, for new employees there is no retirement pension plan which seems to be the norm for most business now."
good,"Great place to work at, but there are no incentives for doing a god job and there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement. School is paid in full which is an advantage."
good,"I would definitely recommend seeking a job with he Boeing Company. Great pay, great benefits, and a wonderful work environment."
good,"During my time at Boeing, I didn't find many issues while I was there. The groups, while a little disorganized, were all friendly and helpful, and we all worked towards a common goal. We were friendly with each other and even found time to shoot the breeze whenever we weren't busy working on a task. It also helped me to learn more about Java and SQL development along the way, in addition to problem solving."
good,"Learned Amazon Web Services (AWS)"
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting to work thirty minutes early reading my emails, getting my team started with our safety moments for the day and giving assignments for the day. "
good,Engineers work on most phases of multiple contracts from proposal to requirements to design to test.  Great exposure to software development life cycle.  Lots of exposure to customers and partner company engineers.  Work is a fast paced multitasking environment.
good,"Good team dynamic with supportive management, however the job became more about numbers and output than employee happiness and quality.  Not much was done to encourage all employees to contribute to the team workload and remain engaged from day to day"
good,I enjoyed working with others in a productive and positive environment.There was always room for improvement and growth.
good,Enjoyed working at Boeing in Production as a Sheet metal worker as a Framer on the 757 program and then on to work as a Material Handler/ Expeditor. Plenty of opportunities to advance and move up the ladder within the company.
good,Always busy so the days flew by so fast. Learned to work with the customer and support teams. Most of all co-workers were great to work with. Only problem I had was with others who would not fulfill their job duties and then were protected by management.  I loved the accomplishment I felt at the end of the day because I take great pride in what I do. All in all it was a great place to work. And I came to know a lot of good people.
good,"Like all large corporations, there are going to be pros and cons."
good,"My family still lives in the Charlotte area, and I want to move back to Concord to be with them. I have no problems working for Boeing."
good,"Learn a lot, get familiar with all Boeing programs design teams."
good,"I had just broken into First Level Management when I was offered a teaching job at a Portland area small university.  Had I know that it was really only a two-year assignment, I would've stayed at Boeing."
good,Overall it is a great place to work that offers many opportunities for an engineer to learn and grow.  A very demanding company to work for.
good,Working on your parts of the Boeing 747 airplanes.  Everything had to be very precise.  Management was pretty good.  There was alot of      favoritism.  Co-workers were good.  The hardest part of my job was drilling in hard to reach areas.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being recognized for good work done.
good,"I would have enjoyed working at Boeing a lot more if I wouldn't have had to battle for respect and fairness. Unfortunately, one of the employees in the shipping department was not so kind and would throw his weight around quite often. The majority of the people that worked there were very nice."
good,40-45 hours/wk + Interesting work. The work tended to be repetitive. Co-workers were excellent and professional. Facilities are modern and office environment was typical to any large company.
good,"Work days were varied from hectic and chaotic to lulls of waiting as experienced for many large projects in major companies."
good,"If you find the right group to work with and the right line of work - It's a great place to work.  Have to put up with typical big company things, but that's work"
good,"Boeing is worlds biggest aerospace company. The company will celebrate 100yrs in 2016. Good place to work, but has been beaten by Airbus all around the world because of cost. The culture in US is open and generally people enjoy. However, at international locations the things are not same due to local managers influence."
good,The job has its ups and downs. There is always something to work on or a project to create as long as production stays priority. Its a team environment where everyone really wants the best product out the door.
good,"Boeing was a great place to work, the day was very fast paced. I learned new skills daily, management was pretty fair. Co-workers were awesome. Hrdest part of job was completeing deadlines on parts due to manufacting issues that came up. Most enjoyable part was moving around the factory learing different things."
good,"I would have loved to stay with this employer, unfortunately my contract ended and the company was in a hiring freeze. this was a fun job with amazing co-workers."
good,Great Senior engineers to learn from and opportunity to work on highly specialized projects. Flexibility in schedule depending on what program you work on. Difficult to move up into higher level engineering. Diverse projects available.
good,"Trainning and a lot of Safety rules. All trades worked with all Inspectors, along with the Supervisors. They would help the workers. The Eng. worked hand and glove with all the Mechs."
good,"This is a good strong company with a strong market position.  There are a lot of well documented and executed disciplines in the organization and a lot to learn.  They pay and benefits are good and for the most part it is a comfortable working environment."
good,Boeing is a great place to work and there is a lot of potential and room for growth. People are friendly and the work gets done efficiently but the management team is lacking in the skill and prowess needed to dig into that potential. I have learned to take things in stride and to be transparent about the issues and the need for motivation. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing a finished product and the hardest part of the day is dealing with the political minutia that ebbs and flows.
good,"Young production site with lots of individuals new to the aerospace industry who are eager to learn and succeed."
good,"Learning every day. "
good,"At Boeing every day was a busy day. I learned a lot of new systems. Management was wonderful. Co-workers were very friendly. Hardest part of the job....not getting hired on as a permanent employee. "
good,parking is the #1 hassle for everyone. Lots of very smart people to keep you motivated and inspired for sure. Fun place to work that has inspired me.
good,Good company to work for. I enjoy the people I work with and the opportunities to grow in your position. The only down fall is the early hours....
good,Boeing was a good company to work for but there was too much buddy system at charleston plant when I was there. I would go back if had the chance though.
good,"Lots of red tape, but good benefits and decent wages"
good,"Typical day at work is about learning new things"
good,At Seal Beach the employees support the airlines by providing services and developing repair guidelines.
good,"Boeing is a great company to develop both technical and business skills.  Standardized process across the business ensure fairness in annual reviews, candidate selection and promotions.  There is a strong focus on improving the way the company does business and this is evident in formalization of its technical and business processes.  The company is working to bring salary and benefits under control and align them with industry.  This is evident in changes being made to medical and retirement benefits.  These changes are being made with the welfare of the individual employees in mind.  The company sponsors healthily choices and manage your retirement training and literature."
good,Management is ineffective and concerned with trivial issues.
good,"A very well kept secret in Boeing"
good,"A normal day consisted of auditing non-conformance discrepancies for accuracy, preparing and sending out a daily summary of all aircraft in work via email, researching historical information as requested. Preparing aircraft for delivery to the military customer was also a part of our daily requirement.  The position required the ability to communicate effectively with all levels of management and maintenance workforce to accomplish all tasks according to the contract.  My team mates and I managed to create an environment of team pride and excellence in providing a quality product back to the military customer. On rare occasion when there was a roadblock to maintaining our success, our team would meet to resolve the problem and to eliminate the possibility of the issue occurring again.  This process could be difficult due to time constraints and the urgency of finding a solution in a timely matter.  I enjoyed the diversity of the work site.  There were people from many different parts of the world and the company encouraged learning about the different cultures at our facility."
good,"typical day, is setting up a studer s33 touch screen, grind the parts inspect and get a first article"
good,Represent Quality function on team activities to integrate contractual and Boeing Quality Management System requirements into all aspects of proposals and program processes and documentation.
good,A great company to work for they allow for personal growth and family life balance
good,"I work with some of the brightest minds in the world.  The things that they can make happen, is incrdible.  Too bad I can't decribe the amazement I see every day."
good,"On a daily basis I am responsible for replying to queries from fielded representatives that they don't have the resources to answer. I have gained a vast knowledge of aviation management, how government contracts work, and extensive blueprint reading knowledge. I work with all former military and there is a great sense of comraderie. The hardest part of the job here as a home office field service representative is finding things to do when there are no queries from the field to respond to. The best part of this job is the vast amount of knowledge out there to gain. There are nearly unlimited opportunities to learn as long as you have the vehicle (financially within the company) and the desire to learn something new."
good,Good company to work for as a new graduate. Great benefits and pay. Opportunities to learn in an engineering environment.
good,"A typical day was usually chaotic with many things to do.  I would work the highest priority issues first, then went on to projects, training, or career advancement tasks.  It was a good place to work but difficult to get cooperation from some people.  Although most of the aircraft delivered on time, mechanics had to ""do what they had to"" to get the job done.  I learned that no matter how hard you work to support teams, it came down to how well you mastered the Business  Goals, and Objectives to the satisfaction of your manager.  Most of management was good and followed Boeing policies but some used some unethical practices and hid them.  Most of my co-workers were great to work with but I found that many of them were looking out for themselves.  The hardest part of the job was getting cooperation from other support personnel and sometimes from maintenance teams to accomplish tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people accomplish their work and making them relieved and happy that they were able to do so despite the barriers placed before them."
good,"Management needs to work more closely to mechanics to make sure the mechanic has everything he needs to do his job, instead of the mechanic running all around finding what he needs. Final assembly and functional test should be that, NOT FINAL RE-ASSEMBLY. It's also a very dangerous place to work."
good,"Working for Boeing was a great experience. "
good,"A great company to work for with the following values;"
good,"This is the best job in the world. I work with a team of project managers, with design and test engineers working together to build and certify newly built military helicopters or modifications to existing models.  To do this, we claim that the aircraft is safe to fly and reliable and maintainable.  These claims are underpinned by supporting arguments (e.g., the aircraft can be maintained with existing hand tools and maintenance skill sets) and evidence (a limited maintainability demonstration that employs the procedures and tools) followed by a demonstration report that documents the objectives, findings and recommendations.  This document is then made part of an iterative Reliability and Maintainability Case Report that is part of the certification record of the aircraft."
good,"Started around 5:00AM ended 2:30PM. Reviewed new and current nonconformance reports (NCR) and determined responsibility. If NCR was a supplier caused initiated supplier corrective action request. Performed follow up investigations and elevated issues too higher authority when required to meet process requirements.Managers often did not understand why acquiring corrective action took considerable time and they were not proactive in requiring their inspectors and MSE2s which complicated the investigation process. "
good,"friendly working environment"
good,An ordinary day is to go thru the daily operation with production. The amount of jobs to complete daily varies on the load. the co workers are very helpful and supportive and will help if need.
good,Many opportunities for those that wish to grow into different assignments.
good,"My position as a Logistics Coordinator / Depot Maintenance & Repair Agent was educational, exciting and challenging which I really enjoyed.  As the liaison between Boeing and the government hardware suppliers for NASA's International Space Station contract, the best part of my job was interacting and coordinating with multiple groups to manage the hardware repairs.  I worked with position for 8 years with 2 different companies."
good,"Very flexible place to work with plenty of training to acquire. I was able to occupy various job positions to gain further experience. Management was cordial for the most part but the employee review system was the extremely poor, inaccurate, and undermining. The hardest part was having poor lower level management, who played favorites and a FALSE SENSE OF JOB SECURITY (too many lay-offs). The most enjoyable part of this job was friendships with co-workers, the FEELING of working for a sound company and great benefits. I would go back in a heart-beat and do things different to improve my chances for occupational longevity."
good,"Was a good place to work, Unstable with contracts with government"
good,"Aviation atmosphere with diversity.Typical aviation company to work for but is not a stable company in San Antonio, Texas."
good,"Other than the cyclical nature that led some to work crazy hours, this is a great company. The benefits can't be beat with free health insurance. If you are good at drawing a line with how much you work, the time you spend at work is likely to be fun and fast paced."
good,"I am interested in an  accounting position for a good company. I feel I have the accounting skills necessary to effectively manage a challenging position; I can help your company grow in success, and business development. I am capable of multitasking in a high pace environment, as well as provide accounting support to the financial team. I have worked in a retail environment with multiple outlets. I have done physical inventory counts and matching those numbers up with an automated system. I have done consolidated financial statements for companies with multiple entities and lines of business. I have worked with the production of finished goods analyzing the costing and G/L journal entries. I have worked in the service industry, analyzed their financial statements and balance sheets and made journal entries to update active accounts I have the ability to manage multiple projects with competing demands on resources. I have strong communication skills and experience interacting at executive levels."
good,"As a note, I work in the shared services group. It is assuredly different than working in the commercial airplanes or defense systems organizations."
good,The work was challenging dealing with the various stores and time differences around the world. But very interesting and when things came together a feeling of success. A lot of the work processes were not visible to Management so they didn't always appreciate the effort required to get the job done. Most co workers were hard working and responsible but there were several we weren't. The hardest part of the job was to get management to change the processes so we could save money. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of a job completed saving the company money. The camaraderie of fellow workers and fair salary & benefits.
good,"Always new things to learn, friendly co-workers.  Job will keep you busy and time will fly..."
good,I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Fast paced and always kept busy. The only down fall of the job is working so many hours and not having weekends off.
good,The work at Boeing can at times be challenging but can also be repetitious. The management is good usually and co-workers great. The hardest thing about Boeing is trying to feel valued as an employee. I sometimes felt like a number. I enjoyed the benefits and pay.
good,"Here I learned how to be efficient and keep myself employed by finding work that required my expertise. However, this seems to go unnoticed if there isn't enough money in the contract to keep you on staff. Don't expect raises, promotions, or bonuses."
good,everyday i work for this company i learn something different  and is always good to work for them.
good,"A good place to work. Learned a great deal about budgeting, business management, compliance, regulatory requirements, project management, acquisitions, and contracts."
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers at Boeing, but the opportunity for advancement for young engineers was not there.  Left to pursue work with a company that would promote younger engineers.  But, once established in your career, Boeing is a great company to work for as jobs are relatively stable and typically plentiful."
good,"Great place to get a union job where life is easy. The people are nice and management is generally decent. There is a problem where half the people do nothing and the other half work twice as hard. So, great if your lazy, or bad if you work hard."
good,"General cleaning as well as stripping and sealing floors."
good,"Straight out of college, it is a good company to start working for. Great experience, huge corporation with a lot of history. Get to work with some top engineers and see the company from all different business units."
good,"great benefits, the company strives for excellence and a professional working environment"
good,different type of people to work with and a lot to learn from the company
good,"Overall, a great company, but many organizations, and groups within them, are still very siloed, i.e. not sharing information or labor. This isn't deliberate, it is just the nature of the company, and it is getting better, but needs to have gotten better already."
good,"Although an outside contractor (temp staff) I was always treated just like everyone else, which was very well. Boeing always recognized that people have lives outside of the office, and were very flexible about meeting the needs of their people."
good,Boeing is one of the best place you can work at. The compensation is awesome. The people are very friendly. It can get a bit political but try to stay way from the bulls. I love it there. I still remember people that hired me in. I love working with them. It's the only place that I would buy a plane ticket and leave the next day for 2 months for so far. I only leave because the project ended.
good,The hardest part of the job was that I was not able to go home every day as the office was over 90 miles from hom. I was able to learn to use DOORS and got into the defense culture.
good,Management was looking at for its employees (by and large). I had excellent coworkers. The environment was always relaxed even when deadlines loomed. I learned significant data. The hardest part of the job was the 13 years of rotating shifts.
good,"Very good work/life balance schedule. It's a process oriented, professional workplace. There are many layers of managements. Therefore, it's sometimes difficult to purchase new tools due to many management layers."
good,"It's a pretty state-of-the-art (for the country where I live) place. It's a JV - kind of fusion of Russian and US business schools. Young and smart staff, lots of work, diversified duties, responsibilities. Smart management."
good,"I am Avionics/Electronics Specialist, I work on all electronics through out the aircraft form POWER ON to the IFE and seat repair."
good,It is a good place to work with great benefits.
good,Poor effort to maximize staff abilities in new positions. Work environment was good.
good,new stuff everyday worked on different machines. learned smartcam.
good,"Working in Research and Development was challenging because in expanded the mind. Supervisors and Leads did not hoover over you when working. The only time they approached you was to give you the job and to answer questions when needed. Had to learn to work without constant supervision. If you were not working on a job already started, you would get a box of parts and job number. You then had to go to the print room and acquire the drawing and bill of materials."
good,"diversified company, challenging, excellent benefits, experienced good training"
good,"Boeing is a big company spread all over Australia and around the world. There is so much opportunity to advance within the same building, country or around the world."
good,Fast passed work environment with many people ever changing job duties. Friendly staff and lots of resources.
good,Good people and Freindly place to work. Good Hours and flexibility.
good,there is no room for advancement. there are more directors then employees. while it is still a good company to work for the focus should be on getting the job done versus micro managing.
good,Truly enjoyed working on the ISS (International Space Station). Also worked on the Delta IV Rocket and TISS (Thermal Imaging Sensor Systems Programs. Went to college to become an Engineer as was able to do Engineering duties at Boeing.
good,This was a very interesting job for me. I learned a great deal and had the opporitunity to work the payloads on several launches. The most challengiing part of the job was when multiple engineers need to have documents edit and the deadlines were all the same. Our team was very small yet extremely productive.
good,Boeing was an excellent company to work for and they invested well in their employees.
good,I am very lucky to be employed by The Boeing Company. It is an amazing company with tremendous benefits.
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits, Very interesting work"
good,"The Boeing Company is a good place to work, it offers good training, and great pay, with a lot of people there to connect with, doing the same type of work, with lots of backup, and support to help you do your job. The company handles ethics and diversity quite well."
good,"Consistent work, good movement between different projects. Training as needed. Great benefits, flexible work hours in the office setting."
good,"Boeing is a place for growth you can take classes at the job site to up grade for improvement they have great benefits in medical, dental, vision and 401K."
good,I found the company to be a rewarding experience. The company values its employees and is Contractor friendly.
good,"It is a lot of hard work but, one thing is for sure you have a since of pride when the day is done. This is one of the better place that I have found to work."
good,"AT Boeing/Spirit we manufacture aircraft. It is a very productive job but in the meantime it can also be very enjoyable place to work. It could be called more of a relaxed work environment. Employees, for the most part get along well and normally it is not a high stress work environment. Work hard, follow instruction and get the aircraft built."
good,"I worked for the Information Services department with a group of amazing people.  The flexibility allows for life/work balance.  The pay is pretty reasonable.  It's unfortunate to be laid off, but I enjoyed my time at Boeing."
good,"Lots of flexibility, good family work life balance.  Good benefits, pay is pretty good.  Lots of training available and company paid education is a great benefit."
good,"People are nice, easy to get along with and are willing to help. It has a fun and relaxed atmosphere. You get to work from home. Coffee machines break down too often though."
good,"Advancement has skipped over Gen X from Boomers directly to Millennials. I have learned that if finance didn't select you for advancement, then it is hard to fight for it for yourself."
good,"40 years ago the people, everyone I worked with was important. That was the company culture. The things I did were interesting and, varied, and always important.  Teamwork was the best part of working there.  Facilities is an 'overhead' organization.  As more senior managers at the top levels shuffled through with a focus on reducing operational costs, the gratification of doing things right sadly diminished.  Still it was a good paying job with good benefits."
good,The largest aerospace engineering and manufacturing company in the world. A great place to be exposed to tons of different projects. A very diverse and enjoyable work atmosphere.
good,"Great place to work for the benefits and work/life balance. Plenty of bad managers though that can make or break your career. I do appreciate the opportunities to move around, there are a lot of jobs at Boeing in nearly every field, so once you are in, it's pretty easy to move around. They also offer benefits if you want to go back to school, great perk!"
good,"A typical day at work for me has changed many times over the years. "
good,"Boeing offers are many benefits, however company advancement seems to be lacking and also a good ole boys environment. I also feel the pay is very competitive with the market value."
good,"Looking back over my time with Boeing, I found it to be challenging and rewarding. Challenging because to me, being an older worker, it takes time to learn the work culture. There are many opportunities out there and it takes time to navigate which way to go. Any company that gives you paid training is a Blessing.  Thanks Boeing!"
good,"You will get out what you put in. You can move to any position anywhere in the company so that is a pretty amazing thing."
good,"employees do get transferred to areas far from home and or long distance driving each day. job can get boring at times. new equipment can take months to you, compared to other companies that have state of the art."
good,"Boeing is a very fast pace production company. It is a good work experience that teaches you aviation painting. I did a lot of sanding, tacking, painting, masking. Using stackers and lifts to complete my work. Using PPE and airhoods."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Boeing. The work place was very professional and the work was challenging. I learn quite a bit more about the Boeing culture from when I work for them before. I was happy with my job and only left to be closer to home.
good,Good Benefits and decent work environment but can get bogged down with typical corporate structure.  Overall would definitely work for them again.  Just have to learn how to play the game better
good,"A bit disorganized and outdated technologically, but a good place to gain experience. Often found employees were left in the dark about a lot of different things."
good,"it was a great warehouse environment for a temp agency that i worked for,   past paced very detail oriented lots of different opportunities to move up"
good,"The pace is extremely fast, many deadlines. There are also opportunities to learn about different aspects of building an airplane and all of the different groups associated with it. The benefits are really good too."
good,the boeing company is a really good company to work for they have really good benefits it was a pleasure work for them the only reason a leave it is because it is a little hard to grow inside the company
good,"I enjoy working here, there are opportunities throughout the company. These range from travel to career advancement. I have gained valuable experience and career insight working here."
good,"-Great benefits"
good,"Flexible, good environments, safe place to work. Management sometimes van vary in consistency. Great benefits. Headed in a great direction after recent unfortunate events."
good,"The Boing Company was a good place to work, people were friendly. Good Training on there systems. Weekly meetings on team progress. Employees worked well in helping each other solve problems."
good,THE Boeing Company is a great place to work. it can be fast paced at times. But it can also be laid back as well. I learned allot working for the Boeing company and it has help me with my aerospace journey.
good,"Great benefits and very fair compensation depending on the hiring manager."
good,"I have been with Boeing for almost 14 years now and I have worked on multiple programs and supported multiple programs.  When I first started at Boeing as a System Engineer 4, I was given a project to get the approved by the customer CWAN certification and approval to operate so that Prime contractor Boeing could communicate electronically and pass secure data traffic to the customer, supply customer, and sub contractors.  That meant I had to hit the ground running and find out what it would take to get the network certified and online.  Within about 8 months after taking on the task the network was certified and we received the Approval to Operate.  The workplace culture was great because everybody work together and had a stake in the mission which made us ""One Boeing""  We worked with the mindset that if one failed we all failed, and we didn't want that.  We stayed and overdrive throughout the program and made major accomplishments as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning to become an engineer and all my co-workers supporting me and helping me to succeed."
good,"I've enjoyed working for this company for more than 10 years and I've appreciated all the benefits I've received, especially the paid tuition and reimbursement of books and software.  The 401k is excellent and so are the health benefits, although they're starting to take little by little, but most companies are headed that way too, if not already there.  I have no complaints, just looking to get into a career that I went to school for."
good,"Management wasn't that good. A typical day as a custodian involved cleaning and restocking restrooms, cleaning cafes, taking out garbage, recycle, and compost"
good,hardest part of the job was trying to read the diagrams quickly to get the job done in time and to make sure that the job was completed safely and without incident
good,"Training, education, and experience are taken seriously and one feels a part of something greater than oneself. Management emphasizes planning and relies on decades of cumulative experience of team-oriented employees to advance the state of the art in airplane and aerospace development. Learning and doing are simply always happening, while having fun."
good,The Talent Acquisition team was always available for assistance with training and very helpful. Always there when needed.  Willing to train at a moments notice.
good,"Boeing is a good place to work and learn as well! Boeing will pay for your training as well! You cannot go wrong! However, you do need to do your part and support your team. Also need to be able to adjust to management, since they are human and no two act the same. As long as you get your work done and stay out of trouble, you will succeed!"
good,"Boeing is a large company so finding the proper team can be key but there are a plethora of disciplines and opportunities. This bundled with a competitive benefits package makes it an excellent place to work."
good,A great company to stretch your knowledge and learn more. Leadership opportunities are always available. You are in charge of your destiny and career instead if being locked down in one position.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and amazing group of people to work with. Emphasis on safety and cooperation for a common goal is paramount within the company and it's core values."
good,"Good and safe place to work but management is not in touch with the common worker.  Management has no idea what the worker does on a daily basis.  Pay and benefits are good and advancement is always available.  However, management is always changing positions, which does not make my job feel stable."
good,"The Great, the Good, The Bad, The Ugly.  Micro-managment dies exist. Benefits are great. Employee discounts are everywhere. Shift preference goes by seniority."
good,"With the company for 24 years.  Good advancement. Always enjoyed the work and people I worked with. The opportunities are there, but they will not be handed to you. Be productive and you will thrive with the company."
good,"Boeing can offer you stability in it's many faucets of the business.  There are opportunities in many fields.  In my experience, training is poor but my manager is exceptional."
good,I don't have a review. I am off today and my family is waiting for me. and this application is forcing me to write something here. I feel I've already provided more than enough info.
good,"Lots of interesting stuff to work on, but promotions are rare and when you do get one the pay bump will not be competitive enough. Definitely a great place to begin your career."
good,"Boeing has good benefits and work life balance."
good,"Redundancy and full of burocracy in the manufacturing process and planning. in order to develop and organization more dynamic, and efficient evaluating preform and recognition of production sites. instead of centralize manufacturing and eliminate waste on building, land and equipment."
good,"It was a fun, comfortable place to work at, the people were nice and friendly,  Any problems, the lead will help us. Overall just a calmn peaceful atmosphere."
good,"Boeing can provide you with a great wealth of experience and skills if you are willing to work for them. The opportunities are there for individuals that are willing to work hard to succeed. Boeing is becoming more competitive from a compensation perspective but the best thing employees can do for themselves is to gain experiences and skills from the largest aerospace company in the world, then leave the company to use those new skills for other companies where they will be better compensated. It is a shame that the company knows this and they are slow movers in this regard. The overall compensation and benefits packages are not attractive enough to keep their top talent from leaving as the reputation alone is not enough to keep people from being lured away for higher compensation elsewhere."
good,Great work-life balance but compensation/bonuses is not based on individual performance so top performers get discouraged to give their best.  Some groups have very old-school mentality and innovation is not always welcome.
good,"Good wages,  benefits are great.   Advancement is moderately OK if you work at it. A lot of opportunity for women in the workplace,  very liberal work environment."
good,"Work your MRP create PO’s"
good,"I enjoy working at Boeing. The hours may be long, but the pay is good and the benefits are great. There always seems to be a workload (at least in my department) that will keep you busy and allow you to take lead on special projects."
good,"Personally, I have had a good experience working with Boeing. With expanding operations, the work culture is in Boeing is more dynamic in nature. The management for some teams are new and have a lot of learn."
good,Working in the Workshare group at Boeing was a very interesting time. I got to work with blueprints and a great many wonderful people.  We worked with Italy and Spain on their products. It was a learning experience!
good,"A good company to work for when you are young or middle aged.  Not so for older workers. "
good,I have had the opportunity to travel to many places in my work.  I have had the opportunity to learn and apply many new things in my career.  I have worked for and with some really great leaders and managers.
good,"Good work Place with with good Salary, Scope of growth is there not , but management is not good. No chance of foreign assignment except US person. Its purely US  company."
good,"A typical work day would entail of great customer service, merchandising, problem solving and building new connections for our brand. The most enjoyable part of the job is building long lasting relationships with our customers."
good,"Great benefits for full time employees.  For the work that is being done and required compensation is low.  Career advancement is very hard due to that most of the jobs are already pre selected candidates, interviews are just a way to be compliant with HR."
good,"Boeing was a great place to work with challenging assignments, travel, good work/life balance and great people. They had competitive salaries for the industry and the area with career advancement for those who worked hard."
good,Boeing is a good company to work for. The program and location I work at is a very flexible work environment. Manager does not micro-manage. People are able to work remotely if needed.
good,"Excellent Benefits, Vast opportunity, Tuition Reimbursement, Excellent job security, competitive salary, yearly bonus, decent work/life balance, paid vacation/sick leave"
good,"I found the work at Boeing to be bureaucratic, but the staff was pleasant. The work was a bit stale in that they are very conservative on the use of new technologies, but they give you the freedom to do your job, and get what you need to done. This was a remote contract so I work from home which was very nice. "
good,"This place has great benefits. Overtime is great. 3x pay on holidays. Medical, dental, vision for $22. Max out pay at 6 years. It is super boring work and leaves you feeling empty inside."
good,"Regular shift work in cubicles when in FWB. On the road we have duties and responsibilities to the effort that is asked of us to complete the tasks or mission. "
good,"For the most part I have had a good experience at Boeing, I have learned so much about the industry and expanded my skill set in many ways. Boeing has great benefits,"
good,"Typical day at work is 8 hours, but overtime when needed. Like the chances to further yourself. I learned about the chances to learn more and their tuition reimbursement plans. Workplace culture is great but can be worrisome when things slow down. The hardest part of the job is trying to work while on a 60-day layoff notice. The most enjoyable is the many special events that happen for different occasions."
good,Good 1st job. Benefits are great and culture is decent. Pay is ok. Management doesn't know what's going on which is a hindrance most of the time. Easy to take time off and no real negatives besides slow pace
good,"Excellent place to work. Great benefits and salary. Team atmosphere. Strong union which made removing those who did not want to follow health and safety instruction difficult if not impossible."
good,"Work life balance was good and they allowed a flexible schedule.  "
good,"I learned all of my professional skills from my time working at Boeing, including program management, leadership and business development.  The culture is ""old Aerospace"" and it is very difficult to influence change due to the heavy layers of management and bureaucracy."
good,"I had great managers that looked out for their people. Great work culture and great company to work for; excellent benefits. There is a reason their stock went from a $23 low to over 300, in 20 years."
good,"The problem with Boeing is that they think they can recruit college hires and they can take the place of the older Employee (the one with all the wisdom).  I'm sorry, but the lack of experience there is obvious.  Boeing will not go out and hire folks with experience.  They are quite cheap when it comes to that.  They look to hire the young person, develop them over a long period of time until they make to much, then they will get rid of them. It's an average life at best and you'll never make $150,000 here.  I'm just being honest, so you don't get mislead."
good,"Worked with diverse people and areas of expertise on a daily basis. It gave me opportunities to learn how the airplane production systems worked and how to work with people from different parts of the world as well as different levels of expertise. Management are open to new ideas and willing to collaborate with every member of the team to ensure that the company is providing quality and cost effective products and that people's morale and safety are not sacrified."
good,"Working here is just like anywhere else, it is what you make it. If you want it to be difficult to work at, it will be. If you want to be successful and do what is necessary to advance, the opportunities are there."
good,Long term career opportunity. Free college opportunities. Good work environment. Great benefits. Convenient location just off I-60. Profit sharing and 401k matching. Good retirement plan.
good,"Enjoy working there, and the environment. just currently need more pay because of family situations. The staff are all friendly, and the managers care what you have to say and work on it"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Boeing."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work but being a union work force many hourly employees take advantage by abusing the policies set in place which made it hard for leadership perform his/her role, many times causing us to receive corrective action. Each changes would take place causing  huge factory backlogs thus causing  delays on deliveries."
good,"enjoyed working at boeing. Very competative pay, Very interesting work. Would of loved to retire there. but was unable due to lay-off. would go back in a heartbeat."
good,The job site was clean and well organised. My co-workers were experienced technicians like me. The management team listened to my opinions and acted upon them. All together i would say a great company to work for.
good,"Boeing was a great place for me to work for 25 years of my career.  They provided great opportunities for learning other jobs within the company.  They offer great medical, dental and saving benefits."
good,Not a atypical career at the company  Most people can report that their time this is beneficial and productive.  The company has a diverse and motivated workforce of professionals.  The group can effectively and consistently work together to achieve substantial accomplishments in short time.  They have the resources and systems to back up the brightest ideas that come along.
good,"I worked at Boeing for 33.9 years, and enjoyed it most of the time.  No employer is perfect, but Boeing comes close."
good,"Come in, do your job, and go home.  Very rare to find a culture of a team that you can get involved with and become invested in.  Almost zero awareness of how to create a happy employee environment."
good,"Boeing can be a great place to work depending on the location and the business objective. There are several organizations within Boeing. They promote One Boeing but they have a long way to go to achieve that goal. My experience is mostly positive and I would encourage anyone interested in working at Boeing to go for it. They have an outstanding education program, one of the very best benefits available."
good,"Best part of Boeing is the people.  Most managers are also great about encouraging a healthy work/life balance, depending on your position.  Long holiday break in December is a plus."
good,"Production is indeed schedule driven, so challenge exists to quality. "
good,"Great long term position but salary does not cover cost of living in the Seattle area. Awesome long term possibilities to move up in the company but unless you are from the area or have been here any length of time, you will not survive here. The price of housing and fuel is so high that you can't afford to be here."
good,"On a typical day, you come in and get started.  Good environment, with Good co-workers. You get the computers ready for the new employees and we also address the daily computing issues."
good,"Recovery Aircraft and Modifications "
good,"The benefits and work area of Boeing depends on management and program. Some programs are hectic, ie 737, while others are slow, ie 747. A lot depends on the management running the production floor. Some first level managers love to micromanage every second of the day, while others just let the Team Leads for the mechanics handle day to day operations. As a career as a whole, its not bad. The pay is fair for the first six years, then IAW 751 Union members ""max out"" according to which pay grade. Boeing offers plenty of classes and courses to help people advance, and also offers $3,000 a year in tuition assistance. "
good,"Boeing was a great company to work for.  They paid for my education all the way through my masters degree.  They have great benefits and a great bonus program,"
good,"I worked 1st shift 6:00am- 2:30pm is the start time but since i was a team leader i was required to come in an hour early and stay over an hour after shift ends, it was very competitive and fast pace on the day shift. From the first day i was hired till the plant closed i enjoyed building aircrafts, it  was what i did and i'm very good at it, management was supportive in removing constraints that may have hindered the process of the ship being completed but it was up to the workers to get the job done under cost and on schedule with quality first work standards."
good,Great company to work for great benefits and there is always room for advancement in this company. You have chances to do training online and go to trainings.
good,"Must have a passion for what you do. Have to be willing to work hard and have a sense of humor. Experience with cross functional teams is a plus. The Supply Chain is global, complex and you have to retain a lot of detail as well as product knowledge."
good,"Worked closely with leads and engineers on complex pressing business situations that required extra effort, and overtime to complete.  "
good,Very well secured work area and very organized system of network work groups. There customer end user associates felt comfortable enough to politely ask for assistance and showed gratitude for work I performed for them.
good,"Was a good job, life balance and with top notch pay. Unfortunately  as an aircraft mechanic you are constantly dealing with the poor ego mentality, backstabbing environment that one comes to hate when you've done it as long as I have.  I also observed some who could not keep their political views to themselves and proved themselves as jack a**** in the workplace. But hey its Boeing and as a mechanic it doesn't get much better than this!"
good,"Money was wonderful, but lot of politics and racial tention.  work was heavy some days and then light some other days.  Good thing was once done with work you wee done for the day"
good,Because the  Company is focusing on cutting production costs the majority of the research projects and resources have been transferred to other States. I think overall opportunities still exist although a little scarce. I hear the Company is ramping up in resources.
good,Only worked there about 3 months. People were friendly and helped me a lot. I enjoyed working with my manager who helped me put presentations together.
good,Very dynamic and exciting. Enables employees to seek more education opportunities.  Management and culture is excellent. Enjoyable place to work.  But not very stable.
good,Flexible hours. Very good salary and excellent tools for day to day duties.
good,"Generally was able to go in work quietly at my desk. Management was very flexible and generally supportive of all of my efforts, but often I received little direction from them."
good,When I worked there it was a very good place to work.  Boeing still does periodic layoffs because of the cyclic nature of the airline industry.  The work was interesting and there were always opportunities for advancing your.self or even changing your career
good,My time with Boeing was as a contract with CSC.  I enjoyed the team and management while working on the contract.  I was a RMS ITOC Analyst charged with monitoring Boeing's enterprise.
good,"A typical day at work - varied over the years.  At first I would perform routine sustaining engineering. Over the years, I would be involved in many different aspects of aircraft electrical design."
good,Great benefits with Boeing.  Management is lacking in most areas.  Communication is not the best from upper management down to the rest of the employees that make everyday Boeing happen.
good,"Was hard to accomplish anything with all the hoops to jump through. But, it paid well and there was always something to work on new if you didn't like what you were doing. I never really felt like I was being fully utilized and it was hard to finish anything (take it from conception to implemented) in engineering world."
good,"Boeing is a great, well run and solid company. I enjoyed the advancements that I made through hard work in the manufacturing area. Corporate is a little more difficult to advance in."
good,"Great place to work, with great benefits, expect to work 10 hours a day, with High demands to get work accomplished, Management can be a little overwhelming at times"
good,Boeing Defense is heavliy driven by government regulations. Job responsibilities require on the job training. Fair management and great work life balance. Opportunities to work virtually on case by case basis
good,"Depending on the program, this is an exciting place to work.  The programs involve high technology and allow the individual to thrive by making significant contributions."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work, with good benefits and good people."
good,"In the past I have enjoyed many interesting assignments.  I considered myself very fortunate as there are many jobs that I consider monotonous.  "
good,There's a reason why Boeing is leading the Dow. It's a great company with a great company culture. They make innovative products and very good benefits.
good,I worked at Boeing for over 28 years and it was very interesting and exciting. I was able to advance from a technician level to a senior engineering role.  Hard work and effort paid off in advancement and salary advances.
good,Its great building for the military and knowing you are part of the military program. You learn a lot from other team members and also listen to music ( with earphones) while you work. Conversation are carried out with the team. Great Job.
good,Day varies on work flow and project. Wide variety of skills and challenges can keep the day moving and fast paced. In general work with a good group of coworkers. However advancement can be minimal and tough in certain departments.
good,"Productive and fast paced, constant crisis management. People were amazing. Made lifetime friends. Good mentorship. Unfortunately the lack of common application at he grass roots level on behalf of senior level management leads to a total lack of character."
good,First level management is very effective. Ability to perform job assignments with little management interference. Acknowledgement for job well done. Great benefits.
good,The Boeing Company has gone through a lot of changes past 10 years with the introduction of new airplanes and competition from Airbus Industries.  A newer cost conscious culture has emerged that puts downward pressure on all employees.
good,Work at Boeing is somewhat balanced.  There are stressful time as working in the labs often we are the final stop after production so pressure is on to complete testing quickly.  Enjoy the employees and the culture is sound.
good,"The people at Boeing are for the most part there to do a good job. There is a since of pride among the work force. It can become stressful at times, but for the most part its a nice place to work."
good,"I worked as a procurement agent at Boing for about 1.5 years. Slow paced environment with a ton of bureaucracy. Tool and process a tedious and most systems feel like they were built in the 1980's. Would be more tolerable of the pay was better, but they pay below market value. Some people do well in this environment, but not for me."
good,Switched jobs every couple of years to keep busy and vary my experience while keeping ties to old jobs and loaning back to them as necessary.  Good culture and they treat you fairly as an employee.  Benefits are good so salaries aren't as high as some places.
good,"Approve all non-conformances and provide final inspections for all missiles leaving the facility. The workplace culture is great, each person help out with the different inspections."
good,"If it isn't documented, it isn't done."
good,Fast paced production environment. Job was to solve problems to keep production moving.  The planes have to keep going out the door to keep the money coming in.
good,"learned to build hardware for rockets for NASA"
good,Boeing is iconic in every way - it's a pleasure to be part of the One Boeing organization as it reinvents itself with the creation of the Boeing Global Services business.
good,You learn a lot in this job. Very typical day to day routine. Contractors are treated differently. Being Boeing is better than being a contractor for boeing.
good,"worked on 787 boeing aft section of the barrel. inspected fasteners, and removed and replace bad fastener to boeing spec's. work with inspection. learned how to work with composite"
good,"In a modification environment, it is very fast paced.  Many changes daily and always responding to special shop requests for support.  Always opportunities for improvement for cost reductions. Opportunity to work with diverse people and all support organizations."
good,Working in a large scale aerospace project is challenging but fulfilling. There are many experienced engineers to learn from so the people are what makes this company great.
good,Marginal company to work for.  Policies and procedures are at times unclear to the aircraft maintenance technician. The hardest part of the job is working in a hot environment.
good,Great facilities and a well deserved reputation for excellence. Its a large company so there were opportunities to work in different areas. It was great to be part of something that takes a large dedicated team to accomplish it.
good,This was a very interesting place to work.  The local Technical Writers were inexperienced but willing to learn.  There was a lot of interaction between permanent staff and contract Technical Writers. A hard place not to shine.  Basic knowledge lacking in permanent staff.
good,"The worlds largest aerospace manufacturer is unlike any other company on the planet.  The current board of executives is trying to run the company like Toyota and it;s destroying the company.  The benefits are great, and it's the best place in the world to work if you love airplanes."
good,"Fast paced."
good,"During the internship at the plant I was able to learn a lot of how the company maintains it's equipment. The only real downside was that since I was only intern there were some things I was unable to do, but this was largely due to potential safety problems and the current managers wanting us to stay safe."
good,"Overall a great place to work.  "
good,Very friendly and fun environment to work in. The people made the work life that much more enjoyable. great camaraderie. Management decision making can be a head scratch-er at times but overall they make good decisions for the future of the company.
good,"Leadership let me do my job and afforded broad lattitude to lead as I felt necessary.  Yes, there were some managers who were unfair and did not appreciate the efforts of others but these were few and far between and ultimately became the vicitims of thier own devices."
good,"Boeing offers a great work-life balance and benefits. It can be hard to promote depending on what business unit you are working for. In my experience, management has been great and supportive. Plenty of learning and training opportunities. Lots of great employee engagement activities around campus to keep people moving."
good,"Good work environment and people are nice.  Not too much experience needed in some jobs.  Raises are great.  the work is repetitive, but steady.  Fun atmosphere"
good,"This job had a huge variety of take to perform. From setting up shipments with FedEx to scheduling international shipments on dedicated cargo planes, it was always exciting."
good,I was a contract worker so my experience did not necessarily reflect that of a full time employee. I enjoyed it immensely and would return if there was a spot available.
good,"Nothing special. Work hard, get paid well. Benefits are great. Ability to move around to other areas of the company. Best 401K program around. Unfortunately, no more pension for younger workers."
good,I've learned a great many things while being here at Boeing. Some skills that I learned through being more innovative to accomplish my jobs here and streamline processes.
good,Boeing is a great place to work. Salary is somewhat below market average however the medical and other benefits are awesome. Management is not very transparent regarding business unit changes.
good,A lot of change is currently going as Boeing transitions to its 2nd century and looks to remain competitive with existing competitors and new entrants into the market.
good,"A Cool place to work. Working for a BIG company can take getting used to. Working conditions are great, pay is a bit above average for the area, health benefits are also pretty good."
good,The work place was full of up to date equipment and software.  There was an ability to purchase necessary equipment to get the job done correctly.  Overall it was a great place to work.
good,"The diversity and inclusion initiative at Boeing has been rewarding from the education provided. Unfortunately, I am not certain the success criteria nor resulting metrics from the global efforts, but again, the education received has truly enriched my personal morality."
good,"It's a great company to grow and develop your career, pays very well and the benefits are excellent."
good,"Boeing benefits for engineer are on the decline, as they eliminate the pension, reduce raises, increase health insurance costs. However, the work environment is typically good even for aerospace, flex schedules such as 9/80 or 4/10 are common and mobility in the company to move to different skill-codes, and different programs and locations is also common and relatively easy."
good,"Work life balance at Boeing was great. They are very understanding and lenient when it comes to family and they are all for taking vacations. Most other companies make you go through a long process to get vacations approved, and this company did not. In fact, they WANT you to take vacations because then you are refreshed and ready for work."
good,"Fun job in an interesting field of work. People here really care about what they do. Enjoyed the 9 hr day, 80 hr schedule that gave me every other Friday off."
good,The company's Business model is old and antiquated.  Simple tasks that should take a few minutes are dragged onto days without clear resolution.  Upper management is only concerned about maintaining their jobs as opposed to generating new and innovative streams of new technology contracts.  Mobility is based on who you know and not what you know or how well you are doing your job.  There is no sense of urgency.
good,"The satellite industry from proposal/design to fabrication and test, to launch, and to in-orbit test has been a very rewarding career.  The work varies over the life in the factory and can include world travel if desired. People are very easy to work with and are the top performers in the industry."
good,"Working at Boeing has given me the chance to live out my childhood dream of being an engineer in the aerospace and defense industry.  Engineers at Boeing are challenged with incredible problems and given the flexibility to solve those problems in the most innovative ways.  The benefits, including salary, are above par.  And so are your colleagues."
good,Boeing taught me a valuable skill in both Scheduling and Cost Analysis. I worked various sites throughout the country which turned out to be a great benefit. I think it's a great place to work.
good,"good place, nice people, decent pay and benefits- stable company good working environment. nice benefits package -overtime. good hours and management is fair too. Enjoyable day to day job duties. Felt valued as an employee"
good,"Limited opportunities for advancement in the geographical area.  However, team and local management is technically adept and fun to work with/for.  Pay is decent but not great, benefits are good, and work/life balance is a major selling point."
good,Boeing was a fun place to work for.  It is a very big company and har to connect with upper management.  The culture had many workplace activities to boost moral.
good,"Benefits and pay are great"
good,The greater Boeing company has a variety of jobs and projects to work on. There are experts available in all technical fields that can be called upon for assistance. It is a stable workplace and the overall compensation package is reasonable. It can be difficult to do something new as the bureaucracy is set up to do what is already being done efficiently so one must be patient if a new process or procedure is to be tested and adopted. The company does seem to care about its employees and provides services and benefits to enhance one's life in general.
good,Commercial Aircraft company that fabricates both commercial and military aircraft and equipment. Employees 1000s of people worldwide and offers reasonable benefits and comparable pay to like companies. Security is not a strong point.
good,I enjoy working at Boeing and would recommend the company to any of my friends.  The company is very large which allows for many opportunities for advancement or career changes.
good,I started working for Boeing right out of the USMC to get heavy jet experience. The job was one of great opportunity to learn as well as to work for the industry leader with outstanding compensation and benefits.
good,Wonderful company to work for. Exciting new things to see and learn daily. Several opportunities for growth and expansion. Great benefits and compensation for all levels of employment
good,Great experience working with the latest defense technology.  The workforce is older and the employees provide great insight on how to succeed within the company.
good,"Pros:  Very talented employees.  Great benefits and compensation.  Lots of internal openings and potential for growth if willing to relocate."
good,Go into work on time find out via your lead where you will be assigned working on jobs you are certified for . Safety classes are mandatory  along with classes pertaining to your job.
good,"I always thought it was a good day when the boss wasn't around. if a situation cannot be controlled by management, how is the low end of the pole supposed to solve it.. ex;;"
good,"To much politic, the company is big, you needed buddy to protected to layoff. I don't like about the Union rule either, the classified the ranking, the boss may like some buddy."
good,"Benefits package is second to none, and the work environment is relatively laid back.  You are able to choose your own schedule for the most part within working hours of the day.  Management is open to speaking with employees, and coworkers generally get along.  "
good,Boeing is a company that you can make work for you depending on the paths you take. I advise every employee and future employee to take advantage of the developmental opportunities that Boeing has to offer. Whether it be education or career advancement this company does have many organizations to assist with employee improvement. The biggest key I can give is NETWORKING!!
good,"Projects include: Supporting the P-50 model production line examples: Relocated up to 75 employees to new bays, including cubicals, computer equipment, and office furniture. Updated Factory signage, relocated barges in factory, remodeled paint room, installed network drops, provided layouts in AutoCAD,"
good,"Arrive on time usually early, morning meeting of what needs to accomplished, retrieve materials/tools and perform the required tasks. Co-workers were great to work with."
good,"Work day starts early, ends early, but if you work at one of Boeings main factory sites parking is very limited and long distances from that parting to office or shop workplace."
good,"I've worked in Production Support my entire Boeing career and feel it's the best position to have since it involves working with the design teams and the mechanics on the production floor. It allows you to move about the factory to help expand knowledge in various areas of the production process. I've experienced great management and terrible management in the various groups I've worked in, but feel that up until recently they've really taken employee opinions into consideration. The hardest part of my job is ensuring all parties involved with issues are satisfied within their desired time frames, which are relatively short due to the fast pace of production and contract deadlines we're held to, but it's nothing unmanageable. The most enjoyable part of my job is being to interact with the airplane, the people who design and build it and being able to fix a problem within an instant's notice and see it applied in production immediately. I also enjoy the variety of work performed and the various customers for which this work is completed."
good,"Good place to begin your career as an engineer. Many systems, lots of opportunity to learn the aircraft. Working on the floor will teach you more than you will learn behind a desk."
good,Boeing had a great work/life balance as the company is older and doesn't expect you to be a wizard and live to work. Tech is older since the money is in making planes.
good,"Great place to work, professional environment and great people.  Benefits are excellent, and many opportunities to advance and grow personally and professionally, really enjoyed my employment at Boeing."
good,"I am lucky as i got chance to prove myself at airport when i was under Jet Airways.Everyday was challenging for me as i use to take  responsibilities to send flight on-time.Lot of typical situation i faced when flight get cancelled,rescheduled,delay etc.I have learned so many things like how to take responsibilities,how to maintain myself,politeness etc.I got very good Manager,great work environment and supportive co-workers over there.I faced lot of problem when i went Bombay for Load and Trim training as it was very Difficult to get 80 mark out of 100.That was hardest part in my professional life but i took challenge and finally i got the position.I enjoyed lot as every day was learning,meeting people,various language ctc."
good,"Small Govt contract, did not last long due to budget cuts. Boeing was my third contract job. They took care of me while looking for work once I was laid off."
good,"I like Boeing and they have have good to me.  Boeing, like most big companies, is struggling to cope with an ageing workforce and an emerging new culture of melineials"
good,This is a great company with many amazing people.  I was proud to be a part of the company.  The only gripe was there were times when employees clearly did wrong and there were no repercussions.  I am a believer in positive and negative reinforcement.
good,"I worked with the lead drafter for the Facilities department designing, creating, and updating building drawings. We stored, indexed, and made a made a more efficient system for the mechanical, structural, and architectural drawings."
good,"Boeing is a great company that provides great benefits and really actually cares about the safety of their employees. Currently, they are facing stiff competition from Air Bus so company morale isn't at the highest where it should be."
good,"overall good for benefits and compensation, management were great with training for new employees, great customer service."
good,"An international juggernaut that everyone has heard of. Basic large company benefits and compensation are up to national averages. The work depends on what you are doing in a company that employs more than 70,000 people in Washington state alone."
good,Great employees and culture. Enjoyed facilitation with customers I was assigned to. There was a lot of room to create change and new Lean values for said customers.
good,A great company to work for. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Benefits are great and very competitive. A comfortable work environment. Management takes good care of there employees.
good,"Employment was very good, but management was lacking in experience.  Benefits were excellent.  Work environment was good, fellow employees were excellent."
good,"Everyday was challenging and exciting something new each day. Constantly challenged by management to reach potential, enjoyed the people and was respected for work performed by my peers and management."
good,"- work-life balance is encouraged"
good,"I enjoyed working for the program, typically I managed the daily progress of each project. I maintained dashboard of daily engineering performance to the planned project. Notified managers and engineer of upcoming or delinquent jobs to be completed. My co-workers were a great team to work with, they were accepting of inputs and requirements that I may have needed completed in a timely manor. My managers were very supportive and helpful."
good,"Interesting work. Good teams. Great benefits. hey trust in their employees to do good work. Boeing recognizes  good work with raises, recognition, and upward mobility."
good,"Strong, ethical company.  Provides ample training opportunities.  Benefits are excellent.  Some manager are excellent however, some are technically focused and cannot manage people."
good,Laid back work place. Worked on two different military aircrafts so I was able to learn different procedures on how to prep the aircraft properly. Managers aren't really helpful. Most of the training is done by the FT employees. Required to stand for most of the shift sanding or painting.
good,"As a team member of your organization, I provide;"
good,Very good at work/life balance. Although the different locations all seem to be in their own world and have a very different company culture.
good,"I was only there for one year during college, but my time there was fun.  I was given a generous offer to stay on as a programmer after college but decided against."
good,"The Boeing company, integrated defense systems unit was really good in terms of benefits, with a saving plan, stock program and many employee perks that actually helped with work-life balance."
good,"The best part about Boeing is their benefits. Its a lot of fast paced work and a safe environment. When you get to work they put you in a time crunch to get everything done and you must ask permission to do anything that may change your job slightly. There is lots of diversity. Some workers cannot read in English. However, it is very rewarding to get the job accomplished everyday."
good,The company has great opportunities for all career levels. Vision and mission statements are attainable with hard work and perseverance.
good,"Good place to work at times tough to advance.  Nice people  "
good,"I have worked at Boeing for over 35 years. In that time, I have worked in both the Commercial side and the Military side. "
good,"Started working back in 1983 as a electronic drafter/verification tech. Move into the software development group, Boeing bought out MDC and I moved into the engineering/system adman group and finally as a Team Lead for The engineering gout."
good,"Manufacturing Engineers at Boeing have an incredibly important role of owning the build from womb to tomb and working cross functionally from product development to design to procurement to build and delivery. The management culture is changing slightly for the better now and is trying to leave technical decisions to the engineers.In some cases technical decisions are still being made by some management but the shift is happening. My coworkers were amazing.Like any org you will always have a few that dont have the right attitude but for the most part I enjoyed the time with my coworkers both in work and outside. "
good,A lot of opportunities. The work force operated independent and build and executed their own plans. Management just had oversight and let the projects manage themselves.
good,"A typical day consists of monitoring telemetry on 72 on orbit satellites. Satellites can have major anomalies that require smart and direct intervention to safe the satellite and return the service to the customers for Iridium. While assuming the duties of Mission Director, critical decisions are made and implemented in a precise and timely order. My Direct Reporting Manager sits next to me which keeps my personal performance at a high level in all situations of anomalies or normal maintenance operations. The co-workers that I have the pleasure working are highly intelligent college grads from various engineering fields. The rotating shifts and extended work hours make this job particularly difficult sometimes. Recovering the satellite during a highly technical anomaly is the most rewarding part of the job. Knowing that you saved military men and women during times of conflict with impeccable satellite communication is quite an amazing feeling."
good,"Aircraft manufacuring is a complex process, you can learn most of the manufactring knowledge here. Many experienced engineers there."
good,"A typical day at work starts off around 7:30, I get settled in logged into my PC and begin my day by going through emails and responding as necessary.  I look at my schedule and prioritize my daily task.  I then begin to work on my tasks and deliver accordingly.  As I check of my tasks for the day I then begin to work on other responsibilities I am given throughout the day."
good,The work was slow paced due to all the DOD access requirements to the Missile Field.Technical information was some times difficult to get due to the rush to get the field up and functional.
good,A great work place that help individuals to choose their own career path and supports with great personal development benefits.
good,"The Boeing Company is a very diverse company, employee can move up or transfer to different careers within the organization. Boeing encourages education, leadership, mentoring programs, and ability for employees to move up within the management organization. I truly enjoyed my 18 1/2 years working for such an organization. I would work for them again in the near future."
good,Enjoy working at Boeing. Supportive management. clean and comfortable place to work. Good benefits and good pay. Thye look out for there employee's.
good,Great opportunity/friendly personnel/ the pay as a contractor was desirable starting out. I would love the opportunity to work in a management position at the company
good,Great company or I wouldn't have stayed there over 34 years!  Held various positions with great pay and benefits. Exciting military and defense programs that are crucial to the country's national defense.
good,I started working for Boeing becuase I was injured on a  construction site.  was supposed to be temporary position for myself but ended up loving it and staying three years.  Pay is great for job resonsibilities.
good,"- Get my job assignment go right to work"
good,"Great Company with Good working environment."
good,"build cables ,racks ,test cables ,packaging hardware"
good,"Good place to work, advancement opprotunities throughout the company. Great working enviroment, very team based organization."
good,"Work hard and play hard. A very diverse and sometimes challenging venue but it also has many oppurtunistc moments to excel towards better yourself professional and personally. I work with motely crew of gentlemen who embody the ""can do"" attitude which was pivotal in getting the bigger task done. One of the most enjoyable parts was the benefits and the most not so enjoyable part was the ambiguity of being a contractor for Boeing as opposed to being a part of ""big"" Boeing but the experince alone is worth trying."
good,"Good company to work for.  Great benefits.  Through 16 yrs. of employment, met all kinds of management.  "
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Worked in mostly in Renton, working on the production line on 737, 707, 747 , 757 ,And  767 aircraft.  Had many years as a plumber installer.  Installing plumbing systems including Fuel, Hydraulics, and Air, to include Oxygen, and other pressure systems. I worked as a Shop Lead in charge of Test Tech crew.  Sat in as Acting Manager in the Managers absence.  I created a training program to train new employees being hired for the Next Gen Program.  Flight Deck Safety and Hydraulic System Safety operation."
good,Mechanics were very eagar to learn and mangement was great at lower levels. one bad point is they layoff when workload is slow instead of traning mechanics on the weekness.
good,"Boeing gives:"
good,Great company with competitive compensation and benefits. Plethora of opportunities to expand skills and find where you belong.
good,"Overall, not to bad for the younger engineers but the more seasoned folks are the first to go out the door.  That is the worst part of the job."
good,Moving most IT jobs to St. Louis which is not conducive for SoCal employment or advancement.  Few opportunities coming to California.
good,"While I held several Certifications at The Boeing Company in order to preform my job as a ""Integral Fuel Cell Sealer A' there was always more to learn, which I loved about this job. No day was the same as the last, always keeping me on engaged & learning new methods & processes. Co-workers were great & fun to work with."
good,"Daily meeting with management to discuss job assignments and address any safety concerns.  I learned that teamwork is essential in meeting goals and making the work load a  little lighter. I get along well with co-workers going as far to help them out if they are behind on job.  I believe the hardest part of the job was working in a tank environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was completing work on time without any discrepancies because as a mechanic I was focused on first time quality to eliminate unnecessary  rework."
good,"While it has the typical bureaucracy that any large company has, it is a great place to work with plenty to offer if you are willing to stick it out for the long haul. Dont expect to reap any benefits until year 5+ of being there as the old guard presence is large and very influential."
good,"Boeing is a fine place to work. Total compensation package is good. In most cases there is open communication. I found many friends here, it enabled me to make use of my skills and earn my degrees"
good,Worked for over 30 years advanced regularly with hard work. Pushed to curb after I turned 55 and made good money
good,"I worked 12 hours a day one day shift and one night shift some time's 2 night shifts and 2 days shift. I learned additional skills in trouble shooting, my management are good doing everything so the company will succeeds in it's  endeavor in aircraft maintenance service's such as aircrafts overhaul and repair and aircraft lines maintenance services, most of my co-workers are young and they are doing their best to catch up and I appreciate it. The hardest part of my job are doing removal and installation of aircraft parts in short turn around, and I enjoy when the removal and installation of aircraft part did not affect the departure time."
good,"GE leader currently in place is cutthroat and only cares about profit.  They are not developing the workforce for the long term.  Recently eliminated the Boeing pension and I could go on.  They build great airplanes, I hope that continues."
good,"•	Building relationships with partner organisations; implement and coordinate a range of activities and initiatives, designed to have a positive impact on communities."
good,love working at the leadership center but doesnt pay well!!
good,"I enjoyed the flexablity and the versatility that the job has to offer. I get to a do a varity of activies such as consulting ahd advising senior leadership, facilitating strategic Lean events, assessing site against operations Lean Best Practices, coaching and training employees."
good,"The culture is great and Boeing is a good company that holds its people to high standards."
good,"I work with a diverse set of people, from MIT graduates to Techs on the floor. I devolop work instructions for the Tech's to build a satellite."
good,"It's a good place to work but there is a lot of job rotation, there will give you lay off on one room and on the next there will be hiring more people."
good,"A typical day is a busy day from start to finish. The company has a outstanding Lean Six Sigma program. Management training could be better when communicating to increase morale. The most enjoyable part of the job there is the next challenge. The hardest part of the job is getting promoted to the next level."
good,"Outstanding Achievement Award KC-135 Project Team, Employee of the Month, Outstanding Service Loyalty Ring, Numerous Awards and Recognition for implementing processes saving multi-millions of dollars for Boeing and Lear Sigler."
good,Boeing overall was a very good company to work for. I was there almost 31 years. I tried to advance and move into new skill areas with little luck - in fact the move to marketing/business development damaged my rating.  But overall an enjoyable career.
good,"ability to work independently; schedule meetings, screen phone calls; facilitate staff meetings as well as new employee orientation."
good,"I worked in a heavy structures repair facility.  The tooling was state of the art, best there is.  Little job security though.  It was a short term contract that ended before it was supposed to so I got laid off.  Management was overwhelmed with tech reps but they took time to make each of us feel like part of the team."
good,"Boeing has great benefits, pay is great. Great place to work, but no job security."
good,Great career to work. Aviation is a good field of work. Co-workers are ok and some didnt really like. But overall not to bad a people to work with
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for.  Especially if you're seeking more security and work/life balance.  The advancement opportunities aren't wonderful, but the work is interesting and the people are nice.  You don't have to worry about age discrimination here.  The average age is 50, but these are some really great 50-year-old's.  I would gladly go back, but I live in Austin now and I prefer to look forward to a new adventure, not an old one."
good,"The people are good to work with, but a very fast work pace for contract people."
good,"Good place to work"
good,I took advantage of a significant amount of on the job training that they made available. Sometimes things appeared to moved slow due to politics. The management team was easy for me to work with.
good,"Boeing has been very good to me overall.  The pay and benefits are good but have been in decline (though not unlike the rest of the country).  Job security has become precarious because of recent upper management decisions that no one can really understand.  They are slashing and moving jobs left and right, and morale is low."
good,It was a great atmosphere to work in. I do wish my stay was longer as a contractor. I had assisgnments in which I worked alone. Everything was clean and organize. I can't say enough of this great company I got to work for.
good,Great company to work for if you desire fast pace advancement.
good,"Morning phone meeting on the way to work"
good,I have learned a lot from Boeing. I am a trades mechanic and I am happy with staying here I just don't like western WA. I would like to be in the Spokane area. Its a big company with big company politics. There are lots of opportunities here and lots of training and that is what drew me here in the first place. Overall I am happy with where I am at and it was a long road to get here but I am just not happy with the area.
good,If you think bigger is better then Boeing is for you.  Good benefits and pay.  Excellent computer systems and facilities.  Great learning experience.
good,Overall a good place to be employed. Many opportunities for advancement if a person applies themselves. Unfortunately many did not use the available extra training and were complacent to just collect a paycheck.
good,Great Company to work for with excellent benefits and endless opportunities. Production intensive environment that always tests your knowledge and skill
good,If you want to do aerospace then Boeing is the best out there in that field. Its a large company with alot of opportunities to explore different areas.
good,"*A Typical day includes designing aero components in CATIA V5 and running 2D/3D Navier-Stokes"
good,"Been working here for 3 years"
good,This job allowed alot of room to grow and learn. The work pace was very slow and I was left asking for more work. I enjoyed the ownership i had over my projects.
good,"a good place to work, fun , friendly, and room to grow if you want to.  a lot of different jobs to do."
good,"Excellent company to work for! Great on-the-job paid training, compensation, benefits, co-workers, and overall atmosphere."

good,"The job was great until they sold out."
good,"Gaining my job at Boeing was the crowning achievement in my 20's.  Then, losing it a handful of months later to a lay-off was more than a let down.  But, as I've learned, such is things in the industry that I've chosen to work in."
good,"Typical day was 0700 to 1530"
good,"Diverse and challenging Company with a Global presence. Cutting edge technology, market leader, dedicated to the safety of the country, and offer diverse range of career choices. "
good,"Typical day at work, clocked in ,sanitized my stations and knives before getting started. Gathered my mise en place or materials needed to get the job done. I learned how to manage my time wisely; service started exactly at 11:00 a.m. sharp, no later than that. Time is always important in a kitchen because it goes so fast while you're working. Management was ok , there were times when the schedule was changed or we had meetings and they didnt tell us until the day of. i didn't like that.My co-workers were easy to get along with sometimes , they had their days where they were hard to work with to get a job done so we could be on time. The hardest part of the job i want to say would probably be working on a busy day with no warning or heads up so we could be prepared and know what we were getting ourselves into. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers smile and making their day after sitting in a cubicle all day long in front of a computer. Just seeing that smile and being able to joke around them was all that i wanted and really made my day."
good,Good company with great career advnacement opportunities. Great commercial product line to balance military production line.

good,"Given the high cost of doing business in California, the stability of a job with Boeing in this state is a bit tenuous. That said, Boeing is one of the best companies with which I've had the pleasure of being employed, and if leaving the state was an option, I would be looking for something within the company in another state."
good,"My role was a contractor, but the time I worked for the company was enjoyable and would have liked to be permanent."
good,"Good work life balance, but not a barnstormer for advancement or change. Definitely an old world company so you'll need to put in time prior to being promoted or being allowed to move to another group."

good,Its a pretty solid place to work. Benefits are good. Paid paternity leave is nice for the younger guys. Work can be challenging at times but you always can lean on the guys for support

good,Good pay and fun doing something I haven't done that often. Good location. Good people (for the most part). Getting to and from work was very easy because there are hotels/apartments very close and shopping was easy because they to were very close
good,"Very process driven  "

good,Lots of experienced people that seem to want to ride out the rest of their careers - holding on for deal life.  The management seemed to be connected to the employees and engaged at what they wanted to accomplish
good,"As a Quality Auditor, I would hit the floor running at 5am and not stop until end of the day. I really it because you stayed busy all day and it did not get boring at all. The team I was working with had various backgrounds and many skill sets were involved with the overall process, I just wished they would have kept the group after Christmas break; However,  I went back to work for Spirit with one of their suppliers and trained them on Management Operating Systems and Lean Manufacturing!"
good,"Interning I just saw a small portion, but loved almost all of it. As an aviation enthusiast it was a dream come true to work there. Work flow was very slow moving due to the size and scale of most projects. Culture was a bit old, mix of younger generation trying to prove themselves and the older generation just waiting it out."
good,"i very much enjoyed my experience here and i would love to go back, although my management was not the best but what are ya gonna do. everyone cant always be great."
good,Excellent company to work for for engineering professionals. Employee-oriented and respectful to all employees. competitive salary structure and excellent benefits.

good,"My time with The Boeing Company was  a fulfilling and rewarding experience. My primary job was to perform various tests on Boeing aircraft systems, repair of deficient functions and documentation of all.steps performed in completing said tasks.

good,"Working at Boeing was a great experience, I would recommend anyone to work there. Great benefits nice environment I met a lot of great people there.

good,No review to report. I have been working for Boeing for over nine years total. I started as a contract employee and then applied for and got a direct employee job.
good,"I worked for Boeing in procurement for 1.5 years. Overall my experience was great. The job can be a bit demanding at times due to work load being high at various times of the year and having to deal with the program and engineers breathing down your back about needing parts and have unrealistic expectations. I left the company due to lack of advancement and promotion within the company. Unfortunately, the only way most people are able to move up in the company is to leave for a year or more and apply for a higher lever."
good,"I worked at Boeing at the Everett, WA location as a contractor in the Human Resources department during the divestiture of 3 manufacturing sites.  Management was equally attentive to contractors as to employees.  My assignment was to consult with the department on effective communications for employees in the process of mass layoffs."
good,"Working on DoD contracts means working on decades old technology. It was interesting to see how technology almost as old as I am still operates, and interfaces with newer systems."
good,Great pay.  Great Benefits. They say one Boeing but different rules for different people.  Don't expect to use all your skills. There are limits on what they'll let you do.
good,Boeing is an excellent company to build and grow in your professional career. They provide the tools necessary to do well within your job. They offer great benefits and allow for a great work/life balance.
good,It has been an honor to work on the GMD program for Boeing.  It was a great learning experience and I was able to be part of something very important.
good,"I have worked for three aerospace companies and would place them second. None were bad, but like all jobs, it depends on the management above you. Benefits were good. I would work for Boeing again if the position was a good fit."
good,"The Boeing Company:"
good,"This was my 4th time working at Boeing in a different group SatCom division.  It was an experience.  Unfortunately work is slow and was asked to take leave for 30 days, but will be able to come back afterwards, which I think works better than unemployment.  Hopefully I will be called back after 30 days."
good,good benefits humble and passionate managers educational informative intuitive  good leaders  some employees are book smart but no common courtesy to other culture
good,"Great Place to work at!!!!! Hardest part of the job was location, my typical day was 8 eight hours a day. I enjoy the training provided, it was very detailed."
good,"Good place to learn new things, meet interesting people. Lots of options on where to pursue a career because the company is so big. Lots of complaining from people who think they are mistreated yet they receive good compensation for doing work a teenager could do"
good,"Some days we have to work really hard to meet our dead line. "
good,Good company with benefits but also worried about being laid off based on seniority. Sometimes gave free food and celebrate for good job. PTO is pretty good and insurance is good but a lot is taken out for union fees and benefits.
good,"I was at a Boeing subsidiary, my company having been acquired in 2000. Boeing has a strong sense of it's mission and culture, and a very prominent role in the lives of people around the globe. I was sad to have my department close ultimately, but grateful for my time, and all the people I worked with."
good,"Only worked here for a couple of days, everyone seemed very helpful. It was well organized and very well planned out as an event and went off without a hitch."
good,"Wonderful place to work, hard working crew always striving to do better. Over 6 years I have had multiple head chefs and learned techniques not found in the class room. Improvising at the last min for catering. The crew was my second family, we always help eachother so the entire team can succeed"
good,"Worked as an independent consultant in Seattle, for over a year. Exciting SAP project with a large contingent of external contractors.

good,"Boeing is responsible for manufacturing satellites for private companies and the government. Once the satellite is done and ready to be launched, Boeing needs a way to be able to see and visualize the satellite during and post-launch. That is the main objective of this project, to create a web application so that Boeing will be able to see at any given time where their satellites are in its orbital path. This involves developing the following:"

good,"Great place to work. Had a contract job but work ran out and was let go. I'd work there again if given the opportunity to do so. Nice people, nine facilities work pace to too exhausting."
good,I worked in a DOD area. Boeing is different all over. If you are interested in a job there apply for it.You are hired in a pay scale depending on your level.
good,"Management caters to certain people , ignores problems till something goes wrong. Working there was the greatest most of the time.yoy where free to organize your area as best to suit your needs."

good,Productive and fun workplace. Cookouts and employee incentive are great. Employee benefits are great. Preventive health awareness is important to boeing.
good,"Large company, good managers. One's accomplishments can get lost in the mix."
good,Choose not to answer at this time due to the fact I work for Boeing as  a contractor and do not feel I have the inside knowledge t answer fairly for Boeing
good,good place to work. that's all i have to say.I have learned a lot. I was given many opportunities. Pay is good. People are mostly very knowledgeable.Great company
good,Very unique experience working in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War during Operation Desert Storm.  Allowed me to challenge myself and adjust to different cultures and religious laws.  Worked with a very tight group of individuals that I still stay in touch with today. It was a stressful environment but we turned aircraft 12 months prior to the war and served and an interim prior to the U. S. invasion if Iraq.
good,They quickly bring you in and get you working and take on duties you are capable at. As a contract worker I would welcome the chance to become a permanent employee.
good,"Boeing is one of the top company in United State of America, it is technology driven company. I recommend to new college graduate to join it and learn good engineering skills."
good,Working on every system on an aircraft is exciting. It doesn't take very long before you gain a knowledge of the different systems that make up the aircraft.
good,good place to work! would go back if they were now in my area of living. would recommend to anyone wanting a great place to work and have a future for advancement
good,I always felt valued here and the work was always interesting.  Always lots of opportunities to hone your skills and direct your career path.  Great benefits.
good,"As a mechanical engineer, Boeing established an excellent foundation for me. First six months was extensive training in drawing, design, and part standards, followed by CAD training."
good,The Boeing Company provides training on different software and you should take advantage of all the training I have been trained on different software and further my education with the companies education program.  Work[lace culture is friendly and most of your co-workers will help you if you need help in the tasks that was assigned to you.
good,Awesome place to work.  I have been with the company 11 years now and I like the atmosphere and the people who work here.  Boeing has given me many opportunities for growth and learning and I would recommend Boeing to anyone interested in living in the Northwest.
good,As a contractor I enjoyed the environment of people who were full time employees. They provided an All Inclusive environment and respected the lane of contractors when it came to roles/responsibilities and policies of the company. Very good people to work alongside with lofty goals to pursue as company.
good,"Amazing benefit, company culture is still old and needs to change, decision making process is very slow, nice people, loved my team. Absolutely loved the CEO"
good,"While my time at Boeing was only a few years, I learned a lot about aerospace and enjoyed every moment of it. Every day provided new and exciting opportunities to work on the latest and greatest technology aerospace has to offer."
good,"As with most other companies, the people make the difference. I was fortunate to work with some the most talented individuals in the aerospace industry."
good,"It was a great company to work with. Lots of opportunities and nice co-workers. Great benefits. Good compensations. "

good,I felt happy when I worked for the Boeing company. I enjoyed every day coming to work. It has a professional environment.  People was friendly and nice to work with. The Boeing taught me a lot of skills.
good,A good place to gain skills as well as giving its employees a good benefit package.. however its management doesnt give its employees much room to grow
good,It is a Union job so you have to deal with people that should be fired but never do. Pay and benefits make the job worth the trouble. They recently voted to remove the pension program but replaced it with a lower benefit of performance-based bonuses.
good,"Extrememly technical and management systems aligned to facilitate management capacity.."
good,"Well balanced employment, great people and management."
good,Very competitive environment. Typically worked bars in completing task in a timely manner. Was monitored by management and leads on progress. Workplace culture was comfortable because everyone worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was being loaned out to other groups and expected to know what the jobs were and needed to be completed.
good,I've worked at Boeing for 10 years. They don't have technical interviews which is a little odd. Other than that the benefits are great and the people are smart.
good,"Relaxed place to work."
good,Strategic direction and implementation of plans and programs solid.  Team I worked with was outstanding and constituted an opportunity to serve the mission.  I was privileged to work there.
good,Most of the projects I worked on were very interesting and led to good opportunities for learning and expanding my skills. The current company direction is less focused on research and would probably appeal more to engineers than researchers.
good,Nothing bad to say good company. Awesome benefits It pay for school also. I would recommend Boeing to anyone. Its hard when on the floor and trying to move up. But other than that good company
good,"It was a good place to work.  I learned a lot and enjoyed work with the employees and the events that was sponsored at the site.  The site has grown a lot in the pasd few years, its become it's own city."
good,"The company offers many opportunities for leadership and advancement at a rapid pace.  The pay is competitive and the education and, health benefits are unmatched."
good,Great work life balance. Flexible time. Opportunities for career advancement. Great company culture. Telecommuting. Free fruits twice a week. Great coffee
good,Typical aviation environment. Good pay with good benefits. Sometimes mundane work and sometimes something new to learn. Its feast or famine with workload.
good,"Daily routine included managing Executive VP calendars, travel, expenses.  Trouble shoot and resolve any issues.  Manage meetings, catering and logistics.  hardest part of the job is to make sure nothing is missed during a hectic changing day.  The best part of my day is to resolve issues quickly and accurately while operating in a diverse work environment."
good,"I should be paid 15 to 18 an hour because I was doing some on catering while my boss was having a baby. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the Boeing Company. i was able to to operate with autonomy while having a really strong team and support system.
good,"Start your day with a quality meeting..with Boeing you learn as you go because their are so many well experience old timers there to help and guide you along the way, experience is the best teacher...The work place is diverse and good people to work with. The hardest part of the job is actually only what you make it..The most enjoyable part of the day is when you have a good manager that comes to you at the end of your shift and congratulate you on a job well done."
good,"Typical work day could included any and or all of the following:"
good,"Very good company with lots of benefits, great partnership. Outstanding work culture. Diversity is the biggest down fall, this is an area the company has to improve."
good,"Boeing Commercial is above the average set by companies in the aerospace industry."
good,"Work environment is modern, good place to work. It is a long walk from the parking lots to the work place unless you arrive between 5:00AM and 6:00AM. Everyone is very helpful to help you get your mission accomplished."
good,"People have multiple views of Boeing, especially BSC. I honestly will say I would have never achieved what I have if I hadn't started a career at Boeing. Not many companies offer the training, schooling, certificate programs, 401K plans, benefits and everything else that they offer their employees. If you have the desire to actually progress and set goals, there are always more that enough people willing to help you. You have to be the driver of your own life, and Boeing allows you the tools to achieve the goals you set ahead out to reach. Yes there are downsides, issues, complaints, etc, but that is anywhere you ""work"". Go to work enjoying what you do, work towards your goals, and you will love it. It does not happen immediately, but put in the hard work, sweat, and stay focused and you can basically go anywhere."
good,"Boeing is the single largest manufacturer of airplanes.  Due to it's size the are many opportunities to advance.  A day in the Facilities Department looks like a multi-layered set of blueprints.  Our group designed office space by consulting with the in-house customer, collaborating with the engineering team, and building out the concept with the construction group.  It took months to complete and millions of dollars of funding.  Fun times for employees who love long, detailed projects."
good,"Boeing is a large company with many opportunities. I found that they are very intertwined and can be difficult to move around in the company. I learned a lot working in the facilities group, I loved the people I worked with. Most people were about 5 years away from retirement, the pay is low compared to other places and the Costs of living there, but it is great experience!"
good,good company exciting to work on planes.  Only reason I left was because I moved out of the area.  The employees were nice the job kept stuff interesting and proper training was given
good,Boeing is a terrific company to work for. I left due to the extreme cost of living in the Pugeot Sound area. Seattle and the surrounding area has a major housing problem. The soaring costs of housing make it very hard to live a life of any pleasure other than work to pay for a place to live. My compensation with Boeing was not enough to maintain a place to live and save money.
good,A company whose main focus is on customer satisfaction and first time quality of all products. Interaction with the customer on a routine basis promotes a well-rounded working relationship.
good,"Worked 2nd shift 2;30 to 11;00. Doing structural repairs and mods. "
good,"Had a great time and learned a lot, worked on a new computer system conversion while getting paid for it.  Able to take all my new skills on word. Loved my co-workers"
good,It was a great place to work with amazing products and people all around the world. The people are friendly and it a nice work life balance working for boeing
good,I wish that I had never left Boeing to go contracting.  Pay was low and 1 good raise I could have stayed. Was slow with raises back then.  Years later I am sorry that I left. Prior to the merger with McDonald Douglas it was great place to work.  After McDonald Douglas took over Boeing as the got  1 for 1 stock options had a ton of stock and Boeing brought in their failed management that was driving Boeing down like did their own business.
good,"A least the team I belong to cares about each other as each and every single individual see the ""bien-etre"" of the team first prior to his/her. Also, there is a sense of camaraderie within the team while we respect the boundaries."
good,Great atmosphere. They offer advancement in different career paths. Building and facilities are nice. Good people development and the culture is always advancing
good,"My tasks were always scheduled as I worked in facilities"
good,"My review of this company should not be required.  This information is not relevant to my current job search.  Consequently, I will not be providing this information."
good,Interesting work and great people to work with. Boeing had all the engineering tools I needed to perform my work. That doesn't happen very often. Management was engaged but did not micromanage in any way. Fellow coworkers were eager to assist when asked.
good,Excellent company. Excellent customer focus. High-quality goods and services especially in the Government sector. Workplace culture is dynamic and results-oriented.
good,Able to work flexibly within acceptable limits.  Family friendly and understanding of good work life balance. Very conscious of health and safety - for example no driving while tired or in bad weather
good,Interesting work environment. Good coworkers and people mostly care about their and duties. Can be stable place to work for the long term. Benefits are good.
good,Boeing is a great place to work with constant change.  The people made it so much fun to be there.  If it was not for 9/11 I would still be there.  I just wish they allowed you to work from home at the time but that has since changed
good,Supported hundreds of customers learning new software and hardware. Responsible for supporting several General rank customers and them wanting and needing to be functioning properly in seconds of an issue
good,"I can not write a direct review for the Boeing Company as I did not work for them, but rather as a project through my school that was contracted with them."
good,Boeing will provide great career opportunities for technical and career minded people when willing to relocate. It is still a great place to work for folks with limited relocation options.
good,Boeing is a good place to work. The people are great to work with; some managers are great while others I prefer not to comment on. Allot of time is spent securing charge numbers to allow efficient work.
good,My manager was so awesome.  He enjoyed his job which was nice.  I had the chance to see how things worked up close and personal.  Met a lot of nice people and some not so nice ones.  There were lot of learning opp.
good,"On the job training"
good,Working there was challenging yet rewarding.  There was an open and inclusive environment that supported both personal and professional growth.  It was a good job.
good,"Boeing is an exciting place to work, as there are endless opportunities to push the boundary of engineering. A typical can vary greatly from uneventful to watching the first flight of a new airplane.  The culture at Boeing is very bureaucratic which can make simple requests take longer than necessary. However, it has a great work life balance, the benefits are great and they are pretty flexible about how  you work (within reason). "
good,The Boeing/Spirit Aerosystems company is a very competitive company to work for and demands the best of an employee to maintain their edge against the competition. This is fairly easy to do considering the professional caliber of employees they have working there.

good,Great place to work with great pay. The only negative was being swallowed up by the Larger Corporation when UTC merged and the expensive insurance. No longer as personal and family oriented of a place to work.
good,Its a different culture from other places I've worked.  I think some days they are still figuring them selves out in a more competitive environment.  They can be demanded but they pay very well and the benefits are some of the best.  Lots of opportunity to try different skills and places to go.  I wish I didn't have to leave but due to family needs having to relocate to get closer to family.

good,Boeing is going through a lot of change with trying to incorporate automation.  It has been challenging.  Business function pay is lower than regional competitors.
good,"Your experience with Boeing really depends on your manager. When I first started I had a great manager, really nice, transparent, and supportive guy. Worked hard for his group and showed how he valued you. My next manager was non existent and she would answer any question or concern with ""I wouldn't worry about that"". You find many managers like the title but not the responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at Boeing was anything but boring. It could be unbelievably busy, extremely challenging, frustrating at times, but also, highly rewarding. Especially when a plan came together, despite any speed bumps or road blocks that somehow found their way into my activity as they frequently did."
good,"Great place to work. It was too far from home for my taste. Once you're in the union, they will find a place for you and your needs and work with employees."
good,"An excellent place to work for.  Boeing has an integrated product team (IPT) environment which is conducive to learning, contributing towards the fulfillment of the project as an effective team player."
good,"It has been a good place to work with good people.  Toughest part is that even though I am an engineer, I did not do classical engineering work.  Making it tough to find other jobs.  Be careful not to get pigeon holed."

good,Go for long term career. Great benefits and flexible schedule. Will learn complex accounting information and have a good understanding of business. Will help you grow.

good,"I loved what I did and working for Boeing.  However, I had met some people at a Seminar I was hosting, and they asked me if I would come to work for Honeywell.  At the time, the compensation they offered was too good to pass up."
good,Boeing SC is a very good place to work . It is a very clean and organized work site and organization .It has a very good training program . Boeing SC is generous at rewarding it's beneficial employees.
good,"The opportunity to work as an intern at Boeing was incredible. Unfortunately, it coincided with a shift in the company's strategy that involved announcing the move of most jobs in one division to a less expensive worksite, without moving the people currently in those jobs. It was discouraging to see highly qualified people with many years of experience and expertise dismissed for the bottom line."
good,"I really enjoyed this company but I lived an hour away. The people were great and the managers seemed to look after you. You came in, did your job, and went home. No one bothered you unless it seemed like you were falling behind in your work."
good,"This job, had several job positions: Production Control Clerk, Material Analyst, Configuration Analyst, Release Analyst, Material Management Analyst. All deal with inventory, all working with engineers and buyers, consist of regular office type work, filing, typing, copying, ordering of parts, prepare reports and much more."

good,Planned and managed aircraft budget for Military Aircraft utilizing performance measurement systems.  Prepared Department of Defense customer reports.  Learned aircraft build process and tools for managing and reporting performance.  Excellent workplace culture.  The hardest part was my 60 mile commute.  Enjoyable part was seeing aircraft being built through the production cycle and coming in under budget.
good,Very good reviews. have no complaints.  Very positive input from all those who asked to give input. the most difficult thing about a review is that you don't want to be surprised.  That is to your advantage and sometimes not so much.
good,"Boeing was a great place to work early i ones career, as they designed and made quite a variety of types of satellites.  They seemed to make good hiring decisions, as I thought they had very strong folks working there (or at least they did 15 to 20 years ago)."
good,Great company with great benefits. My job in particular is something I am not suited for. I am looking for something more physically and mentally challenging.

good,"Boeing was an excellent company for a career.  Advancements were fast for hardworking employees.  Skills were encouraged and recognized.

Overall, Boeing was one of the best companies I have worked for and would highly recommend it to anyone."
good,"Was please to work for Boeing, it was challenging and interesting job, opportunities for career growth, benefits, healthcare. Currently experiencing layoffs and budget cuts"
good,"I worked on many programs, Air Force One, E4b's, Tanker program, 747 freighter conversions, Saudi Program, and others. A  typical day consisted of repairing or replacing damaged wiring, It also included trouble shooting the source of the problem,My management was 1'st class and the work culture was great, The hardest duty involved was working in adverse conditions, but I always maintained.I had many enjoyable moments but one that holds a special place in my memories was when the President visited our facilities in Wichita to honor myself and co-workers on the great job we did. We also enjoyed playing basketball at lunch due to the goals provided by management."
good,"Boeing is a great place. I quit and was able to stay home with my kids, otherwise i would have retired from there. Benefits are great and the pay is fair."
good,"All good things - some isolated areas where  the swamp needs to be drained.  Most of the manager are great, knowledgeable, and capable.  Lost of flexibility and forgiveness associated with punctuality for the salaried employees"
good,"I was very happy with my time here, they are fair and diverse. The culture is involving and inclusive, encouraging team work. The only problem is thw planned lay offs."
good,"if this facility will not move then I will stay here to work forever.  I like to work in here, even though it is actually not my real career.   I hope to change my position if I have a chance to continue to work for Boeing."
good,I was working at the long beach facility C-17 engineering group. The experience was ok. The managers were not that great. lots of fluff and talk but no show.

good,Challenging fast paced environment.  Very knowledgeable work force.  Great place for an engineer.  Interesting work on the space program.  Would recommend.
good,Start of the day was usually to let you know where you a team was in relationship to the date to start a new aircraft assembly and finish up the current planes assembly.The use of 3D graphics to see where my assembly fit in the aircraft as vital part to whole aircraft.Management was usually someone that had been where you were years before so they were very knowledgeable about your tasks if needed to ask a question.Most people were willing to give you a hand if you were struggling or just needed assistance.Learning all the proper processes and standards required by FAA to complete the job.They were a family oriented business with several family members working in different areas of the shop and had many functions that included family picnics or tours of the plant.

good,"A lot of smart people, good working floor, but everyone is not having fun. Lots of processes-politics... Have you ever seen office space? Where is my red stapler? Its like working at Inatech."
good,I am doing this review to put the one hundred fifty characters required to submit the application. This should not be a part of the process of submitting an application.
good,"I was a contractor for a year and a half.  Was hoping to be hired full time, but I had to leave before that happened.  Some contractors are treated as family (which I was), and some are quite limited.  It depends on what role you are in..."
good,Excellent opportunities to build working relationship with a wide variety of people. Management support helped when needed we were given much opportunity to strike out on our own
good,"I learned alot working at Boeing.  The Management were very nurturing and educated me about the aerospace industry."

good,I found company to be satisfactory. But have one recommendation regarding Retention Rating (RR) for engineers. I think RR should be abolished immediately.

good,"I learned a lot from this company about satellites, I worked in several areas from production to final assembly. Management was very helpful, engineers worked with you. I hope to take the experience I have learned to help another company."
good,"This is a very fast paced company and the opportunities for learning other functions of aviation are always available. Though it is a very big company, It is difficult to advance unless you move to another facility."
good,It's a good place to work that makes great products but it's a big company so it's easy to get lost in the flow. The company pays well and has great benefits.
good,"Culture was like working with my friends; close-knit and honest.  Managers were fair, helped me pursue my interests, and advanced my career.  I learned to balance the needs of executives and senior managers with those of team members.  I also learned how to lead a team consisting of different genders, age cohorts, and expertise."
good,Had a great first job at Boeing. They offered great training and benefits. Would work for them again in a minute. They have lots of programs to choose from.

good,"Couldn't ask for a better company to work for. The work is steady, job security is strong, and future work is always being targeted.  Management has its strong suits and weakness as does any other company. The benefits, pay and people are the best aspect of the job."
good,"Project Manager/Integrated Scheduler/LEAN Focal (Former Employee), Everett, WA – June 24, 2008"

good,"- Everyday is different. Can work a wide range of different topics."
good,"Boeing is a good place to work but it is everything you hear about large corporations.

In the Seattle area the benefits are great but what you get can vary greatly from city to city."
good,"this only for CDG chenaai,"
good,"I loved working here....Great People...Great Tools,,,,,Great facility....Great Potential....No shortcomings that I came across...DO everything you can to get a job here....even if that means sweeing floors."

good,"Throughout my career the Boeing Company provided very good benefits and a competitive salary, so I seldom needed to focus on money for my family.  Boeing also provided opportunity for education and advancement; I took advantage of both.  I always felt that my hard work, integrity, and being dependable would result in opportunity for advancement and that was the case.  I hired in at the bottom of the pay scale for my initial skill code and retired at the top of the Professional & Administrative skill code.  Most of the time I enjoyed the work and found professional satisfaction within my career path in the area of Product Life-Cycle Management, which includes Configuration Management, Data Management, Baseline Management, and Change Control.  The most enjoyable part of my career was when I worked for Program Management Analysis, when I served as the Baseline Management subject matter expert (SME) for the MM&U Division under the Director Of Program Management. "
good,Great company to work for if you are okay with repeated work. Job security is great if you are a good performer. Excellent benefits and 401k retire. If i wanted a stable job I would work for Boeing.
good,"My experience at Boeing was very favorable.  Learned much about working in the Commercial Airplane building design, build, and testing world with top flight professionals."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for.  They have excellent compensation and benefits.  Even though they are a global company they still do things to show that their employees matter.
good,This job required a top secret clearance.  I enjoyed working with all the pilots.  Once data was processed I got to meet with pilots to discuss the testing data.
good,Each department has its own culture and prcosee. Diverse trainings. Organizational differences in way of doing business. The stress level is changing with economy up and downs. Some leaders are performing better than others in developing the teams and choosing criterias and priorities.
good,Very productive work environment.  Flight test is very different from the regular aviation environment because we're determining how the fleet operates and maintains the aircraft.
good,"If you're looking to get a foot in the door, this is the place.  If you are looking for a career, I'd recommend getting some experience and then seeing what else is out there."
good,"Boeing works on cool and interesting technology, but operates in a slow and bureaucratic fashion. Recent changes to geographically diversify have made the culture across the company a little more site-centric and reduced collaboration."
good,Excellent.................................Good company to work for. Mgmt very professional. Excellent benifits and provided education expense and training.
good,This was a good company to work for.  The benefits are top.  One small problem is that you get locked in to some jobs and limited to more diverse jobs.
good,"The Boeing Company is a great pleace to work. The benefits at boeing are very good and competitive with other aerospace companies. Unfortunatly, Boeing goes through a lot of layoffs and can be stressful. Boeing offers sick time plus PTO."

good,"Boeing has made a lot of changes over the recent decades and one is taking away from employees.  They continue to cut cost by taking away from it's employees while the Executives make more and more money.  Overall, it is a great company to work for, but wages aren't staying competitive with other like companies."
good,"A typical day was well productive involving diverse projects.  I have learned how to plan, develop, perform and analyze human space flight and exploration including space and communication, from the top-down to the bottom-up approach. Management has its pros and cons but as a progressive, effective, efficient system safety engineer the glass ceiling does not exist. Although the workplace culture can be adjusted to totally focus on project missions, I believe overtime this hazard will be controlled and removed. The hardest part of my job was having introspective adjustments with other team players.The most enjoyable part is having a project accomplished without any catastrophic failures."
good,Dynamic and fascinating work - no two work days were the same. Professional environment with top notch people. Lots of opportunities to learn about the various facets of aviation finance.

good,"Boeing Philadelphia was a good workplace environment."
good,"Environment is extremely open to innovation, combining a huge heritage with leadership in new technologies. It's an ideal starting point for your career."
good,Overall its a great place to work. The size of the company leads to many opportunities for technical people. It is really fun to work on projects with world-wide visibility. The size does limits how fast a culture can change or how nice the office environment is though.
good,"Excellent co-workers/amazing people with heart and drive to be the best and build the best products.  Boeing moved from a company of excellence to a corporate culture driven by stock price in the past decade or more."

good,"Keeping a globally distributed, non-standard infrastructure available with minimal down time takes many hands. Management either rotates or changes every few years which made career success a moving target. Co-workers tend to be close knit, even to the point of being like family, which makes departures very hard on morale. "
good,"Great place to work, very friendly people and a great future. Worked just slowed down and they had to down size. But a great place to work at."

good,"Learn exciting work in the aviation industry. Fun to work and a lot of room for growth. Good work place to be. Work with knowledgeable engineers, fellow techs and mechanics."
good,Working as a Supply Chain Management Analyst at Boeing was a very rewarding career.  I was able to develop skills in building databases to pull data attributes.  There is a lot of interaction between multiple internal and external organizations that make everyday a new challenge.
good,Veracode is a SAAS platform that scans applications for security flaws. Developers load up their binary code to the Veracode platform and then scan it for security flaws. The results are kept in the Veracode platform and look just like the flaws found and reported on the OWASP site. The platform keeps record and status of flaws found and mitigated.  Secure applications help strengthen the security posture of the company.
good,Great company to work for but there are a lot of affordability issues that causes very frequent lay-offs (reduction in workforce) and this impacts the work environment in a negative way.

good,BCA is a place that you can stay in for life. It is fast paced and hard work but they pay well and have good health benefits. Work life balance is hard to find with production line ramp ups each year.
good,A great place to work with the normal ebb and flow of work cycles. Some years there were lots of exciting projects to work on and other years employees were scurrying to prove themselves useful. All of my co-workers were very intelligent and motivated. The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering a useful product to the customers and their enthusiasm for the products.

The benefits are great and compensation is not up to industry standards, but what you could expect with a 100 year old company. Depending on the job and organization you are apart of variety in the workplace can be viewed as something everyone loves or hates, or something that is non existent. An company that is flush with engineers forces you to always strive for better things, and creates a challenging workplace that is exciting and exhausting at the same time."
good,Many Opportunities to move about the company. Productive and innovative workplace. Takes 14 years to become a manager. My position was outsourced.

good,"Spent 25 years with the company and appreciated every bit of it and will always thank Boeing for the opportunities."

Very detail oriented and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete work ahead of schedule.

My co-workers are great individuals in which we all work together great.  I have gotten the chance to improve on my heavy equipment skills, my diagnostic abilities, as well as my supervisory skills.  Management has been the toughest aspect.  Not so much on an individual level, but more so on communication.  Ideas do not get taken into consideration, and a lot of situations remain ""in discussion.""  Advancement chances are limited, and evaluations are not as fair as they could be.

I have worked with many of my co workes for many of years and have come to known them quite well.

With knowledge and experience that I have gained throughout my career, I can apply these skills to ship the most reliable products to our end users."
good,"Excellent work environment, processes, procedures, & people"

Management is open to inputs and considerate of different opinions. Co-workers were great and I had a good working relationship with all. The hardest part was seeing the business base fall. Boeing Huntington Beach had several contracts cancelled, FCS the largest This caused the rates to increase and Boeing lost its competitive edge. The job was enjoyable, I was learning every day, there were no work problems. The big issue was just an ability to win new programs."
good,"Final product and good quality, amazing co-workers and good organization"
good,"I joined the AGS/Boeing team to help implement the AGS sourcing contract at Boeing where AGS responsibilities included managing engineering information, the engineering vault, and printing services.

I was the AGS focal in charge of this effort which became so successful I was asked to consult with AGS and Boeing folks implementing the same service in Puget Sound WA. I was also responsible for developing our production workflow process, troubleshooting production related issues, and providing hands on customer service. The workflow process was so successful for customers in St. Louis that I was asked to bring it to the Cypress, CA DCS facility which I did successfully. I currently support AGS/DCS in St. Louis, Cypress, CA; Seattle, and Philadelphia, and enjoy working special projects when time allows."

good,Good Company to work for
good,"As a contractor it could be a great opportunity for Boeing hiring pipeline.  However, current issues with the 737 Max have greatly reduced the hiring practices at this time.  Recent HR practices to One Boeing, means HR role supports entire enterprise so your not visible to the employees you are supporting.  However, this is also a safety measure especially if you are handling corrective action and discharge matters.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Very flexible work hours and positive work group.  No games."
good,"Great place to work; as you are supported and respected as an expert in your field....which takes a few years to achieve. A person with a can-do attitude that can overcome challenges and provide creative solutions, can work independently, would do well here."
good,"Being that Washington has engineers unionized, there is no sense of urgency to excel because if your manager doesn't like you or wants to get rid of you, they can't - you just get transferred to another team."

good,Good place to work and learn but fairly slow road to the top - not great for learning multiple areas of business. Fantastic for travel and aviation experience
good,Working at Boeing is a great opportunity. When apply make sure that you have a Birth certificate they use that along with you photo ID to verify who you are.
good,"Hard to get in. But once your foot is in the door manny opportunities available. They do require mandatory overtime often. Sometimes you feel your only life is work, and that works for some lifestyles. The Union is a very good resource. Pay and benefits are competitive. A good life long career, just don’t get hurt on the job."
good,"If to evaluate the my Boeing job as a whole, it was an interesting and very useful period in my professional career. Some instability of relations with management personnel interfered with the work. At the same time, the main advantage was the very high professionalism of the engineers and the general disposition to work effectively...."
good,I was the team lead and project manager in the Network Management Tools group.  Very knowledgeable and talented team.  Good combination of legacy and cutting edge tools.  Mature development process.

good,"After several of retirement traveling abroad and doing home improvement projects, I look forward to new challenges. "
good,"The pay and benefits were fantastic, but the mandatory overtime can be really detrimental if you don't want it. Usually 19 days on, 2 days off. If you love to work and make money then it's perfect, but you will basically have no life outside of it."
good,"Boeing is undoubtably one of the best companies I have worked for. Boeing took me under their wing and gave me a chance to learn and develop as their own. The work was difficult at first, but with time, persistence, and outside help, I was able to blossom into a better engineer. The online downside of Boeing is it's culture. Boeing is a very professional company and doesn't has as much ""fun"" as other technology companies."
good,"At times very stressful and challenging. However, a sense of accomplishment when the work was completed and the product was accepted and passed final inspection."
good,"During the eight years I spent at Boeing, I was challenged every day to learn more than I had the day before. Tapping into my 20 years of Army Aviation experience made the job fun for me. Learning about current efforts at upgrading and modernization the CH-47 series helicopter was always a fascinating time."
good,High productivity work environment. Significant budget and time constraints on construction projects. Difficult project environment due to production area access.
good,I enjoyed the challenging and rewording work at Boeing.  I was fortunate to be able to travel overseas to work on interesting projects and meet a variety of interesting people.

good,My experience at Boeing has been overall a good experience. I have had the opportunity to work on both commercial and defense programs. I've also have been given the opportunity to work at multiple sites across the United States. The company provides opportunities to be compensated well and they provide a good benefit package when compared with other airline companies. There are many ways to advance your career within Boeing and to use your unique skills for the company.
good,"I was employed at McDonnell Douglas/Boeing for 31 years.  If you work hard, improve and/ or add to your skill set and look for ways to remain relevant, you have a good chance at being employed there a long time. The company offers tuition reimbursement which is a huge perk, has an excellent 401K plan, and good health insurance."
good,Get paid too much for what they do. Was a fast day every day.  The meetings were a bit much.  Had to stretch every day for about 15 minutes before checking forklift.  Then finally got onto job to come back for break.
good,"As far as I am concerned Boeing is an excellent place to work."
good,"Working at Boeing has been a great experience. The pay is great and the work load isn't overwhelming. However they don't have a pension any longer. The 401K package does make up for some of the pension loss but not fully. With the company being very big, it is hard to implement change."
good,The Boeing Company is a great place to work at and you can take advantage of the learning together program. The benefits are great plus the 401k match.
good,"A great overall place to work, good benefits and work-life balance."
good,This was a great job except for the amount of layoffs. The job was great but it was like a revolving door and you can not raise a family without job security
good,Not a bad place to work. Depending on what area/department you work its a great opportunity. The pay is great considering the experience needed and the on-the-job training is great and they usually work with you until you get up to speed.
good,it was an amazing place to work   I spent almost 14 years at Boeing the only reason i left was due to family finishing High school and unavailability to relocate.
good,"Boeing overall is a great company to work for.  Great benefits with good compensation comparable to others in the same level with national & local business reach.  For the most part, have been fortunate to have good leadership directly above me and opportunities are plentiful based on career path and qualifications."
good,Great place to develop and drive your career!  I spent 29 years at The Boeing Company and enjoyed 95% of it.  I had more than 40 direct reporting managers and only 4 were unethical duds.
good,"Great benefits, diversified company culture.  Family oriented with great compensation and profit sharing packages.  Flexible work hours to accommodate family lifestyles."
good,"Great company to work for. I interned for them in 2015 and loved the work that I did. Unfortunately, they didn't have a position open in that group full time, and it was incredibly difficult to find a position in the company for me to return after graduation."
good,What else is there to say...this is an amazing place to work for. It has been so many years since I worked there I don't remember all the details. I would recommend Boeing to anyone.
good,"Nothing but positive experience during my time at Boeing and will enjoy continue to be employed by this great company."

good,Worked in a Professional Environment that I enjoyed.  Benefits are still very competitive for senior employees like myself. Will always refer Boeing to other folks.
good,Good environment but stressful as more work is expected will less resources. After 38 years the possibility of being laid off was always there. Great benefits and pay.
good,Boeing gives a yearly bonus based upon stock performance.  they have better 401K matches than other aerospace companies Live worked for and better benefits (health care).
good,"Friendly environment, safe place, good management mostly, benefits were great, job skills were laid out to you but sometimes you had to double up."
good,Good place to work. Some good managers. Compensation package on par with industry. The work life can be very stressful if you give the company your best.
good,"I was a PRODUCTION CONTROL EXPEDITER, both on the DC-9 and the C-17. After BOEING bought McDonnell Douglas (for the military jobs)didn't give a care about the commercial side. My interaction with management was different because I was in parts. I supported the center barrel. I SPOILED MY CUSTOMERS!! "
good,Typical day is 7 to 4 pm.  Offers the ability to flex time.  There is an overall culture that promotes the value of learning and growing in the areas of interest.
good,"National team work is more collaborative than most jobs at Boeing, though the bureaucratic nonsense is still present.  The managers are great guys, though they do not have enough time to guide and mentor employees as much as they should (may be different in other parts of Boeing - it is a massive company)"
good,"Great place to work with various job possibilities, flexible work time and good advancement possibilities. Management in our group was very good to work with."
good,I was brought into Boeing in Oklahoma City to work as an intern for 3 months.  I loved being there every day i showed up to work.  The people I worked with and my manager were very friendly and I felt right at home as soon as I got there.  I got to do some web updates for the company and automate some of the processes used to make excel graphs for other employees.  The pay was great for it being my first internship.
good,"I was brought into Boeing in Oklahoma City as an intern for 3 months.  They gave me great pay and benefits, just like a full-time employee.  It was somewhat difficult getting integrated into the team, since I constantly got roasted by some of the guys just about everyday for the first couple weeks.  Some of the other guys on the team were great though. Manager was nice, too.  They included me in the work that I was allowed to see and overall it was a good internship experience."
good,Very dynamic work and social environment. People collaboration was great because progress of satellite build was constantly visible on the factory floor.
good,"My experience with the BR&T Advanced Assembly Automation Group was very positive."
good,"Very productive to work, diverse workplace which allows for team building and creativity. Group activities to break down workplace barriers and to share multi culture backgrounds."
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company. Good people, challenging yet enjoyable work with superb support teams. The benefits were very good. The work hours were very flexible to meet personal requirements. Very good company to work for."
good,Excellent company benefits and salary. Excellent engineering staff and management. I developed excellent skills writing Retrofit Service Bulletins for Boeing's commercial airplanes.
good,"Solid Company, Great Benefits, Several Career Options, Spans Several Industries, May Be Withdrawing From Western States Long Term Due To Agressive Labor Cost Reduction Policies (CA, OR, WA, etc.)"
good,Pay and Benefits are exceptional at Boeing.  Work hours can be flexed for your job type. Opportunity to move to other jobs.  Career advancement and work location is a plus.
good,"Boeing is all about professional ethical behavior. There is socializing and a light hearted atmosphere, but primary focus is work and there is little to no leisure activity distracting employees"
good,Growth is an opportunity to take advantage of it. There are many opportunities available if you are willing to push the issue. Don't be passive about your career.
good,It's a great company but they rather hire burger flippers then actual techs that know what they're doing. With respect to the men and woman on the flight line
good,The work-life balance at Boeing is great and the people you work with are all fun and supportive. I have nothing but good things to say about Boeing. Some room for improvements in their systems being out-dated and not very user friendly and their pay is typically lower than market rate.
good,"The Boeing Company is best of breed among defense companies. Great health care, 401K matching and education reimbursement.  Good open and inclusive culture."
good,I loved working with the friendly people in Renton. The work was exciting and gave me lots of opportunity to learn something new. I could work here 100 years and still learn something new every day.
good,"Awesome Company, great work life balance, flexible working hours and lots of fun."
good,"The company invests a lot of time into their employees and culture. However, it does lack in communication and takes a while to make changes (like most large companies)."
good,"I worked at an acquisition of Boeing.  There was much turmoil and most of the staff left within 30 days of the acquisition, therefore most of the hires were to replace turnover."
good,"Shocked to have been a former employee. Once employeed, I honestly believed my personal career would begin and end at Boeing. Plently of avenues which inspired workers can travel to fulfill any career path."
good,"The Boeing company was an excellent place to work. There were many opportunities to work in different states and countries and transition to various departments and disciplines."
good,"Boeing has fantastic pay and benefits, but advancement in management positions is extremely limited.  Additionally, management seems to have an increasingly difficult time figuring out what direction to take the company, especially on the defense side."
good,"Boeing is a wonderful place to work with many opportunities around the world. The work was almost always engaging, my manager(s) were exceptional, co-workers fun. The hardest part of the job sometimes was the engineering lingo. The most enjoyable was the general atmosphere of caring and sharing."
good,"Everyday brought a variety of new challenges, along with typical work responsibilities.   Management treated us as professionals but it also depended on your work function.  Co-workers were team players.  The hardest part of the job was simply keeping up with all of the different responsibilities and the numerous employees I supported.  At one point, I had over 100 employees and 5 different supervisors I supported.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smile on the faces of those people I could help."
good,"Boeing has a very honest and open culture where everyone is encouraged to be their best and given support to achieve this. "
good,"Excellent continuing education program"
good,In charge of the C-17 production Wing assembly. Overseeing 165 personnel.  Was trained in lean manufacturing in Japan at the Toyota factory. Great employees to work with.
good,"Loved my job ,compensation good work life balance good secure and room for advancement ,a lot of overtime if you wanted it ,can make comfortable life."
good,"big company, but if you have the right manager it won't feel that way. work life balance is pretty great and the benefits a very hard to beat. the week and a half at christmas is awesome."
good,"I have a very high opinion of Boeing. The leadership at Boeing promotes inclusion, diversity, integrity, and innovation. The wok environment was very safe and pleasant. There was a degree of bureaucracy that is inherent with a large corporation."
good,"Great experience in the corporate world.  I learned how to delegate responsibility on to others. How the workers on the floor are the backbone of the company, how processes  are not consistent through out the company. Management proceeds to build little empires and forget what the real goal is, to build a quality airplane that will transport people safely while making a reasonable profit."
good,One of the things I've learned is that there's always change and you have to adaptable for that change. My team knew their job so it made it so easy to complete the task we are given.
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  Plenty of room for growth.  The management team at Boeing is only out for themselves.
good,"Typical day at work I review product dispositions and prioritize repairs.   Also, I attend meetings to communicate with teams several times a week ."
good,I would recommend Boeing to anyone interested in maintaining employment for an extended period of time.  They offer excellent benefits and pay.
good,They are trying to bring in young blood into the company due to the current average being so high but people with experience are being laid off at the same time.
good,Boeing is a great company to work for and they look out for their people.  Only bad thing about this current job is that it is a year to year contract
good,"Boeing was a fantastic experience. The people were nice and hard working and they had a single goal in mind: improve efficiency of producing airplanes. The people were very friendly and understanding. I had a lot of fun working with them. I didn't find the job intellectually stimulating. That corporate mindset didn't sit well with me sometimes, but it was probably because I was young at the time."
good,"Drill and fill close tolerance holes, reading blueprints, how to prioritize    job duties. worked with professional coworkers. Helped on the company moral council to come up with ideas to make a better work environment for the crew. I learned various skills with customized hand tools to complete my job tasks."
good,Amazing place to work at. They do take care of their employees along with union representation. Only downfall is constant shift of workforce until you reach a high level of seniority that assures a better retention. They train you for everything and provide schooling if you want it.
good,Boeing has innumerable opportunities to do meaningful work. With the aging work population it is a great company for new talent to advance rapidly.
good,"hours are extremely flexible and your level of enjoyment of the job highly depends on how persistent you are in pursuit of what you want."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. The resources are among the best in the industry. Opportunities for growth are amazing.
good,"Training intensive environment, very little room for error as they produce technology and aerospace products that demand strict adherence to policy and procedures. Safe environment for job security and great benefits."
good,"Very interesting company to work for with great benefits and work/life balance.  Working for such a large company comes with it's negatives, such as difficult to move around to other positions, political issues, and long intervals between promotions.  Overall good company to work for."
good,Managed the on-orbit operations of a satellite that was part of a fleet of satellites in a mission for our national intelligence and security.
good,"Boeing is a great company, but there pay could be a lot better for such a successful company.  They pay under the average for jobs compared to other companies in the same region."
good,"I love working for Boeing.  I have learned so much.  I feel like if you work hard and have a positive attitude, you will be rewarded.  Sadly, the company is moving away from having virtual employees.  Since I do not live near a large site, I have very little job security if they take away virtual positions."
good,"Excellent place to work can not say enough nice things about management, co-workers, benefits, etc.  Wish I never had to leave."
good,"This is a very professional group to work with."
good,Great Aerospace company to work for. Commucating with colleagues are welcoming . New training and company goals are constant.
good,"I enjoy supporting the government agencies I do, but am very interested in relocating out of the DC area and transitioning out of the Intelligence Community."
good,"This company is the leader in aerospace in the country, if not the world. Working with the people that I have, has enabled me to grow in this industry."
good,great company to work for. always had fun and interesting projects to work on. they were flex with your schedule which was a plus. the defense industry is not looking to good right now which is a down fall.
good,"- Ten years experience as a Manufacturing Engineer in a manufacturing"
good,"Learned how to integrate applicant tracking systems."
good,"The Boeing Company is innovative, energetic, and team-centered Company.  It can provide opportunities to work various places in different functions."
good,"Able to work on meaningful projects with talented, dedicated people.  Generally good balance between work and personal life but times when project needs created a need to juggle work with personal life.  Being a large company many opportunities to purse individual career interests."
good,"Excellent learning opportunities to improve skills.highly pro-active"
good,"Working for Boeing since 1996 I have been in several positions. They include Employee Development Specialist, Applications Analyst, Functional Analyst and Staff Analyst. Given my experience I have vast knowledge of Boeing policies, procedures, regulations and best practices. Having worked in different organizations has enabled me to work with internal, external customers, independently or in a team environment.  "
good,"17+ years at the same company. "
good,Company does want you to succeed and provides a mentor for that.  Lots of red tape when you want to get something done.
good,Kind of like trying to drink from a fire hose when you first start in the area I started in.  Sink or swim
good,A great place to work with great benefits and salary.  The company has great focus on diversity and a commitment to employee development.
good,"A typical day at work prioritze work load each day."
good,"great place to work"
good,"typical day involved managing people and projects to develop and deploy manufacturing (assembly) systems. peer group was other first-line managers from other regions engaged in similar activities with different product lines. hardest part of the job was the continuous activity to provide ""leaner"" and more cost-effective processes to produce ""more with less"" while maintaining the highest quality standards. the most enjoyable part was working with the highest caliber people I've ever worked with in my career."
good,"Good work invironment. Great co-workers. Managers were helpful, comunicated expectations and equipment was in good condition and up to date."
good,"fun place to work, ability to work on your own, not many decisions at the top level of management"
good,loved it there. great pay and great bunch of guys to work with
good,"The company was near a tarmac, and this particular Division was aircraft. Because the facility housed over 5000 employees there was never a typical day. This company was in the south so you could only image that management was based on the ""good ol boy system."" We were almost always in a continually training mode. My most enjoyable experience was when I became part of a crash crew rescue unit for an experimental aircraft military trainer jet that included both Rockwell and Dasa, a German based company."
good,Boeing is a great company. I work as an equipment engineer/project manager. I've learned about composite repair and heat-treat shops for composites and other metals. I've also had extensive experience in load cells as well as many other machinery used for the production of airplane parts.
good,"Multi - tasking is very important at Boeing. Being a diverse company, with different types of services that Boeing provides domestic and  "
good,Working on airplanes with power tools and implementing blueprint designs per FAA specifications.
good,"Great people to work with. A great place to broaden ones horizon."
good,"Incredible people, work environment, and attitude. "
good,"Boeing is a good company and has great benefits and compensations. As far as managment, I was always very lucky to have some really good managers that always gave me the deserved recognition for a job well done."
good,"In all the company was wonderful. competitive pay, great benefits, and I learned a great deal while working here. Moral was good as well."
good,Very diverse place to work.  Plenty of opportunity to advance if you apply yourself and work hard. Many career paths.
good,I enjoy working for them and they are a great place to start in the government world.
good,"Enjoyed the work I did, always challenging. Opportunities for improvement and advancement where available. Good working group of people within the overall organization."
good,"A typical day was gathering all information of production, performances, schedules, for the morning meetings. Learning was unlimited, and the management was incredible, co-workers were delightful. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the schedules. Yet the rewarding part of the job was seeing the results when the schedules were met, and exceeded."
good,I have spent 18 years working in the Apache Program Office. I am taking an early retirement to further my career in the Medical/Healthcare field.
good,"Great Company, worked for Boeing on all of the new airplane Wing programs.The employees are very professional and always willing to help solve problems or find someone else who can help, which makes a job not hard, but challengeing. Great working enviroment. Learned Catia IV and V and Wing Structural Design."
good,The Boeing Companies diversified approach to aircraft assembly is unsurpassed.
good,Typical day at work was fun I could always look forward to tomorrow. I learned a lot not just how to work on planes but other things like construction on buildings or cars just because you can make great friends with different backgrounds. The Co-Workers are easily to get along with they are fun to they can turn a bad day into a great day. the hardest part of the job is watching the lazy no good workers get promoted while us hard workers got nothing but fired.
good,Boeing does a great job of investing in new employees. I have learned a lot in the time that I have been there and the pay / benefits are very competitive.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. I liked it and then got laid off due to their decision to move to Oklahoma.
good,People are nice. Great technologies are dealt with. The atmosphere is relaxed. The life balance is respected. It has a great old school culture.
good,"up close and personal with air planes, very hands on. learn to support my co workers (team work), learn to solve problems.Balancing tasks. While keeping safety first."
good,A reputable company with a great working envorniment. The management and co-workers are helpful. The hours and benefits are great!
good,My favorite job. I loved working at Boeing. It was a busy fast paced job. I had so many different responsibilities both within the company and outside of the company. I wish it would have been longer than a six month contract job. I would love to be back on at Boeing or find something similar where I am appreciated and allowed to use my talents both w/ people and in the work place
good,I learned a lot about how to maneuver in bureaucracies and also a lot about efficiency. I was able to improve processes and reduce wasted time substantially by implementing technology solutions for programs and reporting. The toughest part of the job is knowing that there is an expectation that the employee stays where they currently are permanently and not advance. The best part of the job is security. Security is important for people depending on their circumstances.
good,"Please see privious reviews. Good place to work per sae, but recognitions and transfers are not a good high point."
good,"Over the 27 1/2 years of employment, I have had the opportunity to work with and for some amazing leaders. I have worked in various positions and organizations that have afforded me the opportunity to use my leadership develop, coaching and facilitation skills. I worked closely with the HR community assisting in performance coaching, designing new employee orientation, creating mentoring programs and conducting leadership development sessions."
good,Opportunities for advancement offerred to all employees. Pleasant work conditions.
good,I really enjoy working for Boeing. The company is very inclusive and the work is constantly evolving which keeps the job feeling fresh. I would absolutely recommend as a place to work.
good,They treated me very well.  Had wonderful benefits for me and my family.  The benefits for Retirement are outstanding.  I would have stayed but decided to retire and move closer to family.
good,"I worked there before they had a union, loved the job, work was easy and relaxed, great pay and benefits. All the overtime I wanted. Any overtime hours over 50 was double time and any holidays you worked was triple time. We voted for or team lead and managers left us alone to do our job."
good,"I interned at Boeing twice as a mechanical engineering student, however, my second summer, I began to transition to UX Research and Human Factors. As a technologist, I do not recommend working for Boeing, as their technology is stuck in the past and making change is extremely difficult. As a UX researcher, I was also irked that I was not allowed to speak to actual pilots to get input on new design concepts. None the less, I learned a lot and was able to network a lot. I liked that they make it easy to move to new work groups within the company. I did sometimes feel out of place in a team made up of mostly older men. And once or twice I experienced mildly sexist comments."
good,High expectations daily but the employee is on their own to get started working with support supplied as needed. The hardest part of the job is constructing large heavy beams in a safe and effective way.
good,I was brought in for  7 weeks to be a part of Boeing Portland's summer College Machining internship. As interns we traveled through different departments to learn their processes.
good,I love being at Boeing. They are awesome and strive toward a work/life balance. There are so many opportunities to advance and you see how you contribute daily by looking at the production line. It's amazing.
good,"Company provided many opportunities for interns to learn about the company as well as their prospective fields. The people are very friendly. I was only there for three months as an intern so I wasn't given very big projects, but projects typically are 1+ years long if you're not an intern. Good place to work, I personally just don't like the location."
good,The people are amazing. There always new challenges to deal with and everyone is willing to help when you need it. There is never a dull moment. I always had a change to learn new things.
good,"At times very stressful and challenging.However, a sense of accomplishment when the work was completed and the product was accepted and passed final inspection."
good,"The Culture is Very diverse and professionalism comes from the wide variety of skilled and educated individuals that make up the Boeing Team One Boeing philosophy. They are very proud of there workforce and exceptional proud of there Veterans. They have Clubs that range from diversity /culture ,Veterans and Community involvement/volunteering. Boeing prides it History in Aviation/Aerospace and Space industries."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  The culture is great with people willing to support each other."
good,My experience with Boeing was bitter sweet. The company was called Hughes Aircraft Company before Boeing purchased the Space and Communication (Hughes) sector. Boeing's managerial approach to running the company was vastly different to how they were treated and respected at hughes. I was laid off from the company in about 6 months of the purchase. So personally other than the initial shock it would not be proper to judge beyond this point.
good,"I had a manager that required to be sent to manager school due to his lack of people skills - still I learned a lot from him"
good,Boeing is a good a good place to work.  Apply for the position you really want to work in because you will have to wait for a year to change careers.  Good luck
good,Boeing is a leading edge Aerospace manufacturing company whose products bring great pride to its workers. Proud to support our military with the products Boeing supplied.
good,"strong work ethics, enjoyable, relaxed work environment. The managers I had was great and understanding. all neccessary support is needed to become successful"
good,working now for spirit aero systems  . great company to work for  opportunity for advancement . love working with people. great to see this company grow  chances to move up with the company
good,The importance of the products safety and reliability made for a environment based upon high quality standards and these standards permeated through out the entire organization.
good,My (short) experience as an intern at Boeing was very positive. Boeing is a great company and people working for them are very talented and easygoing.
good,"Very stable place to work. There are opportunities for young people to advance, but you really have to keep going for those opportunities yourself. It is an Aerospace and Aircraft manufacturing company, so don't expect that too many programs are geared towards the latest and greatest in Software Engineering. It exists, but is much harder to find within the company."
good,"Boeing will be for you what you make of it.  Boeing does a pretty good job in terms of long term careers.  Outstanding even.  I found the ""Corporate Religion to be more than I could bear long term."
good,Standard 8-hour shifts with the opportunity to work overtime which is great if you needed extra money.  Once training is complete it was easy to migrate over to the job and help was available when needed. Great people and safe working environment.
good,"Part of a great team, as there are many divisions within Boeing to work, depending on where you are, your job may remain or be moved as in my case. Always depends on where you want to go and what you would like to do in a large manufacturing environment."
good,Working for certifying equipments and systems on newly product aircrafts...working with QC and R/D  working on receiving and certifying aircrafts as comes out of factory line and working squawks before delivered to customers
good,"Although quite competitive workplace in Chicago, the company supports continuous learning and with good benefits and excellent work life balance.  Ample opportunities for relocation and challenging job roles."
good,Professional and progressive environment. Boeing understands the value that a diverse and collaborative workforce brings to the business and its employees.
good,"Positive work environment, excellent benefits.  Hardest part of the job was keeping on schedule.  the most enjoyable was the wonderful co-works I was able to meet."
good,"It was an organized and structure oriented work environment my co-workers were helpful and friendly as well as the management, the structure and the way that they had the warehouse organized was worker friendly! any and all new tasks were easy to learn and they always had someone in angry new area there to give yo their undevided attention to walk you thru the process and willing to answer any questions, there was ample room for advancement and it was encouraged. I enjoyed that job very much. My only regret was the fact that I had to relocate and was not able to remain there I would have enjoyed the chance to stray there and possibly make it a career and not just a transition job."
good,"I believe this is a great place to grow a career and has many opportunities for growth. I was able to move from job skill to job skill and receive both training in house and external to help develop and grow my career and personally. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Boeing. My coworkers treated me with respect as well as management. I was able to go to human resources when I felt that I was treated unfairly. Unfortunately,  plant closure caused me to be laid off in November of 2014."
good,Worked for the 2 best bosses ever at this location it was the only time I felt like I worked for Boeing again it was a fair work environment with work advancement and positive mentoring was very sad when those 2 managers moved on.
good,"Boeing offers great benefits and work life balance. However, there are not a lot of younger people and therefore things can get somewhat boring. Many employees are used to the same way of doing things for decades, and are not challenged to change."
good,Love the dept I work in.  My managers are great to work for.  I highly recommend Boeing.  Insurance use to be outstanding.  But not now.  Now Boeing is having to stay level with other company's. I guess it could be worse.  Other benefits are great.
good,"Boeing has been around for 100 years so their processes have been developed over many years.  This makes things somewhat bureaucratic.  However, the career development resources and the benefits that come with the job are excellent.  Career advancement within the company are great, especially if you don't mind relocating or trying new fields."
good,"The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, and satellites worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services"
good,"Boeing was a great place to work with great benefits. Only real issue is the ""nature of the beast"" with Boeing is the ever present possibility of being laid off."
good,Interesting place to work and learn concerning activities of different aspects of the commercial airplane. Interaction with design engineers and upper management.
good,"You are informed well by management, so it was good communication. You have all the necessary tools to perform your job."
good,"Great place to work.  Being a large corporation, it provides product diversity and associate opportunities to grow and learn in different areas.  One can take on any amount of increased responsibility and the management is  very supportive in that aspect."
good,I liked working there because everyday was something new from setting up travel for people or doing expenses when they got back from trips. I think the hardest part of my job was last minute trips but it gave me a challenge which i like.
good,"Educational challenging, good working environment, family involvement, good benefits, potential growth and development arena, very supportive, future options."
good,"I've worked for Boeing Security Operations for over sixteen years now and have been happy with the set-up. They offer good pay and benefits and, though I am being laid off on 24 March 2017, I feel good about having worked here."
good,This was the best software development job I had in my career.  I learned and was able to put into practice many modern software development and test techniques.
good,Company provides excellent career opportunities in many skills / disciplines and treats employees with respect and good compensation.
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. They have a very diverse work culture and performs with precision-performance. It is a company that demands excellence. I highly recommend this company to driven individuals seeking growth both professionally and personally.
good,"Solid, well respected company. Great compensation and work life balance. Excellent workforce that is focused on doing the right thing both technically and ethically. Highly recommend."
good,"Great benefits and never expected to work till you drop, plenty of family time in my position. Only downfall is tedious tasks."
good,"Typical day: If you have a desk job, it's pretty standard in following the process. For management, it depends on who you have. Some are flexible and some aren't so much."
good,"I had the opportunity to go as far as I wanted to go, with all the tools for me to use,. I love my job and would say it was got me up in the morning everyday."
good,"come to work, do you job and have fun. what more can you ask for. If you have any problems, they have numerous outlets to help you stay on the right track. best job i have work so far in my life. i love the place"
good,"I worked here for a summer as an intern. I worked in the fabrication side of engineering. It was a more relaxed  than product development. The culture is great, everyone is willing to sit down an talk and teach you. Its a great place to work. Only drawback is that its such a large company, so it comes with a lot of bureaucracy. It takes a while to get things done."
good,"Maintaining all the tools and designs was always a challenge. Trying to get designs done on time was always a challenge. I learned how this job has allowed me to grow in my career and I learned how fast I learn while on the job."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Boeing as there were new aspects to learn in a wide variety of areas.  I had the opportunity to grow in my position.  Additionally, by working with my manager, there were opportunities to work on extra teams to target and grow deeper in specific aspects of the position.  Also, by working on the teams, there was the exposure to other areas of the company."
good,"There is a variety of different people, a great workplace for growing and learning anything in the aviation field."
good,Two new company facilities start up in two different states created a new challenge each day. All my jobs provided challenges that I thrive for and keeps each day interesting and rewarding. I learned a lot and are continuing to learn each day. Each job I had to be a self starter and someone that could take charge to complete each task. I didn't need direct supervision right at the job location. each job has taught me to appreciate people and use their talents and mine to complete each day as a team. The hardest part of any job is not to be appreciated and recognized for your contributions. The most rewarding part of any job is customer satisfaction and helping everyone understand what has been accomplished.
good,As an Expeditor with the Boeing Company I worked in a fast pace challenging roll. Project plans deadlines and a strong customer focus a must. Boeing awarded me the opportunity to blossom in this environment by supporting me with any training and skills needed to be successful in this position. A very fun and rewarding job.
good,Very flexible schedule and accomodating schedule.  Non stressful environment. Very laid back
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"My work environment challenges me to take on more responsibility and provide diverse responses to many technicians, engineers, mechanics, and leaders across the chain of command.  In doing this I am provided the support and encouragement of those around me as well as those in company leadership, some of whom I speak with on a daily basis, and others in corporate leadership."
good,friendly atmosphere. comfortable place to learn new experiences. An even better place to meet new aquaintances. room for advancement.
good,"Set team in place, looked for lean opportunities by value stream mapping processes.  Looked at current performance, prepared ETC and EAC documents and briefed management. Developed budgets and reported earned value on government programs"
good,Really big company with growth potential. The company has the best benefits of any company close to the Charleston area.
good,"Provide support to 8 managers and 200 staff members. A typical day includes meetings, calendar management, setting up lunch meetings/general meetings, travel, budget, expense reports, attendance and general support."
good,"An overall great place to work. The people are wonderful, the product is admirable and local, and the Company itself is healthy."
good,"work with co-worker is very fun, also learn a lot about human relationship."
good,"Loved the work with Boeing, it was just a poorly handled contract for the Cargo PMO that ended up cancelling the program."
good,"The first thing I do is log on to a job, then we have team meeting. After the meeting I stretch. Then I review my work order to see what tools and what inspections I will need for the day. Most of my co workers have been with the company for a long time and we`re like family. The hardest part of the job is when we have parts shortages because someone failed to do their job. The most enjoyable thing for me is to see that completed assembley and you know you have done your best"
good,"Boeing is a great company, with many, many opportunities. It can sometimes feel like it's hard to be heard, but the company tries very hard to make the little people feel important."
good,Fun place to work. You learn the manufacturing process of the aircraft. You meet a lot of new people within the company. Your coworkers are willing to help you learn your job.
good,a highly demanding because of the goverment contracts and the production requirements that we had to meet
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for in terms of security and compensation. My experience here, however, was different because I only had a summer internship. Therefore, I found myself often twiddling my fingers at my desk. But it's definitely an amazing opportunity."
good,"Excellent place to learn and grow, move within the company in many job function."
good,"I had the opportunity to meet many people, some I still speak with even though I don't work there anymore. A lot of the older management was being replaced, which is a good thing."
good,Working with people that believe in team work and never refuse to help no matter what and willingness to learn. Cross training was a plus in my department.
good,"While sometimes full of mundane tasks, there are plenty of opportunities for geographical and internal advancements through the company. Great pay and benefits, and overall laid back environment."
good,people at boeing were very friendly and are great teammates and team players. I learned to use many of the tools and familiarized myself with the aircraft.
good,"Boeing really cares for its employees at all levels. They have work/life balance priorities and challenge it's employees to keep learning. They are very supportive of individuals, yet value team work also."
good,It was a nice plant job and nice atmosphere to be around. The place was nice and kept and neat with no problem. The hours I worked was good and not bad hours at all.
good,Great company with understanding leadership. Even give and take. You work for the company and the company works for you. I would recommend working here and would in fact work for them again.
good,"I loved working for Boeing."
good,"Good people, great mission, love what i do.  But company can be too focused on the ""process"" rather than what makes sense.  Management should let the engineering staff do what they was hired to do"
good,I wouldn't want to work at Boeing because it can be so stressful and I really want to work part time and Boeing does not provide that.  There is also a mandatory overtime as well.
good,"winglike assembly, fuselage assembly, reading blue prints."
good,"After working at another company since Boeing, I have come to appreciate the culture at Boeing even more. Everyone felt like they were apart of the achievements of the entire company. With a large company like this, that is incredibly hard to find!"
good,"This company is great. Barriers are political and the Quality team. Everyone wants to be something which is fair, but prevents goal achievement. If you decide to work at this org you need to remember that you will not be able to make huge changes right off the bat. Boeing is huge with a lot of layers. Patience is the key to success in this company. Also, network and learn as much as you can from people! There is so much knowledge within the organization."
good,"The job was great and so were all the workers there, my job was temporary but if i was offered a job i would go back. The work I was given was not that hard but, there was a lot of various projects."
good,"Providing you understand that working at Boeing is not any guarantee you will be there FT till retirement.  The actual is its dependent on the economy and if its down, you stand a chance of being laid off. The best advise I can give anyone is to implement a savings plan to fall back on if layoff occurs. If you're a good employee you will likely be called back when things improve."
good,"Manufacturing Engineering at Boeing involved interaction between Design Engineers, mechanics, Tool Design and fabrication. Work packages were assigned to the ME for determination of what action would be required. ME then determined how to best implement the change. Some changes were simple others required coordination with other organizations.  Every day was different and often required my investigative skills which was one of my favorite parts of the job. Opportunities to cross train with other groups was frequently offered and I often took those opportunities. Management provided support by sharing information weekly with team members which provided helpful insight regarding the company’s plans and vision allowing the team to feel valued. The hardest part of the job was waiting to see the results of a complete engineering change that I worked so diligently to put into place. I enjoyed seeing the results of my hard work and the satisfaction of knowing my work was part of a team effort in completing engineering processes."
good,"Boeing is a really good place to work for your whole career. There are plenty of opportunities to change positions within the company, continual growth is encouraged, and you can always find new challenges."

good,"Working at the Everett location is inspiring as you get to see the planes going through the factory every day. Taking a lunch break walk through the factory was my highlight for the day. As for the work, it was a bit monotonous. I found that my work was very focus on my position and I didn't have much exposure to the many other facets of the company and other jobs."
good,"Professional atmosphere, Excellent employees, positive attitudes."
good,"Excellent company with great and endless opportunity. Very good healthcare, 401K, education benefits and work culture. Very easy to move around the company."
good,"Boeing is a great place for a long term career choice. The culture is geared for career growth and helping you seek out personal interest activities within the company."
good,"Collaboration between colleagues was excellent. Leads were very supportive and provided all training needed to quickly feel a part of the team. Management is ""world-class"". By far, the people were the most enjoyable part of working at Boeing.  Jobs were challenging and enabled everyone to stretch and grow using leading edge technology."
good,"At this time I am doing a start-up on the new Paint building. I work on process air handlers, boilers, chillers and air compressors that control the paint booths. I am still going thru commissioning machines and debugging programs in PLC's that run the building. I would like to get back into the fast paced assembly line type of maintenance."

good,Excellent company with unlimited chances for advancement and increased job responsibilities.
good,"This company was the best I worked for as far as being supportive.  It was difficult to get leadership positions, though.  They invest a lot in their employees and I miss that.  I left to get my degree but some unfortunate things happened after I left where my degree was postponed.  It's difficult getting in to Boeing."
good,"Boeing places a high value on quality products, delivered on-time by a strong ethical and diverse employee population."
good,"I have worked for Discount Tire Company and The Boeing Company for over 3 years with each Employer. Ballard Sheet Metal lasted only a summer before I was laid off to make way for one of the Journeyman's sons. I have worked with numerous types of people in different fields and of different nationalities. I, myself, am a go-getter with a confident and laid back, hard to anger kind of person. I see the value in keeping my word and being respectful at all times and am dedicated to my work. The hardest part of any job is going in blind, taking extra time to be sure to understand before blindly hammering away. This has been tough in the past for me because I like to show up to work and just work! But, I know you must first comprehend your work before beginning it. The most enjoyable part of any job I have to say is 'finding your groove' or realizing you fully understand, can answer others questions about your work, and can work at a fast but safe and steady pace."
good,"the company was an amazing company, but too slow for a new college grad to move up fast enough and develop."
good,"I was a contractor on a Boeing project so as my title suggests my experience would be quite different form a typical job seeker. Having said that, I found Boeing to be a behemoth of a company that none the less seemed like the culture there was positive."
good,"its a big company and has a lot of opportunity. with offices all over the world, it also has great benefits and salary, you can also travel all over the world if you lke"
good,Boring was a great company to work for if you’re an permanent employee. I hate how they treat their contractors though.But overall it was a great company i would only return if offered a permanent position.
good,a very good company with many benefits and complying with all the rules
good,"Worked there 38 years, had many opportunities during that time. Did everything from initial testing to final certification of transport category aircraft. Retired only to stop the 60 mile one way commute in ever increasingly bad traffic, finding retirement a bit boring!"
good,Boeing was a great company to work for. the Management was there for you when you needed some answers for and always go back to you in a timely manner. The benefits were great
good,"There are a lot of areas to learn and advance in the workplace. A constant availability to train and expand your area of knowledge and experience. Anytime you have a question there is someone to help explain or guide you toward who can. I have learned a lot about Excel, Power point,  and many other programs only used in the Boeing company."
good,"Very much the same as my DRS Technologies Review.  Except worked for Director and senior-level program managers on an U.S. Army Mast Mounted Sight (MMS) Program.  Which I started working on while at Northrop Corporation in 1980.  Due to Boeing being so big felt like a little fish in the ocean, but was a good company with good benefits."
good,"working at Boeing has given me the experience  that is needed as an independent employee also working as a teem. In school we have learned the technical for the most part, working with Boeing, I had an opportunity to apply with I knew form school and also have learned many new things.  independently and as a group"

good,I enjoyed working for Boeing. There are many different career outlets available for any background
good,Jobs and culture differ with differing jobs. I find the job is what you make it. Boeing gives the opprtunity to make the job special and that wich brings value. These are adults and expect you to bring something. I like this.
good,No complaints.  I wish i never left.  Thrte were some talk of layoffs.. Job security is questionable. Contractors are very expendable. Company is so big u become a number
good,Blessing to work for a wonderful company. Treated with respect. Managers are welcoming and work with the floor to help make everyone successful. I feel that we are well compensated but as any place its never enough.
good,Gd place and company to work for. Plenty of oppertuinity for growth and great income. The invirorment there was very peasent and good. I'd Do it all over again

good,"People say Boeing is a dream job."
good,Review mirrors review written for Boeing. The company does a great job of taking care of the employees.
good,A typical day would be working in Dassault suite of tools analyzing models or doing customer support functions. I would also do testing.
good,"My job at Boeing was a temporary job that lasting only 6 month until our contract ran out and while working there I couldn't believe how little every employee cared about his or her work. The management at Boeing couldn't be more of a joke. The majority of the managers there care very little about their employees and their work. The culture there is to get the job done eventually and not strive for excellence, but instead for completion. Management is a crucial cog in the wheel that allows a business to stay competitive. Without proper leadership my job was essentially, an attendance based job with no expectations. Most employees would waste the majority of the day hiding out of site but that is not how I work. To be honest I joined in with my peers at first with the art of hiding all day but the boredom and felling of wasting time was too much. Only around 10% of us really did any work and not a soul cared, but 100% of us were terminated after our 6 months were up. This experience taught me very useful information on how not run companies and will help me tremendously when I run a business of my own."
good,"Great company with lots of opportunities.  Great benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job is solving the most complex issues and opportunity to work with the brightest individuals and be part of the aerospace and defense industry that connect and protect the world. Boeing Management CEO and CIO are top notch.  Typical day at work includes working on the most complex issues in Information Technology with a great team!   Challenges are frequent layoffs, and hard to get a promotion at senior levels due to high number of senior team members."
good,This position was a short term opportunity for the students to show promote their skills and utilize this unique opportunity to set in the real industrial world.
good,"Good place to learn, but not good for advancement, very stressful and company is going into layoffs.   Benefits are going away."
good,"Hit the ground running!  I have been at Boeing Charleston for almost 6 1/2 years and have seen it change from Global Aeronautica and Alenia to the Boeing that it is..... Big, and getting bigger.  A typical day begins at 6 a.m. with stall meetings, FOD walks, and assignments ( depending on aircraft priority)  The pace is rapid, and the company wants to increase rate to almost double the current standard.  My duties are to perform inspections to assist in the completion/ testing and presentation of the B787-8,-9 and soon the -10 to customers."
good,"I did not know Oracle, but I got to learn it while working for Boeing. At times they would let me work from home a couple days per week once they knew I was trustworthy, which was great. I learned a great deal working as a Procurement Officer."
good,moved trailers  53 ft 48 ft moved around 70 to 100 trailers in a 12 to 15 hr day 6 days a week.it was pretty good job but it was only a temp postion at the moment
good,"This is a great company and full of resources.   Good to work for the Boeing  commercial airplane program.  There is a lot to learn and comfortable work environment..  There are a lot of  professional engineers to work with. There is also a challenge of big company bureaucracy, , white inferiority complex and fear of lay off ."

good,"great place to work and make good money with great benefits."
good,management sucks they will not believe an employee because they have had schooling even though they have never worked on an airplane.
good,Many years of hard work and many friends and acquaintances. Lots of memories. Boeing is not too interested in work/life balance. I don't think I would recommend young people out of college seeking employment there. But that depends on area of employment they might be seeking. Engineers are taken care of very well at Boeing.
good,Good Company to work for. work/life balance is decent but management will tell you work precedes home/family life if deemed necessary to ensure success of the company
good,"This was an excellent career. Opportunities are readily available if you choose to take advantage of them. Excellent benefits including college tuition, 401K, etc."

good,Boeing is an amazing place to work for so many reasons it's almost impossible to mention them all in this small blurb.  Boeing is one of the world leaders in aerospace and they deserve that title absolutely.
good,"Learned something new everyday. Could be a new system process that was put into place or new policies.  Everyone is encouraged to mentor one another so working for several executives at a time I could be learning something about the company or a personal life story. Plus I was asked questions by my co-works for help or advice too. Things change quickly there so you need to be flexible and adaptable. They have very large diversified culture with lots of options for everyone to be involved."
good,"Great place to work, very competitive and fast paced.  Co workers and leadership became family. Ten years of service ,I have great memories and friends that will stay in my life ."
good,"It’s 4am and I’m trying to find a new job lol so I don’t want to be typing much but Boeing is worth it. Good pay and good management team. I would go back in a heartbeat, I left due to personal life changing events unexpectedly or I wouldn’t hav ever left"
good,"I loved my time at Boeing, great history and great products. Everyday at work was exciting and everyone there takes pride in what they do to continue making Boeing great."

good,"Company uses it's name and reputation to not pay you market value. Other than that, it was great working there and the projects were always interesting."

good,"I just explained it, there is no or will be no Job like it. I was born to work around and in aircraft, Large aircraft. 777. it is the way I am wired. Learned lots that I would not have. anyway you know that dream job everyone looks for? I had it for 21 yrs and may again in the future, its tough here. all i have been able to get is just under half of my wage there. And I have done a couple of so call comparable jobs. And what jobs pay for the tasks asked of people, nope"
good,"I spent over a decade at Boeing and overall enjoyed my time there. Like any global enterprise, there are exceptional employees and a few bad apples. The lack of OT pay and increase in compensation at other tech firms in the area drove me to leave."
good,"I recommend working here.  Great people, interesting work, awesome benefits and they encourage a work life balance. There are opportunities for advancement."
good,A typical day at work usually begins with a carpet cleaning job of cleaning the café me and a coworker go to various outter building to clean them as well the most enjoyable part of my job is working with my supervisor and I learned how to do wood floors

good,"Being an Adminstrative Assistant for a Senior Manager, 11 superviors and support 110 employees could be stressful but also very rewarding. I would process payroll, set up travel for Senior Management and Supervisors, prepared presentations, maintained and scheduled conference rooms, typed up memos and maintained my managers schedule, set up her meetings and conference calls with upper management and staff."

good,Was working as contractor at Boeing and was laid off when work got caught up.  Would like to have been able to move into full time with Boeing.  As a contractor job is unsure the length of time you can depend on
good,"Boeing treats interns very well. Relocation and housing packages are incredible. Pay is very good. If you like airplanes, you'll love the wealth of information available. Managers encourage interns to explore other groups. A personal qualm is that the company is very large, and has the problems all large companies do - it's slow moving, very regulated, and every employee has a very narrow scope of work. The results of your work are difficult to see, and take years to materialize. That said, if you get the opportunity to work at Boeing, it's definitely worth a try."
good,"CORPORATE WEB TEAM DESIGN INTERN"
good,"Responsible for generating an operational schedule which incorporates requirements from various systems for the next 24 hours on a daily basis.

good,"Great company to work for, lots of benefits and career opportunities. The workplace culture is beneficial to both women and minorities as well as others."
good,"Boeing is a great place for a career if you are into the defense industry and aviation programs. I cannot speak for the civilian side of the company, but the only real issue I have with working here is that the touch labor is entirely comprised of collective bargaining unit employees, effectively reducing any chance of advancement and providing job security for those who would normally be let go."
good,Very professional environment. Friendly Management staff and employees. Fitness classes must always start on time because employees work around very tight schedules. I really enjoy the energy  the employees bring to class. I've learned that they like being challenged as the class progresses.

good,Each department and manager has been an entirely different experience. The company is large and diverse. A typical day at work is in a factory office environment. Dressing up is not an option as there are no high heels allowed only flat shoes and safety glasses are mandatory. The factory office is a very different environment from the office environment. Space is at a minimum so employees are moved often and placed wherever there is room.
good,Challenging and adventurous able to learn new tools and convey that knowledge to others.  Good collaboration with coworkers.  And occasionally fun.

good,The job itself was rather easy for the pay. The hiring process can be rather difficult. Very diverse group of people within the company. A lot of people do not know what they're doing including management. If you can keep your head down. You'll be successful.
good,Not used to full potential. Company needs to be competitive from the inside as well as outside. Management should reflect accrued knowledge and understanding through experience rather than book-knowledge. Use of knowledge and experience garnered by military experience often overshadowed by collegiate 'experience' (little to none).

The company could not give me the flexibility to work part-time at that particular time in order to raise my child."

Definitely not a sweatshop! Since it is a commercial aircraft manufacturer, you can expect a certain amount of electronic paperwork. But there is ALWAYS ample help to guide you through the labyrinth. Most co-workers are above average intelligence. Hardest part of the job... I'll have to get back to you on that one. The most rewarding part of the job is walking thru the factory floor, being able to touch the huge aircraft tires (things that the average person will NEVER be able to do), and watch this GIANT 3 QUARTER MILLION POUND BIRD -FLY!"
good,Co-Technicians are great to work with. Little chances to advance. Not many chances for learning or advancement.
good,"Worked as a contractor with hopes of FTE. Two others hired on six months after me got permanent positions. Even though upper management told me I had some of the highest metrics Enterprise wide, I found my contract terminated. Subsequent investigation uncovered the lead on-site had an age discrimination issue for employees older than himself. Other than that, the job requirements and the customers were awesome and it was exciting to go to work every day."
good,"Best brand to work with. Management is approachable and very much accept 'open door policy'."
good,"They make horizontal stabilizers for their commercial jets at this facility.  My responsibilities there were so unique that I am not sure if my review is a fair depiction of their actual development teams and processes (which I participated in via remote).  They have everything really locked-down as far as software licensing and distribution.  If you are a software developer who is used to a more software development savvy culture, you may find working at Boeing a bit frustrating.  Of course, I was part of an R&D project involving Live Metrology, integrating custom software with custom hardware.  For example, there were cameras there that cost on the order of $10,000 a pop.  It was a unique experience.  I was working on the factory floor in a caged area at one end of the facility.  It was very loud most of the day.  No cubicles.  Just a chair and a desk ... although towards the end of my contract, they got everyone desks that could raise and lower to accommodate sitting or standing, as you prefer.  If you end-up working in Layton, it may be completely different for you in every respect.  But, the contract paid well, and - it's Boeing."
good,It is a great place to work. But there need to be some changes in management with how they talk to worker sometimes. But they offer a lot of great things for their workers
good,"At Boeing the sky is literally the limit of what you can do.  They give yo all the opportunity to advance your schooling to help you advance your career - that being said it can be very hard to get into a job you are qualified for with the good ol' boys club mentality.  A lot of the jobs around the company get filled by someone who knows somebody so landing certain jobs can be very difficult."
good,It's a good place to work with fun peiple but the management needs serious help. They're constantly talking about numbers and not actually worrying about helping the workers. Its the little things that add up to make a big problem.
good,I have learned a lot about the Tanker program here at Boeing and what the Air Force expects these KC-46s to look like before they are handed over to them.
good,"Great opportunities depending on the team. Some managers are absolutely rigid on hours and some are very flexible, e.g. letting you come in after 8am to take your child to day care."
good,"Great benefits, better than most in this industry. Education reimbursement is well worth it. Equal opportunity for advancement. Hate the parking situation but at least you get your steps in"
good,Boeing was good place but had poor lower management. For the most part people work together to get work done. Getting promotion was very hard any advance was like trying dig for gold.
good,Most days are planned or repeat of previous days. You learn to interact with diverse cultures and levels of expertise. Hardest part of the job is when there are legacy systems that don't work well in the state of the art environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to be creative with work you are assigned to do.
good,"Aerospace, Aviation, and Defense is an industry I've always wanted to work in. Boeing offers a wealth of different opportunities to work in every area of the aerospace industry."
good,Worked for almost 23 years before retiring. Great place to work. Worked from 1991-2013. I was a Property Specialist and enjoyed my job. It was very demanding and very rewarding.
good,"This is a world class company, but it does have layoffs. I loved my job as an analytical chemist, but the commute was gruesome. I really loved everyone I worked with - we all got along well as a team to get the job done."
good,"Boeing was a company I was contracted to work with to complete a scheduled project.  I only had interface with management personnel at Boeing during progress meetings and on daily Safety & Health Reports."
good,"Boeing is a great company with a wide variety of opportunities for most any career.  There is a high quality and open culture for employees with a great emphasis on integrity and ethics.  For anyone in Boeing's strategic locations, this is a great place to continue a career for the long term."
good,"Very good work environment.  A lot of training is required, tons of information to learn.  New style of management, strict rules and implementation to be with."
good,"Culture is changing but many driver type managers make it difficult to put forth ideas for change.  Little opportunity for advancement and slow to move up in the ranks.  Old computing systems and little technology improvement for the workplace, but much focus on bringing it to the customer.  Nothing in the world like standing under the wing of an airplane that you just helped build."
good,"Good place to work. Long working hours working on a new airplane."
good,"It was a pleasant experience. I would gladly work there again.  I really don't have any more to say about the company, but I am required to write something about a great company!"
good,I worked as a contractor on several projects at Boeing for 2 years. Boeing is a great place to grow skills and learn leading edge technologies. Management encouraged a balanced life/work style with an emphasis on enjoying our what we do.
good,"Boeing can be a great place to work, but it sometimes carries a mentality of an older, slow-moving corporate environment that can be process-heavy and burdensome."
good,"Overall experience was good at Boeing.  Laid off two times and there is no job security.  Liked the environment that I worked in, people were helpful when need be."
good,The company was made great by people that were airplane people and Boeing should try hard to maintain that theme when moving people into senior management roles.
good,"Would go back. Hiring process could be better, should not have to come back as contractor if employment voluntarily terminated. Should be able to reurn back as an employee."
good,I was posted in the middle east and had a 3 hour round trip commute to an airbase in the middle of the desert daily. It was pretty stressful and eventually I left for this very reason.
good,"II choose not to say. Boeing has a contract that is currently cost me money to work here. They have taken away all my benefits to include pension, 401k, education, employee bonuses. There is not an opportunity for me  to advance my career here."
good,I loved working at Boeing. It was a great culture and full of many personalities. I always felt like i was learning about the company and the benefits are incredible.
good,Great company with excellent benefits and perks. Opportunity for advancement. Overall clean climate controlled environment. Competitive pay and salary increases.
good,"In the Boeing company you can develop your professional life as much as you desire."
good,excellent company to work for highly recommend was a great experience the traing was of a very high standard the management were always helpful and a had a excellent understanding of there role and always provided all the information required and the ongoing support to make sure everyone's skills were up to date highly recommend Boeing and wish them every success
good,Management is very restrictive and wants workers to fit a small niche and not to deviate from it. Suggestions are met with strong negative response. Assigned position is insisted upon. Advancement is restricted and repressed.
good,"Great company to work for. A lot of opportunities to make moves throughout the company as you please. If you get tired of a job, you can network and find another opportunity."
good,I very much enjoyed working for Boeing the personnel were great to work with the management was good as well. The only bad side of my time at Boeing was that I was a contractor there and not an actual Boeing employee which left me with no job security and the knowledge that my job could be canceled at any time.
good,I am constantly learning there is always something new to learn which I find challenging.  My co-workers and easy to get along with as I am the go-to person to schedule conference rooms and arranging travel as well as getting them scheduled on the Boss' calendar.  I am constantly multi tasking which I have become very good at managing my time and priorities.
good,Excellent place to work and highly recommend the company to all. One of the best companies that I have worked at to date. Being able to attend school and have it 100% paid for is one of the best things this company offers besides the great benefits.
good,"I was taught many skills of project management, technical problem-solving techniques and partook in fun extra-curricular activities such as mountaineering, golf and skiing. Management changed frequently. Co-workers were rather diverse. The hardest part of the job was the ups and downs associated with a largely cyclical work statement. The most enjoyable was learning and using technical knowledge that makes a great product and is only known by a few people in the world!"
good,the Boeing Company is like a a big machine where everybody only touches enough of a process to pass it on to somebody else. If you are looking for individual satisfaction it is rare and hard to come by here
good,trabajando duro  aprendiendo y mostrando el lado culinarioperuano
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. I have learned so much and I get to build one of the best aircrafts in the world. I am proud of what I do and I look forward to going to work everyday.
good,Alot of politics not enough action. The management promots the work enviorment the leads to infighting. Moral is low and growing worse.
good,"Its all about who you know there, the management just care about how to get their bonus bigger. you need to be sure you cover your butt at all times. you aren't going to have anyone to help you. contractors treated as day laborors"
good,"First job out of the military, very difficult transition at first, learned a lot.  Very technical, lots of hours and OT, hot climate."
good,I worked at the Boeing Co. for 23 yrs. and enjoyed all my years of services until my personal family life needed to become a higher priority and then work life balance became a challenge.
good,was a good place to work with plenty of room for advancement was a steady good paying job one some one would look forward to retireing from
good,"Designed and developed maintenance manuals."
good,"Boeing is a good company to work for, however, I would rather fly the jets Boeing makes than sit at a computer. Job security isn't like it used to be."
good,"Interesting project"
good,"Company has good compensation/benefits"
good,"I enjoy my job. I would really like to work in the hospitality business, Serving people. I enjoy hotels and making people enjoying there trip or visit."
good,Excellent learning environment. Had opportunity to lead several challenging projects.
good,"Due to our site closure, my career at the Boeing Wichita facility is now ending after 31 years.  I have been pondering past achievements that I have been obliged to experience, all which of course contain some good and bad.  There were various elements within these experiences that allowed me to justify staying around here so very long.  Regarding the bad, there have been years that I struggled with my frustration from some bad management decisions or, my trying to get things done per a very tight schedule and perhaps applying some common sense reasoning into our daily activities.  That last one was a real challenge!  All in all, the good of it is that I survived just like most everyone else that has left this place or is leaving today.  We still have retained some pride of a job well done but perhaps would have wanted to prove ourselves a little longer.  "
good,"Was honored to be able to work for this company, I was 1 of 300 chosen to represent our companies work ethic to the Boeing Company. I learned a lot of new assembly techniques working on the 787 project. Management was very courteous and helpful to all of my team members. I was Seal Team lead for new employees coming out of class and on the floor, I worked hand and hand with a Boeing direct employee verifying new employees were good to work alone on there own tickets. The hardest part of my employment was working with some of the new employees because I was not direct for Boeing but very good at what I was assigned to do. Meeting new people from the floor as well as New Management."
good,"Good people, great learning opportunities, exciting products"
good,"Be one your toe's and work hard, it's a honor to work for Boeing."
good,"I worked directly with the client coordinating project activities, providing status updates while ensuring strict adherence to challenging deadlines. "
good,"Tie in with previous shift. Experience Composite Test Develop Stage."
good,very fast paced. working multiple jobs at a time. employee always eager to help.
good,"My experience at Boeing is one I will never forget. What a wonderful place to work and contribute my skills, knowledge and passion on an everyday basis."
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for. The way management organizes work crews provides excellent team building, and encourages Cooperation ."
good,"Reveiw my forecast, work to schedule and complete."
good,Great place to work managment was easy to get along with. the hours are good over time is great
good,"Of the defense contractors that I have been associated with during my 35+ years as a contractor, the Boeing corporation was the best to be associated with. What I learned as a systems engineer, scientist, and analyst was immeasureable."
good,Every day presents a new challenge with a chance to learn and be socially active. You work independently but as a collective. Your team is  there when a question or issue needs immediate attention you will always be able to ask a coworker for their expertise.
good,Es un aprendizaje constante. Se preocupan por todos los detalles y lograr la mayor calidad posible en los productos que fabrican.
good,good company to work for and has a lot that you can do in the company it does have a lot of bureaucracy and red tape so like an other major company it moves at a snails pace with everything.
good,"Boeing is a great place to be employed. I made the mistake of trying another company and now kick myself everyday for leaving!! Wish I could get back in and be with my previous work pals, they were like family! I'll just keep trying my best to get back to Boeing SC!!"
good,"Like I said it was a great place to work. I enjoyed the work I got to do. Got to work on a variety of different projects doing different things which where at times were very challenging. That's what I enjoyed ! "
good,"Boeing provided a strong manager and dynamic team environment.  Although the flexible time and work from home opportunities are not a lot compared to most companies, it is offered.  It is easier to get work done onsite, as it is a manufacturing company with a lot of face-to-face opportunities for meetings."
good,"When I first started it was as New York Fasteners. 22 years later still doing what I was brought onto. I have learn and trained many."
good,I enjoyed  working  at Boeing very much.I started there in 1999 when they were building  the space station.It was a real interestIng and  exciting time for me. The one thing I wasn't happy about was working  in high heights.I eventually got used to it.I learned a lot working at Boeing! that I wouldn't have anywhere else.
good,"very good pay, advancement, benefits are some of the best around.  Time off, Sick leave, pay is very good.  Travel opportunities are great.  Jobs all over the country."
good,The job is extremely stressful and fast paced without clear guidance or instruction.  There is no training and it is learn as you go by stacking different parts of the job which is overwhelming.
good,Contractor on release management team for SAP landscapes.  Managed changes and transports across 6 landscapes using solution manager ITSM and Charm proof of concept.
good,I left Boeing because I didn't feel that there were any chances for me to advance in the current department I was in.  I enjoyed my time while I was at Boeing.
good,this was long ago and I don't know that Boeing is still around in No VA.  I enjoyed starting out as a temp and moving up as a Budget Analyst!  it was a nice group of people but very removed from the main company on the west coast.
good,"Boeing does a great job of driving its mission statement.  The culture can be tough to overcome at times, but I've for that to be true at other companies as well.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the products you are developing are supporting a greater cause.  Knowing that, from first hand accounts, that military aircraft your are helping to build have will continue to save the lives of both our soldiers in the armed forces as well civilians in times in life or death situations.  Makes it all worth it!"
good,"It's a leading edge, top of the heap company that stands nearly alone in the marketplace internationally and completely alone in the US. Near limitless resources. Great place to have a career if you desire a decent and stable income."
good,Good job at Bizjet until they (Luftansa CEO) announced closing the completions section at Bizjet. Pretty much a downer going in to work knowing you will be laid off at any time! that lasted about 2 years.
good,"Being asked to write a review for Indeed even though I worked here so long ago.  This was a temp job and I was in the insurance contract worker's compensation department."
good,Culture promoted innovation and taking initiative.  Early phase of experimental aircraft design provided opportunity for creative solutions to challenging problems.
good,Good place to work.  Union manufacturing and some engineering positions.  Poor parking.  shuttle bus is provided from employee parking lot to main buildings.
good,Boeing is a great company to work for.  The brand identification gives employees pride.   The commitment to excellence continues to give Boeing an edge in the markets.
good,I work second shift in Jacksonville FL. and enjoy what i do and the people i work with. Working hand and hand with the military gives me a sense of accomplishment.
good,I absolutely loved working at Boeing as a contractor however it did not suit my married life/social life/work life since contractors had fewer liberties than a direct Boeing Employee. It was expected for contractors to come in when needed which made outside-of-work-life somewhat stressful but the money was phenomenal and we had plenty of overtime which made for a very nice paycheck. The company is wonderful to work for and their facility is immaculate. Try to go direct if you want a social life but if you're craving the grind then Boeing contracting is right for you!
good,Wire Shop at Boeing : I am not interested in work environment around me. I haded resigning the positioning from boring as wire Shop.  It's different field. Need to pay the bills.
good,"Great benefits. There was advancement, free classes were offered to advance to another position.  Monthly safety meetings were held, safety was first."
good,Boeing is an outstanding company.  The current direction is concerning for those of us with a long tenure with the company.  A new structure/strategy taxes employees to cover more areas with limited resources for success.
good,"I was with Boeing, as a contract Engineer, for over 29 years. I have only good things to say about the Boeing Company. As long as I performed I was given some of the most important and difficult  responsibilities and I delivered."
good,Oversee daily production on the 787 aircraft. To ensure the highest maintenance quality was preformed to ensure a pristine product was delivered to the customer.
good,If your a specialist there is not a lot of room for growth and they will not promote in place. which is unfortunate they have lost some good people because of this
good,Overall I have enjoyed my time with the company and would recommend it to anyone who wants a place in the industry. Personally I feel there is a lot of potential for growth within the company but once you are somewhere moving around the company is hard unless you are the cream of the crop or network really well.
good,"Just remember that you are a number at Boeing and you'll be fine.  Despite Management  nearly universally getting low communication scores each year, I have never heard of a manager taking a communications class to try to remedy the situation."
good,Stable work environment at an Established Company. Learned valuable information on policies and procedure for supply chain. Continually learned improvements of rules and regulations.
good,"A very under appreciated position, that is critical to the success of the airplane build process.  Overtime is expected, but one will not be compensated for it.  2-10 hours per week."
good,"Work as a team, hard worker and communicate each time of production required. Help with other to solve the problem of production. Great with all cultures. The hardest job is require quality assurance to be stamp without mistake before ship out.."
good,"A job is what you make of it and nothing more. I was looking for a job over 30 years ago, started working for Boeing in Wichita, Kansas and now I'm retired from Boeing."
good,"Great benefits (at that time). Pension and 401k matching, low cost medical coverage. Left because of limited chances to advance for senior technical personnel."
good,"Daily: Have worked several Programs, Presently, a typical day is peppered with status meetings with Management and liaison and integration with Engineering Test Teams. Managing people, parts and paper in a dynamic workplace is what I learn daily."
good,"Good environment for those who choose to engage in Boeing's culture, you either love it or you don't.  Offer numerous activities outside of workplace that supports community goodwill and worker morale.  Examples are car show, golf, etc...  charities assisting the less fortunate different times of year. Holidays etc.   It's easy to engage in negativity surrounding everyday changes in Boeing, but it's more fun and rewarding to participate in change and growth."
good,"Was okay until our work statement started to diminish. As with any big corporation when a huge development program comes top a close, expect work force reductions."
good,"Excellent company to work with - poor management staff, lack of work continuity for prolonged periods.  Very difficult to gain progression or training."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. The benefits and pay are among the best in the industry. Advancement is always available if you are willing to move.
good,"Good company to work for, great pay and working conditions, company has and uses latest technology products , plenty of room for advancement, and great working team participation"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is to mine data and create actionable reports and dashboards."
good,"The culture at Boeing is amazing. Everyone is intelligent and passionate."
good,"In my function they've recently been hiring people into middle-management and executive positions who have zero to very few years of people leadership experience.  It's challenging because they have no idea how to lead people and make rookie-level management mistakes that ripple across our team causing disengagement, mistrust, etc."
good,"Overall Boeing is a great company. They do have a disconnect with culture and performance. Boeing have many managers and gives the managers a lot of tools to manage. Boeing has very few leaders and does not supply many tools for there leaders. Leadership is a buzz word which is overused and under utilized, thus the disconnect between culture and performance."
good,Worked for 17 years in C-17 Program Office.  Impressed at how much upper management let us create and run a program-tons of authority.  Best job I ever had.
good,Health benefits are amazing especially if you have a family. Good place to work if you need a good steady income. Closes on holidays so you can spend time with your family and flexible work hours depending on your manager.
good,"My days at Boeing are filled from start to end with challenges. I have learned patience, time management, how to work with different types of individuals and how to focus on customer satisfaction. I find myself having such a heavy workload that I have little if no free time for family and personal growth. I enjoy seeing my team grow into a organized and proficient unit. I have had the luxury of meeting many helpful managers, HR, management support, and co-workers, and I have learned so much from them."
good,I have made my job the perfect kind of niche for myself.  I carry a heavy workload and have much contact with inventors and outside counsel.  All of which I enjoy very much.
good,"The Boeing Company, as with any large corporation, has had good and bad senior management.  They are presently in a good situation with leadership who are making proper decisions for the future of the company.  The work is sometimes slow due to regulatory requirements from the FAA, and DoD.  The co-works I've dealt with are some of the best in the US.  The work week is about 50 hours, but can climb to 80 hours if there are challenges on a project, but the compensation is excellent during these times with OT pay."
good,"Day to day activity on the c17 flight ramp, is sometimes very difficult."
good,i enjoyed it very much. Management was enjoyable and i loved the fact that i was working on aircraft. I look forwasrd to going back
good,"Since becoming Manager in 2009, benefits and incentives have declined and workload has increased to a point where the employees I supervise make more money than I do."
good,"Boeing is a very good company to work for.  Good benefits, co-workers are easy to get along with.  The workplace is well diverse."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for.  The level of intellligence of some of my coworkers is mind blowing definately a company that embraces intelligent thinkers.
good,"A typical day involves interactions with both expats and Saudi Arabian military veterans. I learned a lot about the aircraft since I first started with Boeing 1 October 2014. I've spent 3 months in Boeing training learning about the F-15SA, which closely resembles the F-15E aircraft that I spent 9 years of my Air Force career maintaining. The hardest part of the job is honestly the aircraft delay/arrival to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. However, the best part of the job thus far is teaching both the expats and Saudi Arabian veterans how to upkeep the F-15SA in a safe manner using the applicable technical data."
good,Great place to work.  Incredible knowledgeable work force.  Working in a production environment allows your knowledge to expand massively and see parts get built in house and see your designed parts flow through the entire value stream.
good,The company is amazing. They are very ethical and efficient and the environment is always respectful and fair. The benefits are very generous and it's one of those companies that didn't change after the recession.
good,"I am an unabashed lifelong learner who strives to add value to organizations through my energy, attitude, and sense of humor. I have gained invaluable experience working in federal policy in Washington, DC in addition to serving as a Marketing & Sales Representative for The Boeing Company’s missile defense division. I have a well-rounded educational experience with an undergraduate degree in International Affairs coupled with an MBA focusing on leadership and management.  My role as a Business Development Analyst for Boeing has offered valuable experience in strategy, finance, supplier management, and marketing. My MBA business acumen and years of experience in a high-stakes sales environment allow me to excel in a high performance corporate culture that delivers enduring value to stakeholders and customers alike. "

good,Very good intern program.  Focus on resume-building deliverables.  Lots of social opportunities with other interns.
good,Management and most employees are into advancing there career and the company. Work life balance is great.
good,Great place to work with a very clean atmosphere. Some managers really go out there way to make you feel comfortable and at home if you feel overwhelmed. Co-workers add to the equations by coming to your aid if you ever get stuck on something specific.
good,"Every day was a new challenge with new things to learn"
good,"Enjoyed my 33 years at Boeing, i learned a lifetime worth of knowledge in the production of Aircraft's. And testing , have met people from all over the world and interacted with them in the delivery of Airplanes for there company."

good,"Every morning we reviewed current in work projects. "
good,A dream come true to work n and around the planes in a fantastic building. Being apart of this was a thrill. Areas where I felt needed attention was with some of the management. 
good,"Going thru a lot of growing pains, should be better in a couple years"
good,"Gather Requirement, Document in Stardard Document, Review with Programmers, maybe testing. Might document new development for Users."
good,I loved being a System Analyst at Boeing. I learned everything from getting top grade classes to working with the customer and learning airline manufacturing. I loved programming and producing products and reports to make everyone's job easier and faster.
good,"I truely enjoyed my 23 years at the The Boeing Company. I initially started at McDonald Douglas and found that the integration of the two companies while difficult at first ended up being a strong company, not only for the employees but the customers."
good,"Gathered data, design metric packages, and conducted management review meetings to track performance to plan from staff. Put together materials, proposals, briefings, management reviews, status reports, etc. onto PowerPoint and Excel sheets for Visio presentations and audio meetings that went to all department meetings for weekly discusses .

good,Boeing is a very good company to work especially when you have a family because their benefit package is very good. The base pay is decent but the overtime pay accounts for the differenc.
good,"Boeing was a great place to work. I paid off my college loan and had the opportunity to work as many hours as I wanted for the most part. Boeing has great health benefits, annual bonuses, great paid time off and holiday paid time off."
good,Very organized and professional. We strive to meet critical deadlines. Always aiming to do better. We are a family oriented company. We believe in team work.
good,"Working At Boeing was eventful and challenging at times.  Only those who choose to be challenged will be challenged, Those who don't, won't...  It's that simple..."
good,gave team job assignments and ensured they had all the tools needed to perform the task at hand. Learned how to do many tasks that were not in my job description. Job became very stressful when higher management directed first line managers to push the teams to complete tasks that were unattainable. To deal with stress we had potlucks to boost morale to ensure our teams were being acknowledged for the work they did accomplish.
good,A good company to work for. Management is open and helpful.  A low stress working environment.   Work is challenging  but not labor intensive.  Many opportunities to learn new things.

good,I have several years experience in the Industry but I have learned more and continue to learn more about the product and the work environment and the people make me proud to be part of something special.
good,"Boeing was good to my family and myself family oriented ."
good,"Growing up in Wichita Kansas all my school mates parents worked in aircraft and my parents and their parents it was a generational thing. That was what you did when you grew up. Boeing has always been the best of the best and since I was a little kid that is what I wanted to do in some shape or form. So I thank God I got the opportunity in 2007 to work for Boeing at the old Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas. I was more than excited I was thrilled. to be around all those airplanes and to work with skilled mechanics and engineers. Being active and involved in the restoration process was an adventure. The business is a roller coaster ride sometimes you have to be willing to move with it. I had other ambitions and other challenges to face so I had to continue my journey somewhere else. But I will always be grateful for the experience and the people I had the opportunity to share it with."
good,Boeing Technical Services is a contract company. The work was challenging and plentiful. The pay was good and provided on time. I would work for this company again.
good,"The management was disconnected from the staff and only the managers that were there for any period of time were willing to help new managers."
good,I am really thankful for getting opportunity to work with Boeing and specially my co-workers/team. Its a very good opportunity to learn and work in new streams.
good,"Security forces had a serious and uncompromising position."
good,"A typical day at Boeing is started by reviewing what needs to be accomplished that day and how best to achieve that. Jobs are usually assigned to the worker who has the most experience, therefore increasing efficiency and productivity. Most jobs are viewed as a learning experience for other workers to increase their knowledge. Training is well planned and information shared is valuable and applicable to the job. Management is somewhat lacking. There are only about 40 personnel at my location, but yet we have 7 managers, and those managers don't communicate with each other. The culture is easy going with a collaborative atmosphere that fosters inclusion and innovation. The unfortunate part is that there is absolutely no room for advancement. The hardest part of my job is not actually hard, but tedious. The work itself is not difficult but takes an abundance of patience to accomplish the task. The best part of the day is getting to work with friends and colleagues that have the same attention to detail that I do."
good,"I worked with Boeing as an Accounting Clerk through Randstad Winnipeg. Although I am a contractor, They made me feel belonged and appreciated. I would like to work at Boeing if I will be given a chance."
good,"I worked at Boeing for almost 19 years and it was mostly great.  they paid for my bachelors and master degree and I received many cash awards and stock options for my efforts. I traveled abroad to Europe, brussels, Barcelona, and turkey and even got to visit the airbus facility in Toulouse France.  It was a great career and loved working there.  You need to be able to deal with a lot of change."
good,My experience in the past has been great because of the great manaers I had worked for.  I have no issues with any of the groups I had worked in from the Managers down o the Lead Engineers.
good,"The culture of the workplace is wonderful, full of diversity. Everyone is treated with amplitude respect regardless of hierarchial position. loved being a part of the Boeing family."
good,I have worked with the Boeing company for 19 years.  Its a wonderful place to work. The company has Great benefits. Flexible schedules. Some virtual work is allowed.
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for. Great pay, good benefits and job security is a plus. Very busy work tempo in Dallas, TX but very accommodating and very busy."
good,"Boeing is a great company to work for. It is a shame they took away the opportunity to invest in Tech stock. That was a stab in the back. Now I hear they want to take away our overtime, Another stab in the back."
good,"The management promotes friendly and effective work environment. This attitude help make my tenure at Boeing very rewarding. Given the opportunity, I would return to Boeing."
good,"Its a great company to work for if you get the opportunity too. I like working there and I plan on trying to be Re-hired if at all possible, because I'm in need of another great job."
good,"Great company if you work in the Washington area.  Boeing SC did not make as much money.  The cost of living was decent.  The job was collaborative alot of working with engineers, facilities and other EHS employees"
good,Good company worked there for 30 yrs enjoyed the culture.  The salary and benefits were excellent. Enjoyed my position in a leadership roleand mentoring others.
good,"Challenging work, teams from different cultures, some opportunities for different assignments, fair compensation, great benefits, good work-life balance."
good,"I depends when we have a lot of part orders,. Great company to work for heavy workload  8 10 maybe 12 hour days. But the pay is good and great benefits"
good,Seeing a rocket that you tested put together and launching is very fulfilling. All the coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was the long hours just before launch of the rocket.
good,Boeing was a great place to work in the time I was there. now that it has been changed the environment and the culture has changed dramatically. its more of a cutthroat atmosphere and the people wont tell you even in personnel is cutthroat.
good,I liked working at Boeing while I was there. It has many benefits and everyone works as a team to get the job done. I was lucky to get in the ground floor at a new factory in Texas.
good,"Boeing is so huge it is hard to say what a typical day at work may be. There are very stressful jobs and very laid back jobs, it all depends on where you work and what you do there. There are so many opportunities for learning and moving forward in your career path. They also pay for you to go to school and get your degrees if you can handle it depending on the job your doing. Management all depends on where you work. There are cut throat, backstabbing managers along with the excellent managers. It really depends where and who you are working for. All in all it is awesome that you have a Union that will protect you from the not so great managers. The workplace culture is good. It is a very respected job in the area and I was proud to work there when I did.There is tons of overtime so you can basically write your own check, there is always work if not in your own shop it is easy to find work in another shop. The pay,benefits, and time off beat any other employer I have ever worked for."
good,Upper management only cares about Numbers and bonuses NOT the people who make those numbers and bonuses possible. All of the experience was expected to retire early and most do however in doing so take all of their experience with them and management does Nothing to plan for this lack of experience so quality suffers terribly.
good,"It has been so long since I worked there, not sure that my review holds a lot of weight.  This is been outsourced to a 3rd party and the main function of benefits is really contract management"
good,Boeing San Antonio is a good place to work but it lacks the room for advancement and the pay is not equal to industry standards.   The company has good benefits and the atmosphere is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to work in the aviation industry.
good,There was no room for advancement.  I did love the employees and have and always will have a passion for wellness.  The room for growth was limited at best.
good,"Wish I never left Boeing after dealing with a small aerospace company in Victorville, CA. awful company force me to quit there a month ago, over hostile work environment there! Made me think twice that Boeing was a great place to work!"
good,"The environment at Boeing SC is still one of a new facility that's making a name for itself, in many ways.  It's also part of one of the world's largest corporations, so there is a degree of mega vs. start up, which is unique.  If you have the drive and enthusiasm, you  can find veins of creativity and cutting edge opportunities to keep you from becoming complacent or bored. There is also the unique reality of layoffs, which keeps employees wary and lean."
good,A lot of time spent working on the Work / Life Balance between the employee and the company.  Want the employees to be involved in determining the best way to do their job.
good,As a Sr. Procurement Agent I worked with many groups of people who were dedicated in doing an outstanding job on a daily basis. I experienced many interesting aspects of manufacturing and engineering. Great Opportunity.
good,"You get to meet new people everyday, there's ping pong tables a Foosball table and an Xbox, no PS4 for some crazy reason! only to be used in Lunch!, There's unlimited free coffee (this is a plus). most of the people working here are nice, and they bring you free food and candy often! lots of squirrels outside!!! Huge plus!!!"
good,"Boeing has a competitive salary and benefits.  In recent years, here in Southern California, there has been large-scale layoff of employees due to lack of winning government contracts.  Highly experienced engineers have been let go creating a vacuum for knowledge transfer to young engineers."
good,"I have been working at Boeing full-time"
good,"I love my job but Boeing has made a decision to relocate all of Supply Chain Logistics organization to Mesa, AZ. We were not offered re-location packages. My job type has been scheduled to be relocated in July 2018; however I do not want to wait until the last minute to move to another job."
good,"Loved the job.  Loved the company. Hated the micro-management. I enjoyed the challenge of creating wire bundles starting with raw wire, and finishing with a wire bundle ready to be installed in a new Boeing aircraft.  Quality workmanship is the standard in the Electrical Systems Responsibility Center. Teamwork and attention to detail, following the engineering drawings is an absolute necessity at all times. If you can do that, this is a job you'll love!  But you must be able to learn as you go, and be adaptable to change,  as change is a constant,."
good,".Good place to work, good people. Climate controlled was a plus. I would recommend to anyone. If the pay was better I would have stayed longer. Managers were good"
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. Colleagues are extremely caring and management is concerned about job/life balance. Opportunities for advancement are always available if you are willing to relocate.
good,I really liked this organization and work load. The union was trying to get into the center and caused lots of rifts. I liked the platforms and most of the personnel. The aircraft were military and I really was able to hit the ground running. Lots of distractions from union and non-skilled employees.
good,"Great folks; mostly seasoned military professionals and senior engineers. If you are looking for great benefits, Boeing offers the best 401k and medical dental benefits available."
good,"Support systems and develop software supporting the telemetry data for the Space Shuttle Main Engine program."
good,"Good pay, Benefits and training. Work conditions & lots of hands on training. Management will work with you. Worked at several plants and received good understanding of process"
good,It was a great place to work for 31 yrs.   I had customer all over the world on every Boeing location.   I would support customer in every time zone that needed support at all times.
good,"I loved working at Boeing Australia because of the experience and professionalism of the small cadre of instructors from a vast array of aviation related back grounds."
good,"Very busy all day.  Little micro-management. Good education opportunities. Good compensation. Good overall benefits package."
good,"Great workplace culture, ability to move around, and learn different aspects. Good benefits packages, reasonable pay, state of the art products and processes"
good,Best job in town. Great place to work! Pays to take your time and plan jobs out safely. Great Benefits! Lots of politics though.
good,"same as summary ,i Loved working at Boeing in Tulsa but Spirit bought them and now they suck. Boeing needs to buy it back and get rid of that lousy union"
good,Boeing is a safe and clean environment to work. There are scheduling challenges and other business challenges that come along with working on government contracts
good,"Typical day I worked with all levels of management from CEO to workers on the floor.  Assisting in create a quality product and on time for the Boeing Company.  Daily decisions had to be made in support of my team to insure our delivery success.  We used many tools to measure our success and always exceeded our delivery goals.  To achieve this ]many times we consulted in forming trans of professionals to Engineering, Quality, Schedule and finance decisions."
good,"Worked on several programs, last being classified in El Segundo, CA"
good,"No day was ever the same, lots of changes.  Very fast paced working environment."
good,I enjoyed my life when working with such an awesome company.  It came to a stand still when there was no room to advance in my field.  It is almost impossible to change fields unless you know the right people and get the right support from your direct manager.  They have to fight for you to do anything different than what you were hired to do.  And some are not sure what that is when it comes to Staff Analysts.  Yes you can have a manager that doesn't know how to manage you. They do great with the engineers but for administrative personnel they are lost.  So you have to make it your business to not get comfortable and try your best to move around the company so you can learn new skills and have longevity in your skill code or advance to another skill code.
good,Working at Boeing has been a learning experience. There has been many rewards and many challenges that built the professional I have become in the near ten years I have been employed with the company. Transformative culture change is the direction we are driving but it will be a hard change for the existing tenured pool of employees. Giving attention to intention will generate manifestation.
good,safe and healthy environment with lots of benefits. good grew that always willing to help. place where you wanna retire
good,Preparing employees for day one readiness. I learned how to detect false identification such as passport and naturalization forms. The most enjoyable part about this job was meeting new people daily and preparing them for day one readiness. Work closely with other HR professionals and managerial staff. First point of contact as it related to new hire orientation.
good,"Boeing as a company is a really great place to work. Great talent and very interesting products. Shared Services, a support group, is in the middle of a change in culture making it’s future in some creative areas less than stable."
good,"Out with the old and in with the new is really hard for any 100 year old company, for sure. Transitions are very challenging. Boeing is taking the steps towards efficiency, ethics, security and social media that they need to. My last manager was always open when I wanted to try something new. I grew and loved it. The hardest part is getting past the entitled secure mentality to embrace innovation and create new knowledge. Teaming is growing but not in every job yet."
good,Boeing is a strong company.  It is also an excellent place to work.  On the upside are the managers and the environment.  Job security is a concern for people who wish to stay in the same place for their whole career.
good,A typical day at work would consist of installing different components on a time schedule. Team oriented work environment. Safety focused.
good,"Had a great time working with all the people of McDonnell Douglas/ Boeing, Long Beach. Learned a lot in the years I was there, we built the worlds best aircraft."
good,"Flexible hours, great people to work with.  Most managers are great, but a few are horrible."
good,"over all it is a great place to work if you love air crafts as i do,It will keep you busy at all times.Schooling is offered at anytime you want to further your education."
good,"The Boeing culture promotes team work with different divisions located in all corners of the globe. My experience as a Graphic Designer and IT Communications professional gave me the experience to work in an inclusive environment incorporating many cultures into my work for communicating internal and external Boeing news through both print and Web design."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for.  Really smart folks works here.  Good work/life balance.  Tons of training and educational stuff.
good,Never boring a great company to work for. I have worked for the same company for over 17 years and moved about every 3 years ...relocated several times across the Country. Supported many USG customers.
good,"productive and fun working environment"
good,"Been at Boeing for 14 years and had many opportunities for growth and development."
good,Great place to work. I would never leave the position if the compensation was to my standard. Loved working with everyone and enjoyed the culture. Compensation is not very good because I worked at a branch rather than HQ.
good,"Although the company is large, its many different products, technologies, and customers afford employees and management the opportunity to continually evolve and work in small teams and disparate domains. The company attracts stable and dependable professionals who often have long careers. The company offers good benefits.  Growth opportunities can be limiting at times to younger professionals due to the top heavy employee work force.  Many years of consolidation in the Aerospace industry have resulted in a typically over-qualified and highly skilled workforce.  Management could do better to engage and leverage its workers' talents to bring greater value to its customers and shareholders."
good,"Interesting and challenging and Fun working place in BAA,"
good,Working for Boeing Company at the  Long Beach facility was very rewarding.  Management always had clear production goals for each team to shoot for and achieve.  My co-workers were a good group of professionals who each knew how to perform their job well.
good,"Working for the companies on my resumes was a pleasure in delight. I grew in experience to bring forth to a company I could make a career one day. I am a hard worker and would love to find a permanent career. Working with my co-workers and customers was the easiest part of my job because i loved it, that's what i enjoyed the most; satisfying others."
good,"I think Boeing was a very good job opportunity to advance my skill set.  The culture their was quite beneficial to my productivity as a PC Technician.  I worked with individuals who were all hard workers like myself and wanted to get the job done in a efficient manner.  We were a well organized group of workers who the majority of the time (98%), worked independently.  We were highly motivated to get the job done.  Very seldom were we ever called back to redo a job, once a year if that. The hardest part of the job was not having anything to do at times.  This occurrence was not frequent.  But working helps the day to move at a nice pace."
good,"Fun and easy going,co-workers are great.Management has there favorites.you learn a lot from senior employees.very enjoyable workplace"
good,"Loved working for Boeing, but our product the C-17 is coming to the end of its production. I have received a layoff notice for April 17, 2015."
good,"Excellent training provided and a place where management actually care about their staff."
good,"Workplace that rewards creativity and hardwork, and pays special attention to balance home life with work. Great mix of ages, cultures, and mindsets among both peers and management. Countless opportunities to work with upper, senior, and executive level management."
good,I had great time working with Boeing. Their Compensation/Benefits and advancement are excellent.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with international customers who has a lot job advice and experience to share so that it could give insight and acquiring a better job
good,"Very busy if bar was over loaded. Learned hydraulics and moveables."
good,"When I started at Boeing it was the best place to work.  It is a varied workplace and an individual can find the job to their liking once becoming a part of the workplace.  Unfortunately for new hires since 2007, there is no longer a pension program.  However, the 401K program is good.  The frontline management was at one time second to none of the very top Fortune 500 companies.  They would advocate, support, nurture, and encourage the employee so that they could bring out a productive, loyal, and highly motivated employee.  However, that culture is diminishing, and that management philosophy is changing.  It is still a good place to work with the benefit packages available..  However, in terms of a career, that value has diminished.. I am grateful for the experience there, and still believe the people there do their best to build airliners and other products built there that are the best and most highly reliable in the world."
good,"Depending on the program, job security is the biggest con for this company. Otherwise, there are many opportunities within the company. It is a stimulating work environment."
good,"Small teams, good products, good people, good location, lots of overlap."
good,"Great fun and knowlegable people. Team work. Opportunity to advance, shooling provided and paid for. Best insurance. Positions are many and opportunity to work fromth eground floor all the way thru management."
good,"Everyday was filled with new tasks, this provided for a non typical work day. Great co-workers and H/R department."
good,"Took phone orders from retail customers and dealers"
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Upper management is consistantly changing paths and does not give much infomation to subordinate managers. Benifits are being deminished or changes for no union employees, such as pension, heath insurance, and bonus"
good,"All aerospace has ups and downs, this is no different at Boeing. You may be hired in as one position and leave in another. "
good,"I work on the BlockIII Apache Helicopter Production team. Boeing is a great place to work, and has unmatched benefits. As time goes on, I am realizing that I prefer to work out in field where challenges are new everyday"
good,"The people I have met at Boeing are awesome.  You go to work every day knowing that you're going to work in a professional environment.  The problem is that if you want a little adventure in your job, you won't get it here.  I've seen people most every day who are extremely intelligent, but aren't challenged."
good,"The Boeing Company is the best employer I have worked for in my 10 years in the IT field.  The Systems Engineer team provides daily Linux systems administration, hardware, and maintenance support.  We troubleshoot network connectivity, hardware failures, operating system issues, etc.  The hardest part of the job is the occasional downtime while the most enjoyable aspects of my job are troubleshooting, problem solving, system recovery and resolution."
good,"Overall, the people in my department were great. I lead a number of high visibility projects. I learned to always prepare fully for meetings and be able to defend decisions."
good,Supported Lead Analysts of the Stress Group.  Great Co-Workers.
good,"Organizing my daily schedule based on work sitting in my queue for the day or week. Confer with other groups to verify needs or requests. I had great co-workers that were independent and hard working but were fun at the same time, the perfect mix in the work environment."
good,"Working with the boeing company was a great learning experience that gave me a chance to realize in life i can do whatever i set my mind too. I have never grown as much as i did while i worked there, it taught me about my own personal values, and it taught me how to work on a team. The hardest part of the job was the diversity, i wanted something more challenging and felt i had little room to continue growth. I did very much enjoy working for them it was a very rewarding feeling everyday walking through those gates then walking out of them."
good,"im a self starter and dependable.the position was a very good learning factor in my experencs in factory and assembley work,I all ways have room to learn more at any new company an add to the experience i all ready have..on a one on one basis or a team member."
good,"The Boeing Company is a team oriented environment that focuses strongly on safety, quality and production."
good,"Many years of service.  Good people.  Challenging, teamwork, clean, people focused"
good,"The Boeing Co. is a great company to work for, co-workers are generally very friendly and helpful, working hours are generally around 40 hours a week with overtime paid for working more than 40 hours regardless of salaried or hourly status for employees.  Benefits packages are great and pay is pretty good.  However, changes to business practices are often met with opposition and newer technologies/ processes that can help improve efficiency are opposed without any real assessment of viability.  Also, the phrase ""I don't have time"" is used far too frequently when most employees I interacted with were simply inefficient or sidetracked themselves with projects that were not pertinent to their jobs/ skills...  However, overall, good company, good corporate values, just a bit...  bureaucratic and challenging at times."
good,"there is no such thing as a typical day at Boeing, everyday was something new (new programs, People, Processes, Schedules, ect.)"
good,"Working at Boeing has been great.  Seattle is a wonderful area with tons to do.  Working as a Liaison Engineering leads to working with people (Design Engineering, Stress Engineering, Quality, Manufacturing.. etc), and the engineering. Plenty to learn in this field.. will never stop learning"
good,"I was a contractor , and received no benifits. I made major and minor sheet metal repairs on the 787,and 747 aircrafts."
good,I worked with team members and typical day would be to have a morning meeting with review of each projects. The best part would be to share and learn from other team members. Most enjoyable part of this job was to work with different sites (19 in US) and learn how the same project is accomplished differently at each site to achieve same goals! The hardest part of the job would be when project is at stand still because of the requirements are not furnished completely!
good,"Worked a lot of overtime as schedules were so tight (in some cases one entire plane had to be out the door in three days). See resume for the different types of things I did - an amazing amount of different types of equipment and tools. Hardest part was meeting the schedules. Won many awards for work accomplished, ethics on job, and safety."
good,assemble and repair test. Heavy structure. military program.
good,"Every workday is the same. Same jobs same people, i learned a lot about using power tools and measuring instruments"
good,"Involved with a fast paced dedicated team environment with many product change packages having to be created, modified, taken to Change Board for disposition, depositions recorded, implemented, verified, closed and archived. Management allowed you to do your job and would assist when requested. Time management is job one."
good,Learned alot about building aircrafts and putting them together.
good,"Great place to work.Handles incoming calls from our clients' employees, managers and pensioners, answering their questions and sorting out issues relating to their healthcare benefits, 401K savings, life benefits, retirement plans, LOA, Payroll, other human resource related polices and services. Additionally, the CSA will spend time working through various Human Resource issues such as recruiting, death benefits processing, compensation (salary administration), retirement, and system access."
good,Good company overall
good,-Arrive in morning and work closely with research and operations divisions to clarify product information
good,"I loved working for the Boeing Co. I wish I would still be there, it has been the best job I ever had, the working experience, and your teamates really make a difference. I would reccomend anyone to apply to work there. The best place on Earth!!! Loved it!!!"
good,I would suggest you consider The Boeing Company as your next employer!
good,"Its a nice and wonderful experience to work in Infotech enterprises limited,India which offers engineering services to different customers/clients across the world. Got to learn lot not only technical content during the course of time but also gained indepth knowledge of managerial aspects. Its a excellent work place where is there is mutual understanding and knowledge sharing with the co-workers."
good,"my day would start with issueing out 40 to 50 tool boxes every day right at the start of the shift, and receiving them back in at the end of the night, inspecting every one. Management was mostly very supportive and helpful.My co-workers were great and we worked together very well, I respected them and they respected me. The hardest part of the job would be if we lost a tool during the night, we would shut the whole line down until we found it and wrote a report about the encident. I loved my job and the people that work there"
good,"Nice people, good management. Good for learning new things."
good,Boeing is an awesome place to work. I found that the groups of people I have been around work more together as a team. It's an awesome feeling when the team has achieved an accomplishment.
good,body structure tech. i was in charge of defects and cleaning to prep airplane for costumer to inspect airplane. also in charge cqi team and also in charge of hazmat in are area
good,Great training and fantastic support from many people. This company is redefining what companies should be and I feel I have a great future working here!
good,Great place to work. Very fun.  Work was smooth.easy to move up the latter if your willing to work hard. Benefits are great people are friendly. The company pays for you to go to school
good,Every day I got to work with wonderful people and be challenged in my abilities. I loved working at Boeing. They give you all of the opportunities you need to grow in your position and move up in the company.
good,I enjoy working at Boeing. I enjoy going to work and working with such a great group of people. We all work well together and are always willing to help the others
good,I fell in love with the fighter jets that I was buying parts for. I was a big part of bringing the f-22 from Seattle to St. Louis and loved every minute of it even though it was a tough task.
good,Advancement opportunities if you are willing to push for them. Most employees are long term. The variety of work that is available at Boeing is excellent if you are motavated enough to seek them out.
good,"Boeing is a cross functional, global corporation that offers fantastic career opportunities.  The workplace culture is challenging, but manageable.  I have learned a great deal while engaging with our business partners.  They invested in me by promoting me to management and then putting me through their world-class leadership training.  Then, they paid for my International MBA.  I am now looking to better utilize that experience."
good,Loved the people I met and my job.  Was sorry to leave for involuntary layoff.  Good company to work for with great benefits. Would recommend Boeing to anyone.
good,"This review is for Boeing Everett Wa.  I miss all the benefits and working on the airplanes.  It was at times a challenge and a risk, but all was worth it."
good,"It's a big company, and different areas have better or worse management, so, if you don't like where you are at, move. "
good,I was a contractor so I did not get the he same benefits as an employee. It would be much better as a non-contract employee as an instructor. The students were always great to work with.
good,"You will work a minimum of 8 hours to a maximum of 10 hours a day for overtime."
good,787 was a fun plane as apart of the qualifications and certification team for the mech hydraulic systems. Great development teams. Enjoyed working with multiple partners and suppliers.
good,"Great Place to work. Pay is good. "
good,Great company to work for. Always room to grow and endless growth opportunities. I enjoyed my time with the company would recommend it to anyone thats looking for stable employment.
good,"Fun company, with a great collaborative work culture. Overall the opportunity to grow and expand your skill set is high, and the fact that it is a large firm allows for a great degree of internal mobility if you get bored."
good,tested circuit boards and located faulty parts and had certified solders technicians to replace the parts. assembly units and conducted testing of the units before being shipped to the customer
good,It is good company to work. Working hour is flexible. People are cooperative in Boeing. Lot of learning for the fresher. Even the salary is good. Boeing work-life balance is good. They also provide yearly health check-up
good,"Throughout my career at the Boeing Company I obtained my college degree, had plenty of opportunity to learn the ""ropes"" at all position levels that I held. "
good,"5 of the 6 Managers that I had during my time there, were excellent! Open door policy was legitimate and very helpful. Team building events and activities were important and consistent. Moral was a priority."
good,"Morning meeting."
good,"It's a great company that expands knowledge on aerospace. Many opportunities to branch out on varieties of aerospace positions within the company. College courses that goes towards to more better yourself within the company is cover within the company, along with Associates degrees for family members."
good,"Depends on which organization you work in (as with every large company), but overall they have do a good job with vision and mission direction, work/life balance by providing virtual/working remote options, maternity leave for 60 days and more. However there was a strategy in the last year that shifted a majority of SoCal jobs out of state and caused a lot of turmoil internally with employees not feeling valued and safe. There is also a lot of bureaucracy and levels of mgmt to deal with on the job. The pay is not as strong as competitors but they boost of the benefits package to being strongly competitive. Hopefully they will adjust their strategies to enforcing a stronger employee appreciation and career options/stability for those that are strong performers."
good,"This position is wonderful."
good,you are either extremely busy or its dead depending on a myriad of factors that are all out of your control. lots of opportunity to expand your knowledge base and learn new things
good,I always loved walking in the gated doors using my keycard in the morning. I was only an intern and would do little tasks for my mentor. I learned to organize a yearbook outline for the Boeing High School Internship Program.
good,Boeing was a center of excellence global employer to work with. Each employee was challenged by there managers to do more work and take on more multiple rolls of work duty. Boeing offers all the opportunities for employees to improve there work skills. Employees can enhance there education and skills by paid college toition. Boeing did not pay the professional managers very well and that was patrially because I worked in the Oklahoma Business Units of Boeing which all managers were under paid. I considered all the Boeing  management were very professional and treated people with diginity and respect. Overall the working culture was very professional and the primary objective was to meet customer expectations and meet delivery committments.
good,Typical day is check status of the Group's Releases. Making sure that parts are currently on order. Working with Manufacturing Engineering to keep the commodities work flowing.  Working with Liaison Engineering to limit and avoid any Non-Conformance issues that may come up.  work with the Technician to see what improvements can be made to the commodity my group is supporting.
good,"Great place to work. Pays good for what you do. Typical work days are not very busy. When you meet the quotas, the company gives out great incentives (ice cream social, cookouts and etc.)"
good,"As a contractor, Boeing was a good place to work at. During my years there as a direct, I had a chance to do involving and important work. I also took as much advantage as possible to take as much work related Boeing training and education as made sense in terms of my job."
good,Moving from west coast to east coast with the same company I lost over $600 a month. Was told cost of living was lower on the east coast (not true either).
good,"Boeing is an amazing company to work for and offers great work/life balance as an internship."
good,"What i enjoyed about working for Boeing was, there was never a shortage of part, tools and hardware. Our work was scheduled per our experience. At Boeing if you desire to grow the company will help you achieve your goal's."
good,I worked at Boeing for 36 years. I had multiple jobs and advancement. We were paid time and half for Saturday and 2X for Sunday.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the team atmosphere.Most of the time we worked at a fast pace. My management was very encouraging.
good,"Great place to work. It was contract employment.I would recommend a friend to work for them. Management is direct and very helpful, diversed culture, exceptional tools to get the job done."
good,"The company itself is amazing and loved working for them but as far as for the manager I had that looked over my shift. Well he wasn’t that nice of a man and wasn’t understanding of real world issues. For example, being rude to an employee for being gone a few days yet she had a note from her doctor as well as let the bosses know ahead of time that she would be gone. He was not good at running things either , a lot of the employees took over the things that the manager should have done because he either did it poorly or didn’t do it at all."
good,I was in the Help Desk so I took calls on a day to day basis but the majority of them were web application issues and remote access issues. The employees who called in were all engineers or support staff and were very cool.
good,"There seems to be a shift in the Aviation Industry that minimizes the worker in such a way that they're not interested in its mechanics and engineers as long as they are making profits."
good,Outstanding Co-Workers. Learned A so many techniques and knowledge on the floor. Develop many skills asa far as getting use to different kinds of Boeing softwares. Ergonomically comfortable and most exciting and practical thing is the time schedule flexibility.  Fair awards and recognitions.
good,"productive and fun workplace. Best management I have ever been under. I would have loved to have been hired on permanently, but I would definitely go back as a contractor"
good,"Enjoyed working for Boeing."
good,Would recommend this company to anyone looking for career development or to further their education. Boeing will pay for your schooling 100% up front.
good,"Boeing is a company everyone desires. There focus and strategies on people, product and principles is what makes Boeing one of the greatest companies in the world."
good,Great place to work good income and benefits. Safety is stressed and your input is of value to improve production on the aircraft. Advancement to supervisor role is available for those to seek out.
good,"Boeing in Ridley Park for a long time was a stable place to work.  Just like any corporate structure, as time goes by and employees put their time in they look to eventually force you out if your salary is high and hire a newer and ""cheaper"" generation.  There is a unique dynamic between salary and union employees at the site.  Overall however, it was a great company to work."
good,"I had three children, and then a fourth was born while I was employed for Boeing. The company itself along with the engineers and people I worked with were outstanding. It was a hard balance but each day a pleasure because I was able to have the time, money and development of skills to take care of my family's needs."
good,"Boeing had ""clubs"" such as BHEN, which stands for Boeing Hispanic Employees Network, for people to network and mingle after work. It was a great way for the interns to interactive with full time employees."
good,"fun workplace, competitive pay for contract and full time employees, casual work attire, relocation opportunities, employee perks and incentives, numerous work locations"
good,This internship was a great learning experience and it helped guide me into what types of careers I want to pursue post graduation. I utilized the informational interviews and networking in order to increase my knowledge at Boeing.
good,"Typical day to to take the Turn over from the previous shift.  Time and team work made our lives easier.  We go to meetings to discuss any discrepancies and find resolutions in a timely manner.  The best part is resolving issues and getting awards,  The hardest part is that customers wants things done yesterday."
good,"The Boeing Company is an enjoyable place to work."
good,"It was a good learning opportunity for me."
good,"My 20 years have been a positive experience overall.    Boeing presents a working together environment and every employee shares in the success of the company.    "
good,Great company to work for other than organizational change is constant and seems to be made without much thought to the real value to the company. Benefits and pay were great.
good,"multi cuturarl work experience mix of skills to seek for help in working problems.mangement helpful and will render assistance as needed."
good,Boeing is a good employer with great benefits. As with all companies of this size they are slow to change and some decisions can take a long time to get made.
good,"Good company."
good,"I enjoyed the challenge to work on the new 787 program and was the M/E supporting final assembly of the very first 787 assembled in Charleston, SC. Was very good to learn new systems and meet new people."
good,"I had minimal exposure to Boeing culture;  in comparison to IT companies, I found the energy to be somewhat latent.   Overall, good experience to see how legacy organizations operate."
good,"Working for Boeing was a great experience and a learning experience, every step that i took was a move up and a move to become a project manager in my career"
good,"I enjoy my career at Boeing.  However, there is little opportunity for growth in this company with my skills and or experience.  Much of my job responsibilities were outsourced."
good,"Everyone was willing to help the new engineers. "
good,"Very active and busy. From time I arrived at my desk, until I left, I was on the phone with clients, internal customers, contracting officers diving into the work at hand. Negotiating terms and conditions and executing contracts. I learned there is a formal process, policy and procedures ""The Boeing Way"" that must be followed in order to achieve successful business outcome. Management was very supportive and extremely helpful in basic daily matters through more complex challenging situations externally as well as internally dealing with other functional organizations and customers around the world.  The work place culture was a strong, positive and well communicated platform. Happy would be a one word definition of the culture where I worked."
good,Learn Lean and Agile methodology here. Excellent Lean organization. Committed to customer satisfaction. Learn basic principles of Lean and Six Sigma green belt.
good,A typical Day at work was slow at times due to waiting for access for stuff as well waiting for things you need to do your work to be finished but overall it was a great experience
good,Well organizing and managed company . Many opportunities for advancement and challenges that will keep your interest. Benefits are very competitive in the industry and education is offered in your work area. Great company to work for.
good,Great place to work and terrific people to work with.  Moderate amount of pressure which makes it challenging at times.  Overtime available and management is flexible.
good,"good compensation packages though health benefits are dwindling"
good,"I started Boeing in November 1985, and 2 layoffs, adjusting my time to September 1990.  I never went to college, so getting this job 3 years out of high school has been a great place to be, gave me a good life for raising my kids.....I just felt it was time to try something new."
good,"The work was very fast paced in my line. I had good training to make my job as easy as possible to turn out a quality product. My managers tried to solve any problems  that arose quickly, and helped maintain a good work environment in my area. The hardest part of the job was working a lot of overtime, while the best part of it was the good pay and benefits, plus the wonderful friends that I made and worked with."
good,One of the best run companies on earth bar none in my opinion. A company that understands the value of training and how it prepares its employees for future roles.
good,Great place for a career. It is a large company but it is relatively easy to move around. The company has excellent employee benefits. It is part of the Dow Jones 30 stocks and has performed the best of all of them this year.
good,"The company is very good at promoting from within, but the sizable amount of corporate ladder climbers make things difficult for career professionals."
good,"-Safety and Customer first, that's the major takeaway I've learned from Boeing. It's so deeply embedded into our culture of who we are as individuals and as a company. With every airplane we work on we say ""treat is as if your family will fly on this plane"" because they will. From learning about LEAN and 5S procedures and how to simplify processes we are always looking to make things better and more efficient. My time as an Inspector has compelled me to put the customer first in every thing I do."
good,It is a rewarding place to work along with positive enter action with management and the production teammates. You are encouraged to promote Safety first in all work environments.
good,"Every day was different. You are learning all the time. The job is continuously changing due to manufacturing changes, process improvements etc. As a manager at times the employees are your most challenging but also are your greatest support."
good,"Training was great, Management was not too bad, Morale was good."
good,"Excellent workplace, but labor force fluctuates. Management is organized. Pay is sufficient. The cost of living in the area reflects the workplace...."
good,"Sharp people, challenging work, many different customers, and your customer is on site most of the time (US Govt).  Would do it again in a heart beat."
good,"A good company to work for, excellent benefits, however job ups and downs and specialization may make it difficult to move on to another company when you are laid off."
good,A typical day at Boeing for me required a lot of coordination and data mining. I used multiple Boeing and standard software applications. The people at the working level are at times disconnected from the decision making process. All in all it is a good company with very good benefits.
good,Great place to work. Just programs hire and layoff. So either relocate or take the layoff notice. I have enjoyed working many different programs and assignments. The moving around can take a toll on the family life though.
good,Open environment that allowed for great discussions and ideas to be developed. Was able to develop logistical skill set. Felt management cared and listed to our input.
good,"On a typical day I start by monitoring new equipment issues and generate disposition appropriately. Learning that we are transitioning from a design/acquire mode to a sustain/maintain mode. In this workplace culture, employees are encouraged to become involved with the improvement process. I enjoy the opportunity to see different aspects of the overall manufacturing disciplines."
good,"Good place to work highly competitive chance for advancement a typical day at work consisted of doing the very best Job I could do along with mentoring, Coaching, providing Training as necessary for work force, I learned a tremendous amount about myself and working with everyday concerns of people and how to get the best out of them. workplace Culture is very good provides extensive training and gives lots of help creating Best possible product. The most enjoyable part of the Job was mentoring and Coaching others Peers and workers to become the best at whatever their task. watching others being successful. I took great pride in everything that I Do. Love to make things happen. Set goals and exceeding beyond normal requirements. I like to know that I played a vital part in that process. The Hardest part of the job is being Laid off."
good,"This a great place to work. The benefits alone are amazing. You can get discounts to so many places like Verizon, Sun Splash. Pretty much any name brand they have discounts with. They work with you and are just run in a great manner."
good,Can't express enough how much I loved this job.  Worked with some of the most brilliant minds in the world. Humbling.  Work was rewarding and important.  Atmosphere was professional and organized.
good,"Working various modifications and job roles. If you want to mix it up, work military, not commercial. Commercial engineering is like punching rivets, the same thing day after day, year after year."
good,I very much enjoyed my time at The Boeing Company. I enjoy hands on work. The company is a great company to work for but things just didn't work out for me.
good,This is a great company to work for  Very structured and apply necessary training to do the job.   Boeing has processes for ALL manufacturing requirements.. Which helps you to do you job correctly!!

good,"Productive and interesting company to work for, with plenty of interesting people to meet and advancement opportunities."

good,"Challenging and dynamic place to work"
good,"Supported client development team; Supported project Managers in deliverables, technical documentations"
good,"Large / Complex - Many areas and experiences to see."

Great satisfaction from helping out the US Army!"
good,"I Loved working for the Boeing Company. It was more than a job. It was a career. I was devastated to find out after 5 years with the company that myself and the crew I was working with were all getting laid off due to reduction in force. I learned so much working for Boeing, and had many mentors that showed me many different leadership styles that I incorporate into my own style."
good,"Just a dynamic place to work and enjoy coming to work every day."
good,"Focused, still environment, apprehensive of lay-offs. Not open to change. dedicated employees. Plenty of learning tools."

good,Tough place to get into but great place to work.  Certain positions can be a hindrance on your home life.
good,Boeing is my second job out of college and it has been great working here the past seven years!
good,"A typical day at Boeing is coming to your desk and working on your assignments. Attention to detail and high quality is important. Benefits are excellent and pay is fantastic, but the trust level of management and the company as a whole, makes you unsure of job stability. Boeing will do anything to save a buck right now, including sending engineering jobs to other states and countries. I learned a lot working here. Learned CATIA and ENOVIA. Part and assembly design. The most enjoyable part of my day is working on conceptual designs using CAD."
good,great job with excellent benefits. This is a great job with great job ptoential.
good,"Great place to work. Benefits are above par, salary was great, hours were relatively flexible and I worked in a casual environment with a very attentive and present manager who genuinely wanted to help you grow and succeed. "
good,"When managing a team I found that someone almost always had a task to be worked and solved.  I found this to be educational and rewarding.  These tasks were one of my reasons for being a central part of the Supply Chain processes.  Most of my co-workers or employee's were dependable which made my job of managing them more enjoyable.  The hardest part would be having to discipline someone for making an erro,r but I always made sure to do it in a positive ""learning"" together method."
good,The last aircraft I worked on was the 787. I was good to have worked on that new Composite airframe. I learned a lot from working on it.
good,Great place to work.  A world culture to work in. Interesting people to work with. A different challenge everyday.  Encouraged to participate and provide recommendations for production improvement.
good,"- Co-workers always available for help"
good,I learned a lot about how to maintain a clean working environment for everyone around me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you would meet everyday. The co-workers worked together everyone helped each other.

I learned a lot about airplane interiors and new design, my co-workers were smart and supportive, the hardest part of this job was having to leave, I began to feel like a part of the Boeing family. My mosy enjoyable part of the job was the feeling I would feel walking in the factory under a newly constructed 747-800, I would get a sense of pride to be part of what was going on, even if it was a small part."
good,"My experience at Boeing was very enlightening. I had been hired by Boeing straight out of school with no experience working in aerospace or structural design. I loved my job because most everything was structured and scheduled and the order of authority allowed for my input to make a difference on my work environment. Though, I felt that management lacked realistic expectations when it came to scheduling and that in turn resulted in me and many of my coworkers always playing catch up with countless hours of overtime to show for. Boeing does a great job in rewarding their employees and giving recognition and credit when it's due."
good,"Aprendí no solo conocimientos técnicos, sino también de cultura y ética del trabajo"
good,"My work is to trouble shoot and produce the damaged part and make sure the production runs smooth."
good,"Boeing is a great place to work. The people are great and willing to help you if you need it. Management could down flow information more effectively, but other than that, they are ok. The pay is good and the benefits are unbeatable. The hardest thing about the job is knowing it may be coming to an end. The best thing about this job is coming in everyday."
good,Great company to work for but job security is very low since they layoff so much. The time I work for Boeing 14 years I had gone though 8 layoff then finally the 9th one I was gone. Our whole division was laid off 300+ people.
good,"A solid, diverse company with a heavy presence in numerous major US cities. A company as large as Boeing requires hiring employees of numerous skill sets. Opportunities for travel are also relatively easy."
good,"awesome place to work, good benefits, for the most part plentiful work, yet lay off are almost certain"
good,I've worked for this company for three months as a contractor.  I come into work and I'm able to get right down to business.  It's not extremely challenging work (this particular project) but it's work.
good,Great comoany supported very well by the US. Boeing is a company that operates globally although many of the senior roles are located in the US and this limits managerial growth in other countries.
good,"I love Boeing. It is like living in a fantasy airplane world, but you have to devote a lot of time and energy to it. There is a lot of great people but also some freeloaders that make it harder for everyone. Those people need a dose of the real world again. Life is too good here."
good,Excellent place to work with outstanding people. I enjoy interfacing will all levels in the organization.
good,"Boeing South Carolina was by far one of the best places I have worked in the past. You go in early (0430) and go home late (1700), but, it's a production facility and there is ALWAYS things to do . It was truly an amazing feat to be an installer for the 787 dream liner project, and work for a fortune 500 company in the airline industry. I learned how to analyze different blue prints/wiring diagrams, how to work with mechanical engineers, and different trades (i.e. metal work, drilling with composites, troubleshooting, wiring aircraft, etc.) The hardest part of the job were the long hours worked, and the best part was how Boeing made work a family environment. Everybody knew everybody, and it was a great place to come to work."
good,"Interacted with employees, managers and co-workers regarding training.  Developed curriculum for various skill codes.  Led meetings, taught managers and leads ""Investment in Excellence"" course.  Tracked training to ensure employees maintained certifications.  Part of high powered training team to determine classes employees should be attending off-site."
good, the best job  and very challenging and a lot of overtime early start in the morning 5 a.m.
good,"Boeing is a great place to work, the envirnment is second to none and the learning opportunities are also excellent."
good,"A nice place to work, typical day includes long hours using CAD software to complete design packages for commercial airplanes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional design challenge that can occur and how my coworkers can come together and resolve an issue"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the Computer Aided Technology for Building the New 787 Dreamliner! Awsome!
good,"A typical work day usually starts off on the run.  Cleaning up and organizing from 3rd shift production crews, making sure all parts for production are properly marked and in the right place.  Setting up for transactions between production and then mostly making sure all parts are here or on the way for production for the next day.  Checking for part shortages and informing production of the issues. Assisting in any unforeseen issues, assisting in improving processes to streamline production flow, while cleaning up as I go.  The management team is a pretty good crew with adequate support and team involvement.  I have a good constructive group of co-workers that are always eager to assist each other.  The hardest part of this job is to staying self-discipline to maintain proper procedures and processes.  The most enjoyable part of this job are the people and the action.  "
good,A lot of upward mobility is expected. Productivity is valued at every level.
good,Varied assignments ranging from aerodynamic design to flight control and auto-pliot system design.
good,Worked in company for 16 years and was able to move around the company and lean more areas and expand my knowledge for the products. 
good,"While job security because of their reputation for layoffs is a little shaky, it is a good place to work. Most managers are very savvy to the needs of their teams and all work together."
good,This was a union shop that worked. Most union shops don't seem to work all that well..
good,"worked started at 6 am till 14:30 M-f. I was a supply Specialist orking in the Warehouse department. We had a small office I worked alone my job was to ship all NON BCM, E&I, QDRS off station. I have my very own work center and reported to the Operations Manager. He would come in a say ship 5,000 dollars of material off station today. I would type up paper work DD149 or 1348-1 and he would sign off for approval. This job was ok I had been doing it when I was in the Military as a Sergent working in AWP department. I was really all alone with these high dollar parts. I did like working here, but was always wanting more responsibitity. I did get to talk with other co-workers at lunch or when they droff off the part in my department on any given day."
good,"A great place to work, however if you are a Christian like me you have to be careful about what you say. I continue to pray for my friends that continue to work there. It was a blessing to be laid off. God has opened up other opportunities for me."
good,Job direction provided by Boeing leadership. Assignments provided training in creating drawings of detail parts. Hardest part of day waiting for next assignment
good,.Good working conditions-productive
good,Boeing Tulsa is a great place to work.
good,"Great company to work for with opportunity for growth though most of the work now is in northern California, St. Louis, and other states. The employees take a lot of pride in the work they do."
good,"On an everyday basis, I receive Bills of Materials from different teams within The Boeing company or different suppliers that work with Boeing. I then go and price different types of material, set up a spreadsheet and turn in a report with my quoted prices for each Bill of Material."
good,It gets to be boring after realizing your gonna do mostly the same job every ten days. But seeing a 747 from start to finish never got old for me. The benefits were amazing.
good,typical day review previous days activities and plan out your schedule to support customer request and budgets
good,"Always begin the day with greeting the prior shift and to tie-in department goal of the day. I've learned no matter how long one has been in a company, change is always necessary for increase of production, and continual quality improvement. The role of Management is very critical to the success of our daily task. The guidance given by them ensures the direction is clear, and the work load has a continuous flow. They serve a great deal of wealth of knowledge to be owned by all employees. Sometimes the hardest part of this job is not being able to meet quota, when hard effort and man hours are spent,supply and demand sometimes aren't always met due to various challenges that do occur. In which this part Management helps redirect the work load to ensure dead lines are met and achievable. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you contributed to the success of people being able to travel the friendly skies safely to visit they're love ones and or vacationing.."
good,Untypical software development trying to go Agile but tied down with waterfall support structure great team of developers.
good,I enjoy working with Boeing. The company has great benefits but it is hard to move up the chain for those that have ambitions.
good,"My six years with the Boeing Company were very rewarding, challenging, and helped me to grow as an individual. Being a vital part of the defense of our nation is both an honorable and valuable experience. Boeing promotes training and employee professionalism through its safety, ethics training, and information security programs."
good,BSS was a great place to work. It provided me an opportunity to implement Lean methodologies
good,"This was a great place to work and grow within the International community. With the established processes and passion of the people behind the commitments, I grew personally as well as professionally"
good,"I recommend others to work for Boeing, it's great company and environment. "
good,"After working for this company the last 12 years I have this to say. Boeing being so big has many different cultures and environments. I’ve worked with teams that were tight and treated like family and I’ve worked in areas where it’s every man for themselves. Management typically has no idea what’s happening on the shop floor and the entire crew is ran by the team lead."
good,"Good Work place environment and paid fairly. Friendly and like a family co workers, only bad thing is job not secure "
good,"Pros: "
good,"The El Paso facility produced electrical and electronics products for multiple DoD and NASA platforms.  The site had focused individuals and teams, working together, and committed to producing the highest quality DoD and NASA electronics products in the industry.  "
good,"I used to work security for Boeing, and it was an amazing job, I felt a sense of purpose with every patrol. Everything we had to do, had an easily identifiable reason, there were no ""filler"" jobs to kill time. We worked like a well oiled machine."
good,"Awesome place to work, even better place for a transitioning service member such as myself. I went from “one team one fight” to “one Boeing”. This company is entirely about completing their goals."
good,"Wish I was still there, was laid off due to lack of work, hope to be back there soon.  Overall a good place to work, great  people.  Have a gym that I miss very much."
good,Best job of my life. Looked forward to going to work most mornings. Love my job functions. There was a atmosphere of friendly competition between the different crew in the area that make it a enjoyable and rewarding.
good,I enjoy working at Boeing. I enjoy going to work and working with such a great group of people. We all work well together and are always willing to help the others.
good,"Boeing has several different business units. One of the only companies where you can potentially work in every profession. Boeing has been around for 100yrs, so there is a great sense of pride about staying true to the Boeing Values and mission statement. Being a century-year-old company has its cons as well. Most business functions still operate through manuel excel spreadsheets. There isn't a digital dashboard or one-stop-shop. IMO too much time, is exhausted building powerpoints and ensuring the data is accurate to report the same churn instead of spending time analyzing the data to provide management direction. "
good,"Many opportunities to grow as an employee."
good,Good company to work for. I am happy working for this company I hope I get to retire from this company. If you get hired you will want to spend your career with them

good,"I had a great stint at Boeing but they were downsizing and I had just moved to a new group and was looked at as ""not required"".   Many top notch people there, quite competitive. Many interesting jobs though and the culture is to ""Get it right"" which I love.  Also when things go wrong the culture is to get a fix not to point fingers and who created the mess."

With that, this is the first build so we are challenged daily by the complexity of this project, but that's what makes it so exciting because there's opportunities for learning and development.

The culture is diverse and we work with Washington State employees quite a bit. Management was a little difficult to work for because they were so focused on hitting their quotas, but for the most part safety and employees were the main priority. If you like challenges this is the place for you."
good,overall working at Boeing was a great experience. I was a contract employee so I did not receive any of the Boeing benefits. The best part of the job was the work environment. The hardest part of the job was learning the new systems. All in all a great place to work.

good,Have benefitted greatly from working at Boeing. Many organizations are best-in-class. Employee benefits are second to none. Work-life balance for most organizations is excellent. Opportunities for professional development and career advancement has been excellent.
good,"It's a good, stable company to work for.  You work hard but there are rewards."
good,Boeing has been working hard to change their culture to encourage organizations to work together.  They are doing a much better job of bring in diverse people.

good,"great people, including most management"
good,Boeing allows employee to work both independently and within small groups.  Boeing offers great employee benefits at a reasonable cost.  Boeing encourages individual development.
good,"I was contractor there and I loved my job. The last position I had I felt liked I owned my job.

Best job I ever had and I loved to working for Boeing."

good,I worked for this company for 9 years.  Had plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.  Always rotating work schedules.  Friendly fun atmosphere. Was proud to say I worked for them.
good,"A typical day starts with a team meeting, then as a quality inspector we work with the mechanics as one team to build a quality product and meet our dead lines. Management is there to help and remove road blocks. Work place culture is great as they support team building. Hardest part of the job is dealing with non-conformances as they can hold up the process. The most enjoy part of the job is building the end item and seeing it all come together and meeting the customer expectations."
good,"Too many contractors were brought in that had no experience and received 2 weeks training at Trident Tech. But apart from those guys making mistakes all over the air frame, it was a fun job where a lot got done."
good,"The company was excellent at cross-training staff, so it was possible to expand one's skill sets. It also was possible to transition from one job to another, when appropriate. Depending on the division, however, there could be limited opportunity for advancement."
good,"shipping receiving packaging shipments for delivery, working well with others and working together to accomplish the task at hand. There is no hard part of the job just adapting yourself to every situation that is place in front of you!"

good,"I love my job, and the company.  Always keeping my options open for new positions that will keep my mind fresh.  This is my second career and I don't feel any of the pressures today, that I once felt on a daily basis in the military."
good,"When I worked at Boeing, I was in a different role before becoming an IT employee.  This gave me a perspective that I could not have gained any other way.  I utilized the relationships I had with my peers who became my customers to our mutual benefit.  I learned a lot, and Boeing got a lot of benefit too.  It was a true win-win."
good,Good quality products and the technical culture is second to none. I highly recommend Boeing as a great place to work. Many bright and talented people there and is a good environment to work in.
good,Going over schematic drawings to ensure proper component placement on PCB board design per electrical engineer. This was a quiet workplace due to the very intense concentration.
good,"Usual day consists of a daily meeting to bring your team up to speed on what you're working on and if you have any issues. Beyond that unless meetings are scheduled for work you're involved in you're usually free to complete job duties."
good,Working with the Boeing Brand internal agency and brand team is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The History of the employees knowledge and the management team is excellent.
good,"The Boeing Company is a great company to work for.  Boeing has allowed me to grow as an Engineer, Mathematician, and a Physicist.  I have learned huge amount of skills that I can now take to any company and be successful"
good,If you're looking for a career job this is the place to work. Great atmosphere wonderful benefits you have a real oppàortunity at Boeing to further your career
good,"Had open problems, shared a platform to visualize data for spatial temporal processes. The work has been implmented and integrated with CAD software and a use case have been provided."
good,Daily operation were always high volume get it done. Throw in the daily by the way we also need ..... The people that worked there made it happen and made if fun and never too stressful. I will always miss working for Boeing.
good,"A typical day at my last job was usually busy and varied. On a daily basis, I interacted with my peers, Supplier Management Procurement Agents and Material Management Analysts.  As the software program I managed was used by internal Boeing personnel and external suppliers, I trained and troubleshooted all issues related to both the software and processes."
good,"IT is experienced and always encourages new solutions, the HR and business team is approachable and always listens to automation which would reduce the time required to do manual process"
good,"A very cool and interesting place to work, lots of opportunity. only con is processes move slow. other than that is it a great work environment with lots of knowledge."

good,"Offers excellent benefits and tuition reimbursement.  Many opportunities to improve skills through certification.  Gym on site, promotes healthy lifestyle options"
good,"I had been working for Boeing many years, and I had a lot of challenged assignments. Each assignment is required to learn a new processes, interfaced with new groups so that we all carried out the project successfully."
good,My experience serving an apprenticeship at Boeing and the opportunity to work as a manager in training for the program was a great experience. I believe this to be an alternative to college or a foundation in advance gives practical experience and confidence to people looking for a life skill.
good,To be successful at this job an overwhelming amount of knowledge is needed. Boeing is like 2 jobs in one. Finding networking equipment and fixing it. Largest building in the world.
good,"Boeing is very diverse; I can only speak for Manufacturing Engineering and some of the groups that I interacted with.  If you understand that no one is going to hold your hand to show you how to stand out or contribute, then you can start looking for opportunity to make an improvement and build relationships that will make Boeing more competitive.  In order to fund other programs within Boeing, teams get cut-down to skeleton crews and your daily work will increase to the point where you will need to be able to adapt quickly and value something more than letting work get stressful.  If you show that you can respect, work well with others, keep commitments, and communicate well, then you'll have no problems with advancement and moving around within Boeing."
good,Some of the management was sub par. Co-workers were great. Culture has changed over the past 5 or so years and not for the better. Boeing can be a great place to work if you put your on touch on what you do.
good,great place to work very fulfilling could not have had a better job. Enjoyed the travel and working with the whole team. Received great satisfaction working with the customer as well
good,Great place to work for 18 years but plant closed due new owners who outsourced all of our work. Calibrated all types of measuring instruments used as product acceptance. Boeing Georgia manufacturing thousands of parts and assemblies for different Boeing aircraft.
good,"Great Union job.  You and move up the chart as you check off on all the green."
good,This was a place I started at and learned process and design.  The new technology being used really helped ramp up my knowledge on many subjects as well as learning how to fly and develop software
good,The work day starts pretty early and was the hardest part of the job.  I learned several computer programs specific to the job i was doing at the time. The work place was nice and the people also. Lots of opportunity to seek other jobs if you wanted to learn something else.
good,Offers amazing health/dental insurance for employee and their family. Offers a 401K. Options to own stock within the company. Mental health care for employee and family is provided.
good,"A unionized manufacturer of airplanes, Boeing's corporate benefits were simply amazing back in the 1980s. Structured reviews for advancement, career development planning, mandatory skills training, etc. all created a very desirable culture"
good,Compensation and benefits were better than any other employer I have worked for. The company has a significant amount of resources and emphasizes professional development. It is a great place to be surrounded by intelligent people and learn.
good,I can't speak highly enough about 28 of my 30 year tenure with The Boeing Company.  The company itself with it's strong ethics and morals is a fantastic company to work for.  But with that said one does need to be aware of certain programs which create a caustic environment regardless of your years of experience or tenure with the company.
good,"5 years at company. Fantastic opportunities to learn, pursue skills and education, and network. They invest in their employees and reward those that show drive and initiative."
good,"- Teaming exceptional"
good,"When Programs come to completion, or funding is re-allocated (to other programs), the process to move to a different opportunity within Boeing are very difficult. Boeing should make process changes to allow current employees relocate to pursue other opportunities within Boeing."
good,"Boeing is doing a culture change from the big company from the 70's to a more refined company doing what is right to prevent issues instead of fighting fires. "
good,"Awesome place to help you bring up a family. Had a great opportunity to attend Management training at St. Luis, Missouri, as part of employee involment."
good,"One of my favorite places to work only reason I am looking for a new job is there are shutting down the El Paso facility. Team work "
good,"This company is an icon in the Aerospace industry, an international industrial champion.  Employees are treated very well and the compensation is good.  I have worked with the company for over 30 years, and progressed up through engineering and up to senior management.  The company is beginning to understand that airliners and the associated engineering and manufacturing skills are becoming a commodity.  The market is very competitive, and work-sharing over the years on an international scale has prepared other companies to compete.  The new CEO is taking swift action to restructure the company for improved performance and innovation."
good,"Do not want to write a review, good overall. work life balance is good, cares about the employees, work safety and well being. nice to see.Have not met the CEO, to approve or dis approve yet."
good,face paced.....leadership promoting you to learn more and collaborate to resolve issues.  Some days are longer then others.  Meeting new people and working across the world is an amazing experience
good,"Always something new to learn while working with highly educated and motivated individuals. "
good,"Working in BR&T is rewarding. There are dozens of technical fellows to learn a lot from, and hundreds of engineers to work alongside. Sometimes the verticality of such a large company can decrease your productivity (in my case, my development velocity), but working in aerospace is worth the complexity added by Boeing's bureaucratic labyrinth."
good,I generally enjoyed the type of work I did and the people I worked with at Boeing in a relaxed and professional atmosphere. I also appreciated the benefits supplied by Boeing to the workers.
good,"Great place to work, awesome pay and benefits."
good,"My work at The Boeing Company in extremely intense, but for a fast learner and multi-tasker like myself it is perfect. Boeing provides the right person an opportunity to grow."
good,Great company to work for with lots of opportunity. Diverse employee base with differing skill sets and technical knowledge and skill sets. Somewhat beurochartic and changes are slow and compersom.
good,My experience at Boeing has been mainly positive. A lot of great and smart people. Work-life balance is good and the heath care benefits are great. People can move around to different teams and get acknowled on many different areas of the business.
good,It is a great company to work for Boeing!!!  I have been working for this company for more than 6 years and it has been one of the best experiences I had in my 20 years aviation experience
good,"Aerospace engineering addresses some of the highest safety standards known.  Boeing excels at meeting these requirements. The work culture is among the best I have known, and I have quite a bit of experience at other places."
good,Working with vendors and supplier non conformance items. Recording process violations and inspecting workmanship items that has a problem. Completing reports and working with management to resolve different non conforming items.Hardest part of the job is being able to prove to suppliers that the non conformance may had been caused by them and maintaining a professional relationship with the suppliers and management.The enjoyable part of the job is to know that we worked together as a team to resolve problems that occur so we can all learn that first time quality saves time and money.
good,Boeing is a great place if you like to change it up every once in a while.  The sky is the limit when it comes to things you can do.  Advancement is another story.  It is so big that you have to be a Superman to stand out.  I prefer smaller companies for this reason.
good,"Boeing was a great company to work for, excellent benefits. Again, the team work was awesome and the company had the product needed to complete the task at hand."
good,Aviall is a great place to work.  There are opportunities for advancement.  Benefits are good with a selection of health care plans.  Helps if you are an aviation enthusiast .

good,"Within Boeing, there are many different types of jobs that can provide great opportunity of your preferred career to grow.  Excellent benefit provide to employees."
good,"Boeing has one of the greatest benefits within the aerospace industry. Starting from the 401K plans (rated as #2 in S&P 500) to health insurance and various wellness programs. "
good,"No complaints with the overall company just not too many opportunities to advance. Pretty flexible in the hours, along with great work life balance"
good,"Great place to work and expand your knowledge, as with most places, management can be hit or miss, some great some not so great. There are ways to move into areas you would like to work. Overall a great company with great benefits. Typical day is about 9 hours, overtime when you want it and sometimes when you don't. Just part of the aviation culture. I have worked with some great managers and had a few not so great. Company tries their best to help out but like most large companies, you can get lost in the process. It is what you make it. least enjoyable thing is not getting the support needed sometimes to get the job done. Most enjoyable part is knowing what you do is important and lives depend on your abilities and workmanship. Seeing those big birds fly off after you repaired it or worked on it. Most co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Boeing is an amazing place to work, I have really enjoyed my time there.  The company has great pay and great benefits.  I consider myself lucky for the time I spent there."
good,"Found it very difficult to share the same vision as leadership as it has changed so drastically over the last two years. Lots of room for process improvement and efficiency. I did work with the best group of people, and the culture is the best part about this company."
good,"Work is great but some management is not adequate "
good,"Boeing is a multi-million dollar company with offices all over the world. The ability to advance is in your own hands. The only negative comment is that Boeing's largest customer is the US government and with this can be unstable."
good,"Had the opportunity to work with amazing people from all parts of this great nation. Plenty of time to bond and develop life long relationships. "
good,"i learn something new everyday, you get to work with a wide group of people. It's a very demanding job and a very hard but manageable job."
good,"Really good office & equipment, very professional attitudes, a super job to look forward to every day. "
good,"Because I was able to worl at my own pace in order to get the high tech jobs done with a 99% accuracy rate they loved me."
good,Typical day at work was learning how to be a system engineer fabricator. Learned how to work hydraulic components for various machines. Management was great co-worker team players. The hardest part of the job welding and testing probes.  Learning various machines and reading blueprints.
good,"Boeing is a distributed, service oriented architecture.  IT positions are limited to strategic direction, design, and planning.  IT operations are generally outsourced.  Management serves an up-line reporting and metrics function only.  Career path and development are self directed.  Considerable reorganization is a constant.  Opportunities to be a part of a world class IT organization are abundant.  Coworkers are competent and some of the best in the world.  Opportunities to learn and expand are self-initiated and self-directed.  Virtual work is generally discouraged.  Job security used to be the best in the industry.  There seems to be a general tendency to ""retire"" individuals post 50 years old probably because for many years the company has had an overwhelming part of the work force within 10 years of retirement."
good,"Working side by side with highly skilled technicians has been a wonderful experience. Our core objectives are created to involve all aspects of an employees life at work and at home. The co-workers at The Boeing company are the work family, we respect one another, have fun while producing a highly advanced aircraft."
good,I worked for the Boeing company for 24 years and learned allot during my time there and gained valuable skills. I would highly recommend this company to anyone interested in a career with Boeing.

good,"Great people to work for, great benefits, thier well-being and recogntion programmes are second to none and management take care of thier employees."
good,Job very rewarding with opportunities to advance. Lean many manufacturing and warehouse skills. Required long hours but was well compensated. Very advanced technology and systems.
good,Lots of challenges ahead. Losing lots of contracts. Looking for opportunities overseas and in CONUS. Preferably military sites and contracts.
good,Life was good at Boeing. The supervisors were great. The pay was great. The benefits were terrific. yearly recertifications were required. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Great place to work, especially for a young engineer. There is an official mentorship program and many are willing to take you under their wings anyway."
good,"Great place to work, had fun working with great people.  Learned a lot.  Not hard at all but maybe the hardest thing was trying to get a  lot of assemblies out at once to keep the schedule on track, but made for quite a productive work day.  Very little stress, will miss it all and all the great people."
good,Each day I was responsible for making sure production had what they needed to do their job. Fun place to work with good work ethics and good chance to move up in the company. Had a Cadillac health care plan. Offered schooling.
good,"It was a great place to work, unfortunately Boeing seemed to have less work than its size, and it was very hard to get in, I think now the situation is the same. I was lucky enough to get contracted out to Boeing, after a while, the manager liked me, so I was hired."
good,Great working environment with many different activities going on at the same time. A typical day can vary from reviewing non conformances to being in involved in Root cause corrective action RCCAs
good,"Log review of managed systems.  Attend project meetings with global customers.  Scheduling builds and moves.  Review job tickets in the queues.. "
good,A typical day involves solving Architectural challenges demanding highly technical solutions as well as personnel-related dynamics working towards solving parallel system-of-systems goals.  Fortunate to work with highly-supporting management.  Looking forward to working with more technically-advanced/sophisticated team members to deliver economy/industry-changing solutions.  Hardest part of the job is satisfying the need for more rapid responses.  Most enjoyable part of the job is discovering those rapid responses.
good,Loved working with the atmosphere of that was provided on the Renton lines.  It was fun trying to complete the same planes on different lines with different people.
good,"Boeing was an exciting company to work for.  It has a deep and extensive tradition in commercial and military aviation.  The operations were very impressive - factory and flight line.  I felt as strong about the company when I retired as I did when I first hired-in more than 3 decades before."
good,"* Fun and Exciting Work Day 8:30am - 5:00pm"
good,"Hit the ground running daily and you will go far."
good,While working I found out that it can be both fun and productive. I love working with a lot of different people so I learned a lot of thing from them in a lot of different fields. The hardest thing about my work was that I did not have all the paperwork that I needed and I had to go find it.  I enjoyed my job because of all the people I got to meet and work with.  I work well with a lot of people so it was always fun for me.
good,"This is a big company with great products.  The company offers great benefits.  The jumbo jet plant in Everett, WA is huge, so sometimes the people are not so personable as in a small company."
good,the job was to short needs to hire more direct employees rather than temp services. but overall great company and management was the best I have seen
good,My time was short at Boeing due to a family medical problem.  There was advancement opportunities and training too.  I liked the position and its educational benefits.
good,I enjoyed working with such capable and talented people while at The Boeing Company.  I was able to improve my management and interpersonal skills by working on a wide variety of jobs in various working environments.
good,"Enjoyed working for Boeing. Good benefits. Good medical benefits."
good,My job always presented new challenges which I liked. When you think you know it all then you learn something you did no about doesn't matter how long you been there you will always something how to do it faster know where find it  better ways to make your job faster and better. And the older generation that's been there a long time always helping you and giving you tips  And pass knowledge on to you. In return you do the same for the next generation. Pretty cool I think. Kind of like a big family made a lot a good friends and meet really good people and some strange ones but it's good it makes your job better and more enjoyable. Great pay and benefits you can't be that.      .
good,"Numerous opportunities to work multiple projects."
good,"Great Company "
good,"The Facilities Division handled all requirement of the Long Beach Calif. plant that did not go into the building of the airplanes.  I interfaced with the customers every day.  I had to manage Maintenance Acquisition group of 17 acquisition employees that procured all materials, parts and supplies required by all craftsmen of our maintenance departments"
good,Great job with a lot of potentials towards learning and great people around. Great benefits and excellent pay along with nice environment.
good,"On a typical day, we start out with a quick morning meeting. We discus what is going on in the shop and what needs to be improved on. Second we gather are work and discus if there prior issues or NCRs. Like any other job, we start are work and stay busy most of the day. Currently in certain areas in the shop are having difficulties moving parts. this causes most of the shop to slow down in production. Other then that im happy to say, i have a  great team and a great manager too."
good,"Best company I've worked for so far."
good,"This conpany has amazing people working in one of the most exciting industries in the world. When you consider their many accomplishments -- from designing and building to creating and supporting today's spacecraft, one would think that they would be content with how far they have come. Fundamentally, this company constantly re-examines capabilities and processes to ensure company strength and heritage."
good,A typical day could consist of coming in to be sent home to pack my bags to go to some austere country to performing sheet metal repairs missed drilled hole repairs to landing gear removal and replacement etc.  I learned a lot from wiring repair to sheet metal work weapons systems mods and upgrades to doing operational checks on multiple systems.  Hardest part of my job would be working in extreme heat conditions or extreme cold conditions overseas.  The most enjoyable was after working on a jet that had either ran off the runway or gear up landing watching it take off to head back to the depot for permanent repairs.
good,"8 Hour Shift with a Lunch Break."
good,The SLS rocket is the most powerful machine ever built. I love every second working on it.
good,I worked for Boeing for 27 years before taking an early retirement.
good,"Busy, challenging, great team. Supporting launch operations at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station."
good,Loved working for BOEING.  Great family and worklife balance.

good,"Boeing provided a good income, and allowed me to have a very good life. Extra benefits were many."
good,"A typical day at work involved scheduling and coordinating the manager's calendar and booking travel reservations. The Boeing Company utilizes many internal computer applications to perform a variety of tasks.  I enjoy working with the computer applications and found it both challenging and rewarding.  I was fortunate to be able to support one of the Directors, Legislative Affairs for over ten years.  I established life-long friends at The Boeing Company.  The hardest part of the job was the day I left.  But it was also one of the most treasured because although we said goodbye, I still communicate with several people.  The Boeing Company is an excellent company.  The salary and benefits are superb,  Even with many budget cuts, they are still well above average.  One area that I feel the management should change is that there is not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"every day was a challenge as technology was changing so fast,very good place to work,"
good,I love working at Boeing that's why I've been there for 45 years
good,Great place to build a career.  Compensation and benefits is pretty competitive.

good,Given a task and then was allowed to freedom to develop the best solution for the problem
good,"Great place to work. I do wish they would be more selective on who they hire. Seems like anyone and everyone is able to get a job there. Boeing as a company is great! The people, well we live in a sin cursed world what can I say. "
good,"I filled out work orders to supply the line workers."
good,"it's a place where you fill pushed to give all your best, as I said in the summary, it is a very challenging environment."

The hardest part of my job is to get machines from production ahead of complete failure to work on. They drive an extremly busy schedule and would prefer to run to failure I believe this is a bad idea and not cost effective. I enjoy the challenge of the fix were talking multi-million dollar machines that go down my job is to fix them.
good,The goal is to build the best airplane in the world. We made the cable and wire harnesses.

good,"I worked as a Contractor at Boeing in Anaheim, CA and also at Boeing in St. Louis, MO. I was well received at both companies. I would have been a permanent hire in Anaheim, but SBIRS-Lads Satellite was put on ""Hold"", and all Contractors were laid off. A similar situation happened on the Apache Simulator. The Comanche Program was put on hold, and the people on that program moved over to the Apache Program and we Contractors were laid off. It was very sad to have to leave, as I had 45 minutes flying in the Simulator, and I liked living in St. Louis, MO again. I had lived there when I was a child. I liked Boeing very much. My co-workers were hard-working, knowledgeable, and interesting people. If I needed help, it was gladly given. In my own time, I made flower arrangements for the Secretaries' desks, and was told I improved the looks of the working area."

good,"I learned a great deal inside & outside of my department. I've worked with other companies, other departments, special programs, various locations & installations, across the country. A typical day included a morning meeting to set priorities, which I liked. Management was supportive & kept us informed. A highlight for me was to hear complements about our work, from outside of our department, location or competing facility/ company."

good,"As an employee straight out of college, I found myself at home at Boeing.  I quickly was presented with challenging learning opportunities, and given freedom to perform with great trust as an individual contributor.  Within a four year period, I was able to move from an entry level role to that of a Sr. Manager, due to the development paths the company offered.  I truly look back at my time at Boeing as being remarkable, and transformational, to the trajectory of my career.  Moreover, I still to this day find myself maintaining great friendships with those at the company."

Developed spreadsheets and presentation for clients/customers that I supported."
good,"A typical day at work varied by the position I was in."
good,"Working for Spirit Aerosystems was great, there wasn't a lot of down time which made the day go by extremely fast on most days. The experience gained was irreplaceable for the fact it can be used in many different places within the manufacturing industry along with various other industries needing précises math and engineering. The management was great in making sure no one was hurt and doing their daily duties, along with helping with where help was needed within the section. There were many cultures and diverse people there in which made it easy to learn from one person to the next. Being on your feet for periods of 8-12 hours a day but getting a break every two hours made it go by fast. I loved the people, a lot of different minds and ways to think brought people together, the comradery was one of the perks with working with a team of people."

good,"Compared to the higher paid job I previously had....The stress is nearly non-existant.  I have been with Boeing in Everett, WA for 6 months and I have had nothing but great days. Every 6 months you get .50 cent raises. After 6 years you get a significantly bigger raise. I love this company."
good,Boeing is a mature company with unlimited growth potential.  There are opportunities in both military/commercial aerospace as well as with Boeing's subsidiaries which are not fully integrated.
good,"My workday was very well defined because I was given the proper insight to the schedule and the laboratory equipment.  Meetings with managers were well defined and always allowed for employee feedback without fear of reprisal.  They also retained the knowledge base within the work area, so the access to senior staff members were always available.  They are a great company to work for."
good,I have enjoyed working here and have gained very useful experiences and training.  The company does a great job training personnel for future growth opportunities.
good,Boeing is a great company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Only thing is that the job can be very hard and stress at times- it comes in waives. The California beach jobs are relocating to other states and the facilities are being sold which can put in question the longevity of SoCal all together. Maybe this would never happen for El Segundo since satellites will not go anywhere anytime soon.
good,Great hands on learning environment. Each day was filled with new tasks and learning challenges. Great mentoring from senior staff members.  reward were given per performance.
good,I enjoyed working part time at Boeing.  Wanted full time but had to wait for an opening which did not happen.  Went to work for NGA from Boeing.  Enjoyed the people I worked with.

good,"I worked for Boeing Defense for a short time before being transferred to Boeing Commercial to work on the Boeing 777 Program that had just kicked off. Boeing provided more crucial, in-depth training than any company I had every worked for by far. My team members and I were all extensively trained in CATIA V3/V4 and in various dedicated engineering apps and BOM packages, etc. The Boeing 777 was designed as a virtual aircraft, which meant that every structural and system component was modeled in 3D. As I recall, it was the first commercial aircraft to be virtually designed in 3D. Boeing has a very professional, but mostly friendly, progressive, supportive corporate culture. I had numerous interesting and challenging assignments. There are many opportunities to learn and progress."
good,Friendly people willing to help. You get out of your career what you are willing to put in. Plenty of professional and personal resources for growth and learning. A vast array of opportunities.

good,"Boeing is a great company to work at. There is a lot of job security, decent pay, opportunity for growth, and more. But, if you are not looking for a slower paced company with a lot of bureaucracy, this isn't the place for you. There is a lot of structure, so for a creative, Boeing is not the place."
good,Fun workplace with awesome people and great projects to work on. Great management at that time but the whole technology team I was part of was laid off due to company cuts in 2013.
good,"I had to resign my position due to relocation, and regretted leaving this job. Since I have returned, I have been trying to get back on with Boeing. Great place to work, very good pay, and a very rewarding job!"

good,"Really like working for the Boeing company.  Many opportunities for learning and career advancements."
good,"A typical day at work was I would go in and do my job. I worked on a classified program and the atmosphere was so different. I learned a lot of technical skills. the hardest part of the job was making sure that I did not leak classified information via email, phone, etc. I supported my engineers whom I worked with for 20 years and we were like one big family and when Boeing moved the program to St. Louis, which is why I lost my job, it was real hard on all of us to deal with being split up. I love to help people in any situation."

good,"I worked at Boeing between 2003 and 2011 with some of the best people of my career. I learnt a great amount about commercial aviation and was involved in some exciting campaigns, which enabled me to build a strong network within the industry. The central U.S. control loosened during my time which was one of the aims of becoming a global company. Boeing takes its campaigns very seriously and there was always great team working across the business and the application of appropriate resources."
good,Boeing is a great company to work for.  They off very competitive pay and benefits.  There are many opportunities to excel for those who want to pursue them.

good,"Good place to work, but my kind of jobs (i.e.: Staff Analyst) are being eroded away over time, and the few remaining ones are not usually in Puget Sound, but elsewhere (e.g.: Mesa, AZ; Ridley Park, PA; St. Louis, MO; Charleston, S.C.; etc). Many positive opportunities to team with others, plus a few not-so-positive ones, but all were instructive."

good,This was with the same group and was a great work environment had great flexibility with decision making. Great work teams and support groups to assist with the job
good,"My internship at Boeing was not very meaningful, however I was only an intern. I believe Boeing is one of the best places to work, based on how I was treated. It's the only internship where I was given 5 sick days and 5 vacation days, and was ENCOURAGED to use them."

good,"Boeing is an awesome place of work. It represents generations of good work as well as good workers making good aircrafts. it is professional. Yet, do to budget cuts it seem it was replacing knowledge and experience with new blood. Even though this new blood is very intelligent it lacks the required experience to help maintain low cost as well as maintaining a safe environment. It is a great American story and a great American company. I would love to go back and help in anyway I could."

good,"Great company to work for, with great benefits. Good environment and fun people to work with. Once you get your foot in the door, stick with it because there is so much oppurtunity to grow."
good,I love working for Boeing and contributing to building the 787 Dreamliner. I've enjoyed learning about the composite advantages of airplanes. This is an exciting and leading technology aerospace company that anybody would be lucky to work for.

good,"Every day was a new experience. I might be 200 feet above the ground replacing aviation lighting or escorting military personnel around the plant. I learned all facets of electrical, electronics and even audio technology. Management was great because they left you alone for the most part unless you needed tools or recourses to complete your assigned tasks. The hardest part of my particular job was preforming so many functions and becoming proficient in those jobs. The most rewarding part of my job was having satisfied customers. Although the workload was heavy at times Boeing always allowed time to do the job right and work in a very safe environment. Everyone was a team player and we all worked together well. As an electrician I was given the power to instruct most anyone even up to director level if it impacted safety. In other words I was empowered to preform my job functions as a professional without reprisal. The facility that I worked at was well maintained and had all kinds of places to go for relaxing."

When I started, most schools were telling us to work for our first company for 3 to 5 years, then build a career somewhere else. Boeing is a large company that allows one to explore new products, innovate in existing products, and learn more about all aspects of the business. In my career, I have taken advantage of the opportunities to move, to grow in my capability, and to supplement my existing knowledge with academic and practical experience. Boeing is also active in the communities it serves. Boeing employees get out into the communities they live in and solve problems, quietly and effectively, on a practical level.

They work very hard to cater and grow young employees / engineers.  Management in general cares for the employees.  The total compensation package is very competitive, but the salary is low relative to its peers.  It is expected to work uncompensated overtime when approaching critical program milestones."

Your co-workers are (as usual) the best part of any place that you work, and upper management, which is void of the day to day operations are typically thought to be clueless. this is usually due to poor communication that happens more as the size of a company increases. Nothing new there."

Probably the most enjoyable part of the day world be how nobody has a negative attitude about the job, skills needed to accomplish tasks and how we all found our contributions rewarding."
good,"Start early with early morning meeting. Good Managers make it happen, they enjoy being part of the team. My co-workers work as a team, get the job done, and don't care who gets the credit.

good,"Typical work day was filled with challenging work, I learned from great mentors who drove my career to the next level, the hardest part of the job was hearing that I needed to pursue my education which was really the best thing that happened to me, I ended up acquiring my bachelors degree and then my masters degree and later pursued my certified professional coaching certification.  Boeing paid for all my education.  What I most enjoyed about my time at Boeing was all the traveling I got to do.  I travel more than 50% of the domestic states and internationally to Europe, Brussels, Barcelona and Turkey."
good,Management was very supportive. Allowed to work independently or as a team member as required. Job was very rewarding. Most enjoyable part of the job was problem solving. Hardest part of the job was administrative tasks; prefer technical work.

Each and everyone represents our team culture as One Boeing, and at the end of the day we leave with self gratitude and understanding for customer satisfaction."
good,Only thing I can say I didn't find great about Boeing is that as hard as I worked I wasn't hired. I saved CSC 11 Million dollars because of ticket recalls going from 87% efficiency to 94% and also taking the performance meeting issues from the 300 I had originally to 10 revolving.
good,I loved working for Boeing!  I was able to take advantage of the many career opportunities and growth with the company.  Working in BR&T afforded me a lot of creative growth and independence.

good,"A typical day at Boeing was fast pace constantly moving, Working and sharing small spaces with co-workers. Constantly thinking and modifying parts. All of the work was done from written instructions and blue prints. Math was a big factor working there and precise measuring. You definitely had to be a people person because you sometimes worked in very close quarters. Working at this job required discipline and respect toward others. You had to be a team player to survive at this company. You met all types of people working on the different  programs. Needed mass mechanical skills and the ability to work alone."
good,"Working at  Boeing was interesting, however there isn't or at least at the time there were not many opportunities for advancement. Company policies were somewhat ambiguous and hard to adhere to. Boeing is a good place to work if you are only interested in a paycheck and don't care about advancement.Time changes a lot of things and the company has improved in a lot of areas but still a lack of employee appreciation still exist today,  On a positive note it has one of the best labor unions in the industry."

good,"Employees are very committed and passionate about their roles"
good,"Boeing is the right environment for a post-Military individual who appreciates being 'a cog in the machine' as we were while serving in active DoD.  However, its not the best for someone who wants to shake the world with their ideas, as many are drowned out through the various (and many) layers of process approval.  Its not for everyone. But they are a global team of innovators, and extremely successful leaders, who march with an army of support around the world.  Best private sector job I've had, by far."

This is a place concerned with a compensation package which includes employee feedback.  There are many opportunities to grow yourself, to mentor and be mentored.  The company is highly diversified and works 24/7 and globally.  Its relationships are apparent with long standing employees and business partners.

I learned lot of new things because lot of changes happened from the previous time I worked with Boeing. The management was very well organized providing all the information necessary to work successfully in the project receiving all the accesses needed to work in time. It was a multi-culture environment but very well harmonized, all was working like one together to reach the project goal. The project was little bit complex and different opinions about the elaboration of 2D drawings concerning the simplified representation should be, but finally was solved.

good,"Great management, mentorship, and overall culture! A very youthful, casual vibe. I love how they have team meetings every morning discussing goals. The communication is excellent. It seems if you excel, you can get promoted very quickly. I love how the sales people are not drilling people out of money. They would rather someone not spend at all than spend money on a campaign or product that will not perform. Calls are ""warm calls"" (members of our free section, goal to make them spend.) The memes and ping chats keep things interesting. The open office environment is refreshing. I thought my first sales experience would be in an old office, cubicles, and I would be drilled with metrics. They seem to give the autonomy, and coach, but also allow for your own unique process. Managers are out of this world. I cannot even believe that my first professional experience was with a company so amazing. My recommendation for interns is to not lose hope. Someone you spoke with the first week may come back a month later and purchase! It takes patience and time. With team outings and free food, it is a great college summer experience. The only downside is that somedays are slower than others. They want to see if you can keep a good attitude with your book (older accounts, no new leads) the whole summer. If you are die hard for indeed and sales, just stick with it. You will close a deal (:"

Another great thing was a program called ""company suggestions"". This program paid quite well for any good suggestions that helped the company. Lots of other things like ""2 on the town"".

good,"Generally my day would start by communicating with my team to go over the plan for the day. Next we would enter the work area and everyone would begin to do their specific task, all working together to accomplish the same goal. My job was to set up my drill guide in place, and then drill holes through the fuselage and the wing so that we could later on install fasteners that hold the wing in its place on the plane. After I was done drilling, I would get my tools and gear ready to enter the fuel tank. Once I was in the fuel tank and in my position, I would locate the holes that me and my team drilled earlier. Then I would insert bolts by knocking them in with a pneumatic rivet gun. Once all fasteners/bolts were installed, I would then get out of the fuel tank, then go back inside the fusealage and locate the fasteners I just installed. Next I would apply a collar (specific type of nut) to the end of the fasteners/bolts and tighten them down with a special torque wrench. Once completed we would begin installing what we called Stub Beams. Once again we would have to drill holes through the beam and body of the plane, then install a fastener in each hole, along with a collar to hold it together. That was my job. then we would let the quality inspectors come through and check our work. If there were any changes needed to be made we would complete each task as needed. Then our job was finished. Next we would input the days work into the computer. Then I would clock out and go home."

good,"A typical day at Boeing, in the various software positions that I occupied, might start off with trouble-shooting a program bug. This is always fun work, because it involves puzzle-solving. I might be interrupted to answer a customer call, from someone who needed technical assistance. I would research their problem, talk with whatever experts in other departments needed to be contacted and consulted with, and call the customer back and explain to them what we knew about the problem. We might have a solution immediately, we might work with them on the phone to develop one, we might have to wait until another expert got back to me. I would typically return to the task that I had been working on, prior to customer support, and do more puzzle-solving.
