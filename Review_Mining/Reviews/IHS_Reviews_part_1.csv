rating,review
bad,A typical day at work consisted of checking all restrooms eating area for employees The pay was okay for the work required but overall the work was never the problem the management were unreliable and not dependable. That alone was my sole issue with the IHS company.
bad,There is no communication between staff and management. They are highly understaffed and thus try overwork their underpaid employees. There is alot of responsibility and lack of work/ life balance.
bad,"When I first started my job at IHS, I really enjoyed coming to work. A couple months in we got put under new management and things definitely changed. Our boss began hiring in strictly family members, and promoted every one of them. This wouldn’t have been an issue, except the people she promoted were EXTREMELY unprofessional and not fit for the management position. They harassed workers, made a stressful and hostile environment, and did nothing all day besides make the job harder than it needed to be. They would give one person multiple floors to clean in the warehouse, with no help. If you did not complete every single task given to you, even if you were obviously struggling, you would get written up and possibly suspended. We worked 12 hour shifts and often got pulled off of our breaks, or sent home for taking our breaks. Management treated staff terribly and differently based on race, age, gender, and if you were hired in by the new management or not. We were constantly threatened our jobs especially when it became 6-7 days mandatory a week. If you didn’t show up, you would get a text saying come in or you’re terminated. Not to mention they began shortening everyone’s checks by HUNDREDS of dollars and STILL expected them to work. This happened multiple weeks in a row and would take them multiple weeks at a time to fix. I have NEVER experienced such an unprofessional, hostile, and petty job in my life. If the old management was still there, I would still have a job."
bad,I hated it the people were unprofessional  it was always drama they would demand for you to come in on your off days  workplace culture was very intimidating slow paced people always calling out employees stealing the hardest part was having to be there the most enjoyable part was getting off
bad,IHS offers a quality work environment for those that want to succeed and advance. They have many divisions to work in. I enjoyed working with my co workers.
bad,My job at IHS is a stepping stone while I am attending school. I enjoy working and meeting new people. The hardest part of my job is having people looking down on me because they think they are better than me because of what I do. Management always let me know that I am doing a great job. My co-workers always encourage me to stay strong and keep my head up. I thank God that I have a job to pay the bills and put food on my table. I am blessed.
bad,There is no advancement within the company unless your family (local/family owned). Compensation is far from fair for the labor/job that is expected from you. Full of empty promises.
bad,"IHS is not a long term employer, at any time you can be laid off without warning or consideration, if you are looking for a long term commitment, look elsewhere.  It's all about the bottom line of profits for this company and they do NOT value or care for their employees."
bad,"Merging with Markit, UK based, IHS culture quickly went from great work life balance and happy employees to just another company. You are encouraged to promote then you do, manager black balls you. H.R. is unsympathetic and unprofessional..Hiring off the street rather than promote within."
bad,"IHS Is A bad place to work not because of the job b, but because of the people that you work with its not much team work in that job its very hectic at times."
bad,"I was acquired into this company so I was use to a great culture and where the analyst were the priority of the company. This company focuses on their massive sales squad who really don't know about the reports or details and are mainly focused on hitting their targets and getting commission. While this may be great if you are in sales, as an analyst, it's insulting considering those are the individuals creating the documents to sell. The low salary, okay benefits and lack of transparency to anyone above your supervisor is incredibly disappointing. The company is more focused on making their share holders happy than making sure their employees are taken care of. Needless to say, I've moved on. If I'm going to work for a big company, I would like to at least get paid that way. Especially when the benefits and pay at Frost, IDC and VDC are much better than IHS. If you come into a position here, my only advice is to make sure you negotiate a high salary because the raises are barely enough to cover inflation and cost of living increases."
bad,Its a company in turmoil as far as meeting deadlines.  My project left a trail of dead.  This is an international company so you will be working with a lot of offshore people.  The hours can be very long because of this.
bad,"work was usually repetitive but coworkers were excellent, Usually worked with another employee work hours were good overall not a bad company to work for"
bad,"Companies pay good money for IHS's services when in fact a lot of the articles that the editors claim to write are actually articles that they cut and paste out of other articles, they just change a few words around and sign their names to it."
bad,"low pay not able to sustain life/ balance bills etc."
bad,"Hard work, travelling around the country, had good relationship with staff and management.  the company lost a portfolio transferred to Broll, therefore request to move over"
bad,The company is often advertised as a top 10 employer in Denver.  Don't be deceived.  They advertise internally for voting on this.  They are marginal at best.  They sway with the price of oil.  The annual RIF is the constant.  Salary variance is high between employees.
bad,"Our former company was doing great, good growth, good business, and we were getting rewarded for it, provided with the best tools to do our job, and a substantial bonus (for everybody in the company)."
bad,"IHS is a giant public corporate monster that works very hard to convince employees it's small and friendly. Your entire professional trajectory at IHS -- what you're paid, if and when you're promoted, your internal opportunities, your paltry raises -- depends on stock price movement and the size of major shareholders' returns. Pressure to increase revenue is everywhere, and constant. I was lucky to have two good managers who encouraged quality work and tried to temper the buzzword-packed corporate messaging. My team was also filled with smart, dedicated people who generally enjoyed their jobs but struggled with IHS as a company. Upper management frequently come off as aloof, out of touch politicians obsessed with revenue. IHS continues to favor acquisitions over organic growth, resulting in a fragmented, disorganized, and inconsistent company culture."
bad,You were always worried about your job because they were constantly holding layoffs. It didn't matter your seniority. The company thrives on acquisitions which means that your job is relevant one day and not the next.
bad,"Not really one company, but many. Acquisitions have resulted in huge number of relatively senior people that have risen above their Peter Principle level, but are able to blame others for their failures."
bad,IHS recently merged with Markit from the United Kingdom.  The ethics and work atmosphere has changed drastically so I would not recommend working there.  I retired just as the merger was taking place but have heard of many of my friends being laid off or those staying have had benefits cut drastically.
bad,"Enjoyed position while I was there, but there really wasn't enough to keep me busy and it went from 5 days a week to 3 then finally ended all together."
good,"My role varied from Office manager to Sales Director support. I gained a lot of experience from presentations and organising events."
good,I would recommend this job to anyone terrible management and lot of stress and really not worth it unless you really really need a job. Then they lost the contract with Amazon and everyone was laid off without being notified
good,The company is high stress.  They hire batches of people through temporary services on a regular basis.  They pick the ones they feel are the best for the position and fire the rest.  It makes for a competitive atmosphere.
good,"Project Management was not good. I learned many things from IHS like technically & professional with carry out my works in this company. Some of co-workers was good but some are behave like a enemies and also the team lead also not so good."
good,"- Upper management not interested in improving the organization "
good,"Productive & Fun Work Place. "
good,Well it all depends on the person ur taking care of cause u cant change nobody's  way of been  we just got to adapt to them it's hard but patiences and a worm heart goes a long way.
good,I worked for them as a remote analyst and the work was not that frequent. And when it came to pay there has always been delays with an assigned new poor Manager.
good,"Working for IHS represented many challenges. As part of an acquired company, there was the general level of uncertainty that follows any acquisition. I was also working for the first time with a remote supervisor and team. Developing a sense of team spirit and knowledge of who to lean on was difficult in this atmosphere."
good,It was a nice environment to get your foot in the door to learn the oil and gas data. I learned a lot while I was under Geo Tech supervisor.
good,people are nice there.  they are trying to integrate many cos. that they purchased
good,This company is a nice place to work. Very friendly atmosphere.
good,"Good to start the career, less opportunities to grow, not handsome salary, less work pressure, good teammates, no job security, less challenging tasks, no team building activity"
good,"As a medical support assistant, I would prepare referrals for weekly review, research claims, schedule patients, and submit purchase orders for approved referrals or call-ins."
good,"Very laid back culture. Good challenging work, but not much of a place to make a career. You'll get stuck in position with no chance of promotion or pay raise."
good,"1. Typical day of work is to manage the customers "
good,I have enjoyed my time at Pawnee IHS very much. It was a much different work environment than I was accustomed to; but after a little time it seemed like I had worked in a clinic forever. I had worked in the home health field for apx 15 yrs and at first I felt confined and limited. However over the course of 2 1/2 yrs I came to realize that I was a vital member of a very large healthcare team & that we all shared a common goal: Improving Patient Care and helping our patients attain & maintain the best health possible. The biggest challenge was learning the IHS referral system; but I tackled the referral system & overcame it.
good,"Opportunities to learn, in a fast paced environment. Management is not a safe place to be if you want to stay employed. They run a much too lean shop"
good,"The days are wildly variable, ranging from a stressful overload to a stultifying stoppage."
good,"I would definitely go back if I could . It was a great place to work at and I met and worked with good people. Hopefully I can find a job similar to IHS, Inc."
good,Enjoyed taking care of the lawns and making properties look amazing. Learned how to maintain lawns/ yards. Leaving the customers satisfied with their properties.
good,"Most of my days would be spent in meetings with different stakeholders with little time to do the work required. There is progression within the company but payrises are sparse and pay generally lower than average, the benefits package is very good though. The culture is very stakeholder orientated with little expenditure on anything that may affect this. The people I would work with make the job enjoyable but the lack of commitment to colleagues is hard to get past"
good,"The management team was highly involved with the overall care of the residents and the management of the staff and the facility. The Management team worked as a team and were efficient in providing the appropriate level of care to the residents, and family members.  All staff repeatedly went beyond the basic duties to do extra for the residents. And the staff treated one another like extended family members. Good place to work with truly caring people."
good,Worked for IHS for 4 months and laid off on a sudden reorganization. Never got feedback for performance. Hard to judge with such a short time.........
good,this was a good company to work for I never had a problem with them. I went and filled out the app and they had me a jo the same day. they have a great staff.
good,"Continuous changes to organizational structure which creates delay/ changes/dismiss of existing and ongoing projects. "
good,"Dynamic working environment, many business verticals to choose from. Depending on the business field, timelines are very client driven, working overtime is necessary to meet project deadlines. Bonuses and overtime compensation available to some."
good,It's a US Wells project related all USA states wells information are down loaded as per client instructions and provided to team related team. Oil and Gas board (IOGC). This project was taken from IHS-United states(Information Handling Solutions). It's a top most company in world wide. This company has to take that project from United State Government

good,"Assisted in distribution of PLC/Energy Web Leads. Researched, rerouted/linked leads toexisting customer records and notified the appropriate reps."
good,"worked in a long term care facility performing occupational therapy on a variety of patients including ventilator patients , multiple diagnosis and contractures."
good,"IHS Markit is a data/analytics company with lofty revenue goals.  In preparation for a recent merger and as a new merged company (IHS, Markit), they are primarily tactically focused from an IT perspective.  This means that enterprise initiatives and organizations (e.g. EA, PMO) were considered unnecessary.  Merger shareholders and the market place were promised significant cost savings / synergies as well.  This is a key contributor to tactical focus."
good,"I learned to seek help from co-workers and show initiative and good judgment.  I was permitted to participate in team meetings and management reviewed goals and performance individually with each employee in the Houston, TX, office."
good,"Typical day is hoping you get enough /contacts to meet your metrics. "
good,"Great work place, laid-back environment, good for senior developers who looking for a stable and easy job. For young developers, you might not want to work here since you can learn much more (and earn much more) somewhere else."
good,"Benefits are great, however there is little room to advance."
good,Reveiwing and Posting Invoices and Expenses
good,Excellent culture and opportunities for growth. Great colleagues. Teamwork is important. But career advancement is not clear and subjective depending on manager.
good,the work experience at IHS was good also and the work history with the colleague was very interesting and I develop a log of knowledge when I was there.
good,They placed me at a company that was horrible.  I called to discuss it with them; they never replied to my emails or voice messages.  They didn't care at all.
good,Good work environment . Friendly colleagues . Enjoyed working under different projects. Learnt many things in excel and to conduct oneself well in an organisation.Hardest part was work pressure.
good,"The company have lots of interesting technology and a huge variety of business units. The culture of Agile development is pushed hard and we received Rally training."
good,"Good atmosphere to work, provide s health care to native Americans, employees are friendly. Plenty of work to do in keeping facility up to date.  Follows Joint Commission requirement."
good,"This is a great company as far as it mission and stated values. Unfortunately mid to senior management undercut them by their behavior. There is a great deal of time spent on touting the values and the top most senior managers believe it however it quickly gets lost below that. It's a public company so performance is important, unfortunately the values are thrown out the windows by may of the senior managers in a make the numbers not matter what mentality"
good,"I like working with provider because she was a wonderful person, her family also was so nice ,gave me time off when I needed it, nice family to work with"
good,"Well it is good. I have used this once in 2018, and it helped a lot. This helped my family by getting me a well paying job, and I hope I can get more out of this."
good,"people work hard to get jobs for applicants but do not have an up to date data base system to do the best job."
good,"A day of work could either be slow or fast paced. You never really knew. I learned that not all jobs are professional. That management was very poor, seemed like they supervisors had no idea what they were doing while everyone else working under then had way more knowledge and work ethic. Supervisors would usually talk down on workers and cause a hostile work place. Meaning a lot of employees would stick together and help each other out. The hardest part was the poor management, short breaks, and impossible expectations, By that I mean they would give 1 person multiple floors to clean in a warehouse by theirs elf and they don't encourage others helping. The enjoyable part of was having nice employees, and for the most part and independent work environment."
good,I loved working with handicapped adults it was a fulfilling job they just love everyone they meet and are willing to help in any way they can best job I've had
good,"Always have something to work on. Good people to work with. Good hours, no overtime. Something new to learn everyday. Constant workflow. Great people."
good,Good Company to Work but looking for some new opportunities.
good,"My day was an 8-5 day came in an stocked after breakfast an set up for lunch. I learned how and what to make for different patients with different symptoms, our director was a very hard working woman. she always came in on time made sure we did what we was suppose to do an she also showed me what to do, my co-workers were also hard working women. they worked long and tiring hours and sometimes 7 days a week. the hardest part was leaving. I had got use to working there. it was hard for me to say good bye. the most enjoyable part was me being able to make somebody smile when they seen me at the register every morning."
good,"It is a very good workplace with good supporting team, Scope to learn about tools"
good,During my time at IHS I learned about the ins and outs of working in web-based marketing and how targeted direct emails can benefit a company's overall status and stature. I also was able to hon my skills as a press release writer and the ability to continue to write about a variety of electronics.
good,Amazing people......nice and friendly staff....very professional company...great experience....perfect location...and working environment is fantastic
good,its fine as far as a job but the pay and benefits are not great.For someone who is desperate for work like me it is perfect but hours they want you to do does go with pay
good,"first company, thought us completely about work, work environment and nice co-ordination with colleagues, overall very nice experience, best job to work at as per my experience."
good,Having started as a messenger after leaving school I was promoted to work in the production department as a layout artist. The work was always evolving as publishing companies constantly faced new challenges. I was fortunate to be part of the launching of new products and see it flourish in a very sceptical market. The excitement and joy of watching the publications grow and become the leading journal in its field is not something I would forget easily. The hardest part of the job was always trying to keep cost to a minimum without impacting on professional and quality.
good,A growing company with skills and knowledge in many areas.  It is possible to find someone with data on most topics and this makes life easier as an analyst.
good,"Work life balance"
good,"Working amongst factory workers to keep the building clean and presentable.  There are set times to cleaning restrooms during the 12 hour shift in a rotating order.  There are also offices that are to be cleaned including taking out trash,  dusting and sweeping floors. The hardest part is to make sure you are on time and your work is done thoroughly."
good,Seems their biggest focus now is outsourcing all the jobs to Malaysia.  No longer committed to their employees.  When I first started working for IHS they were very focused on building their business and taking care of their employees.  Once the company merged with Markit they only seem to be cutting jobs.  There are many people who were worked there 20+ years which is what made me want to work there; job security.  Not anymore.
good,I was employed by IMS Research a small private company this was acquired by IHS a large US company which as grown by acquisition. It has become increasing difficult to do my job well as travel has been all but stopped and my market research work requires a very F2F approach. I am considering semi-retirement and haw I might use my experience to best effect.
good,"My first job after gratuated,"

good,I worked for Human Resource.  I was responsible for reviewing and updating reports and documents that were submitted to the Board of Directors.  Hardest part of my job was meeting deadlines working many hours per day.  I enjoyed working with the other staff members.  My tenure at IHS was for a short period of time.  I left company to pursue other opportunities.
good,not bad for a government job. the work is at an ihs facility an Indian health service hospital.  Very rewarding to help people with serious need. expect usual government bureaucracy
good,we would get calls or have appointments made for us to go work on appliances I learned how to take appliances apart and how to fix some things on most appliances. The management was good. The workplace culture was ok. The hardest part of the job was how far we would travel   sometimes for us to get to the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the things I learned while there.

Management was comfortable to work with as long as you did your job. Some co-workers you worked well with and some might be difficult. You find what's comfortable for you and work to be the best at what you do. The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone got the care he or she needs. The most enjoyable part was seeing the joy on the faces of the ones that got good nursing care."
