rating,review
bad,"In Whp..They force you to write a good feedback about the company! They will treat you so bad unless they need something from you or you have a relative inside in upper management !Managers take it personally and will try to destroy you as soon as you are not on their side!Management has the ego that they know everything and you know nothing! "
bad,"The company dose not reivest in equipment, The managers run when things go wrong and look to blame others,the company need to invest in new equipment,there is too much waste inspectiondue to poor inpe"
bad,"Whirlpool uses Temp agencies Aerotek and Randstad and hires in class after class of temps lying to them stating it is temp to hire.  Unless you have a relative already working at Whirlpool and are under the age of 50 you have a 1 percent chance of getting hired.  They have a 99 percent turnover in both sales and Trade Customer service.  Extremely low pay and the culture is that of a Junior High School, petty and gossipy."
bad,The pay was alright but they were not worried about the employees as much as they were worried about getting the numbers out. It was far to strenuous on all body parts and too many hours were required
bad,Whirlpool is run as a corporation and cares only about the corporation and not the employees that keep the company in business.  Corporate needs over workers needs
bad,"Fermé pour délocalisation. "
bad,I was let go along with about 30 other people at the same time.  No training.  I met my boss one time. Never received any direction and was told what to do by other workers that I had no idea what their role was.
bad,"Customers and their faults no longer company priority ,very poor management detached from what's really happening in the field,wages low,no job progression opportunity,"
bad,"Wow. Just wow.  All the supervisors are on drugs and have 0 ethics.  They literally are sleeping with everyone.  Human resources bailed on that sinking ship so now you have these outsources hr reps who making moving up impossible. It takes months to get change a job.  And even then the interviews are complete frauds. If they dont like you they wonr invite hr to that meeting so you only score half the points and lose by default. "
bad,"It's hard work, the pay is NOT enough for the amount of work. People are working like slaves but not getting paid what they deserve? I don't get it were in 2019!, NO AC I don't understand why? Benefits are good but pay needs to be more if they want people to stay, ac needs to be on!!!"
bad,Would never recommend anyone to whirlpool. Constantly giving you down days laid off a whole week with no pay. Management approves my vacation and tells me day of they declined it and I must stay or I get fired. Zero training sink or swim style. Not enough bad things to say about this plant. Meanwhile the higher ups in management are on drugs and try to get people fired regularly. high turnover rate
bad,"The absolute worst place ever to work. Hardly any training provided, unfriendly and unhelpful coworkers. Not worth the pay. They just throw you on a line and expect you to catch on. And quickly. And don’t dare ask for help."
bad,"Whirlpool approves of Kelly Services mismanaging their employees. Lack of pay Lack of PTO. WHIRLPOOL has to approve of time off They refused me of My son graduation I couldn't get time off for nor time off for his College Signing for Football  LACK OF FAMILY VALUES They prefer Product over People. Safety does NOT come first everyone in sub assembly can smell the alcohol but AC or Supervisors never reported or question the line all while visually seeing this person could not function. WHIRLPOOL Will lie say you get hired in after 90 days or 520 hours Its been 180 day well over 520 with overtime but refuse to honor their word and hire me in. Lack of communication my line is downsizing from 9 employee to 5 I'm lowest seniority but they and Kelly Services won't explain what's going on with me. "
bad,High Expectation for Selling and Brutal Customer Service - consumers are allowed to swear and be mean to those persons answering the phone - customer service representatives must take the fowl language no matter what and Supervisors are changing requirements daily
bad,Work more than 65 hours weekly  basically 7 days a week at times. 12 hour days. Don'thold people accountable. Supervisors yell and are very rude. Very cold in the winter.
bad,Management will screw you out of pay. Operators don't listen. Forklift drivers act like they own the plant. Work every other Saturday on short notice.
bad,LE Management culture du lieu de travail l;aspect le agreable de votre poste
bad,"I worked for Whirlpool through a temp agency called Randstad. They are by far the worst agency EVER! After an incident in the restroom where a floor was left wet and no sign was put, I was fired for missing work even with a note from a doctor."
bad,Racist environment..hot...no air only fans...team leaders are not really qualified for positions..hostile work environment...WHIRLPOOL SUCKS...very short breaks...the bathrooms are very far ...lunch breaks are 26 minutes when it should be an hour.The turnover is very high due to their point system..They will hire you quick and fire you even quicker..They dont seem to care about the quality of work only quantity...I would not refer anyone to work there.
bad,"Overall I did not mind working at Whirlpool. I absolutely enjoyed the work and was fine with the physical labor that went with it. I'm fairly fit and try to stay as healthy as possible. If I want to give an honest reason why I'm giving such a low review I will be truthful. When I first started I knew it'd be a physical toll and I had to either get used to it or it wouldn't work. My back ached and my hands felt like I was a 100 old man with severe arthritis and etc. I didn't try to complain about the pain because I knew it's something that came with the job and it was something I had to get used to. Only times I mentioned it were if I felt I was slowing down and needed some assistance. I was a little alarmed when I was flat out told. ""Either it gets better or it's just not going to work."" I was told either I get better or I'll be fired. I wasn't a bad working and I was trying to find ways to make the pain manageable so I could do the best of my abilities. It was confusing to me that a job would throw out a hard worker without any negotiation or compensation for at least trying to do my best in spite of my physical pain."
bad,It's fast paced hard work they don't make sure you have proper training and if you aren't close with the team leads or supervisors you ain't getting anywhere
bad,"Not possibility of advancement. Pay is low but huge lot of work everyday."
bad,I didn't like I was talked to. They wouldn't let go to the bathroom it was emergency.the line was fast even when your new they expect you to keep up.play dumb you will get a better job.
bad,"This a horrible place to work for! They don’t care about consumers or workers, they fire everyone and just keep bringing in new hires to replace for like a week. You get lied to and in trouble for just looking the wrong way so ridiculous."
bad,The management does not care about your well being (and that is even if you know who your management is) They do not expect you to work for your family they seem to want you to have a family to work there. More worried about there own image on select days through the year when wealthy business men come through the plant than actual safety. all in all worse job i have ever had and i worked there for a few years.
bad,era jovem aprendiz e muitas coisas que foram faladas nao foram cumpridas
bad,I love working in fast paced environment and being able to advance my career maybe even be able to go to corporate one day if I try hard enough very good job
bad,till date the worst decision in my 18 years old career to join here.too much politics and inefficient work culture.excessive amount of back biting.this Indian subsidiary is not at all the same as the USA parent.
bad,un'esperienza che pensavo potesse durare ma sinceramente pessima
bad,would not recommend this company.  Management treats workers terrible.  There is no opportunities at this company.  Pay is low for what they ask you to do.
bad,Employees are kept unaware about many facts! No knowledge sharing. Discrimination between people on company payroll and on third party payroll. Too much work load. tight deadlines.
bad,this place is lacking in management and production is Training is really horrible and what you dont know you have to learn on the fly and people get mad if they have to show you.
bad,the management sucks at this company they don't care about their employees will work them to death without any remorse when you do supposedly have vacation time they will never approve any day you pick to take off and will not work with you when u have family issues and need time off
bad,"If you've ever heard of the term ""forced ranking"", then you know where I'm going. For those of you that haven't, in a nutshell:"
bad,"It was very interesting, but also very hard."
bad,The work environment is horrible. The permanent supervisors are not fair in their treatment of new hires. The management has no regard for new people's learning many new jobs. Their is a lot of favoritism. Older employees are very coy in designing plots to ruin a person's ability to work free from harassment. Management has no control over team leaders and line supervisors. I would not recommend working there especially if you are a minority. It's ridiculous.
bad,Uma empresa q não oferece muitas oportunidades d crescimento e quando oferece são pra pessoas q puxão saco
bad,Empresa que poderia ser gigante pelo produto. Mas a cabeça da estrutura é provincial. Uma pena. Apenas empresa de trampolim profissional.
bad,It's a good place to work. People are friendly they don't give up on you there always pushing for you to do better the hours are easy time goes buy fast
bad,Initially what is perceived as a good company to work for however the communication between ground staff and management is poor and the daily planning schedule isn't efficient.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, I installed the appliances for Whirlpool. 15 hours days are norm for this company. No communication from this company. Bad pay as well."
bad,"Worst customer service role I have ever had the pleasure of working for. Lack of training and no progression within your role, a dead end role, made to feel like a number and certainly not valued as a person, terrible management. Lied to and treated badly and nobody cares and is made accountable they have absolutely no work ethics. Bad practices, results in poorly trained staff and management. "
bad,Management is horrible they don't care about their employees! The only thing they care about is the all mighty $ and they don't care who's backs they have to break to get it!
bad,I have had a positive experience working with Whirlpool.  I have had the opportunity to work with management as well as employees.  I teach American Sign Language and enjoy my job.
bad,"Was treated like I was never part of the team.  Was more concerned with the fact that I did not like the FREE lunch, than they were if I did my job correctly.  Is a seasonal job and was  told at the end of the season, during my review that I would be returning for the 2016 season.  In January received a registered letter telling me that I was NOT a good fit and they were firing me.  Did not even have the courtesy to tell me to my face.  I have never been treated so badly in all my life.  On the good side the guest always treated me very well.  Management is very sour.  Co-workers never wanted to work as a team.   Guaranteed  me 32 hours a week.  Always wanted to ""SHAVE""  hours off to short me.  I worked harder there than I did at the Hospital.  Pay should be a minimum of 10.45/hr."
bad,"favortism, lack of communication between higher level and floor employees.  no satisfaction, no gratitude, no incenetives"
bad,"Learned project management process & C2C processes required at the time of new developments"
bad,Oh my I don't even know where to start how about the fact we had to lie to customers on a daily basis and it was definitely safety problems and violations a lot of them were recalls. The whole entire brand of whirlpool is junk!!! I mean literally and if you're out of the one year warranty they won't do anything for you unless you buy and extended warranty which in itself doesn't cover much. Horrible bosses to put up with. Horrible rules and regulations. The company has ripped off sooo many people over the years. Poor Maytag you never should have let them buy you. HUGE MISTAKE I tell everyone I know not to ever buy a whirlpool appliance of any kind their all junk.
bad,"I worked at the incoming call center in Benton Harbor Mi.  The bottom line for this co....money.  I had to explain to people that even though they spent $3000.00 on a refrigerator, if they were a day over their 1 yr. warranty, too bad.  Your stuck in a cubicle 9 hrs. a day with 2 ten minute breaks and a 1/2 hr. lunch.  My mom is going thru her last days of life and because I had been called because she went to the hospital, needed me, etc. too bad.  I've never worked at a job that was so heartless."
bad,"Whirpool was a good job when it was here"
bad,Its not the job for someone that want job security.. It sucks here!! The pay isn't great. You work long hours. If you get pregnant the benefits are SUPER WEAK. MOST positions are outsourced
bad,"They cater to the weak , bully the strong to work harder, doing your job plus the weak jobs as well. They also play favorite . There is an hourly employee on line 6 who been an employee plus 25 year , and they had an hourly employee do her job so she can play straw boss and play on her phone play around with her friends . She very racist against white people , have said out loud I don’t do white I don’t care who knows it."
bad,Much Drama and no respect towards the associates that work for the company. The Salary workers carry big attitudes and doesn't work with the ones that work for them....
bad,I felt attacked racially. And not respected. If they would just not be so judgmental and disrespectful we would be alright. But that wasn’t the case..
bad,I started working when it was magic Chef it changed to Maytag then where to whirlpool. Whirlpool is the worst company of all I work.My pay is lower then drivers that do replacing absent drivers. I do more then drivers in my area. Coordinator Call’s on me all day to do other things no one else.
bad,"Its ran by by supervisors who have never been on the production floor, when you have an issue they don't seem to understand whats wrong when you explain it to them. Another example of ""i don't know how to do your job, but my book says you are doing it wrong"""
bad,But the are not opportunity to advace for better future there if you dont have any family and any high posicion they dont give you the job 
bad,Whirl pool wharehouse is not the plan.for their work you jave to move big boxes full of anything(some heavy some not) along with fridges and micro waves and beds and couches and all appliances all over the warehouse that you have to take to specific unloading lines but there arent enough tools toove them with so some workers are pushing these items across yhe floor to the unloafong door.after they get them to the door the truck drivers and his installer prepare to distribute these items(prepared the day before) but not before they argue with the warehouse worker for the same tools that there already isnt enough of in the warehouse.truck drivers and installers also dont get breaks.the installers with the truck drivers are the old warehouse workers who've been working three for a while so sometimes they even rotate.overall this job is truly modern day slavery.
bad,The management could try to make sure they stick to there word instead of going back on it. They could also have more leaniacny for people who are hurt at work and come back with restrictions.
bad,"The workplace with a low level of compensation and management. "
bad,"Doesn't matter how hard you work and know your job unless you are a huge kiss a**, you won't get anywhere! Been with them several years and went to school 4 years for them and they continue to be rude on me! Maintenance is one of the worst depts to be in considering the management involved with this department! Can't wait to find a new employer who appreciates my knowledge and commitment! Also insurance is horrible and extremely way to expensive! Over $400/biweekly for a family!"
bad,Not a good company to work for its a job!! Not to mention very high employment turn-over rate. I don't know how much the company paid  people to write these reviews but they are lying come join us see for yourself.
bad,"Complete waste of time. Was let go because of missing 20 minutes within a one month period. Pay sucks. The climate of the cooperation is that of rudeness, and not caring of the employees."
bad,"They do not care about the safety of their people and they lie to their employees.  While I was there I ran a machine that took two people, I was the only one working there and if I was gone they would have two people working there and second shift had two people working there.  If you did not hit your quota for the day you had to stay late or come in early the next day however when second shift didn't hit their quota they didn't have to stay late or come in early."
bad,"Worked for Whirlpool as in In Home Agent (IHA) from December to July. Was originally promised conversion from temp to permanent within 2 to 3 months. This was not the case. I ended up quitting for many more reasons, though. This job requires you to keep your cool while having someone berating you in your ear. You are NOT allowed to respond in any way other than ""understanding the customer's feelings"". Closing statement before ending the call is not clear for the customer to understand, thus receiving a request to elaborate, which you are not allowed to do, as well as getting deduction from quality scores if you DO elaborate. Management is not in good communication with each other. Leads will tell you one thing while your overall manager says another, then YOU are responsible for the mess up. NO PAID SICK TIME/VACATION TIME even when earned. Both full time and part time. Definitely will NOT be recommending this job to anyone EVER AGAIN."
bad,Ambiente excessivamente competitivo e tóxico para os trabalhadores.
bad,"Instabilità delle decisioni"
bad,"this company claims to be a family orientanted company but I couldn't tell you a better lie. you have 5 days the entire year. and if your late by 30 seconds that counts as a full day against you. if your child is sick or in the hospital that is not an excuse to miss work. if your in the hospital yourself its not an excuse. if your in a car accident on the way to work your still expected to be there that day. and that's just a small portion on that"
bad,"Very unorganized place to work..always out of parts, lots of screaming and yelling between supervisors and employees. Very high tempered amd lots of cussing. Pay is ok but not for what you are expected to do with very little training."
bad,"I love my neighbor as myself. This company penalizes their employees for having any other lifestyle than alternative. "
bad,Not a good place to be... very structured and treated as a child.  No growth - work is BORING..  I mean who has to put a lunch sign on their desk to go to lunch??
bad,"horrendous management,no job security whatsoever.Workers who give years of service are quickly a target for release.They talk about people culture, teamwork, spirit of winning but they dont practice what they preach.They give all the American jobs to Mexico and Brazil, they use Employment agency not to pay medical or even full salaries.People from other countries want you to abide by Brazil laws when we work in the USA and even by Mexico policies, its an absolute joke."
bad,Poor place to work. Break room is right in front of restrooms where people wait in line to use the limited facilities. Bad working conditions and leadership. Harassment appears to be ok with Human resources.
bad,management played a lot of favortism and did not listen to complaints regarding any of it. over abundance of gossip at all times. very disgusting. increased my blood pressure to the point i was forced to take FMLA because my heart was being overworked
bad,Hired on the pretense that I would be going into a specific department. Was told this prior to being hired and also all through the hiring process. Never got into that department and they moved the  department to another state within 6 months of my hiring.
bad,"The company itself sell appliances that are 85% faulty, hence the amount of calls that you seem to handle each day. "
bad,worked from 1973 til 2017  last 7 years was a big joke  thaye hire jerks that never ran a press or shot screw as supervisors and they dont know any thing
bad,"This company is so dis organized, they say quality is first but at 5 seconds a unit you don't have time to even put screws in correctly or plug in wires all the way."
bad,he company is a nightmare to work for constantly changing there minds about how they want to help customers leading to inconsistent treatment of customers. Expecting there saff to lie to customers the custoemr service is appalling
bad,"I'm still in disbelief how a $21 Billion Corporation could allow and perpetuate a work environment with so much racial discrimination, nepotism, and pollution. The cancer rates in the surrounding area are off the charts! The management turns a blind eye on prevalent racial discrimination. Out of more than 3000 employees only a few percent are minorities. They do however produce a reasonably good washing machine/"
bad,The work here is neither comfortable or enjoyable. Many places in the factory have no temperature control and frequent hydration breaks are required to continue working effectively and safely.
bad,Every quarter was a fire drill to make numbers and the culture was very poor as it was not genuine. Very hard environment to maintain a positive work attitude.
bad,"I worked under a very strict and rude Manager. She would get mad at me for going to the rest room for more than 50 seconds. Absolutely no flexibility with work schedule, If you cannot make it to work on a specific day of the week for any period of time then tough luck. "
bad,Very very political temporary stay temps for several years before going full time. As a supervisor you have no control over anything without consent from human resources.
bad,"Management is constantly changing, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Constantly trying to appease new management, good or bad."
bad,"co workers are like little children, management is just there .  Jobs are easy but fast."
bad,"I would rather go back to power washing hog barns for 12-14 hours a day. The days drag on, and leadership treated me like I was unable to do the job at times which was frustrating when the issues arising were caused further down the line. A significant language barrier between myself and my team leader."
bad,"As I driver you are expected to go out on your own."
bad,I worked there for three years and almost everyday a nightmare. They dont care about safty or people unless you work on line. Lost my job because I told a unsafe employee to be safer and they hit me. Then they fired both of us. They put out poor product and dont care as long as they make money. Dont work here.
bad,Department supervisor was really chill as long as you got your work done. Plant manager was not fair and would recommend not working their. The only thing that would make this better is no temp agency and unionize.
bad,To much gossip and drama! Work with a lot better old people who like to bicker back and forth about who does what and who has a harder job. I’d not recommend working there to anybody.
bad,No life/work balance management was very poor and demand is absurd. 30 min lunch when ten mins is spent just trying to get to and from lunch room. They fired a lady cause her home got hit by a tornado and she had to leave cause her family was injured. They need union control
bad,"The people are honestly extremely rude, I was harassed, stalked, bullied, and threatened and whenever I went to report any of these happenings none of my higher ups did anything to stop or resolve these. They basically just gave the other employee who was doing such things a slap on the wrist so to speak."
bad,"Fired in a coverup. I had warned management in several emails of a potential problem that was a danger. They refused. Someone was hurt in the exact manner I described although I was not there and I was fired when I refused to take responsibility for it. Several others were let go, too.I worked many overtime hours, never refused a task. went to work and ta noon they called me in and let me go. Has caused so many problems ."
bad,"Ambiente di lavoro mal organizzato, responsabili in alcuni casi poco competenti e disorganizzati, contratti precari e soprattutto basse prospettive di crescita professionale."
bad,"Do your job as told by top management person. Even though your told by 10 others to do it another way, do it how your told by top dog. Do not try to explain any situation as your words will mean nothing to nobody. clock in, clock out, collect your paycheck and you will do fine."
bad,I wouldn't recommend unless you happy to be a data processor without ambition. Disappointing experience overall. Not much communication between the department  not great atmosphere in the building. No career development opportunity
bad,"Very bad atmosphere, they seem care very little for workers, unwilling to actually listen to employees about new ideas. Bosses pick favorites very quickly."
bad,whirlpool was great place to work.  Like all company they had  good supervisor and not so good supervisor.  Healthcare were good
bad,If you don't talk bad about other employees with the managers you won't make it or move up so look for another job.  Everyone is 2 faced don't trust anyone. There's a total lack of communication in leadership and the pay is not god enough for the things you have to put up with
bad,"I worked at another manufacturing company for over 20 years and felt proud of my job and product that we made but after working at Whirlpool for almost 9 years I would not consider owing any of their products and I would not recommend any of their brands which makes me sad because I consider Maytag to be one of the best appliances until Whirlpool acquired the company The same for Kitchenaide,"
bad,Was a good place to work until started cutting and combing jobs left and right. Management hard to get along with at times. Co-workers great to work with. After 18 years with company they moved out to Mexico!
bad,"The pay, which tops out after five years, is good. Opportunities to move up are dependent upon who you know. There is a strong clique mentality. If you suffer an injury freedom the job, don't expect management to be supportive of you.  Do expect to be harassed, intimidated and accused of lying. I worked there 17 years and I had to leave because I had a worker's comp claim and I could  not handle the bullying from leadership."
bad,"Can't warn people away from refrigeration enough. Toxic culture that values looking smarter than your co-workers rather than actually working together to achieve something. Being thrown under the bus for things outside of your control (or sometimes outside of reality/ physics) is just called Tuesday. They claim they are trying to improve processes and ""move with speed"" except they only ever layer ever more complicated processes that slow everything down. "
bad,"Jobs keep getting more and more overloaded. You will work your fingers to the bone and then they will fight any injury claim you may file. Management has zero respect for employees. Lots of “good ol’ boys” in upper management. The only chance you have to advance is to get in with the right clique. Benefits keep getting worse and worse. Medical insurance is a joke these days. They like to say they are family oriented but they absolutely are not! They don’t care what the reason is if you need to leave, you will be pointed and if that means your over the limit we’ll that’s just too bad. I’ve seen people fired for pointing out after they had a heart attack!"
bad,"What used to be a five rotation job is cut down to two rotation job and then they speed the line up and don't add anyone to the line! They don't train someone long enough on jobs! You are only allowed 5 sick days off a year and that week is part of your vacation!!! Say you get 4 weeks vacation, no you get 3weeks, the 4week is your sick days off for the year!! Unfair!"
bad,Esforço repetitivo e sem valorização aos funcionários
bad,Pultroppo non è più affidabile non ti assicurano il futuro
bad,Repetitive work. same thing over and over. Supervisors will jump in and help if and when you get behind. no AC so it gets hot very quick and most people there don't keep up with their hygiene.
bad,"This would be a good place to work if management actually cared about Quality. They are trying to do too much to cheapen the product and make way too many changes that they think benefits the employees  and the product. They hide a lot of issues especially when people from other marketing companies come to visit. I’ve known women in there who are constantly sexually harassed and all that is done by HR to take care of this issue is move them to a different job or do some coaching. HR is an absolute joke. They only take care of management and could care less about the employees. Only 5 times a year do you get the opportunity to call in if you have an emergency, so if you have kids or constantly sick then I would not recommend this place. This used to be a great place to work, but new management and cheapening of the product has taken it downhill. The culture is not very good."
bad,"do not appreciate their dedicated employees.  No access to HR.  No more open door policy"
bad,"Management is horrible. Seniority means nothing. Favoritism everywhere. In a state that is an at will state...they seem to think they aren't allowed to fire people for harrassment. One guy here has ran off many women because he harasses  them and supervisors and mgt won't do anything about it. Corporate wouldn't even do anything. He still works here, no punishment at all. He even laughs about it. Supervisors are awful. I can't wait for the day I can walk out of here. Don't come here unless you have no other options!"
bad,Not a fair place to work. They do not support workforce. Management is only interested in having thier own backs. Will fire someone to protect their own self.
bad,"management is disorganized and has no planning capability. urgency and priority completely flip flops every week based on whichever manager is making the most noise. Bad business decisions are made on a regular basis to benefit someones goals for the year. Severe lack of leadership and not even a single grain of long term planning exists. managers are promoted based on gender and race to meet ""diversity"" goals and have no leadership competencies. Politics are at such a high level they can't be measured and dictate every decision based on opinion, not any facts."
bad,Whirlpool can be a great place to work for.in my time there.i experienced a lot of problems with the politics of business. They do not operate the way a million-dollar company should and they do not listen to their employees.
bad,As a temp at Kelly Services i was paid low and got unfair treatment compared to co-workers who worked for Whirlpool. I had witnessed hard workers who had worked there for 2 years getting paid 10/hr and hadn't taken more than 2 days off in those two years. There was no guarantee to getting hired in and i was hired in on a line that was being shutdown in a few months so i was to be laid off soon after being hired in. I quit to help my sick mother because the potential for opportunities weren't there and wasn't enough to keep me there.
bad,"not a clean place to work, but it was a job,  heavy work, loud, smelly, cold in the winter and hot in the summer.  but good pay scale."
bad,You make good money and have good benefits but it's like working in a soap opera everyday with huge amounts of drama.
bad,"Nepotism. People that have been there long feel like they can treat new hires like dirt. Everyone acts like it's high school, with gossip and talking about each other. Lazy people get rewarded while hard working ones get trampled over."
bad,Hope u don't get sick or have an illness. I was on FMLA and let go do to being unhealthy. The lead was absolutely horrible and higher up managers do nothing about it. Worst place ever
bad,"Mettere subito le cose in chiaro quando ti danno un tetto massimo di secondi per fare il tuo lavoro, altrimenti vieni preso di mira solo tre quattro volte che esci dai secondi ptestabiliti, E giuro sono pochi, C'è da correre come i matti!"
bad,You are not allowed to be at work happy or make light of any situations they will write u up for that only certain people can use their phones the rest get fired or written up
bad,"Work was alright until probation was up. Mandatory Saturdays for the last half of the year. Turnover rate is ridiculous. Many people working with unreported injuries. If you do report an injury they will use anything to get you fired. They don't care about family time at all. You were either coming in 2 hours early/late for four days a week or working a Saturday. "
bad,"Very hot environment in the summer. If you are a hard worker,, then you re worked harder while lazy employees are assigned easy jobs. The environment and also the management are hostile."
bad,"La corporation e' azienda stimolante, con processi consolidati e progetti interessanti."
bad,"The pay is great here, but it it doesn't pay you enough to deal with the bs on a daily basis. Micromanagement all throughout the place, most of them don't even know how to do their peers  jobs 100%. And if you get injured there at all, you're out of luck. The company dr. is a quack and he discriminates and gets off the hook."
bad,"I was a ranger which means I got to work all the positions in a particular section. My section was fabrication. But first I should say that the 3 day training period is actually a test of its own. The people that pick up the education the quickest are also the ones that get called back the soonest. "
bad,They have core values they don't follow and expect you to believe in. They bring in executives to fix problems and then lay off them when the problems are fixed. They have had numerous lay offs in the past year and have only hit 60% of their desired goal. They also knowingly build appliances to not last in hopes someone will buy their other brands under a different name. They are a horrible company that doesn't care about the employee nor the consumer and you will either feel insecure with your job or guilty knowing what the business does that is not right.
bad,"Newbies get the hardest and most horrible jobs. I am used to fast work, but some of these lines are so fast that it is hard to keep up, especially keeping up with the screws. I absolutely hated it."
bad,Whirlpool is a very large company that is interested in the bottom line
bad,They ignored doctor restrictions and still have you do work that you were restricted from doing and then say your moving to slow when they can clearly see you are in pain suffering
bad,They believe people are so desperate to work for them they will pay as little as they can.  People are not treated equally and what the promote as inclusion does not include all.
bad,"Assembly line work here comes down to: if you can't keep up or don't like the conditions, you should quit.  English speakers are the minority, especially for second and third shift, so brush up on your French.  Also, be prepared to do the same thing for 700-800 times a day, including lifting refrigerator doors."
bad,"Management has gone down hill over the past couple of years.  Speaking of manager and director level staff.  Morale has significantly declined as well, specifically over the past five years.  No longer a fun place to work.  Stress level off the charts."
bad,"What a disappointment.  Unintelligible product branding and employees from the many acquired companies having positioned themselves into management positions makes it impossible to get a fair shake here.  Big push to reduce costs but only if it makes your department look good.  For example, management wouldn't step in to  make one group spend $.50 that would have resulted in a $2.00 overall cost savings to the product.  They talk TEAM but don't walk TEAM.  If you enjoy being a foreigner in your own land then Whirlpool Engineering is the place for you.  The last time I felt that out of place was when I was working in China."
bad,"But the only family the care about is their own son or daughter advancing. Lazy people get promoted faster. The jobs are easy, once you get the hang of them. Coworkers were good. Management is terrible. Expect you to stay over with 5 minute notice."
bad,"If your in need of a job go for it but it would be a last resort for me."
bad,"Culture shifts have made for a very different company that no longer cares about employees."
bad,"supervisor refused employee medical attention and is rude to new employees. spoke in threatening tone while employee was injured/ ill. "
bad,Whirlpool could be a great company to work for after a culture change.
bad,"They have cheated me out out $120 and am currently fighting to get my $300 commission check from march. The job itself isn't terrible if you can handle being degraded by customers, but not being paid and getting ignored is ridiculous and unprofessional."
bad,"Whirlpool was a bad place to work. People always caused drama, people were hateful to everyone, a lot of back stabbing and total drama. The jobs on the line are not very difficult, but doing a job repeatedly gets boring fast. It was hard to work my way up, because like they say.. it's not who you know, it's who you blow. Management is a joke and HR didn't want to help with anything."
bad,"Honestly, I thought getting a job here would be great. I was wrong. It's a call center. I get it. But you'd think you would get paid more for what you go through. Getting calls that threaten your life and people cussing you out all day every day is not worth 10 bucks an hour. Yeah there's room for advancement but you have to be your manager's pet before they help you with advancement. Also, you can be amazing at your calls but if they hear one bad call you'll get a bad score on your score card which is what helps you move up in the company. The coworkers are great. But if you don't want your possessions stolen, don't bring them. I had something stolen from me and literally nothing was done about it. Overall it was not a good experience and I wouldn't recommend this job."
bad,The job is so fast paced that one could never keep up. In the summertime the temperature to reach upwards of 120 degrees. The brakes are only 9 minutes. The management is simply unreasonable and the union is very weak. I would not refer my worst enemy to work for this company. Human resources is very disrespectful and unsympathetic to the employees. You are liable to be fired if you are injured on the job. It is just a horrible horrible place to work for.
bad,"onde eu trabalhava era bom eu abastecia a maquina pra ir pra pintura era bom fiz bons amigos la dentro,a parte mais dificio era te que ergue os gabinete na monovia pra ir pra pintura era a parte mais pesada"
bad,i wouldn't tell the worst person in the world to work there.if you are good at multitasking you will be able to caught things very easy. disappointed with HR staff and their handling of many circumstances concerning employees and their families..
bad,"Taking phone calls from people who are angry about their machines being broken is by far the worst job I’ve ever had. People can and will talk to you however they want and 90% of the time they will be extremely rude to you. Management is mostly okay, a lot of good managers. There are some that just don’t seem to have what it takes to be a manager. I for one don’t have what it takes to be in that call center PERIOD"
bad,"busting your butt"
bad,Fast pace environment. They push you and breaks ar about 9 minutes. Break starts when you leave the line and starts back up right at 15 minutes. Lunch is the same way they treat you like a machine. I would never work for them again. I got hurt and did what they said and they didn't take care of me and fired me because I couldn't do the job. I hurt my back. The test showed a bulging disk and there doctor and nurse said I was fine.
bad,The work load was great and keeps an employee on their toes. The unfortunate part about working in this facility is that the management and teamwork is severely lacking and creates a hostile work environment for any assembly line worker or seasonal help.
bad,Whirlpool was a good place to work with much room for advancement. Good environment with great people. As for the company...they moved all production to Mexico;  nothing more to say
bad,Whirlpool makes sure you and all other employees know that they are disposable. They are into conformity not diversity. Work hard and stand on egg shells for eight hours.
bad,"In whirlpool, just like any job working with an assembly line, you're an expendable asset that can easily be replaced. If you get sick once, you're put on the spot! Only granted 5 personal days throughout the year!"
bad,No me contrataron por un pequeño problema en mi audicion que he tenido toda mi vida.
bad,Varje dag inte sen lik hände nya saker hela tiden nya bekymmer maskin 30 år gammal.Det jag har tagit med mej från whirlpool.Kunskap och alla dagar inte säg lik händer nya bekymmer hela tiden.På avd fanns det en tvätt med emalan som tvättmedel efter tvätten kom tork ugn sen pulver boxen eller emaljerings box efter det kom en härd ugn på 840 grader.Ibland kunde få översvämning i tvätten för mycket olja i baderna hamnar på givarna som känner av vatten nivorn.Eller så kunde en slang på pulver boxen gå sönder en massa små grejer per dag.en gång så  rasade hela härdugnen isolering låg överallt inne ugnen fick rensa bort allt börja o laga bygga upp nya plattor ny isolering limmet ska härda 24 timmar innan man fick starta ugnen vi jobbade 15 timmar per dygn fick laga olika steg innan man knde limma vidare på isoleringen.kunde komma igång på måndag rädda fabriken från produktions stopp.
bad,I would not work here unless i could not find any thing else. The co-wokers are good people. You are just a number and that is all. This company can replace you with temps.
bad,"Im glad my time at Whirlpool is OVER!!"
bad,"The people aren’t a good role model area, there’s a lot of people that made me not want to show up and acted like they were still in grade school. A very unprofessional work environment if you’re just trying to get in and out without an ordeal."
bad,"Not recomended very hot can get up to 105 degrees during summer months,bad training program,bad team leads with attitudes.its a very fast paced job alot of people coming and going!it may be a good place to work if they had some kind of air circulation in the plant."
bad,I hated this place I received no real training to be a material handler. They do provide a week worth a training if your going to be on the line but if your not on the line it’s sink or swim. I would be move from place to place everyday and the only training I received was a quick explanation from someone before they went to do their job
bad,Leading CPG Appliance company - great room for advancement.
bad,Excelente empresa un muy buen ambiente de trabajo crecimiento dentro de la empresa
bad,pull doors to the line then put out parts for that door . do this about 1500 doors a day waked a lot hard to stay caught up every fast paced moving around alot
bad,I would have to say its a OK job to work at I would work from 7-3:30 Monday Thur Friday I would stand at a line placing labels on doors and print labels when needed and also inspect doors when coming down line and also run plastic machine and stacking doors in slots
bad,"Was a good place to work until they shut the plant down. I did all jobs in my department every thing from assembly, stockperson, head operator, and running all the machines."
bad,"its a bunch of drama, with the older employees. And one untrue statement will cost you your job. Advise, just take the hostile work environment, if you want your job. Because if you go to your management, they will just fire you."
bad,Low Pay for work .
bad,Dia de trabalho normal tudo que faço aqui já tinha experiência de outras empresas não gosto da gerencia porque não ver o lado dos funcionarios colegas de trabalho são alguns ótimas pessoas outras normais a parte mais dificil do trabalho é falta de extrutura no setor de trabalho não tem parte agradavel no meu setor de trabalho faço o que mais gosto mais não tem condições de trabalho
bad,"Sopratutto se sei giovane, ti sfruttano come pochi, straordinari quasi obbligatori (dico quasi semplicemente perchè ai primi NO, non ti rinnovano il contratto) e contratti a tempo determinato infiniti"
bad,Very forward thinking company but not so friendly to the people who work for them. The company is clean and nice to look at just really needs better management and to treat its workers better.
bad,I worked in lucknow they dont gave me placement they gave training only 3 months then they told not to come because they don't gave permanent job they gave salary in part payment half on 15 half on 30 every month...it was such a bad experience i m now searching for a good and permanent job with fix salary
bad,I have worked at Whirlpool for almost 5 years and the culture there has steadily declined to the point that I need to find something else more in line with my values and experience. Whirlpool is only looking to create a image of engagement but does nothing to truly effect change. It has provided me however with good benefits and some much needed HR experience.
bad,"La mia esperienza in Whirlpool è stata diciamo altalenante, assunto per il turno notturno dove con tutto il gruppo di lavoro abbiamo avuto un ottimo risultato di efficenza e velocità in questo reparto che ora non c'è più mi sono trovato bene con tutti qui si lavorava in armonia."
bad,Es bueno el ambiente laboral pero falta mucho a esta empresa
bad,"Very little chance to advance, a true sweatshop."
bad,"I was considered a floater at whirlpool. i was thrown around to different lines, never really got trained right, and sometimes didn't have enough time to go through lunch line too eat."
bad,Recently we have been moved onto continental working pattern. Due to this it means I cannot see my son who I only see on weekends which is meaning I'm having to leave my job. I would only recommend this job to people without any commitments.
bad,"Used to be  a great company to work for. Reorganization was a step in wrong direction. Management has no clue what they are doing. Whirlpool has beliefs and values on paper, but when it comes to the bottom line the employees work/life balance is the first to go."
bad,Don't both busting your butt. Favoritism is so rampant there's really no need. Management is also incredible incompetent.
bad,"Nao dar valor nos otimos fucionario,nao avaleia um bom fucionario"
bad,A great job to have. The people who trained us was very knowledgeable and knew what they was talking about. In return help me to do my job. 
bad,"Expected to do more than what you are physically able to handle, never appreciated and taken for granted daily. Great for gaining some experience but wouldn't count on it being long term."
bad,Lavorare in Whirlpool non è gratificante e l'azienda non è gestita come dovrebbe
bad,"Günlük işlerin birçoğu Polonya dan takip ediliyor ama süreç çok kalitesiz. Firmalar sürekli ödeme sorar, çünkü faturlar geç işleme alınır. Herkes konuyu birbirine atar şirkette. İletişim çok kötü departmanlar arası. Yani körler sağırlar birbirini ağırlar. Özellikle fatura, mutabakat, demirbaş, arşiv konuları sıkıntılı. Ayrıca inceleme ve davası hiç eksik olmaz.."
bad,Very stressful environment to work. Managers normally know nothing about the area they manage but won't listen to the people on the floor. A lot of back stabbing for advancement. The only good thing is the compensation
bad,"when it was magic chef and then maytag, they cared about the employee. now that it is whirlpool, they don't care. whirlpool says its about safety, but its really about speed of production. and u can forget any kind of advancement when u don't have a college degree. and because of their overall attitude toward employees the company has a very low retention rate of new hires, usually 7 to 10 days."
bad,worked the line as a temp worker for almost 2 years had to fight to get in permantly inwhich you get benifits and are treated better but as soon as i enlisted into the United States Marine Corps i was fired and since i was a temp worker it isnt breaking any laws
bad,I honestly took the job to better my family. they don't care about health issues even when your 9 months pregnant. if you don't know a job and tell them that because you really don't know it they'll make you feel like its your fault when you wasn't trained and the supervisor will yell at you because of it
bad,"Racist comments was made while working, team work was good as long if you was the same race, no one would help you if you had gotten behind, it could be your very first time working in that line"
bad,"Don't expect to be happy here. They will work you like a dog, and are very inflexible. They pay well and their company benefits are decent, but those are the only good things about working here."
bad,"Empresa não oferece oportunidade de crescimento, promessas vagas."
bad,"I did not have a good job experience at Whirlpool whatsoever. Between the attitudes, the hours, and the work schedule it was enough for me to leave. They had people that didn't know how to work with people and they were in charge and managing. I think that the snarky attitudes and rude comments were enough to make me want to get out."
bad,"I did not work in the regular plant operations. So, I cannot give an accurate evaluation of the work environment. I only worked contingent in the health center."
bad,As a technician they will keep you on contract for a very long time even thought there is more than enough work to validate a hired in position. They use this strategy and as a financial tool with no regard to the employee's future.
bad,"staff nice,but work is like production type 8am till ur shift ends on phone.clock work type,breaks too short lunches 1/2hours. trainers have no time to really train you,but rush type tranning.if you can handle every min and seconds counted for than i guess this job is right for you. you should never be late even 1 min and really work like machine! all these people who are giving 3 and 4 stars are like machine type workers.what they pay is not worth the time and effort,and managers are pretty laid back! its who you know in this company and if you can become their favorite person than you will climb promotion ladder! very fast."
bad,Monday through Thursday shifts with weekends off are a plus. 10 hour days with breaks but pay tops out at less than 15 an hour. This job offers minimum benefits.
bad,"Procedura di acquisizione di Indesit SPA da parte di Whirlpool,"
bad,"The people aren't bad to work with. Unfortunately you are always hoping that there won't be a layoff. Pay is okay, benefits are about average. Their union is a joke...spineless."
bad,Turnover at this company was extremely high.  Constant training was in effect which could be very distracting.  Started at Maytag.  Maytag was purchased by Whirlpool.  It seemed that Whirlpool did not want the previous Maytag employees and made the job harder for those of us that were Maytag employees.
bad,"empresa com problemas gerenciais o que causa alto estresse para os subordinados."
bad,"Call Center Work"
bad,Was not a very busy job but was perfect for me because of my age at the time.  I gained a lot of experience from LECO.
bad,"good work place"
bad,Safety concious workplace with emphasis on Quality. I have worked at Whirlpool for 26 years and performing numerous jobs during this tenure. Have established many friends during this time.
bad,"No room for advancement.  Leaders don't hire people they see as threats to their own positions. Paycheck is good but your mental health will take a HUGE HIT! Day shift is never held responsible for leaving a mess behind for shifts after them. Quality is not important, they have removed almost all quality check positions. They force workers to learn multiple lines and don't follow through with standardized work formats.  They blame the lower level employees  for stopping the line and loss of line time but don't consider what cause the loss of time. It is almost always due to operators being over worked and constant chances to how a job is performed."
bad,"The management will smile in your face then stab you in the back, no one takes accountability for their actions, always pointing the finger at someone else,supervisors play favorites, if you bump heads with them or they don't like you, they will find a reason to get rid of you"
bad,"I was put in CNC at first making $12 an hour, and I applied for a position in the department multiple times I was qualified for, and employees from outside the department were given the job, but I wasn't even interviewed."
bad,"Whirlpool isn't a terrible place to work if you have no education and want a paycheck."
bad,Its a  numbers game every1 just passed the buck ..... people lie on you it's best to stick to yourself very very prejudiced place smile on face stab u in back ..... do not gn o here ever high school
bad,"Executive leaders have limited moral compasses when it comes to people changes. Most leaders think in the near-term about how to meet yearly goals vs. long-term strategic planning."
bad,"people were very mad at company for the to fast pace & the lack of quality. workers on the production line only had a few feet in between each other, so if someone was sick or did not shower, ouch  u got sick with them, & had to smell them all day"
bad,Poor management and direction given to employees.  Constant changing of priorities and direction.  This leads to great confusion and stress for its employees.
bad,"El trabajo es bueno, pero el trato es malo."
bad,"Very good experience to have had, and for being in the customer service field for many years, I have to admit that this particular job was very challenging. I loved the job itself, however a lot of the customers called in using profanity and we were instructed that we were not allowed to hang up or disconnect the call for any reason. I was ok with all of that, however, some days were uncalled for to be talked to and disrespected on high levels. The management teams and staff as a whole were very good, thorough and helpful most times. They always tried to make it fun when possible."
bad,They hire you in telling you the hours will be mon-fri 8-5. However they change that after training they hire and fire you for no reason. Better have a backup for this job.
bad,Hated working here. I was temp but not aware that I was only temp. They never let me know and didn't let me know there were accepting apps and holding interviews to replace me. Managers were horrible and rude.
bad,"The only really difficult part of the job is the speed at which one is required to work. The coworkers were, in general, nice people who're fun to be around. the downsides of this place, however, are numerous. You usually have maybe a days notice of overtime, which is mandatory. The management does little to fix problems and is content to blame and punish whoever is at hand. They make a big deal about all the benefits and significant pay raise you can get once you're hired in (it's a temp-to-hire workplace) but they'll find an excuse to fire you before they have to give you all these things in order to pad their bottom line."
bad,"A typical day in my role as a HR Business Partner includes supporting the IT leadership team in achieving their objectives from a people perspective. This entails delivering results in the following areas: talent management, performance management, team effectiveness, organizational effectiveness, talent assessment, talent development, change management, education and training, program management to the IT leadership development program geared toward early career talent, etc. What I have learned the most in this role is how important it is to align IT (a support function) to the business/value chain to drive greater results. The more aligned we are with the business in our operating model and org structure, the better we can provide value to the broader organization. I've also learned that having the right talent in the right role is vital to the health of the organization and us being able to accomplish our goals. This means, I have to make tough calls at times but it is for the right reasons."
bad,not good to work there. No cooperation with the other  teams. very clicky. Director stayed in his office or I could not find him. Did not answer my e-mails.
bad,"Ok place to work, as long as you get along with the A/C's. Too much micro management. The best part of the day was going home at the end of the shift."
bad,"a lot of the reviews I have read are from management , supervisors and people dating them and there family and buddy's as well so don't go based on it they also have company doctors that will side with whirlpool"
bad,"I experienced a company culture that displayed ethics and values contradictory to the stated company ethics and values mission with regards to safety, respect and non-discrimination."
bad,"I've worked at the Marion location for over a year. I was direct hired, temp to hire isn't worth the pay for the work. You most likely start out on 3rd shift as a float. You will be put in all the worst jobs possible, and be absolutely worn down until you end up leaving or finally getting off the line. Turnover is extreme. I've never worked somewhere where its literally common for people to walk out on a daily. It's a factory, we know it's going to be work and hot. However, being constantly short handed and ridiculous line speeds makes for impossible jobs. My line runs like 2340 dryers a shift. You have about 8-9 seconds to shoot 4 screws on many jobs, talk about carpal tunnel. Except when important people are there. Then they lower the speed to make our jobs look easier. Also, be ready to work Saturdays. Tip for new assemblers, they dont care about you. Dont tell your supervisor that an area is just not right for you. Maybe it's the people and you are clashing, maybe you struggle at shooting screws or plugging wires, maybe you're not fit enough for certain jobs. In training they tell you to say something if you're struggling and theres a job for everyone. That's a lie. If you say anything suggesting you're unhappy or having a hard time, you will forever be placed in that area. Only further training is given to those who absolutely fail at all jobs. Theres so much seniority that you cant get vacations scheduled, you cant get a decent job, and seniority is so tired of training and new people you're basically ignored and left to sink or swim. Also, the place is so hot. I'm not"
bad,Moja ocena tej firmy polega na tym iż pracowałem w niej. Brak praktycznie szans na awans. ( Mimo starań a awansowani są często ludzie z krótkim doświadczeniem) zarobki są małe. Nawet podwyżki nie są odczuwalne. Kultura pracy pozostawia dużo do życzenia kadra kierownicza popędza ludzi przy pracy co powoduje duże straty jakościowe. plusem jest jednak to że praca jest na 8 godzin dziennie a o nadgodziny są dla chętnych
bad,"Apesar de ter sido classificada como uma das 100 melhores para se trabalhar por vários anos, esta companhia não oferece benefícios de primeira linha."
bad,was a line assembler made drives for the bottom of the washer. management had very poor communication with there employees. would let anyone unless you were buddies with the boss  move up and advance yourself.
bad,As soon as the assembly line started you work at an extremely fast pace all day. I learned that places like that don't treat their employees with much or any respect. Management was always about quota and not about compassion.The hardest part about job was everything.
bad,"The work culture at Whirlpool has deteriorated post change in CEO since 2017.  The new culture is dominating, my way of highway type culture. Not the Innovative and people oriented company it used to be. Compromising a lot on its core vale of ""respect"".  Engineering groups plagued by politics promoting only the Brazilians. Lot of top talent scrambling to leave the company."
bad,"This is a job that you'd apply for just for the money. Management is not great, can be very stressful with very little help. Majority of the people i started with have left & my present co workers also are keeping their eyes out for other workplaces."
bad,Depending on department there can be absolutely no work life balance. Continued reorganization due to company being in bad shape. People are let go every 6 months and the people who are left behind are scared thinking when will it be there turn
bad,The workplace has kind personnel but the lead men and managers only worry about what their bosses think of them and will stab you in the back if it keeps them out of trouble. The managers refuse to listen to your opinion unless you are someone they favor. They also believe and think that everyone should be happy all of the time without allowing you to vent your frustrations if you are unhappy about something. They will say you have a poor attitude and write you up. Their discipline policy is a joke with too many loop-holes for them to slither through. They take advantage of the fact that 90% of their workforce are relocated foreigners who are too scared to voice any objections.
bad,Be careful what you say because people will take words and twist them to proposely set you up for failure. Management does not listen to its workers about problems in the work place.
bad,"Company culture is getting rather cut-throat.  Too many reductions in force over the past 7 years to recommend working there.  Things may get better if the business situation stabilizes.  If not, I would expect more of the same."
bad,Not a great place to work.  It was already a temporary position on the production line and it seemed that something would breakdown every night allowing to only work just a few hours.
bad,People Leadership at Whirlpool is poor/non-existent.  Management seems more concerned with their own career pathway than investing in the people they manage.
bad,"The pay is decent especially if you have a degree but otherwise the job is not great.  There is very little opportunity for advancement and you are answering calls all day long with limited break periods to get up and move/ use the bathroom.  If you are wanting to sit and do the same thing all day long this is the job for you, otherwise look elsewhere.  There is also a high turnover rate because people are always leaving for something better."
bad,overall pretty easy job management was always changing because people would never stay not to big of a deal working in fast food I wouldn't consider it a full time job for anyone though
bad,very chill environment just not a job to keep for long very easy going just too much going on at once and not a very comfortable place to work. try it out
bad,It's a relatively small organization to work for. The structure is flat so the good thing is you get a lot of exposure to different roles. There is no room for error which means there is no room to be creative. Good place to start your career learn and leave.
bad,there is a lot of young people that work there that are in school that only stay for the summer when you get young people toget there is drama. if you can get into a palce where there is not many young kids it could be a great place
bad,"This is not a career. This is a job. They violated their own policies. They say dont wear Tennis shoes, Sweat pants, leggings, piercing, ect. Everyone does. They say alot of good things in orientation, none of which are true. You can not bid pn other jobs until you have been there a year, unless it is a downgrade. Do not bid on Microwave line. You will be stuck there for a minimum of 12 months. No one wants that job and you cant leave till someone bids on your job."
bad,"daily assembly of mixers"
bad,"I was a production supervisor. Upper management has no respect for hourly employees. Everyone is expendable. Culture is terrible, people aren't treated well, mandatory overtime almost EVERY weekend. You get fired if you skip."

bad,"Orari su turni, corsi di formazione utili e interessanti,cattiva gestione dell'azienda, colleghi maschilisti, responsabilità mal retribuita. risolving problem."
bad,One of the worst positions I've held.  It was literally like goin back to high school and dealing with children. Everyday was another new drama.  Management on my shift was not organized and we often had issues with how to get things done right.  Even though we had standardized work instructions.
bad,"A lot of research in learning the various products on a day-to-day basis, inbound phone calls are very challenging daily, micro-management environment in customer service.  One of the hardest part of this position, when customers have questions, and the answers may be difficult or tedious, which can become time consuming and leave an empty feeling when the task with that call feels unaccomplished or unsuccessful."
bad,"Whirlpool is a decent workplace. Very productive daily, must be able to preform a multi-task activity often daily. Safety is Whirlpools top priority regarding to their employees from injuring themselves. Safety arm guards, gloves, steel-toe shoes and safety glasses are to be work at all times. Along with pants that cover a persons skin, also shirts with sleeves. Whirlpool also gives their employees 140 hours for a whole year along with 5 emergency days. Which those 5 emergency days are not superset from the 140 hours that they give you at the beginning of each year."
bad,Ambiente lavorativo buono... Io ho sempre lavorato in catena un po dura... Sopratutto con alcuni capi... Però alla fine è un bel lavoro.. Un azienda che ha dato speranza a molte persone... Dove sicuramente non sarò la migliore ma comunque mi impegno su tutto ciò che faccio.... E finché posso giocarmi l ultima carta lo farò voglio solo lavorare ora che sono molto serena e non ho nessuno più che mi rende nervosa... E poi alla fine come azienda mi è sempre piaciuta
bad,"Long hard hours for just a little pay for the task.  No uniforms, no chance to enjoy your breaks, Very dirty work.  Repetitive motion all day/night.   Bad for health"
bad,"You are a minion!"
bad,"One the line your going fast pace but you have to do 6 or 8 things all at once."
bad,"Hiring process botched by slow, out-to-lunch HR department. An internally-focused, generally closed perspective within company culture limits the number of talented people in the employee pool. Cultural tolerance for ethical gray areas is relatively high, unfortunately. Truthful communications from management a hit or miss proposition."
bad,extremely hot even in the winter and back breaking work 2 10 min breaks but bathrooms were so far away you could barely get back in time because the line starts back up exactly 10 min after it stops and you cant eat on the line but you don't have time on your break and yes you need to eat on break it is a 10 hr shift some of the jobs were incredibly hard but they always had people out timing areas to see how they could cram more on jobs to get rid of another body on the line. schedule was mon-thur 6 to 4:30 but they can tell you thur morning we have to work friday we were always having to cancel appointments working here your personal and home life is 2nd and work needs to be #1
bad,There's not enough training in a new area to allow someone to advance in this career and no one was really there for you to talk to. And always asking for helping and getting no where. Tried talking to Kelly Service Rep and they were hardly in the office.
bad,"3rd shift personnel manager fo the Whirlpool manufacturing plant that WAS in Oxford, MS. The company relocated to Mexico around 2006. Pay for the factory workers was $8-$9 hr. Turnover was high."
bad,Whirlpool is a okay place to work when you need funds to support your family. I worked there for 7 months and left because of management. I worked on the door line and felt like I was being harassed by the first shift supervisor everyday for the  type of clothing I had on and I worked second shifts only. There is no room for rising in the company when people are trying to cut your neck and make sure you don’t make it to the top . Also there is no air conditioning inside but big ceiling fans that do not help when it’s 100 degrees outside and feels as if it’s 120 inside. The management does not know how to talk to you and can make you feel very upset. I believe the wages should be higher than the pay thats being given today!
bad,"This place is great, if your young and fresh out of college. This company will not see job loyalty as a positive. Instead, they will fire people who have dedicated many years. Whirlpool sees age and time invested with the company as a undesirable culture."
bad,"This place is going threw many changes as it was bought by whirlpool. Use to be American dryer. Might change with time. Dark Facility, not very organized, dust everywhere, garbage/trash thrown everywhere."
bad,"Whirlpool can be a good place to work but don't get too comfortable. They tend to do a ""restructure"" and eliminate positions on a whim.  If they need to find money, they eliminate positions regardless of consequences.  They don't consider the position they are eliminating could be important or necessary. Only after letting someone go, do they realize that the person they let go was doing a critical job for the company and was the only person who knew how do to the job.  "
bad,"Management is horrible, and human resources is not there to help the employees. The culture changes daily. This is a company that struggles to find their identity. If you dont fit in, you will not last. They do not want open minded thinkers, just employees that say YES to everything."
bad,you work your butt off then they let you go just before your probation is up and walk you out the door like  a common criminal I feel they tend to play favorites and if you are not a favorite life is no fun here
bad,"Employees have more responsibility than is manageable."
bad,Everything is about what is best for the company. No one cares about the employees. They do pay a decent pay. And offer insurance no paid vacation to start. And they are on a point system. If you are there for a year and they offer you a permanent job and you get ill but you point out. well too bad you get fired. That is what happened to me. The training only gives you part of the picture then when you are allowed to work alone and you mess up the managers get mad at u.
bad,Whirlpool is a great place to work under better management. There is room for advancement but in order to really grow one would need a degree. That is what I am seeking now.
bad,"A strong culture of competition and results focus. The general environment is balanced with good  benefits and work life balance. However, the company has significant boom-bust cycles."
bad,Open options to alter jobs throughout the shift instaed of just one function.  Management is not always available when there is trouble on the line with bad units. They move down the line and time is limited to always flag bad units besides put in bins and do checks required for the unit functioning.
bad,"Esta minha avaliação, refere-se única e exclusivamente á  Whirlpool."
bad,"Horrible with helping temp to hires move to a different job that better suites them. They see it as, if you're a temp then you don't matter in their facility. I loved the pay, but had to leave due to wrist surgery from working there."
bad,"no communication from manager and no training was provided, manager treated me poorly and Director did nothing to reprimand manager for treatment or lack of training being provided for position"
bad,"This company does not support marketing efforts, nor do they hire talented leaders to drive the marketing organization. Benefits are great, as is vacation time. The offices are amazing, and the company is doing a great job of trying to engage its employees overall. Unfortunately so many people work 12 and 13 hour days, are under appreciated and taken advantage of. Not a happy place to work."
bad,"job requires no skills what so ever, training on site doesn't take long at all."
bad,it was very stressfull it always seem like some machine or production line was breaking down which resulted in leaving early
bad,Ambiente tranquilo e descontraído. Equipe e empresa muito preocupado com ambiente e segurança dos seus colaboradores
bad,Technology wise they are very less active. They follow brands rather than brands follow them.
bad,"Co workers were not friendly at all. Had a line leader that was hard to work for ,acted as if she didn`t like me from the get go."
bad,Dont tick off the wrong person or they will conspire to get rid of you.  Backstabbing environment with a double standard. Lazy whiny managers on days.  Policy changes with mood. Work at your own risk
bad,"Good pay, overtime available, decent benefits. Very monotonous. Even for skilled trades. Benefits decent. Very poor ""buddy system"" culture. If you are not tied with that culture, dont expect to go anywhere."
bad,"There are opportunities to advance, to a certain point. Beyond that, it becomes completely a political charade. Upper management does not support their supervisors in a way that leads to success. Discipline is not enforced fairly or with any consistency. Upper management plays favorites with their supervisors, then over encumbers the remaining supervisors with an abundance of tasks. The workplace culture is rampant with favoritism, and nothing is done from the top down to address this. However, management is quick to listen to and act upon unproven complaints made by hourly staff."
bad,Don’t expect much in the call center. The 4 week training prepares you little to none. Managment is aweful. Supervisor sends you one place and they send you back to supervisor when needing help.
bad,the job was not all that bad once you got used to it or the training you needed if they didn't move you but  management was a joke. they kept having down days and shutting down lines and shift. management can treat employees like they are nothing and your told you have to have proof to do anything but cant provide any because your not allowed cameras or anything on plant floor.
bad,"If your fresh out of high school and are looking for a career in fast, robotic, mindless assembly work..this is the job for you. It's unbearably hot in the summer and you have to cover your arms with sleeves and gloves which makes it even more unbearable. Your supposed to be trained on a job for 30 days but they expect you to keep up with people who have been there 2 or 3 years after only 6 days of training. You stand all day long unless you know your job well enough to sit once in a while. If you get bumped around on the dryer lines ( which you will )..you will loose your 15 minute break and your lunch! Believe me..you want your break and lunch! I hated every minute I was there and prayed to have enough nerves left at the end of my shift to make it home."
bad,"Muita falta de respeito nas áreas, pouca chance de crescimento e reconhecimento, descontrole sobre quantidade de funcionários, e despreocupação sobre a saúde dos funcionários."
bad,"Whirlpool very often and anywhere highlights Whirlpool values, but this is only b.s. What did the managers recently, it has no equivalent: respect - they cut the throat  of employee 15 years and more employed, who during those years brought to Whirlpool benefit in hundred thousand €, during this years they lost their health and now, under this conditions, should find new job, what it is in our country almost impossible."
bad,"This company will fire the top pay operators to bring in the Temps at a cheaper pay rate. A lot of ""children"" working there. I don't recommend Whirlpool as a place to stay anymore..Just go there for some quick money and get out!!"
bad,Worked there 15 years and watched many changes for the worst. Eliminate jobs and make it harder for others because they have to double up work....cant wipe your nose cause you have no time
bad,There was no leadership they needed to quit adding totems to the totem Pole and actually talk to their production in assembler workers but there were no quarterly meetings and you never knew what was going on in the company
bad,"I worked here for almost 2 years, i recently got terminated, due to 2 mins of down time, this could of been avoided had my superviser not stopped and talked to me, alot of people are related that works here, i was lucky to get a direct hire, to which seemed to put a target on my back,"
bad,"Is normally good for a year or two.  But the HR system of rating people from 1 to 4 with bell curve forces good people to get screwed each year.  Once they decide they label you low you have no way back.  This regardless of how good or dedicated to your job.  You can work 60 hours a week and complete all goals and tasks and get rated low.  Not rated low by your boss who knows how good you are.  But your boss is told to rate you low and to find items they can base it on."
bad,Il cambio di sede lavorativa oltre ad avere  effetti negativi sul personale ha portato intrinsecamente ad un grande inefficenza che però sembra nn eessere tenuta in debita considerazione
bad,"I worked in owasso for about 1.5 years so here we go. "
bad,"Nice job, if you  rub elbows with the right people. The hardest part was having to stand up all day. Met a few really nice people.  If you ever need to go on medical leave or have an injury, they will fight you tooth and nail not to pay your time off and will come up with a great excuse to fire you. Will not take the doctor's diagnosis' for the reason you can't work and will have an outside company decide if you should be off and will or will not be paid for your time off, even though you've paid into long term and short term disabilty."
bad,"The working shifts are a joke. never the same days off or start times are never the same. "
bad,"Average, it wasn't the best company to work for, wasn't the best team environment and the equipment was poor. Management didn't really care either, don't work there"
bad,"Taking phone calls on a daily basis booking engineers to go out to the customers, training was a bit of a shambles but managed to learn the system in the end, managers are there to help but not as efficient as they could be."
bad,"I loved doing my job, did not like the way they treated people. They were not good at giving people raises that they deserved. The company was very disorganized."
bad,Primary focus id cost reduction & quality improvement projects.
bad,"They care about the safety of all employees and visitors, you get 2 weeks off for the Holidays."
bad,Management constantly pushes you to do more and more. Completely understaffed it is like working in a zoo on the phones for them. Great compensation and pay if you can take the stress which is beyond ridiculous.
bad,"Dificil conciliar vida academica com a profissional quando se trabalha numa empresa que suga/explora tanto seus funcionarios. "
bad,you get to work and you clock in and go to you area and stand there and push a button. The work place is vary one sided and they don't really care for there workers or how they feel.
bad,I was screw the doors and I had fun with that job it’s helped me get my car and going to school every day but sometimes the supervisor wasn’t nice with some people and me that why I leave the company
bad,Interesting work for name brand product. Many decisions based upon consensus from many departments. Great production staff that were always willing to go the extra distance when needed.
bad,"A Whirlpool é uma boa empresa, emprega muitos Joinvillenses. O problema da empresa está mais relacionado com o fato de a fadiga gerada pelo trabalho na empresa tornar difícil de conciliar trabalho e estudo. A empresa também reluta em dar os devidos aumentos para seus funcionários. No restando é uma boa empresa."
bad,"employment is almost based on the housing market. In the summer when people are doing improvements and then there is a lot of overtime opportunities. In the winter, things do tend to slow down."
bad,"Lugar sem ventilação adequada, pessoas passando mal todos os dias, comida ruim, trabalho pesado e desumano muitas vezes."
bad,CareerBuilder doesn't make you do all this to post a job. It is already stressful as is having to complete this much information just to use the site. This is not good.
bad,muita cobrança e pouco incentivo para que seja atingida as metas.
bad,Some areas are good some are not so good. Not very professional regarding work ethics for lower-level supervisors. Shift changes are out of your control.
bad,"Whirlpool is experiencing heavy competition from Korean manufacturers for several years, and struggles to respond with new product innovations.   With too many brands in the portfolio Management is battling to figure things out, leaving little or no new product innovation and introductions.   There is much strife among product development functions cooperating together.   A recent global acquisition has lead to layoffs, indecision and stagnation resulting moral extremely low.   It is a big company so few get promoted.  Pay is equal to or above similar large companies"
bad,esta bien el trabajo en area de prensas solo que supervisores exigen mucho y te dan poco
bad,Lots of forced overtime and responsible for temporary labor. No health insurance. The business has been bought out. Not a bad place to work just lacking in some areas. This was a company which had a tremendous amount of growth in a short period of time. They had a lot of growing pains and did not adapt to new technologies well.
bad,"Esta é uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar, agradável, pois beneficia o funcionário com descontos no site, com uma determinada pontuação o Colaborador pode ate mesmo conseguir o produto sem pagar, somente indicando o Site. Esta empresa é Multinacional e tem uma certa admiração com o  Funcionário e o preserva. Porém  como sou funcionária Terceira não tenho os mesmos benefícios que os funcionários."
bad,"Es una empresa que tiene muchas áreas de oportunidad en el area de produccion,falta de trabajo en equipo por parte del área de ingeniería Industrial y procesos, para apoyar a implementar la mejora continua en la línea. Se tiene un  porcentaje alto en cuanto a la rotación del personal operario que se encuentra fuera de nuestro alcance."
bad,not a bad place to work if you keep to yourself. management sucks they never do as they promise and to much drama as well. never in a steady position and always moving around. co workers can be cool if you already know them.
bad,This is the place for you if your just looking for something temporarily. The place is extremely hot and they require you to wear PPE that doesn't help the conditions. The pay is good but they require you to perform task that even the managers have trouble completing.
bad,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, reconhecida na cidade e paga bem pelo custo de vida local."
bad,"Your colleagues are what makes this job bearable, badly ran management, power hungry managers, badly ran system. Was once told by a manager 'you are all replaceable' which didn't make me feel at all valued. Perk of the company is 2x bonus a year, staff discount and can't complain too much about the salary. I wouldn't personally recommend working for the company, but if you enjoy being screamed at by customers all day due to constant errors made by other employees/managers then go for it!"
bad,horrible work envirorment!!  No air conditioning and don't allow time for you to stop and take a drink even when needed.  I go so dehydrated that my I was almost put in the hospital and than got fired for not calling in everyday when they had a note from my Dr saying I couldn't work till futher notice.
bad,Typical 100+ year old company which has been stuck in the same patterns of doing things over long periods of time.  struggle to embrace any new thinking or approach to development or design.  long history of dominance is threatened by tech savvy competitors.  reminds me a lot of automotive about 20 years ago.
bad,I have been with whirlpool for several years and have learned a lot from my coworkers but I feel like there is no job security or company loyalty for its employees.
bad,Muito boa a dinâmica de trabalho. É uma empresa que é muito boa de se trabalhar e de adquirir conhecimentos.
bad,"If you can actually pass the test (which many perfectly competent people fail) you have to deal with Kelly services not actually tell you anything about any of your benefits or the differences between them and whirlpool it'self. I had to go in during my off hours just to get access to my paystub because there was no one in the office during the hours I worked. If you choose to work there and you're not on first shift expect to work overtime or be forced regardless of what they say. "
bad,the line leaders are lazy and get mad if you need a bathroom break. they have horrible benefits and people. the hr department doesn't ever want to do anything when its brought to there attention
bad,"I did enjoy working at Whirlpool too much the first time. When they wanted to hire me back, the second time was better than the first time. They were very inflexible where family was concerned."
bad,I did not like the atmosphere that the work place put out. Time management was ridiculous and the bosses were not caring and understanding about situations
bad,"Didn't enjoy working at a factory, it was a fast working environment that didn't bother me, but overall it was boring and I was doing the same thing over an dover again with the same products."
bad,Good when first starting out but unless you are in a social cliche or good friends with the management you won't get far. Seniority and experience means nothing as people who basically got hired in would get good positions and others wouldn't be considered
bad,Could be better. They could listen to there employees better. Also they could help out better with putting people where there good at the job instead they don't care.
bad,"My time working at Whirlpool Corporations as a Safety Lead Representative, I learned  a lot but there is limited room for advancement. Once you apply for a position and if you get that position you are basically struck in that position. My typical day at the office was speaking to customers regarding their safety concerns with their product/s. I would set up service if needed or just document the concerns of the customers that I speak with regarding their product. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help every customer that calls in about their safety concerns pertaining to their product. I enjoyed working with my safety team members."
bad,It was not a bad company to work for considering it was a decent pay.  The employee all and all made the job the time went by fast and it was a team work place
bad,Uma empresa de pequeno porte mas com forte interface com as empresas / marcas a qual representava. Forte integração com empresas estrangeiras.
bad,Does not care about their employees. Bad ergonomics. Bad line leads and Supervision. Everyone is replaceable.  Not fun. Would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Management doesn't care about their people and they've been purging people left and right due to unrealistic demands.  Also there's a lot of nepotism.
bad,Responsible for assembling products. Wasn't much room for growth or improvement. To long of a commute and costs of benefits were outrages for the wages I was making.
bad,"En cuanto al ambiente de trabajo es agradable, pero no hay mucha oportunidad de crecimiento ya que las categorias tienen un tope y si uno aspira a más tiene que esperar a que alguna persona decline a su puesto."
bad,You spend day working with great people but never knowing what is actually expected of you as policies change almost daily and no one can stay on the same page of on what is the current policy.  They will also tell you its customer service but the policies are slowly turning it into a commissioned sales position rather than customer service.
bad,I didn't really care for Whirlpool as a company. It is definitely not an employer that I would choose to go back to. There was a lot of unnecessary drama allowed.
bad,Management is horrible. They would not let me advance my career there. The supervisor told me I would never get to leave the line.
bad,I like working for whirl pool know everyone there on different line. Lwarn how washer and drying are being made. Its a great placeto work just take to lomg to hire in best thing about coming to work there you know most of the people there in the lines so you get a long with others great when you already know how they are.
bad,I am in charge of over seeing the door line.  I make sure we are working in a safe enviroment and keep an eye on the quality of the product.  I troubleshoot some of the problems we have with equipment and get ahold of maintnance if I can't figure it out in a timely mannor.  I order parts to the line if we are running low and make sure we are getting the correct parts.
bad,"To report customers complaint and suggestions on company Database. "
bad,"A WHIRLPOOOL: E uma execelente empresa,ganhei um grande apredizado de trabalhar com maquinas indústrial e com outros equipamento."
bad,I was not a fan at whirlpool. they are never happy with your performance.
bad,"empresa mundial, buen ambiente laboral, crecimiento laboral"
bad,Whirlpool is an climate job. So it is extremely hot and miserable in the summer. A lot of wear an tear on the body. Can be hard to keep up wit you have to be a very fast leaner.
bad,Your expected to keep up right away while working on the line. Was treated badly by the women out there. Was told they don't like newbies coming into their territory.  Was talked down to and literally pushed aside many times while trying to catch up on my own. Not worth the stress and wear on your body.
bad,The job can be very stressful for someone with anxiety. The people working there are great. HR doesn't work with you very well on hard situations until you have been there for a year. Everything goes by seniority so new hires have a really hard time. You get two 9 minute breaks in the morning a half hour lunch and a 10 minute break at the end of the day.
bad,It's was a high speed job. I put doors on stove and also put the bake tray in the stove. Working at whirlpool it's was alright The people that work beside me alway help when you need help.
bad,Working on assembly line was easy and hard at times. I enjoyed it... It was only hard when the parts was defected and it couldn't be fixed easy.. Have several different things that are repetitive.. Makes a fast day if the part runs done but if it runs poorly it could make slow day as well.
good,HATE HATE HATE it. You dont get paid enough for the rudeness you have to deal with. They dont work with you like if u have doctors appointments they won't let you bring a note and be excused. I was fired BC I was pregnant and missed too much work BC of doctors appointments BC i was high risk pregnanvy
good,Corporate Greed took over and the Fort Smith plant closed down and went to Mexico to save Money.
good,"Lack of advancement due to politics, not paid enough to deal with stressful environments. Leadership does not value you as a person. Nothing additional to say."
good,"If overtime is what you are looking for, you found it. Working for one of Whirlpool's 3PL Warehousing facilities, you will find, its common to work 60-72 hours a week. No opportunities for advancement. Many of the ""Bid Jobs"" are actually at a lower wage than the operators. No appreciation for Family life, or any life outside of the facility. The supervisors are non-linear when it comes to rules and disciplinary actions so some shifts get away with far more than other shifts. Every 3 years, the facility rebids and whirlpool has the opportunity to change 3pl. So don't grow roots unless you want to restart all the hard work you've done, with a new company"
good,"Negli ultimi mesi il clima e' peggiorato notevolmente."
good,"assembly line work making ovens."
good,"Scanned/ Audit inventory in stock. Counted and kept records of all products in warehouse."
good,Working here is like being in kindergarden older women telling on people. Was ok in the beginning now it just seems to be worse plus its along way to drive looking for something closer. I have learned that its everyone for themselves no team work im all for teamwork I am working cause tired of staying home but after working here wanting to stay home again.
good,"Sommati pro e contro mi sono trovato bene peccato che non tengono le persone,contratti al massimo di 9 mesi poi altra buttata di operai"
good,If you get hurt they don't want to pay for it and they want you to work overtime all the time because they can't get enough people to work there been there 21 years never seen anything like it
good,"Not a company to work as there is no Job Security in whirlpool Asia LLP as Whirlpool India and Asia are both different and separate companies "
good,Most of the people are on drugs and sell them at work. You put out more units daily than are required 90% of the time. You may have to be out a few days occasionally because you have made too many products and the warehouse is full.
good,"> Exposure to various work culture with in same company since Whirlpool operates in all across the Globe."

good,"Fast paced assembly jobs such as: using hand tools to place screws in proper placement holes, attach wiring harnesses correctly, assemble sides and backs of different size ranges,assemble and inspect glass to be placed in door frames, etc."
good,"Very fast pace , Line assembly. Very strinked on time off. Not a very friendly atmosphere to work for. They just throw you on a line and hope you pick up the jobs on your line fast."
good,"Your work day could go either way, it depends on your entire team working together. When I started Loved my job as well as the group of guys I supervised each day. However towards the end of my employment"
good,"It was Ok, but they hired the personnel threw a job agency and that meant that employees did not have any bennefits. Also contract were renewd monthly and that gave insecurity."
good,"The poor management sucked there and it seemed like if you wasnt family they didnt want you there and they took other people before all the new hires. I thought a company was supposed to help, teach and communicate with everyone there."
good,"Pay is good for the area. Advancement is possible as well. However, in order to advance it doesn’t seem to go on work ethic or ability it seems to go more based on if you are one of your supervisors favorites. As a result people who don’t seem to care about their workers end up in positions of authority and regularly abuse their position."
good,"Whirlpool Fall River plant has cultural issue.  Fortunately I was under a manger, who really stand beside us.  The plant whirlpool took over is in a such a area that has majority of one cast community.  If you do not belong to that community, you will have tough time making things happen."
good,It's a decent job you get to plan stuff with your family since you only work 4 days a week but they hire in their own temps and tell you 3 months but it takes over a year to become a full time employee
good,"It's a nice enough place to work. However the work is difficult. If you need a job, you should be able to get in through the temp service available to start with."
good,Job was not fun at all and did not really get along with anyone. You had to work there for almost 3 years or more to even get an opportunity to move up and raises were very scarce also.
good,"I worked at a call center and answered incoming calls from appliance dealers like: Lowes, Home Depot, and Best Buy. I would help with product information, like features, colors, and installation information. I was also backup to two other departments, to help with call volume, so I had to be able to switch train of thought quickly and adjust easily to which ever call was coming into my line."
good,"I enjoy my position. I need more hours per week. The interview went good. I enjoy troubleshooting. Making sure parts are one hundred percent, no defects."
good,"Whirlpool is divided into different groups that do not work well together.  Instead they like to point fingers at each other."
good,After 16 years there and got injured they had nothing but a hard time for me. I was put on jobs that I knew but was not allowed to rotate. I was made to feel like I got hurt on purpose.
good,A carga de trabalho e excessiva e a liderança esta sem direção neste momento.
good,"A typical day working there is challenging due to the fact that you never know from day to day what your work load will be. You have to make decisions on how to help the customer. You are responsible for solving issues constantly and produce a win - win resolution for both the customer and the company.  I have learned how to deal with customers and coworkers. How to solve issues and produce a win for all. How to understand issues and come up with a resolution. Management is always needed. Hardest part of the job is having to make decisions that is not always favorable for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with coworkers, building relationships and learning new things."
good,"The organisation is stuck in the midway trap. The business is not bringing money from sales of goods. This compels them to seek revenues from other options."
good,I work as a Lobby Receptionist and have temporarily assumed the role as the HR Lead Specialist through Kelly Services. There are a lot of opportunities to work as a temp employee.
good,"a typical day doing someone else is work"
good,"I loved seeing the same customers come in each morning for their coffee to get their day started. I enjoyed the conversations that we all had as co-workers. It was more like we were family. There was not any complaints about the management. The hardest part of my job is sometimes having to work double shift, back to back, when someone didn't show up to relieve me."
good,"Uma empresa amigável, mas sem muitas oportunidades, ela cobra muito dos funcionários as vezes, os colegas de trabalhos são pessoas boas."
good,management leaves a lot to be desired.  the hourly workforce is a lot of fun but seem to be handcuffed by management to reach their full potential.
good,no aprendi nada por que ya sabia el tipo de trabajo.                           los compañeros eran conocidos de anterior trabajo.                         lo mas dificil era que teniamos que estar todo el dia viajando.             y lo mejor era el horario de trabajo de 6 a 14 horas.
good,"Good job, great coworkers. Gained good experience. A lot of unnecessary hours delegated by day shift operators and their supervisor who had no idea his operators were building banks of parts during the week and coming in just for the OT hours. Maybe thats why company moved out."
good,Would not work for them again. Too political. Watch your back.
good,Pay is great but benefits are very expensive. Culture is really tense and often times miserable. Plenty of job opportunities but need senority for most. Good job if you have a family and need job security.
good,"Was fairly easy work, how fast it is depends on where you’re at. I started through the temp service which I found tedious. No guarantee of getting hired at all so you have no idea how long you’ll be without benefits or a raise."
good,Good place to work if you want to move up in the company quick. Management and communication skills lack throughout plant. Good pay if you stay for five years and reach top pay.
good,"The company is trying to reinvent itself, but the middle management is dominated by an old boys club that is too attached to power and won't let it go. The company has gone through many reorganizations in the last years, but, at the end of the day, the same people remain in charge and nothing changes."
good,You can't trust anybody and the leadership is sub-par. Great experience to begin a career. Low margins lead to an extremely cost driven company. The positive is there is a lot of room to move if you know the right people.
good,"In need of process improvement across all areas. They consistently have product availability problems."
good,"The company has its perks but the overtime is generally what drives people to leave. They schedule overtime with usually only 24 hours notice and for about 7 to 8 months out of the year it is none stop almost 7 days a week, this makes family life or even just having a life very difficult. If the plant leadership could figure out a way to run enough production through the week without as much overtime they could probably find loyal employees. I work in the maintenance department and a lot of the issues derive from things as simple as not stocking the correct parts to fix equipment, this mean parts must be ordered and 9 times out of 10 the wrong parts are ordered causing excessive downtime leading to more overtime. Also running equipment until it brakes is not ideal in a factory environment."
good,All housekeeping duties and procedures for all area's of Dunrovin Conference center for Whirlpool . 40+ hours a work week. Timely turn overs with great satisfaction.
good,"Acredito que a empresa em sí é o que é pelas marcas, o orgulho em trabalhar com marcas lideres, ajuda e motiva os funcionários, porém qualidade de vida, reconhecimento, promoção e gerente/ especialistas faltam."
good,More politics than professional management. HR not strong. Goals are not defined & measured. limited growth in career. perception based assessment. huge favoritism.

good,not competitive in salary. leadership at the Knoxville facility is terrible. Not loyal to loyal employees. Leadership should actually know something about the business to lead the business and the employees.
good,"Es tener un día muy movido parar lo menos posible de principio a  fin con condiciones en los tramos. la premura por recuperar las unidades. "

good,Ive  had to work there because in our part of state isnt much job opportunities. I really didn't enjoy my job but i needed money so i've had to work somewhere.
good,"Very boring nine and a half hr. days. learned how ,run ,clean and maintain foam systems ,dealing with pressure gages and valves,calabrations ,computers.Management wasn't that great,co- workers were great.The hardest thing about my job was to come in there and do a good job for a company that cared nothing abouts us at all.The best thing about my job was my co-workers. Our company gave us a pizza party for having the best guallity  of all the other Whirlpool factories then they shut our doors!"
good,"Hard work, alot of hours. Similar to working on a pirate ship."
good,It was a job that I did what every duties i needed to do.
good,"Actually as a company it's good to be a whirlpoolian since 18 year plus with the same organisation just on third party pay  roll in various department and have a good command over all activity and back end support with front end sales service commercial and logistic team since so long time onwards  rest all is okay and expertise in a communication and love to handle any type of escalation n executes and be a problem solver "
good,A typical day at Whirlpool is hoping i have equipment to work with. Once i have a piece of equipment i can begin my work day. Work place culture is pretty good considering the fact i have to find equioment!
good,"very repetitive, same job (activity) daily "
good,Whirlpool had ok benefits and pay. They don't hardly ever hire from within. They are constantly cutting back on the benefits as well. Most of the plant has no climate control of any kind so it's either extremely hot or very cold.
good,worked there for 2 years. i loved my job and my line supervisor the team that i worked with were all fun loving and knew how to make the shift fly by.  made loads of new friends and would recommend this place to anyone
good,"A typical work day would be cooking different things using different cook modes. Developing algorithms to control the oven functions."
good,"People are nice. The environment is fast paced but very little job responsibility. The pay is terrible, you cant survive off the pay so you will need another job"
good,"A typical day for an electrical engineer at Whirlpool Corporation begins with already feeling overwhelmed with the amount of responsibilities placed on you.  Due to recent layoffs and no reduction in workload, electrical engineers are supporting 2-3 jobs.  We are constantly being told to deliver on-time and be predictable, but this is a very unreasonable request with the amount of work responsibilities we have. The quality of the work the electrical engineers are delivering has been compromised by schedules forcing employees to skip key process steps or be punished."
good,"Whirlpool is great for those entering in the corporate world. Outside of it's salary, the culture, nor the management is anything outstanding. I learned a lot from my time at Whirlpool, and met some great coworkers, but I would only recommend it for those with a thick skin."
good,"You wake up, start your day off with stretches at 6:13. "
good,"A typical day at work includes assembling dishwashers. I learned how the functions of these units worked, as well as how to fix them when they do not. The management honestly depended on where you were located. Some lines have fantastic managers, however some lines have managers that are less than great. The location that I was placed was great for me, because I was able to make lifelong friends. That was easily the most enjoyable part of the job. Also, there are 30 minutes of break time. The hardest part of the job would be the long hours and lack of seriousness from bad employees."
good,"Promotion is based on who you know, not what you know. Promoting young people for less money, and they have no clue on how to manage their day, let alone how to manage people."
good,i make good money but the management in this place is unfair. ive worked here for 11 years i like working here but they are just so unfair and everyone has different rules they go by...
good,"Working day was fine. Management almost non-existent as I did not hear from them for the whole 9mths of employment. Not so much as a call a few weeks in to see how things wee going. Very poor. Tried to contact, left msgs but never called back. Technical back up was poor resulting in having to leave customers with a non working machine as could not contact anyone in tech dept."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar lá , tanto que fiquei por 12 anos...."
good,"Do trabalho em si, tudo muito tranquilo sempre trabalhando com segurança, e com toda a segurança que a empresa fornece, aprendi muitas coisas no período em que estive lá, tudo relacionado a refrigeradores e produtos de linha branca mas focado em conserto e qualidade de máquinas de lavar."
good,Place shut down and was different to work for when they knew they where gong to Mexico. Left for better job and was hailed about it by management and others
good,"This is a job, not a career. advancement is slow, and the fear from supervisors to train or share any information that could lead to their removal is constant. if you need an in between job or prefer a career in a repetitive factory environment this is for you. If not and you are like myself you will find something quickly."
good,Excellent co-workers.  Diverse workplace.  Continually changing management.  Achieving goals would benefit from greater stability within corporate initiatives.
good,"Very poor management"
good,Good job bad people. Lots of up sides but some down sides. Training is not the best. They have new people tranning newer people. Higher ups don't really know what's going on. It is safe though.
good,"Baixa meritocracia, falta definir a cultura organizacional e também as técnicas para controles de processos, muita técnica e pouca prática."
good,"A typical day consists of hours of answering call after call as they poor in the cue. Customers don't normally call to share their joy with products. My job consist of deescalating and assisting. Worst part about the job was trying to comfort and console an irritated consumer and then being scrutinized by quality control over not selling an extended warranty on a product a consumer is calling in irate about. Ummm no, I just finished deescalating this ordeal, I didn't feel like starting from the top. There is a time an a place, and I was not hired for sales. Secondly it really is terrible to have to bid for shifts every 3 months. Having to change your family's routine consistently is upsetting. The best part about this job was the gifts, vacation time, and professionalism among employees. If it hadn't have been for the shift bids every 3 months, I would still be an employee."
good,"Good Pay / Benefits, Poor interaction with Management on multiple levels. they portray a caring work environment, but Production is first in most all aspects."
good,I liked working with all the chefs in the kitchen and learning so much. Its a face paced environment. Not suitable if you have a family as you have to give up a lot of your time for your career.
good,"Se hicieron 5 equipos de trabajo para unir mas al área y tener una mejor comunicación efectiva, cada equipo cuenta con un líder y un sub líder, los cuales ya debieron haber asistido al curso de AZAMAR donde se forman lideres de trabajo."
good,"A typical day I would arrive for work 20 minutes before the last shift has completed so I was fully prepared to take over on the assembly line. I learned how to work in a very fast paced manner, to help keep the team on track. I do not recall ever meeting my manager, and my co-workers were constantly different due to working for a temp. agency. The hardest part of the job was being expected to be up to speed from the moment you started working there, there was no learning time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay, it made up for the very hard work."
good,"its ok lot of walking ,lifting, hot work, and painting i worked there for   two years and have to say it was ok for most part the staff sucked but most was ok"
good,"visite de 4 clients par jour : différentes typologie de clients allant de clients centralisés, en passant par des grossistes, jusqu'aux clients indépendants"
good,"A typical day at work consists of business development, profit management, sales, inventory analysis, research, customer service and business growing."
good,"Work environment was geared for excellence, for learning, for a lean environment, and a strong focus on the customer. "
good,"A typical day consisted of extracting a random sample of the products that were produced during the shift in which I was working."
good,Once you clock in you head to your dept.  Everything is set up as an assembly line. I learned how to operate certain robotic welders and inspect parts for defects. The management in my department was swell.My co-workers sucked other than My set up guy Rick and Team Leader Chris. The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain co-workers. The best part of the job was having weekends off and my paycheck.
good,"Works in Whirlpool CRM. The Management is very good, The salary Structure is good. Working with some fun very good place for work"
good,they dont care about the workers they care on how many dryers get made and get shipped
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was running the sealer, a machine used to put Freon into the freezer and refrigerators."
good,"Friendly people to work with."
good,todos os dia é estressante na area de manutenção corretiva.
good,this company did not have their priorities in line. they were firing employees for going outside to smoke.
good,"World's Largest Brand Marketplace. Choose Your Favorite Product and Order Now! Quality Assured. Trade Assurance. 100% Refund. Most Popular. Types: Machinery, Home & Kitchen, Consumer Electronics, Packaging & Printing."
good,"Work 6 days a well lots of problems on the line.  Lots of safety issues,  supervisors knew took a long time to ignolage them or to even fix one they knew they were problems."
good,"One of the best paying jobs in the city for someone with a high school level of education. Nothing glamorous but also nothing too hard, cant complain it pays the bills."
good,"You work very little overtime unless you want to. The pay starts out way too low. The assembly department is a very hard place to work, and thats's where most people are placed. The only two good things are the eventual (years) good pay, and the fact that they almost never force you to work overtime."
good,Dinamiche un pò troppo lente per i mercati interessati.
good,"Depending on where you work and who you work for, Whirlpool is either an amazing experience, or absolutely horrific experience."
good,I am a unique thinker.  I simply do things different and have a different way of thinking.  At whirlpool they force you to think a their way and when you do not comply with the norm you are singled out and 8-balled despite your excellent work history.  Plus the managers do not appreciate how difficult the work is/was and have no patience if issues arise in the work.
good,Han sido dos años de montar un  nuevo Departamento que ha dado buenos resultados a pesar de los problemas logicos de la integracion de las dos compañia ( Whirlpool compro Indesit)
good,"Its a nice place to work, its mostly the people that make it stressful and make you not wanna work there.  If you're fast paced and you want to work somewhere that you do the same-thing everyday then this is the place for you."
good,Its not a bad job its just something that isnt for me. It is a job for someone who doesnt have a child or alot of emergencies. Its is a job for someone right out of high school.
good,It used to be a great place to work but with the new management that is no longer the case. The current management is more concerned with quantity over quality.
good,I have work this company 2010 to till date but this company not increment to time to time this company increment per year 800 to 1000 RS . So I m not happy.
good,It's an average factory job. It's a very diverse culture and management needs to conform to the needs of this environment. I liked working there and will go back one day.
good,Losing market share year over year.  A more agile competitor.  Confusion on how to operate and deliver results as a global company. Multiple layoffs in two years.
good,I do not regret my time there but I do regret not being able to transfer into whirlpool from the temp agency. You have a lot of options to grow but have to be in whirlpool
good,"Started off great and after a lot of upper management changes has slowly went downhill since you get no training on how to do jobs that yoy bid on, its a sink or swin mentallity currently."
good,they have very little room to work with people and thier home situations. anyone with kids trying to start over it is very unlikely you will be able to work thier for a long period of time.
good,"A empresa em si é muito boa, com ótimas oportunidades."
good,"I worked on the assembly line assembling refrigerators. The works extremely fast paced and can become very stressful, but they do pay decent wages and supply health care"
good,"Working at whirlpool is a good experience and I have learned a lot of new skills, a typical work day starts with booking out new orders that have been placed on the system so we provide the best service that our customers expect"
good,They use an outside company to take care of their employees medical leaves and they do not do a good job of making sure people are covered for their time off. A lot of people get fired because of it.
good,People were great but their management needed some help cuz they didn't seem like that was very together. Meaning that coordinators sometime didn't know where to put people at times or not sure who knew how to do what. Things could of been better if the upper management was actually paying attention to what their job was and toke it alittle more seriously.
good,I was on contract there and will be let go at the end of next month.  I was the first one in daily and left at the normal time.  There was not much reward for doing a good day's work as it was Corporate America.
good,Es valorable en la empresa las actividades que llevan a cabo para mejorar el clima laboral.
good,Whirl pool had a very cluttered workspace and too many lay offs. They are very fast paced and alot of the time leave flaws in the product from what I saw.
good,The company is no longer located in fort smith. No reason to even do a review but they are making me to continue with the rest of my resume. Do not waste your time.
good,"Work life balance poor if you want to get ahead"
good,"Being a salesman for this company was a good experience."
good,"lavoro monotono in catena di montaggio"
good,Mucha inestabilidad en el trabajo. Exceso de presión por objetivos poco alcanzables dada a las herramientas que tiene la organización en el Peru.
good,"A typical day at work involves handling inbound calls from external customers, and assisting them through the process of booking a delivery, or arranging a collection that could involve a varied range of household appliances. Outbound calls are also made that cover the same objective described above for inbound calls. Every contact with a customer is an opportunity to sell a service plan, which provides commission for every successful sale."
good,"This company used to be the best company to work for, now its just another job.The Yearly review is just poor,set up to give you a low rating no matter how much you work.Too much work for one person layed on you always,very stressfull.Health insurance is worst ever.Benefits are not what it use to be.Seems like they let go people just to have fun,no matter how talented they are  unfortunately this company is going down hill due to poor decision making and sale strategies,too bad,it used to be an awesome company."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em  equipe "
good,"Arrive at work, log into the system, via phone code.  Boot up computer and begin releasing orders and planning out the day."
good,"O tempo do meu trabalho sempre foi arquivar documentos, quando terminava essa parte ia fazer planilhas ou organizar documentos, pastas, etc."
good,They aren't too concerned about their employee's and will replace you quick.
good,There are ways to advance but management can be tough to deal with.  My coworkers are friendly.  My job is a bit tedious and can be boring
good,Company were not focusing on retail sales or counter sale only focusing on distribution sales......
good,"When i initially joined the company the culture and dynamics within the workplace were phenomenal, and i thought it's a place i could grow old. However as the years went by, the company's luster kept dropping and dropping."
good,"Fun job, never travel always off by 2. I was laid off in 2008 followed by Whirlpool moving production to Mexico"
good,"Abrimos la tienda a las 10 am,,procuro llegar entre 30 y 25 minutos antes,,casi siempre tenemos clientes todo el dia, hay que atenderlos y sacar dudas a cada uno de nuestros clientes primeramente preguntando cuales son sus opciones o que esta buscando el cliente, hago tambien labores administrativos cuando no tenemos clientes, verificando que todo este en orden,,tanto la exhibivion como los preciso mostrados."
good,"Por se tratar de uma multinacional com mais de 6000 funcionários permite vivencia em sociedade, aprendendo valores e buscando melhorias. Peca no reconhecimento dos proficionais."
good,"Arrive, pretrip, truck inspection, 3-15 stops where a helper(s) and I would show up and deliver/install appliances, get back to warehouse, throw away day's trash and clean up, post trip, then go home."
good,Pretty good job. Very hard to advance in and secure your position.
good,"The place is a Manufacturing Company; they make Whirlpool Washers & Dryers."
good,"La direccion de planta un poco bipolar, no sabes como estara como un dia puede estar bien otros dias te puede poner en evidencia frente a todo el equipo"
good,"Whirlpool is a MNC, but i didnt found any MNC culture there."
good,Workplace culture somewhat inflexible in regard to employee work / life balance.  Requires improvement.  Senior leadership has opportunity for improvement in regard to subordinate life balance challenges.
good,"No Work Time Limit. No Holiday. No leave. This Is a Hard working Sector."
good,"It is stressful but there is lots of room for growth and potential there. Pay is not as competitive as expected, I would recommend for people who are willing to prove themselves and gain experience. Lots of ongoing projects and improvements, so there is lots of skills that can be developed."
good,I worked at whirpool for a year. In that year i got carpal tunnel im only 22. I moved area because of that reason to heavy lifting and my body gave out
good,Good company for young engineer to learn and interact with some experts. The system resists to change and does not take the innovation as a drive and essential to invest on
good,time goes by fast at whirlpool cause you are working fast. i learned alot about different cultures. the management at whirlpool changed alot but for the best. whirlpool has a diverse work culture. working with such a diverse culture is difficult at times because there arent many interpetors.
good,Whirpool is a good and great work environment... But i had felt that the supervisor and training was not so good and great. And kind of towards the unfair side.
good,"Boa empresa para se ganhar experiência, com diversas áreas de interface e pessoas com diferentes backgrounds."
good,"ok place to work not good on advancing with in company , good discounts on merchandise , family days with discount to zoo  not fair on solving issues with employees"
good,"I came in expecting to be able to move up with my experience in the material handling field. but they operate more like a union shop, so my experience has zero benefit here. "
good,"Overall I enjoyed working with my coworkers at Whirlpool. "
good,"Good vacation day benefits and located in a good place to raise your kids."
good,"A empresa oferece grandes desafios, desenvolvimento profissional, execução de projetos e possibilidade de ascensão de carreira. Salários e benefícios são altos dependendo do cargo e a estabilidade depende dos seus resultados entregues no trabalho."
good,muito pouca estabilidade na empresa mais tirando isso ótimo lugar de trabalho
good,Whirlpool is making drastic changes and not for the better.  Top management heavy with little recognition for the workers remaining after drastic cuts.
good,"N/A I don't really have anything to say except the supers and the management sucks."
good,"Good working hours "
good,"Moved to Marion, whirlpool was my first factory job. It was difficult to pick up on the smallest requests. After a couple of weeks I realized I really enjoyed the work I was doing along with the people helping along the way ......."
good,Good pay. Good benefits. Overall a good place to work. Had too many clicks in the Organization. They had a buddy system. Promoted on who they know rather than skills.
good,"É bem cansativo exige muito do físico, demora pra dar aumento a comida do restaurante é ruim tem muitos descontos às vezes vem algo que não era usado descontado, quando se tem um bom supervisor ou facilitador que escute e ajude o funcionário quando preciso o trabalho fica bom forma se uma equipe com os colegas todos se ajudar para não ficar pesado para ninguém mais muitos facilitadores somem nao ajudado aí que fica ruim, mas depende muito de linha de gestão trabalhei em 3 linhas diferentes duas foram boas é uma ruim."
good,Physical job hard on the body and there is mandatory overtime on Saturdays quite often which is hard. Pay could be better and the time off isn't given until being there for a year.
good,most people that work there especially on 3rd shift are very young and they like to start drama do not get yourself caught up in it because it is not worth losing your job over.
good,Good productivities and good teem management is my tl and my location is gonda distic beast product customer service is good and customer product is good
good,"The division I work in is a fast paced, high energy environment.  Most of my peers are talented and hard working.  Very little dead wood at the division."
good,"It is a production job so they are not flexible with you if you have small children or need to take time off. If you are not there then you do not have a job and they have no problem replacing you."
good,"Buena sin se extraordinaria, recomendable hasta cierto punto."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho corrido, porém com grande aprendizado, gerencia de pouco acesso,os colegas nada a reclamar, a parte mais difícil e quando você faz e não e reconhecido e aparte agradável e quando você conquista seu espaço."
good,Whirlpool claims that advancement opportunities exist but the reality it that advancement is biased. Leadership often times does not know what is really going on in the plant
good,Whirlpool is a fast paced production assembly job. Different opportunities available. Job bids posted every week to find the right job or to change to a higher paying job.
good,"In Whirlpool you have good exposure and end to end knowledge of your work."
good,"The role involved customer contact across all communication mediums, over the phone, face-to-face and online. Key functions are data entry, providing quotes, organising deliveries and collections and coordinating with relevant departments to deliver services in accordance with customers' expectations."
good,The company in whole is great. However the split shifts are a problem. These are not a major problem. However this can drain you when you go home for 3 and half hours.
good,"Answered 4 line switchboard.  Creating and updating property flyers, creating pictures and editing pictures of properties.  Sorted mail and ordered office supplies.  Greeting customers. Assist Tenant Rep in locating possible locations for clients in different states using graphs and charts as well as traffic counts."
good,"Empresa com pouca chance de evoluir e salário baixo, porém tem uma bom ambiente de se trabalhar"
good,"Enjoyed coworkers who genuinely sought to do a good job, but were hampered by management structure and development.  Goal of developing a single platform that can be used across the world is ambitious, time will tell if approach is successful."
good,Algumas áreas possuem um serviço muito cansativo e repetitivo.
good,"A typical day at Whirlpool "
good,"Company offers a decent compensation/benefits package, but limited in job growth.  "
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho entrega de resultados"
good,"L'esperienza in Whirlpool è stata molto positiva soprattutto per l'ambiente internazionale che si trova quasi in tutti gli uffici. L'inglese veniva utilizzato su base quotidiana."
good,The people are working to improve everyday.  We working together through this improvement process.  Each learning step we take is done as a group process.  We learn together within our improvement steps.  Working towards a final phase.
good,"Buena empresa para laborar."
good,"I worked on the assembly of stoves. This included the inside and doors. Also, I handled porcelain parts for the handles. I learned how to make a stove."
good,"I like the people I work with. I think the job is very hard on my body. Repeating the same thing over and over, pulling, tugging, reaching, and lifting. Even though we do rotate every hour. I feel that it is to rough on the body."
good,"Empresa de trabajo en cambios rapidos . enfocado a  la produccion "
good,"Over the years Whirlpool has slowly changed the focus of the customer comes first to the numbers of the employee does a day.  I am still in the mindset that the customer comes first.  We are judged by how many emails we do day and not how the customer is taken care of.  Management has lot site of the customers expectation of having excellent customer service and getting the issues taken care of the first time, no matter how long it takes.  We are judged by how long it takes for us to do an email and phone call."
good,"Aprendi trabalhar em grupo as pessoas se ajudava,a parte ruim era o tempo que tinha para fazer as refeiçoes enfrentar uma fila que  jáconsumia a metade do tempo."
good,"It is generally a great company to work for, the Job is not difficult by any means but is tedious as for most departments you do that same task for your entire day. They provide great benefits and do thing for their employees that a lot of companies can not or do not."
good,"I enjoy my job and the position i am in, everyday may bring new challenges to keep me alert and learn more things about the machinery, products and company"
good,"Whirlpool Corporation is a great place to work.  I have thoroughly enjoyed working at the small appliance manufacturing facility in Greenville, Ohio."
good,"average 'large manufacting' company"
good,"Empresa Inovadora,com bom gerenciamento,com ótima equipe promocional."
good,"Coworkers were the best kind, we were a whirlpool family. You always knew what to expect when getting to work and who you were working with. Hardest part of the job was learning new procedures for upgrade jobs. For example, brazing copper tubing to steel tubing."
good,I love Whirlpool and the corporation has become close to my heart. It is very stressfull and my favorite thing there is some of the employees I work with. They are like family and will stick by you through the tough times. I feel though there isn't alot of equal opportunity within the corporation though. I was always told I needed a degree to move up and others moved around with out those. Its no hard feelings I know its all about who you know I guess.
good,Good wage and benefits but no sense of community with upper management.
good,"Ok company to work at if you are looking to move on after a few years. Audit Sr. Management is weak and clueless and the local town where Whirlpool is located is completely horrible and boring."
good,For the 24 years I worked for Whirlpool I enjoyed working with people of all walks of life along with the different cultures. For the most it was a good place to work.
good,el problema es la falta de promoción ya que no dan pie al desarrollo profesional
good,"A typical day at Whirlpool was just simply answering phones and assisting customers with their appliances. I would answer questions about the appliance, help the customer with any basic troubleshooting or schedule service for a malfunctioned unit. I learned a great deal about the product and how to use a computer more efficiently and quickly to assist the customer the best way possible. This part of the job was the most enjoyable. I liked the fast pace and talking to different kinds of people from across the U.S. The hardest part however was assisting the angry or upset customers that would yell or curse at me. However, despite the arduousness of handing an upset customer, I was still able to provide excellent customer service to them and meet their needs along with generating revenue for the company. I did all of this and maintained a quality score of an overall 98% when the company requirement was a 96%. My co-works were very pleasant and I enjoyed the close atmosphere that was created with them. Everyone is always willing to help you with any questions. The only downfall to the job was there was not enough understanding to certain life circumstances such as an illness in my case."
good,"Every day was different, worked on and repaired machines, in order of priority to keep assembly lines and production scheduals up and running. would pm machines at scheduled times to minimize down time, and maximize quality and productivity. Always something to do, never a boaring moment, learned to make intelligent decisions in order to make operator's jobs easier and productive. Listening to experienced operators is very important to repairing and having machines up and running quality product is essential. Did not see much of management if you were doing job correctly. Enjoyed my coworkers, they were allways willing to give a helping hand when needed lots of teemwork. The hardest part of job was, trying to take an unintrupted lunch, being that it was a paid lunch and different lines would take lunch at different times, I usualy stayed in department durring lunch i n case of a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that every day was different."
good,I woould say it is a challenging experience. It has its ups and downs but still can make a good living here
good,"Ambiente bom pra se trabalhar,todos são comprometidos ,carga horária adequada,beneficios desejados"
good,"I worked for Whirlpool ever since the initial issue with the tumble dryers. However within in the past year a large number of terrible decisions have been made which has caused things to become a real pain to deal with. One was the option to no longer include manuals with our appliances meaning there is a daily flood of consumers asking questions unnecessarily increasing workload on call agents, second was turning the one department designed to help customers into a sales team which has strongly affected morale as well as caused a big rift in the team. Repeated concerns have been left ignored by upper management because 'the decision has already been made'. This has put massive pressure on a number of agents as well as the poor supervisor that must force this change on agents who are in incredible disagreement in this change."
good,I enjoyed bosses but no real flow to job. Required to be consistent in speed but add other positions without notice and expect same result of trainees. Line leads lack patience and coordination. Needs improvement in lower management and did not compensate me as promised upon hire. But overall can be improved upon
good,"Kellys services now does the hiring, they hire everybody, alot of lazy people were hired by them. they hire alot of people who have no business in a factory setting."
good,"It is a typical corporate company. Some of the roles are good for work-life balance,  Electronics and Procurement are busy functions. Product development is a good function to work for."
good,"la nuova location di Pero rappresenta esattamente l'immagine di una azienda moderna, dinamica, volta al raggiungimento degli obiettivi con una grossa attenzione all'elemento umano"
good,I worked for WP for three years.  It was fun to begin with.  But recently they have begun to institute new rules and putting a lot of pressure on the CSRs.
good,"The job is great and your team is awesome but the management and supervisors are just okay. Not very much help from other team leads nor management. But overall, I love my group and training them to their best ability and mines."
good,Great company. Given the chance I would come back. I worked in a fun department.  Whirlpool treated me well for over 29 years. Felt like I was forced into early retirement. Wish I wasn't.
good,Whirlpool can be extremely cut throat and political. There are some individuals who won't think twice about cutting down others and taking credit for their work. The company can be very political in which advancement takes place only because of the amount of people that a person has talked to or their ability to network. This is a common mindset in the corporate world but it speaks volumes when external individuals know how Whirlpool can sometimes treat loyal employees. Talented individuals too frequently are let go or go unappreciated and unmotivated.
good,"The Whirlpool plant in Evansville, IN closed its doors.  The company was good to work for.  The main issue, with the plant, was that it was unionized.  The union could not see that it had to work the company to stay competitive.  The poor relationship was the main reason the company shuttered the business to relocate."
good,"L'entreprise offre de nombreuses possibilités de gestion de projets, elle est très novatrice dans le domaine des Ressources Humaines."
good,The work isn't particularly difficult but management of all levels will not help you when you need it. They will try to pawn you off on all of the other area coordinators and supervisors until you finally just give up on getting any help at all.
good,"If you hire into Whirlpool out of college and get into their mentoring program and follow all their management program rules you will do great.  I hired in from another company with lots of experience and found a severe lack of job description, leadership, and support.  Whirlpool rewards change for the sake of change regardless if it makes sense to change.  People change job roles every 2 years which is meant to keep things ""fresh"""
good,Good Employees.  Could use a better system to evaluate employees.  And some departments do not have good work life balance.  Whirlpool provides you with the appropriate resources to do your job.
good,"A large fast pace company that is very goal oriented.   Teamwork is valued and used every day to meet production goals, drive quality improvements  and improve safety."
good,"E stata un esperienza piacevole, "
good,Empresa boa pra se trabalhar só precisa melhor mais alguns postos de trabalho
good,Whirlpool is a pretty decent organization to work for. The management seems to be in tune with the current trends and there is a strong focus on continuous improvement. The company is trying hard to stay competitive and is innovating itself so this is a good time to work for them.
good,"Whirlpool was an okay place to work until they used their ""lean-tech"" to make every job on the line super hard to do. Once they did that, every job was stressful and difficult and took a bit of time to master. Once your done working, your so tired you don't want to do anything else."
good,"Good place to work, but job stability was questionable weeks after I started. Good helpful Management and Staff with good facilities and benefits. Long Hours at month end with resulted in a high percentage of staff turnover."
good,"A typical day in plastics at whirlpool Amana is getting covered in toxic chemicals, operating machines that are literally falling apart. No real advancement available."
good,"Not sure if all the facilities are like the one I was at, but despite being brand new, the place still needed a very large amount of optimization. The engineering employees were VERY old in comparison to myself at the time (20 year age difference easily). Management was constantly in meetings and was constantly handling issues on the floor that could have easily been handed to someone else. Pay was very good."
good,My time at Whirlpool has been a very rewarding and challenging at the same time. I have worked with extraordinary professionals each day and working with the best keeps my sharp.

good,"A lot of job openings at the corporate office in Benton Harbor, MI. Not a lot of options outside of that town. I've seen a lot of changes within my function over the last couple years."

good,"Whirlpool is a great company in a small town. There are plenty of jobs to be done and one can easily move horizontally in the organization."
good,"I constantly felt judged for everything done, so I was worried to even do what I was allowed to do. The customers were also highly stressful when they called. They seemed to gain this sense of confidence over the phone and can be extraordinarily rude. Workers are told that if they have a bad call that they can take a minute to regather themselves if it's necessary, but they get on you for taking ""too long"" even when it's only been a couple of minutes. Being someone with mental health, sometimes it takes a little longer to recoup. My advisor knew this and still made me feel bad about taking a minute to regather. I LOVE my coworkers, however, and a lot of the advisors are wonderful, but I have just had an overall unpleasant experience."
good,"never worked in a factory but this one was a good one for me.  learned how to run presses, work on production lines and how to clean.  never seen any of the management, other than my immediate lead person.  the most enjoyable part of this job was going home to take a shower."
good,"your days can be busy and extented at times depending on workload.  "
good,"The benefits and the pay is ok, if you don't consider how much revenue the overall company earns compared to their employee pay rates. I was let go after taking a sick day when I wasn't informed or warned that my disability was not approved. I was never wrote up or informed by management or my first line supervisor. I was never late never wrote up for insubordination or had any unexcused absences. I only ever missed work due to person injury incurred on the job and or being physically ill."
good,"Es una empresa que esta bien estructurada,tiene sistemas de trabajo bien establecidos, y un acercamiento con la gente.Si bien,el tema de incrementos salariales a medios mandos, en cuestión de operativos, hay mucha posibilidad de desarrollo."
good,"This company started out being a fantastic place to work, but has begun to decline."

Management was just wonderful. my co workers are outgoing out spoken and full of energy a lot of diversity. Hardest part of my job is my time through my shift went vey slow and had to much time to think. The most enjoyable was at the end of the shift knowing I produces all those dishwashers and made money for my employer and me.

good,"El salario no es muy competitivo, no tienen buenas prestaciones"
good,"As pessoas em geral são agradáveis de conviver fora da empresa, mas quando se trata do ambiente corporativo, o clima de concorrência e competitividade toma conta. Difícil ter união entre o time e trabalho em equipe. Aprendi muito por ser uma grande empresa, porém em vários pontos tive muita dificuldade de conviver."
good,Empresa ótima para iniciar a carreira mas extremamente ruim para seguir um plano de carreira vide que o método de avaliação nem sempre é clarificado pelos superiores e realizando inconsistências
good,Not my cup of tea but ok health benefits and decent pay. Really hot in the summer some spots have ac some don’t... a lot of there ways of operation is way out dated
good,"It is the good company . I get a chance to work ther. There is safety first... we have to wear safety glasses , ear plugs, and gloves.   Teamleaders and supervisor are good."
good,"The company offers great benefits, a nice 401k match, paid time off, and very competitive wages, but currently not as much promotion from within as in recent years."
good,"Muita indicação e os indicados ficam olhando enquanto os não indicados trabalham, e os chefes que tem mais do que subordinados, não falam nada."
good,el sueldo era muy bajo a la prestaciones que nos ofrecian
good,It wasnt a bad place to work but some of the new managment made the work more difficult then need be but most of the coworkers were great to wok with .
good,"Interessante esperienza, adesso l'azienda sta vivendo un momento particolare"
good,"Fast paced easy job , very respectful and friendly environment. trainers are great people who help every step of the way always make sure your ok throughout the day."
good,Working here just helps pay the bills . it is an ok job. There are many things which I hope were different about working here but management does not care
good,"My position was contract, no point in me commenting here. that's all I have to say. this is stupid that I have to spend this much time entering a no comment"
good,Good Place to work could offer lower deductibles on Health Care ! HR is poorly run by random people and not very resourceful ! absent management firm is not good due to access.
good,"I mainly did recycling there ,which included putting cardboard on a conveyor belt. this job wasn't really that hard it was a really laid back job, slow paced"
good,Its a relaxed job where you can go over previous days returns and put back for re-delivery and re-stock. Place following days order in front of gates for out going shipment.
good,"you are given a set amount of time to perform a task at a station"
good,Enjoyed my time there. Good starting out potion for those wanting to learn. Left for a better opportunity to advance my career. You can make some good friends there. Allows you to talk while working and that helps take the monotony out of your day.
good,En general una buena empresa donde te dejan desarrollar tu potencial
good,There is a lot of room to advance your career and even the ability to move around different departments to find the right fit. Overtime available year round. Decent benefits and pay. Adequate training provided on the job.

good,"i liked what i did as a material handler ."
good,"The pay and benefits were really good but the culture of the factory is not a very good one. Nothing but drama, it is just like high school for adults. Management doesn't care about the workers"
good,"Aprendi muito, fiz muitas amizades é ótimo para trabalhar em equipe."
good,"There are multiple jobs in the factory. It is hard to specify all the details of all the jobs at Whirlpool. In my experience from the jobs that I have done, some jobs are harder than others. It is a very fast paced environment. There are opportunities for advancements with Whirlpool with a little luck and hard work. The environment can be very stressful and very hot in the summer months. One of the harder parts of the job is that Whirlpool is not very family oriented. Meaning that they work a lot of overtime and do not excuse any absences for family reasons. Also the health benefits are not all that good. There are not many company activities for being a larger corporation. In my time there we went through several people in management positions. I did walk away from the job with a lot of new skills learned."
good,Whirlpool was a decent company to work for before they made the move to leave the U.S. and do most of their production in Mexica.  They shut down most of the U.S. factories including the one I worked at in Fort Smith.
good,The place was well organized and it felt like a good safe environment. They never had enough equipment so it wouldn't feel right trying to race to the equipment .
good,install the parts on the refrigerator. they give a 3 days class to all that are hired to the plant. a diverse place to work. they help you when you need it on the lines.
good,"Implementing sales & business strategies for accomplishment of targets."
good,"Pay was decent, management don't help much unless you shut the line down from struggling then they rush over and yell at you. Shoot screws your hands get sore and pretty much get carpel tunnel and suffer but it pays well and hours are decent"
good,Decent place to work only complaint is no room for growth in what I want to progress. The company does what it can to provide for employees they just have not so friendly of a management. Pay I say is average just wish it was a little tad bit more of a progression. Dirty work atmosphere (although it is a factory it's to be somewhat expected). Overall a solid place to work if your wanting to settle for average that is.
good,my trainer got me behind on teaching me the basic skills and there was a time limit. in which you had to meet... NOT ENOUGH TIME...TRAINER was either asleep or on his phone..
good,"If you're looking for a job with good pay, this is the one for you. Though, the main drawback is the management working there; they don't care about their subordinates unless you're a brown-noser."
good,"Pocos descansos"
good,I loved my job there cuz I learned and did many jobs over the years I was there! They went through alot of changes while I was there with new lines being put in . The I only reason I left cuz I got legionare amoia answer was in a coma for a week and off work for couple months once I got clear to come back I was getting treated  unfair I had flma!
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar si la persona desea quedarse mucho tiempo en un mismo puesto. Las prestaciones y salario son buenas, los valores no siempre e cumplen y desafortunadamente es la dirección quien decide el futuro de cada empleado y sin tomar en cuenta las referencias del jefe directo."
good,azienda con una forte cultura dell'ìnclusione e della responsabilità. i collaboratori vengono motivati  sempre a dare il massimo

good,"As a planner- typical  day involves ensuring the  skilled engineers are available in the right territories at the right time thus maintaining a good speed of service and customers are notified in time and appointments rearranged at an greed date in case of engineer absences, i have great managers who have been so helpful in career development- Very supportive and fun team to work with."

good,"Whirlpool a mio avviso ha subito un declino negli ultimi anni sicuramente dovuto anche alle dificoltà del mercato."
good,"if you need a job then its there, but it is one of the most dramatic places i have ever worked, long story short it breaks up marriages and relationships, false promises for advancement, wont cover accidental injuries. its just a place to get a pay check and thats about it."
good,I've learned to work well with others even side by side with team leads and enjoying the most when we are together joking and exchanging gifts like families
good,"Over the 11 months that I worked for Whirlpool, I was given many a large amount of lee way to choose and carryout which projects I worked on. Unfortunately, the workplace culture left for quite a bit of room for improvement."
good,"not a bad place to work "
good,I had a good experience working in groups. The shifts are 1-3 through the week and weekends off. The workplace is the average factory environment. I liked getting to meet people from other places and their experiences. It is repetitive work.

good,Pues el sueldo este muy mal y no toman en cuenta el rendimiento de la gente
good,Place is brutal to work at. Very very hot. Stuck in one 3 ft spot all day long. Will be told to go faster no matter how much faster you wuld go over production
good,"A decent place to work, the people are nice, great work environment,  sending on the line it was pretty easy! Overtime was optional, many chances for advancement"
good,"Aprendi muito na empresa, e consegui emprego aós a saída da empresa, graças ao que aprendi lá."
good,"I like my job I hate 2nd shift, I would be a better asset on days with more input and helping them save time and money, alot of items are thrown away instead of being rebuilt, this is a big waste to me"
good,"The pay is decent. The physical demand on your body is rough. But once you get the hang of it, its a good place to make a living. Decent benefits. Would recommend."
good,Great place to develop and learn. Continuous improvement with excellent benefits and paid time off to spend with family. Discounts and incentives offered for Whirlpool products.
good,"On A Typical day I experienced average factory temperatures, a friendly atmosphere, and good solid work, However the management had not yet found a balance in full utilization of its experienced employees. I had fun doing my job, never wanted to leave, it was through poor judgement on upper managements part that resulted in my leave of the company."
good,I enjoyed working there but was sad when they laid us off. great people to work with. I enjoyed talking to customers and helping them with any issues they were having at the time. They had good hours and benefits to.
good,"I worked on a line with about 3-4 other people and we inspected parts for conformance, state and local regulations. They was very unorganized about people being late and tardy so if they were not on the line when it started we had to pull their work."
good,Falta mas sensibilidad en cuestión de los turnos ya que trabajas tarde y noche pegados una o 2 veces al mes
good,"Great Employer Thanks,Politics Played A Huge Hand In deciding who stays and goes,Long term practices and measures of standards are always different,Overall great ppl to work with"
good,"I'm sure some folks would love the job, but it wasnt for me. windowless dark work environment. constant repetition. It's a factory job so that can all be expected. I just didn't like it"
good,Era tutto perfetto finchè l'azienda non ha deciso di chiudere
good,"Empresa de ramo de refrigeradores trabalhei desde a montagem ate a embalagem e ainda na solda dos freezers horrizontal com um pessoal auto astral tive alguns contratempos no inicio para aprender tudo novidade,mas aprendi"
good,"Whirlpool lets individual managers have a lot of control on performance and policy. This means your experience as an employee is strongly tied to your manager and can change very quickly if your manager changes. Most people I work with have vague performance objectives that make it difficult to excel; for example when I agreed to take on a project as a ""stretch objective"" my boss turned it into an ""as assigned"" regular objective.  My experience with on-boarding and HR has been fairly poor. I relocated from a different state and it was 3 years before I could figure out how to get all the different tax buckets corrected, despite having done my work study in HR and numerous phone calls to Whirlpool HR."
good,Just like any major corporation you're just a number.  Great benefits and decent pay.  Dealing with general public is difficult and nepatism is rampant.
good,Fast pace with multiple assembly positions. Personal positive gear provided. 2 short breaks and 30 minute lunch with a cafeteria onsite. Ability to move to different lines and departments
good,"My job consisted of making stoves,microwave and convient oven on a moving assembly line. We worked on quotas. I aslo was a material handler. We tested every machine."
good,"It was ok but it was just temporary. It was ok, but they never moved me around to learn other stations like everyone else. So it was alright. I enjoyed it."
good,Good company to work for with good people Only issue is culture is very reactive to every little market change. Makes it difficult to plan and execute projects. Company has hard time attracting talent to area so large number of new people (1-5yrs) and large number of people that have been there for 25+ years but very few in the middle which causes some difficulty when it comes to continuity.
good,"Older culture, relaxed environment, flexible hours. Many opportunities for process improvement. The hardest part of the job is changing processes that people have been doing for +15 years. Although there are a lot of opportunities for improvement, change management is the hardest piece to deal with.It is also a slower paced environment. This can hold certain projects back due to management holding it back. The most enjoyable part of working with Whirlpool is the relaxed culture and friendly environment."
good,"Empresa oferece uma boa estrutura para se trabalhar, bons beneficios, oferece varios treinamentos para aperfeisoamentos de ferramentas"

good,It is a pretty decent place to work. They do certain things when it comes to family events they try to help everyone as much as they can to their ability
good,"Fast paced environment, there is chance for advancement over time.  If you can handle repetition and same task day in day out several hours a day then it's okay."
good,It was my first job and it was easy but too fast for me. Its also very dangerous and very loud. I really can't say much else because I wasn't there that long. Nobody seems to like working there
good,"Upper level management does not always see the big picture."
good,"My task was to provide production on few machines without delays. Everyday was a challenge, calibrating machines, making little repairs ,and preventing any possible issues. I thought me predicting and preventing problems, also having eyes around head."
good,"I loved the ideas that Whirlpool tried to provide their employees, they do a lot for their people. Yet again some of the management has let the power get to their heads. Other than that it was an ok job. Not fast paced enough for me."

good,I Come to work with my team an we stay focus an do what wer need top do we clean an keep the customers happy . the customers always first in my eyes.

good,Whirlpool was a good place to work but I really needed more hours to cover my bills. Since I was traveling about 38 minute or more to get thee the cons somewhat outweighed the pros.
good,"Myself:"
good,"A typical day at work included: opening post, sorting out invoices, batching, scanning, checking, filing, archiving. Printing invoices from 2 database systems."

good,Under mina 15 år på fabriken hade jag chans att jobba på många olika avdelningar och lära mig olika moment i produktionen. Där lärde jag mig ganska fort att hantera stress vara noggrann och jobba i hög takt. Jag hade många arbetskollegor och vi hade ganska  roligt tillsammans. Den bästa delen av jobbet var under min tid som resursperson till teamledaren där jag hjälpte till att planera och genomföra tillverkning. Samtidigt var det också svåraste delen  eftersom detta innebar i vissa fall tuffa samtal med personalen och nya rutiner vilket inte alltid välkomnades.

good,"A typical day at work involved inspecting parts at the machine while in production, and tagging/quarantining non-conforming parts before they leave the plant. I learned to interact positively with many different personality types in both good and bad situations. My co-workers had very diverse personalities and interests. When you work with more than 150 individuals on a regular basis you learn each persons likes and dislikes and ways if engaging each person. The hardest part of the job was staying positive while our jobs were sent out of the country. I enjoyed the challenges and critical thinking involved in the execution of this job."
good,"o funcionário so consegue mudar de cargo se tiver padrinho dentro da empresa ou se ele tem uma grande amizade com os supervisores, senão o funcionário entra como operador de produção e sai com este cargo."
good,Enjoyed the employees I worked with but was disappointed with HR staff and their handling of many circumstances concerning employees and their families..pay was sufficient for work done
good,"A empresa dispõe de treinamentos para capacitação e qualificação profissional."
good,"Had spend good time on this role, since role was new,peoples were new. Enjoyed my time here"
good,"Very busy, co-workers very helpful. Drove forklift, reloaded on trailer from warehouse to keep line moving."
good,"buona esperienza per quanto riguarda il lavoro di gruppo"
good,"I would have to load at least 8 loads per shift, but most time I would load more than that. After I was promoted to outside spotter, I would get moves on my computer screen. I would have to do at least 60 moves each shift. The pay was good and the company insurance was also good. It was such a loss to my family and the city of Fort Smith when the plant was shut down."
good,"As I mentioned I was working with whirlpool without any specific reason,, only reason is to earn money... afterwards I realised that no one is looking & appreciated to my efforts.. no increments ... no revisions of salary & post... after 10 years dedicating my work & efficiency with it...Therefore I left job.."
good,Senior Engineer at Global Technology and Engineering Center of Whirlpool.
good,A working day in whirlpool starts with R&D with our own ideas for development of various parts in washers. i learnt a lot of basics reagrding working of wahsers which helped lot in my R&D process. management is very transparent and gives good opportunity to exlopre our ideas.
good,Fast paced work environment that keeps you on the go but is simple and straight forward when you learn your role.
good,"I dont have to much to say, in one year working at whirpool I did'd have problems, coworkers help each other's, and they let me practice my ideas that i had from other companies, "
good,"a typical day at work would be easy an not to demanding where team work is the key to a smooth an very productive day."
good,"Evaluación de necesidades de capacitación con Jefe para determinar proceso de capacitación."
good,I am grateful to have had some truly wonderful experiences/ opportunities and to have developed many rewarding professional relationships.
good,"inspected Finished Products,this was also a second job after I would get off from vandy I would go to work at whirlpool"
good,Administracion
good,"mala organizacion estrcutural, no habia un jefe establecido, aparte de que las ordenes las daban desde mexico y a veces no contestaban y no enviaban las nomina de trabajo, horario de 12 horas de lunes a domingo sin descanso por falta de personal, lo unico bueno heran los bonos de productividad y las horas extras."
good,"Health insurance through this employer is a joke. You're better off not having insurance. We used to have family day at Cedar Point, be able to wear shorts, and some other things that set them apart as an employer. It's a job, pays well, but co-workers will be in your business."
good,"The pay was not bad, but the supervisors had no idea what was going on fron day to day...my dept was unorganized."
good,"not to much to say about this company, I didn't think they treated their employee very well that's about as much as i'm going to say"
good,Spent 10 years learning variety of tools as an employee in different departments.
good,Spent 10 years learning many things from different departments.
good,Realizazar preventivos a diferentes equipos a detectar diferentes fallas a los equipos lo que aprendi fue que la seguridad es primero trabaja con seguridad por parte de la direccion nos relizaban eventos diferentes como el dia de la familia sobre mis colega eran participativos en el trabajo en equipo la parte mas dificil del trabajo es el tiempo de respuesta para detectar la falla tienes que ser habilidoso y detectarla en el menor tiempo posible lo que mas me gusto es el ambiente de trabajo agradable
good,"Management was terrible, gossip was allowed and encouraged in most situations.Schedules easy to work with."
good,"perform routine repair,maintenance and assembly line work"
good,As I look back on the whole whirlpool experience it was a good place to work. Guess that is why they employee so many folks.
good,My job was to secure new business in the home builder business. It required a lot of patience and long hours. My work life balence suffered during the beginning phase.
good,"Its a customer service job, assisting customers with their appliances. You do troubleshooting, use and care inquiries, installation inquiries, and schedule service if necessary schedule a service technician for a repair, if the problem can not be resolved. Over all it is a good job, but can be tedious at times. Over all I would give it a fair rating, staff turn over is high."
good,It was a nice place to work with good benefits. It is a huge factory with multiple locations and thousands of employees.
good,A company that was always willing to change to stay in the business.
good,Whirlpool Corporation has been a proven industry leader in lean manufacturing and new product introduction. Their marketing leaves something to be desired. Small budgets and mediocre marketing talent leads to lack luster in market support of impressive product. The company is still heavily manufacturing focused but continues to put more and more emphasis on their marketing. There are definite signs of improvement as well as new pilfered talent from strong CPG corporations in leadership roles. They will continue to get better and more focused on their marketing strategy.
good,"Atuo como jovem aprendiz, a empresa é boa. Porém, não ligam muito para os aprendizes."
good,Was expected to work on coffee makers and every item sold by whirlpool without proper training such as down draft range hoods.  Expected to sell sell sell and over charge customer.  Commission rate not too good most money went to whirlpool
good,Upper management is horrible. Probably one of the worst places I have ever worked at. Benefits are not that great. Work balance to life balance is really good. Always overtime available.
good,factory work.  standard  factory lifestyle. overtime as needed.   various personal protective equipment.  many departments and jobs.  lots of employees
good,"As Long As You Can Keep Up With The Fast Paced Line Movement, Random Job Relocation, & Follow Standerdised Work Instructions, You Shouldnt Have A Problem With The Workplace Overall"
good,"Whirlpool Tulsa is a large facility with an equally large staff. Besides the extremely competitive and old fashioned floor culture, nothing Whirlpool does is particularly bad if you're a full employee. Pay is decent, lunch room and cafeteria included, basic benefits provided with a decent amount of time off. They give fair notice for overtime, and their 4 day shifts are universally loved by pretty much the entire work force"
good,"Atuar em áreas diversas na empresa, visando ao aprendizado de competências próprias da atividade profissional e à contextualização curricular, objetivando o desenvolvimento profissional."
good,Work load is very high and lack of salary issues. No personal growth for employees. Culture of work is not much good. Physical work is more in this company.
good,É muito bom trabalhar na Whirlpool.  Politica de promoções e estabilidade é boa. E o equilibrio com a vida pessoal é muito bom.
good,"* in general up to me what I appreciate"
good,"the job itself is very simple but repetitive, it is a workplace that is very fast paced but a great work environment. saftey is their number one. which is great."
good,It’s a Fast paced job. You will be on your feet most of the time. Do have weekends off but we have requirements overtime on every other Fridays. 30 mins lunch
good,"good paying job, but management was terrible and never felt like they cared.. We all were just employees, no comfortable manager-employee relationship."
good,"you never know what to expect entering whirlpool doors. Some days you worked, some days you get sent home for lack of work, some days its a slow pace day other days its really fast."
good,"Empresa com bons benefícios ao empregador, pouca chance de crescimento e baixa estabilidade. Contato com supervisão fica a desejar no caso do cargo de promotor. Ainda sim uma boa empresa pra se trabalhar."
good,Whirlpool is a great place to work to gain exciting opportunities and experiences.  Global experience opportunities are available and very valuable in terms of leadership development.
good,"They hire through Randstad so starting out you don't actually work for Whirlpool. Because of this your starting pay is minimal and you gain no real benefits. You do get 80 hours of vacation but it's unpaid. There's also no guarantee you'll ever move up from the ""temp"" position. You're not at risk of losing the job, it's just getting converted to an actual Whirlpool employee seems to be a rare occurrence. "
good,"On phones all day , booking deliveries , answering product calls and questions. Assigned email boxes to respond. Processing refunds on alternate weeks."
good,"Poderia melhorar na administração, melhor o a estrutura e a segurança"
good,"upper management is always looking to nail someone for anything to make themselves look valuable. good team atmosphere, good supervisors, always an audience when there is a breakdown"
good,"Whirlpool Co. was a great place to work until they laid off and closed down the warehouse leaving over 4,000 employees unemployed.  I have nothing else to say about Whirlpool."
good,"Apesar de oferecer ótimos benefícios aos seus funcionários, a empresa peca em relação as chances de efetivação."
good,"Whirlpool is a good place to work with good benefits and good pay. "
good,"No hay una cultura nutritiva que fomente el accountability, la toma de riesgos y la autonomía para la toma de decisiones."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement if you are hard working, and dedicated.  Would like to see more workplace engagement involving leadership and individual contributors."
good,"did not mind the constant calls on the phone but when there was a problem with a customer it was difficult to get the job done such as manager call backs, some managers would say they would call the customer back within 24 hours and actually they mean they will put it to the side and forget about it, this didn't happen all the time it was probably one of the main problems i had working there. overall if i had the chance to work there again i would probably not take it due to the fact i didn't really enjoy the environment"
good,"Working there was okay. Some pros and some cons. The people there do care about the employees, but the corporation itself is only concerned with maximizing value for the shareholders.  This can at times lead to a disconnect."
good,"Um bom ambiente de trabalho, mas infelizmente minhas atividades não foram condizentes com a proposta da vaga."
good,"Super easy, slow paced work place. Very flexible with hours, easy to accommodate having multiple jobs. Not many benefits from working here, no discounts,  no 401k or any paid off time."
good,"Rasoalvel para crescimento,porem acredita no potencial do colaborador."
good,I started working for Whirlpool in the month of January threw pinpoint personnel this job was a temp to hire position.I was a forklift driver when I first started just taking parts to different areas throughout the warehouse and was moved to a tugger drive stocking different parts of metal to keep the production line moving for assemblers this was a hard job for me.
good,"typical day at work was easy going, people were friendly for the most part, days were broken down into half hour segments in which you do one job for a half hour then move onto your next job."
good,"This is a good company to learn and grow in.  You can have multiple experiences."
good,"Good first time job, good job for college students, 40 hours a week guaranteed, great discounts, management is a little unfair can show  favoritism, some team leaders and employees and be disrespectful"
good,"Nice place to work as lots many opportunities are there to learn new things in the accounts and finance domain. "
good,"Good company but it could be a great company with changes. Whirlpool has a relationship based culture which can slow decisions and execution. There's been a lot of change over the past few years in response to increased competition. However, the company needs to change faster particularly the North America region. The innovation process still takes too long and is not customer centric. "
good,"A parceria entre os tecnicos era muito boa, o trabalho em equipe, por mais que o serviço fosse pesado e sujo, era satisfatorio estar la"
good,"The department i was working was fun , energetic , and extremely busy , sometimes very challenging . lots to learn including processes , computer systems and a vast amount of parts and possible appliance faults"
good,"It was my first time working in a factory. I work 3rd shift, 36 hours a week and plenty of overtime if you wanted it. "
good,This warehouse had alot of incentive programs to offer and much overtime was necessary as a matter if fact there was actually too much. I waa pushing almost 80 hrs a week on a non peak season era. Only bad thing was that my uncle worked there for 8yrs and they only have him 2$ more than what he started in at
good,"Good company with employee benefits, Great co-workers, Fun place to work, great place to learn different process, Diversity with Inclusion"
good,Only worried about the almighty dollar. Company will sell out a plant and its workers if they can make a penny more profit in Mexico
good,la giornata si svolge nella sistemazione dei dati e nella correta funzionalita' della presa del materiale
good,"there were good points and bad points to work for this company, lack of leadership, no one could pass on information, each shift conducted work differently etc....."
good,"trabajo bajo precion de ensamble de acuerdo a la produccion diaria ,aprendiendo a ser hagil en el ensamble y el mantener limpio las areas laborales, inconsientes de acuerdo a las necesidades de vida social en referente a cambio repentinos de hora de salida ,respetuosos y trabajajadores en equipo en momento estresados por la precion de la produccion ,el batallar en relevo de empleados al faltar un empleado a la jornada laboral,que al final solucionamos en equipo con mis colegas y terminamos el turno sacando la produccion lo mejor que se puede"
good,enjoyed my time there but management could have been better going through the temp service has it pros and cons but the unexpected change in policies makes it hard to grow in the company
good,"Liderança em projetos de desenvolvimento/homologação de componentes elétricos e placa eletrônica"
good,Amazing talent with room to propel your career forward if your willing to travel. Whirlpool is striving to obtain a culture that is focused on life/work balance. Very knowledgeable leadership.
good,"Analisis de requerimientos, y cotizaciones de los nuevos proyectos, me quedo con los procesos de contratacion y negociacion con proveedores y el diseno en funcion del cubicaje para rutas logisticas el equipo era excelente pero las discrepancias en el sistema no te permiten planear con efectividad, lo que mas me gusto fue la libertad de tomar desicicones"
good,"Nobody is strict, no bindings, Work atmosphere is awesome."
good,oferece grande oportunidade do primeiro emprego para muitos jovens além de ser uma conceituada multinacional
good,I help assemble ranges for whirlpool. I got to do the wiring for the thermostats. I also got to place the rods into the bottom of the cook tops to help open and close the top of the cook tops. I had to check for defects and make sure we were sending out perfect ranges.
good,"ótima estrutura,qualidade de produtos e mão de obra,refeição de péssima qualidade,falta de crescimento profissional."
good,"nel corso degli anni ho imparato lo spirito di gruppo, ho sviluppato la capacità di adeguamento ad ambienti multiculturali, ho imparato a comunicare con le persone"
good,"pessoas com boa vontade para ensinar os novatos, bons gestores."
good,A very competitive environment in which to work with very little training.
good,fast paced work that made your day go by. could get hard at times but people usually stepped up to help you out.
good,"I am Unemployed not because I chose to be. I loved working at Whirlpool would still be there if they did not leave Evansville,IN and move to Mexico."
good,It was a really fun place to work. We had all sorts of different people that worked with us. It was the easiest job both physically and mentally that I have ever worked.
good,"A typical day would include early hours. It's not the best place to work if you have children because of the 10hr shifts. Management in the office need to stick to that because coming out on the floor where production goes on doesnt work, but they did their jobs as far as I can remember. I would say I enjoyed working with my co-workers, made friends I still talk too. The hardest part of the job would be the repetitiveness which often lead to injuries. The best part was those three and four day weekends:-)))"
good,Whirlpool Is a good company to work with.They have great work life balance.
good,"Management at local level was extremely efficient and had good values. However, corporate level repeatedly passes on their own proposed values in order to make a quick buck."
good,"Hard to advance, placed unrealistic goals and did not provide proper tools to obtain goals,also switched teams and desks every month so no consistency to ahdjust and grow."
good,Great job great pay great benefits but! The don't except doctors excuse no matter if its life or death or kid involvement they same they are for family but not your family...whirlpool family fix those things great place for employment
good,"i am happy with whirlpool. Friendly atmosphere. space have been give to grow one self. Management are good. benefits are also ok, flexible hours. opportunity to grow, a good learning experience"
good,"Good pay and benefits, hot factory in summer, emphasis on production rates and keeping up with assembly line. Nice cafeteria with full kitchen. Long line getting in and out of the parking lot. Impatient with late or absent employees."
good,i worked only for a year there during my 1 year of professional training.  i enjoyed working with the service department and handling their IT issues.  people and engineers in their service department were nice and friendly and very co-operative.  They never let me feel that i  am just a trainee.
good,Assemble ranges.  I have 125 more characters to go to move on so. I'll keep writing blah blah blah 52 more to go so I guess I'll keep writing 9 I am done.
good,"I like to work at Whirlpool"
good,Wages are fair. Health care is much more expensive than other area manufacturing facilities by a long shot. Management changes constantly which can be very frustrating at times. There is plenty of oppurtunity to grow in the company. The company takes pride in training it's employees. There is multiple classes available to continue  your manufacturing knowledge.
good,The job was fun and very helpful with customer service never got a chance to get into whirlpool was thru aerotek so I don't know the specifics of whirloool
good,Minha passagem pela WHP foi bastante produtiva a onde tiver a oportunidade de crescer profissionalmente e desenvolver meus conhecimento da área  fiscal.
good,it wasnt bad when i worked there 10yrs ago. But places change along with the times. I would personally  not go back because of how it has gotten to be today
good,"Ambiente di lavoro stimolante e flessibile in cui ho avuto la possibilità di fare la mia prima esperienza lavorativa...in Whirlpool mi occupavo del collaudo e del controllo estetico dei frigoriferi. Lavoravo su due turni, dalle 6 alle 13.10 e dalle 13.10 alle 20.20."
good,"Fairness with the employees "
good,"-E' un'azienda che mi ha insegnato tanto e a cui ho dato tanto in termini di sacrifici e risultati. I manager sono nella maggior parte disponibili al dialogo e ti aiutano a crescere se ben predisposti. A volte non si hanno gli strumenti necessari per andare in battaglia a vendere e bisogna fare di mestiere virtu' e da una multinazionale ci si dovrebbe aspettare qualcosina in piu'. "
good,"Overall the job is great."
good,"Most people are friendly and easy to get along with. Not much room for advancement. You're mainly doing the same repetitive job over and over everyday. No way of expanding your knowledge and you're basically just a number, but it is a decent place to work if you really just need a job and don't care about learning new skills."
good,"I learned a lot from the whirlpool company, how to operator a forklift safely, how to manage a schedule, how to look parts up for the day and ensure the parts were in house or in route for the day, learned warehouse and dock skills."
good,"Amana plant is a fast moving facility with great, premium product. Facility is outdated but corporate is devoting resources to change that. Plant is lacking resources to get changes done in timely manner"
good,"This is a great company for those with 5 or less years of experience.  Management focuses on the advancement of younger employees.  Highly ethical company - management ""walks the walk"" and frequently seeks feedback."
good,Whirlpool Corporation focuses more on the numbers than the actual productivity of its employees. The management (mid-level) does however have the employees best interest at heart. Work life balance is questionable at times.
good,"A empresa de um modo geral é ótima um ambiente de trabalho agradável em relação a colegas, porem, deveria haver mais investimentos em setor de ergonomia e mais preparo para a liderança direta com os operadores."
good,"At Whirlpool Shared Service Center in Dublin, all employees are very busy at work and learn a lot. 1 year working there looks like 3 years."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, com gerencia de ótima qualidade, tratamento muito bom aos seus funcionário."
good,Considering the work environment it is very good company to work. In terms of remuneration it is very accurate and is execution is also best. Openness & Self driven company which facilitates to grow in the organisation
good,"Great pay and nice benefits (including reduced cost and, at times,  free appliances for home use).  "
good,Amalgamation of several companies which have merged over the last 10 years. The core DNA of the company exists but hasn't yet finalised its people culture.
good,En mi punto de vista es una empresa con muy buenas oportunidades de trabajo en donde puedes crecer laboralmente.
good,"Help load and unload trucks, scan I merchandise, call customers and install appliances. Management was great when it came to communication and responds. Hardest part was labor of the job and the best part was the freedom of the job."
good,"While it is not a bad place to work, I believe the leadership is narrow minded and has become greedy based on results vs. performance.  I want to work for a company in which leadership acts on what they say they're going to do.  If our company failures to deliver internal goals YoY, why do we get penalized in bonus when leadership does not?  Our stock price is extremely high and we are over delivering to shareholders, but under delivering to internal metrics.  This is very frustrating."
good,"Esta empresa é boa para o desenvolvimento do colaborador, pois ela oferece todo tipo de treinamento, suporte de infra estrutura."
good,Whirlpool is a good stepping stone for any one wanting to work in a factory. The work there is easy and allows for someone to move up in team management.
good,"Empresa com time competente, focado em resultados, com ambiente de trabalho muito agradavel."
good,"au fil des années j'ai passé plusieurs caces"
good,"Empresa boa pra trabalhar porem o salário deixa muito a desejar "

good,"un ambiente amigable, y estable. con trasporte , con espacios de fumadores"
good,aprendi a manejar el montacargas lo que mas me gusto fue el trabajo en equipo
good,good to work had a great team excellent management learnt a lot of skills. the most enjoyable part of the job The rating you provide is completely anonymous and will not be shown with your review.
good,Jobs aren't bad for the money. People are great most are really friendly and helpful. Leadership could use some work. It's very Cliquey in there. It seems like if you have your own opinion and or you arent friends with the boss they hold that against you.
good,"I went to work for Whirlpool thru a temporary agency.  I worked in the office during the initial setup of their facility in North Tulsa/Owasso.  It was an enjoyable place to work but I was told at the time they were only hiring a few office people if any and unless I wanted to work in the shop, I should consider looking for other employment."
good,"Working with Whirlpool has given me immense knowledge about Supplier Development and Quality Planning for Part."
good,Great people work here and there were many opportunities to advance in this company. Very secure job with great pay. Benefits at this company are fantastic and they reward you for trying to improve your health.
good,Lo unico malo de esta empresa es el sueldo en todo lo demas esta exelente..
good,Alot of working with tools on an assembly line. People were great and a very nice facility.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo y seguro."
good,"Aprendi de sistemas de planeacion, trabajo en equipo"
good,"Em partes foi uma empresa no qual gostaria de estar trabalhando até hoje, gostava dos horários, refeitório próprio, ótimo plano de saúde, enfim, quanto a benefícios nota dez. Mas durante cinco anos trabalhados sempre ouvi muitos elogios quanto ao meu trabalho e até incentivos para fazer os cursos internos ( fiz três) mas infelizmente não tive oportunidade de sair da produção e ser promovida."
good,"Setup, conduct testing and data acquisition on prototype, component(s), and complete residential and commercial Whirlpool and competitor refrigeration products using LMS sound & vibration software/data acquisition systems."
good,"- Operação padronizada e metódica, proporcionando segurança e permitindo boa visualização e controle das tarefas;"
good,"Una muy buena compañia pero tiene una falta de productos cmpetitivos adecuadas a nuestro mercado.-"
good,When i worked at whirlpool i pretty much worked alone.Everyone had their own workstation and took breaks seperately.Being there definitely taught me how to work independently.The hardest part of the job was it was so monotonous doing the same thing over and over again.The easiest thing was you really didn't have anyone watching over your shoulder as long as you were doing your job correctly.
good,"A typical day at this job was to report to my job, work the 8 hour shift building dishwashers and go home. I learned how to build dishwashers, how to test them & how to repair them. Management treated employees with respect. I got a long well with my co-workers, it seemed like everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was knowing I was going to get laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"Worked second shift.  Learned how to do several different jobs."
good,"Whirlpool is a great place to start your career, but there is a concrete layer of middle management that can create discouraged and disengaged employees.  There are tons of development opportunities for employees that choose to own their career path.  The small town culture leads to a very familial and team-oriented environment.  "
good,"A empresa desenvolve ações para melhoria continua e respeita principalmente o meio ambiente,"
good,mais para um pai de família paga pouco. fica difícil manter as dispersas casa.
good,".... but not a challenging place to work. Factories are usually in the hinterlands, making further personal growth difficult."
good,"Hard ,  Strenuous , hot environment, , had to unload trailers by hand and place in skids, reach over your head, boxes fall on you. I would not return."
good,I commuted and carpooled to work everyday. Some thought I was crazy for making that kind of Drive which entailed driving an hour and 20 minutes before and after work!... but you do what you have to do for a good job!
good,"The employee connections were outstanding.  People help where they see a need.  Was a great job, became difficult as plans to shut down evolved.  That made it much more stressful."
good,ottimo posto ma la postazione dove stavo io minimo servivano due persone
good,"Very hard, very hot, and if you get to work with insulation, good luck. The people being brought in are people off the streets. the culture isn't as great as it used to be. However, pay is great and so are the benefits."
good,"must be able to perform at a high level. Learned on the job training, getting along with coworkers, and meeting new people. Typical day is very busy and stressful."
good,"It's not a bad place to work if your young and healthy."
good,Uma empresa. Boa tem bastante oportunidades. para crescer na empresa
good,Whirlpool has changed over the years. They used to be a great place to work for but I think all the money they are making has gone to their head. They tell you hiring in is as quick as 90 days but most people said it was almost a year before they were hired in. The pay sucks for the amount of stress. Also shift bids suck!
good,"E boa a empresa , tem chance de crescimento gostei"
good,"empresa dinamica e agradavel de trabalhar, visando o bem estar ergonomico."
good,"Es una empresa donde puedes laborar y percibir uno de los mejores sueldos que en cualquier otro lugar,."

good,Trabalhar numa multi nacional e uma das melhores empresas muitos beneficios horarios otimos
good,"• Treinamento de segurança do trabalho constante."
good,"hardest part of the job is getting used to the work. the people you work with are the best. you have to be at work on time ,not late or absent. time goes by fast when you keep busy"
good,"I found it a very pleasant place to work, I wouldn't have let the job if I wasn't going to move to Coventry to do an access course"
good,"- Boas condições de trabalho"
good,"Great place to work with opportunity to meet diverse group of people across the world. "
good,"it gives me ability to work my speed and too carefully on every parts of the refrigerator installed."
good,Empresa cumpria seu dever como empregador e mantinha tudo em ordem com pagamentos e benefícios.
good,"Trabalhei em caráter temporário. Contudo, no pouco tempo que permaneci, consegui perceber muitos pontos positivos na empresa. Dinâmica, de muito aprendizado, onde os colegas se doam em prol da empresa e de colaboradores recém chegados."
good,"Always walking around the factory floor getting your hands dirty. If you are critical to a line, then you would have to be there if something went wrong even over the night."
good,"Typical day at work starts off with conducting a phone meeting with suppliers in Mexico to discuss issues and next steps. Afterwards, I worked on retrofitting new model stoves with my controls and resolving issues."
good,"Digamos que já entrei na whirlpool com bastante aprendizado.Porque trabalhei nos terceros fui aprendendo trabalhar em equipe ,o bom saber tambem individual ,mais o meu forte sempre foi trabalhar em equipe.Lhe dou bem com com os companheiros de serviço e respeitar e saber dividir idéias,lógico principalmente a segurança do trabalho usar os I.P.I.Parte mais agradavél 6 horas de trabalho.A parte mais difícil é que a direção se aprimorar na integridade ."
good,"Typical day at work is full of activities. I don't remember a single day when I was sitting without any work. Even if there is not urgent project, there is so much to learn and experiment."
good,"It is a nice place to work"
good,not a bad place to work as far as factories go-rotating through several work stations every 1/2 hr. helped break up the monotony
good,"O dia de trabalho estressante,eu aprendi trabalha em equipe numa linha de produção grande,a direção cobrava muito sobre produção assim como a gerencia meus colegas e bom te trabalho a parte mais de dificil era parte de montagem a parte mais agradavel quando terminava o espediente."
good,"Okay company, friendly people. Benton Harbor is just a remote uninteresting place to work. The technical challenges also were not appealing to my skill set, but that's just me. I think there are some management issues at the low levels (upper management seemed good)."
good,"A typical day at work started with a 45 minute drive to work, have a meeting/ pep talk then assigned to a work station. If you had enough seniority you were assigned a permanent spot which you and your body could get used to. If in my case you were sent wherever you were needed. there was no air conditioning and the plant would reach up to 100 on hot summer day. Again if you were lucky you had access to a fan. the only thing keeping me there was the people. wonderful group of co workers and managers. Great benefits with Union backing."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, produção alta e rotatividade em diferentes funções."
good,Une bonne entreprise où j’ai beaucoup appris. Mais je veux aller vers de nouveaux horizons
good,"Whirlpool is a great job for someone who can sit and take phone calls of customers who are most likely not polite to You, if You find that enjoyable and can do it all day then it is awesome with great benefits and nice hours, not to mention they pay for Your college. It is not for someone with a creative mind and would like to be more apart of something, nor is it for someone who enjoys different things and different task. It is very repetitive."
good,"The assembly line just wasnt for me. Short breaks, fast pace, cut throat, competitive and very stressful. Worn out body and exhausted everyday. My first manager was great but the second one I had, he was horrible. Didn't care that I didn't want to be on the line and he didn't do anything to help me get off the line."
good,i worked on the press line very good job but very nasty one .my boss was really good at listing to you and tried working with you until i tried to talk to him one day  about why i wanted to quit my job that i did like just not the people i worked with

good,There were many people that loved their position. I was not one of them. It took a major toll on my anxiety. The leads and team heads were very supportive and helpful.
good,Its a wonderful career but it's a job that your life has to be balanced and prioritize.Yu have to be willing to be a team worker and able to keep up with a assembly line
good,Quando eu entrei lá não tinha um lugar fixo para trabalhar todo dia estava num posto diferente então foi difício de me acostumar. Mais o restante é uma empresa ótima.
good,"Management could use some work..but coworkers were manageable. Decent hours, great pay. To far to travel. Easy but fast paced work. Not long enough breaks or lunch break was to short. I learned how to assemble and disassemble different kinds of products. A typical day at work consists of moving around at a medium pace assembling products."
good,"Tiene buenas prestaciones, pero hay mucho favoritismo para el personal que ya esta"
good,"Empresa onde diversas adversidades aconteciam, sempre um desafio aparecia para ser solucionado."
good,Fun place to work  but can get crazy and sometime the lines can stop and be off for a long time and the next there could be just alot of malfunction or issues but then there those good nights where everything ran just right
good,"its a great place to work , its very structured to be honest , they need a better way to train , they don't have enough time to truly train because the other issues they have to take care of throughout the day and little Glitches"
good,"Basically, your assigned to your area, you get a lot of training, and you work as long as you suppose to be there, but they never force overtime on you, and they are always willing to help you advance if they see the potential for you to advance."
good,aprendi sobre valores e eticas
good,"É um trabalho cansativo mas dá muitas oportunidade, aprendemos muitos setores várias funções,os gerentes olham pelos seus funcionários, mas buscam fazer um ambiente bom se trabalhar,as pressões são grandes  nos setores ,para alcançar metas,o mais agradável é que os funcionários que se esforçam são reconhecidos."
good,My days working there were fun and I learn a lot from the staff there.I was given the chance to move up in the company I had the chance to see how they make appliances and how the shippments and oders went through the company at a fast pace
good,"great co workers, great team work, Life long friends were made during my time there"
good,"Working at whirlpool was the best experience of my life. We were like family at whirlpool always worked as a team. We all worked on the line helping and enjoying the job. It was so sad when the company told us the company is moving away, that was the hardest part working for whirlpool."
good,"Fairly balanced reapeated daily life the ppl are cool just take sum time to get use too , just focus do your job, they could longer the breaks or give more, it get really hot and doing the same thing over and over get dizzy and frustrating and 9 minute breaks aren’t enough when there is a 1000 ppl trying to do the same thing"

good,As a Trade Customer Support Specialist we manage trade customers orders while communicating daily with our trade partners. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different individuals. .
good,"Overall I enjoyed my job, I worked sub assembly. I made rate on most of the jobs. Most of my jobs came easy to me, it was very fast paste, very few jobs were difficult for me to accomplish."
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is the people.  There is a serious breakdown between functions that needs to be improved in order to continuously improve.  They offer a few great perks such as fitness reimbursement (should be more) and education reimbursement (also should be more) but something is better than nothing.
good,its a good job but wears you down was there 7 years and never received any kind of praise or god job the only thing that kept me there was the pay and people  i had 4 surgeries that they refused to pay for im better off not working there.
good,"it was a very touh experience , i had to adjust myself and focus on egtting my internship done to achieve my targets."
good,It is a very good Company providing good product to cosumeres

good,"Whirlpool m'a appris le monde du travail, j'ai pu y apprendre différents postes puisque je suis maintenant ""polyvalente"" ."
good,"10 hour shift"
good,"Based on my experience in the appliance industry, corporate America asks its' employees to redirect a great deal of animosity from dissatisfied consumers to trade partners. To summarize my experience, it forced me to become slightly desensitized to people when I'm unable to provide assistance due to restraints in place to save the company money."
good,Managers are a joke rude and disrespectful also they will not give you any slack so if your hurt u should just call in unless it happened at work  or they will send you home
good,"- Empresa prefere a contratação de terceiro para área de TI."
good,Analyse competitive landscape. Look at the promo pricing. Conduct custom research. 
good,typical day was trying to out do yesterdays service in terms of helping out the clients and making the company the top name.
good,"Whirlpool is not a place for everyone and it does take a special kind of person to work there. Sometimes you deal with very difficult consumers, which is to be expected. However, there are consumers who will be flat out rude and disrespectful to you and you are not given the proper training to handle those consumers. You cannot disconnect the call, due to that being grounds for termination, you also cannot just transfer the consumer to someone else, especially if they are refusing that. In my opinion there needs to be a process to handle those type of consumers. I also feel like there should be better coaching, not ""hey, you did this, you're fired,"" but ""I understand why you did this, this is what we can do in the future to correct this issue, and this is your first and last warning to correct it."" The CXC Center is a great place to work, I appreciated having a set work schedule and knowing that my CA would work with my schedule when I needed them to, but I do feel like there needs to be better training and coaching to handle the more escalated calls."
good,"Very friendly work environment and professional.  The middle and upper management have no say as to who is going to be let go when the corporate executives decide for layoffs.  Hundreds laid off with little to no notice every couple years.  Lack job security and loyalty.  Surprising culture from a global, multi billion dollar company."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, temos pausa , ginástica laboral, ótimo horário,"
good,I like the job but was unhappy with management. It takes a minimum of 9 months to get fully hired in. I wasn't to happy about that. There point system was outrageous at the time to.
good,"but if your face doesnt fit you will know about it!"
good,"Finchè era Indesit Company nulla da eccepire, bell'ambiente, bel lavoro, possibilità di inserimento."
good,Management of EMEA not satisfactory as after Indesit acquisition have completely lost the commercial advantages of the two companies together and have fired a number of managers that remaining in the same sector have stilled a lot of the business.
good,"no benefits that you could afford ,not a full time permeant job. No paid holidays. job itself I"
good,"Controllo produzioni e gestione ordini del cliente "
good,I worked under a manufacturing engineer.  Here i learned the importance of work balance.
good,"Good place of employment, work for Whirlpool for 10 years and made a lot of friends while there."
good,"Hay muy buenos compañeros, el nivel de presion no es muy alto, los retos son pequeños, se llega a caer en la monotonía, limites salariales muy marcados. Sistema de evaluacion oscuro."
good,it was a ok place to work. wouldn't recomend it to to many people. the pay is to low for as hard as they push you.
good,"I liked working there on second shift. the management on first shift isn't great. goal of whirlpool are reachable, but the opening and closing of lines are uncalled for. The stress they put on the people on the lines with lean makes it hard to work there. I'm all for hard work. But if u dont have time to think, or drink water, then you need to reevaluate somethings like; your line pace, and/or work load"
good,"Typical factory, easy mindless work. I met a lot of interesting and unique people while working at Whirlpool."
good,"A empresa Whirlpool é muito boa para se trabalhar,mas o unico probleminha é a remuneração salarial,que não reconhece o serviço e o esforço do funcionario."
good,Overall Whirlpool is not a bad company to work for. The call center here and the management is not so great and I will not be going back. Great company.
good,It all depends on what position they put you at. Everybody is different one job I sucked and another job I was great at. Like at first I was an Assembly It was difficult for me. Almost loss my job but I kept trying until I was able to bid to a different positions. I bid for the plant utility positions and I like it I good at it.
good,Whirlpool is a fast paced environment and is not for everyone I worked here for 2 years I enjoyed my time here. The people tend to keep to themselves and the work is not that difficult.
good,"I liked working there, but I was walking home one night and got hit by a car. They lady that hit me with her car was harassing me at work so I ended up quitting because of it. I went and talked to them about the situation but nothing was done about it."
good,"Not good for growth if thats what you are looking for, company is in moddle of work culture shift which is creating issues for employes and no proper growth policy is there"
good,"É uma empresa boa, porém não te dá muitas oportunidades, pra mostrar o seu talento"
good,"Empresa agradável , séria  , colegas de trabalho compreensivos , porém nesses anos que estou lá , não tenho tido oportunidades"
good,Working at Whirlpool is a great experience. They expect quality that is above and beyond other manufacturers. There is a team effort and management pushes their employees to do the best they can to achieve daily and long term goals
good,"your co-workers are amazing people, team leaders where ok it was hard but fun at the same time considering it was mostly about the timing but it was fun."
good,Présentation devant le chef d'équipe qui vous oriente vers le poste a occuper en vous expliquant ce que vous aller devoir accomplir.la polyvalence et de mise car différent poste vous sera présenter.Vous aurait a assembler des  pièces sur différent poste de travail.
good,In the growth of the company management go lost with the employees. They are now starting to come back to the employees because they realize without them they have no business.
good,me senti bem o tempo q estive ali...conhecimento e amizade fizeram parte da minha vida trabalhando na whirlpool..
good,Although being told on many occasions there were opportunities for growth. my experience has thought me unless you were part of a select few the opportunities were not available.
good,"Fiz grandes amigos, e mantive portas abertas por todas as áreas com as quais trabalhei."
good,"it is very interesting working place,and my senior is very good behavior."

good,"ees un trabajo muy rutinario pesasdo y bajo presión del tiempo ya que la produccon depende de lo rápido que trabajes,"
good,"wide range of age groups from kids to senior adults, to lawyers and doctors to super star athletes that you meet on the job as a lifeguard. cheerful but very important, lives are at stake. i've even saved a few infants and senior adults from potential life threating situations."
good,"Running reports, releasing orders, managing accounts as needed."
good,My work day is fast paced. I learn to work well as a team. I learn profound patients working as a team when everyone has a diffrent agenda. I find myself somewhat stepping into a leadership role. My co-workers are a test of my skills to maintain poised attitude and i do just that. The hardest part of my job is not being able to deal with the public because i posses skills in customer relations and maintining those relationships. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i am a part of serving.
good,"Lá você aprende muito, boa liderança e profissionais qualificados"
good,"Respected brand in the appliance industry regarding product quality, support long after the sale, as well the infrastructure.    In most positions (entry level to mid mgt)  compensation is low.   Most all advancement opportunities are in the Benton Harbor Mi area.   Would be much more attractive if located in a bigger city... such as Chicago, Dallas and so."
good,Falta tener mas presicion en los objetivos a seguir asi como tener mentalidad de cambio
good,"I worked at Best Company for less than a year"
good,"Good to have a flexible timing."

good,"Loved whirlpool, pay was an issue . We didn't have enough hours to makeup for the amount we made . Definitely could of had better orderer in the way things were done.. Was very slow paced most days ."
good,Whirlpool becoming more global company and getting exposed to global environment so it is good company to develop you career but location of Tech center is away from big cities
good,a half hour per job rotation with 7 jobs to do a day. as i said before it is a rather fast pace job but over time it becomes easy. loved this job for a while.
good,"Was a fine place to work.  Good pay, good opportunity.  Plenty of training.  Politics and decision making can be frustrating, and you tend to repeat similar failures repeatedly."
good,"Pretty good place to work. You get to work on some new stuff.  No opportunity for advancement in the near future, though.  Nothing else to add.  Just making character min."

good,"eu aprendi que    nos sete anos de trabalho na empresa que o essencial de todos é trabalhar em equipe que era muito raro nesta empresa devido ,a dinãmica do trabalho muitos não queria ajudar uns ao outros e gerava toda aquela discussão dos colaboradores.Mas eu como funcionario sempre procurava a orientar os mais novos colaboradores que se nos trabalharmos juntos os desgaste de trabalho seria menor e se cada um procurar um objetivo na empresa a tedencia de crescer la era muito  grande,as opurtunidade ia chegar da melhor maneira possivel foi o que aconteceu comigo cheguei num cargo de muita responsabilidade grande cuidar de duas maquinas nao era facil se eu deixar ela parar parava uma linha de produção que não era legal pra ninguem.Em fim apesar de todos os obstaculos era uma empresa boa de trabalhar."
good,"manage inventory, put away parts, unload and load trucks. Ten hour days, and lots of overtime."
good,"Ambiente agradável"
good,The manufacturing environment was a productive one but unfortunately that took total precedence over employee work/life balance.
good,"Management was very much 'in tune' as to the workers and their needs. Very busy environment and always on the go, enjoyed very much working with the team."
good,O trabalho em equipe é indispensável e necessário ser o mais ágil possível.
good,I enjoyed working on the project that I was taken on for - and would have liked to have stayed on tp take on further similar projects at the company. I was part of a friendly team.
good,Uma empresa boa pra trabalhar tem uma dinamica fácil de aprendizagem
good,"boa para fazer carreira, tem um bom plano de saude, transporte e alimentação"
good,Whirlpool is am over all good place to work for the money. But over all it was an okay experience. Managment is pretty good as well its a fairly friendly work environment.
good,"Es una empresa muy segura para laborar, tiene buenas prestaciones."
good,"It's not a bad place to work. You have people there that is willing to help you to make the job easier. The work that you do there is fast pace depending on the area they put you in, but it gets easier as you keep working there. You just have to put in effort when you are working. "
good,"It is a great place to learn in deep with embedded systems, but they don't care about your work life balance. You won't be working on any latest technologies but in your area of work you will learn many things"
good,"Competitive, quality driven company with a commitment to continuously improving. Variety of positions, shifts and opportunities to advance within the company. Above average compensation and respectable benefits package. Highly recommend to anyone looking to start a career path with an established company."
good,"Whirlpool was a great place to work. The downfall is that their was a lot politics in the Plant.  A great buddy system if you were in the right team."
good,"One 15min break, 30min lunch. Very fast-paced, management hires you in saying they have resources to help you but if you ask to use them you are frowned upon. Lots of drama and your health insurance takes a big cut of you paycheck. Only get 30 PTO hours to start and half the time it's not recorded so you get marked for taking vacation anyway. Line supervisor was very rude."
good,"Regular factory job & I wouldn't recommend it , takes a lot to move up & and workers are favored by the bosses & isn't a fair job. Pay isn't enough & only 5 sick days the first 90 days, and you don't get hired through right away it can take up to over a year total. lots of drama & isn't a happy place to work at, & the team leaders & supervisors are really bad & don't handle the job properly. I wouldn't recommend working here."
good,The job was very fun and enjoyable. The environment allows you to be sociable and still work without falling behind. There are also plenty opportunity to advance career
good,"Ambiente laboral pesado, exigencia y salario poco aceptable."

good,En esta empresa el trabajo es estable es muy difícil que te despidan
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, mas meio complicado na questão crescimento."
good,It is cool when you get to work 4 10 hr shifts and be done it is rough when you get mandatory overtime which cuts out the only weekday where you can handle personal responsibility such as making phone calls running errands so on and so forth.  Great benefit package and good pay extremely strict on attendance.
good,Empresa con buenos valores y mucha seguridad para trabajar.
good,"call center answering phone calls, how not to become upset with callers, management was fine, the culture was diverse, the work wasn't really hard, the hours flexed."
good,Make money money money. You work hard for it though. it is very hot in the summer. Hard to get anything improved as some management just tell you what you want to hear to shut you up.

good,"Buenas prestaciones, oportunidad de desarrollo, buen salario"
good,"Empresa seria, dedicada, apoia os funcionários. Como todo lugar tem seus pros e contras."

good,"Excellent opportunity if you come in under the recent college graduate advanced placement program, or going from intern to full time. Can be difficult to advance when comeing from outside role without internal connections. Advancements were given to those who worked the office politics and networked successfully."
good,Muito agradável para se trabalhar nesta empresa...
good,factory work its a good job not stressful but you must make your production good work environment if you do your work you have done your job   good co-workers
good,A Whirlpool foi capaz de me proporciona experiências profissionais.
good,Culture is the best I've ever been in. Immediate management was great. We recently got a new ceo and we can see some changes coming. They really care about diversity and support a work life balance.
good,Solid company! Great benefits and atmosphere. Constant paid training. Educational remembursment. Staff very helpful and works as a team. Left for career advancement. Knoxville location now closed (relocated).
good,Respected  have a problem there is someone there to help hrs are great polite people everyone gets along  great attitudes hard working people very clean environment
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, Long Hours, I worked 4 days a week at 10/hrs a day and had the weekend off, Had two 10min break and a 30 min lunch, Can't smoke or vape on the premises though."
good,this was a good company to work for. just a slow hiring in process. many people are temps. and dont get hired into company for up to 2 even 3 years as a temp. i could not do that.
good,I liked working at whirlpool it was hard work but it also had decent pay the only downside to me was not getting to spend much time with my family like I wanted to
good,"Whirlpool provides many opportunities to learn and grow.  During my time at Whirlpool, I was a systems analyst, project manager, business analyst, technical support and a testing lead and testing manager."

good,This is a world class manufacturing company and I had a good experience as a co-op. Learned a lot from good mentors and faced nice and helpful people during my experience.
good,"Good Company..."
good,Whirlpool is a strong company.  However was disappointed that many jobs were cut due to input from an independent firm that didn't really know what we did on a day to day basis.  I feel they are exposing the company to risks as a result.  Also relocated jobs to India due to cheaper labor
good,"Worked in multi culture environment"
good,"It was a great place to work and I enjoyed it very much. The parking lot was hectic, and some of the policies made so sense. What I enjoyed most about it was the pay"

good,Gran ambiente de trabajo. Enfoque en calidad y en cumplir con los lineamientos.
good,"The job was good and paid well, but the workers weren't the greatest. Management also wasn't that great. Didn't really seemed like they cared much about their workers. But in my job I could avoid management and some coworkers I didn't want to associate with."
good,"Fair pay, three day weekend, employees are friendly and a blast to work with.  You get plenty of vacation time to take whenever you want.  The company has good benefits"
good,Fun and hard working kind of job. Very rewarding to see progress in your work. There are ways to move up in the job but not easy and not an easy way to receive benefits.
good,"Whirlpool India is a very good appliances & very good environment it has but I had a timing problem,& the primary thing is I am not satisfied that company"
good,Una Boa empresa que possuiu uma excelente estrutura para os colaboradores.
good,"I would walk in and the people were not very friendly, a lot of people was there to get there jobs done and leave they did not care about the next employee.  I learned that no matter how hard you worked there you was not looked at for it.  Management only cared about how many units you put out a day and that is it.  Hardest part of the job was just getting to know the people because they was only there for themselves.  I did enjoy working there thought because it was so close to home."
good,"Bajo nivel de capacitacion"
good,good pay for the time I was there.good hours nice people. place is no longer in business! easy job with lots of good people. learned a lot while working there.

good,This is a good starting full time job. A good pay rate with friendly and helpful management. Mild physical exertion and a fast pace every day. In my limited experience this could easily be a career.
good,"A Typical day is never a typical day.  The workload is ever changing and challenging.  There was never any down time which made for a busy day, it also made for an exhausting day.  Co-workers were great and everyone pretty much helped and respected one another.  Management could do a better job in communication."
good,I liked my job. it was fast paste and you learned new things. I assembled washing machines in a ten job rotation. we made a washing machine every 10 seconds so you had to be quick.
good,"Boa empresa, boa refeição, boa carga horaria, bom transporte."
good,Fine place to work. good pay. no complaints. located in a small town. this is not glassdoor.com.  Why must one add this level of information?
good,"Ambiente ingegneristico."

good,"Giant corporation, room to grow if willing to move, great compensation and benefits; there is plenty of help from other locations."

good,Start on time at my station every day. Learned different things every day. My boss was very helpful. my coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was the heat during summer time. Keeping the machinery in running order was enjoyable.
good,"A country club, with lots of red tape. Not progressive, rather old school. They now have a fancy office, bit that's about it!"
good,"i learned many design factors, software, etc"

good,"I report to my assigned station and work at that assigned station, unless my supervisor tells me to move to another station. The job is fast-paced and the tasks are repetitive, but they are easy to learn and I picked up on them quickly."
good,Bom ambiente de trabalho com profissionais bastante especializados que oferece grande oportunidade de aprendizado e crescimentos. Utiliza avaliação de desempenho para os funcionário mas que contem falhas de avaliação na promoção dos funcionários bem como no desempenho e entregas dos seus gestores e colaboradores. O mais difícil fi tratar com gerência interessadas apenas nos seus objetivos e metas de carreira.
good,I hired on as a temp.  The work wasn't bad and the pay was fair.  For those who get hired in at whirlpool it's an exceptional job.
good,Whirlpool really cares about their employees and takes good care of them. It is overall an encouraging environment with pleasant coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working at Whirlpool because of the fast paste work. We were always busy and had to remain focused on our job. Everyone depended on each other to finish their job correctly and within a timely manner.
good,"Entry level very hard to get through. If you make it and can get converted from temp agent to whirlpool agent, pay increases and benefits are not bad. As with any customer service job, it can be stressful having strangers yell at you all day. Attendance policy is too ridge to work with you should you have serious issues happen within a years time."
good,"A typical day at work I operate 3 separate stations on an assembly line putting together KitchenAid stand mixers in different steps wherein I rotate to a new station every hour throughout the night. I learned that with dedication and repetition i can achieve anything I set my mind to especially in regards to hands on work. Management does a fairly good job overseeing the production of the line and are usually available if I have questions or concerns. My co-workers are friendly overall and I have been able to get along with them well during my time here. the hardest part of the job is making sure that the quality of the product is as good as it can be since our mixer output is running at a quick pace. The turnover rate is quite high since the average Joe is not physically and or mentally capable of meeting the requirements of the job, even after weeks of training. The most enjoyable part of the job is not knowing which mixer model we will be running day in and day out. It helps break up the monotony a little bit, but overall the work is consistent."
good,"Company's enviroment is good & all staff peoples are very cooperative in nature . I am learning so many new things like what is the role of control chart, cp & cpk in a company , sap saftware , jmp software , how to lead a  major project & how can we closed it after completion."
good,typical day consist of shooting screws checking wires and dealing with every day people. some of the people are friendly and others are not.

I turned in my paperwork to quit, and then wanted to do something then, but what they wanted to do was move me instead of the team lead who was causing the issues."
good,Good pay good benefits. As long as you stay of materials they look for reasons to get rid of people that go into that department .works are bitter and hate their lives.

good,Whirlpool has great bebefis. However they tend to cut your hours on a biweekly basis. Management as far as treating people fairly is great. Attendance is very strict. You only get 5 emergency PRO's but receive 10 PRO's every month. However if you run out or emergency PTO you have to plan your regular PTO days.ahead of time. If you run out then you have to leave the job. Even if your dick you have to co.e to work if your out of PTO.

good,I had a great time working with Whirlpool and Cognizant. Gathered immense of knowledge and team work capabilities. Being with such an organization developed my technical and interpersonal skills.

My goal is to find a position doing this same type of maintenance work closer to home."
good,"Be focus and work hard everyday"

I have learned how to run waste treatment a bit and how to run the ecoat machine itself and solve errors on it. i learned how to read materials sheets and do paint tests along with titrations and balancing of chemicals. Management treats people fair and will work with you for the most part. I have 2 co-workers and both are pretty good at their job and will do more if I ask them to. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people and being relied on so the line doesn't run out of parts and have to stop.
good,esta bien el ambiente solo que ahy algunos supervisores algo despotas y en ocaciones van en estado de ebriedad y se torna muy mal las condiciones de trabajo

good,Whirlpool cXc is a good place to work.  The hours may not always be ideal but the pay is good and benefits are good once able to go permanent with the company after working through Randstad for a period of time.

good,The pay is great especially when you have high seniority and the benefits are pretty good as well. But sometimes the people you work with can be very toxic and make it hard to work with them. Management still needs a lot of work... I do love that they don't force overtime anymore.
good,"Ponto negativo salario e plano de carrera"
good,"This is a good place to get experience in entry level management and possibly more. Once you get through your probationary period, you have the ability to bid to other areas"
good,"Muito boa empresa para trabalhar, bons benefícios e salario compatível com mercado de trabalho. Porém peca na avaliação forçada de resultados para com colaborador."
good,Management says change starts with you... Change starts with management... Management at whirlpool cops out and places blame on employees rather than looking at management structure and management application.. Advancement only possible if a Whirlpool legacy. Management walks around with sense of entitlement.. Looks down on the labor force.
good,"A typical day is focused on our customer providing the best branded consumer products in the world. New programs and principles are always in the fore front to set pace against our competitors. Manufacturing is not  just putting pieces together it's building a product which creates demand,loyalty and a drive us to be more innovate to support our customers future demands. "
good,Must be able to work at a rapid pace.  Team oriented environment with your department.  Simple mathematical computation is a must.  Attendance must be really good.

good,"Same as above."
good,Empresa voltada altamente à resultados com time extremamente capacidade e robusto em qualquer posição.

good,"I had an amazing team to work with.  I learned so much in my temporary positions with Whirlpool.  I am only disappointed they didn't hire me full time.  I worked there for 4 years with no benefits, no PTO but I loved my temporary assignment and wish it had become full time. I'm sure its a great company for those that are there full time."
good,"Whirlpool is very much about taking care of the customers! There are always changes happening, some for the good, some for the bad. Downfall, is when you get into a higher paid position, without a degree in you are not able to advance any further."
good,Whirlpool is a good company to work from and gave me the ability to work from home. I am just ready for something different. I want to be able to move around at my job and not just sit behind a desk. I have very strong communication and computer skills.
good,I worked for Whirlpool for 25 + years and I can truly say that I earned every promotion I got. Whirlpool gave me the opportunity to go to college at LMC and earn an associates degree. Working with so many different people from so many different cultures was a great experience.
good,(ELECTRICIAN) If you are considering working in maintenance at Whirlpool then its a great job. Very low stress and management and supervision does not bother you as long as you get your assigned jobs done in a timely manner. Work is divided evenly and fairly.

I've been many places but never been anywhere that had an atmosphere like Whirlpool and not in a good way. I would never go back.
good,"En mi opinion es buena empresa, solo que los jefes no te dan oportunidad de crecer economicamente."
good,"Empresa com alto dinamismo nas atividades e muitos desafios. Clima de trabalho agradável. A parte mais difícil é a pressão e gestão de prioridades, a parte mais agradável é o desenvolvimento e geração de resultados."

good,"This is entry level job, working on assembly line.  The training is great, they never leave you on your own when you are first learning.  Being a trainer was great, spent a lot of time with the new workers. most of the time you are put onto midnights right away."

good,el da común es llegar a tu operación trabajo constante y lo padre era que cada tres horas se cambia de operación lo malo es que se hace fila para ir al baño tienes que esperar que te cubran y mis compañeros muy buenos lo poco que los eh conocido excelentes personas y muy responsables de los directivos no tengo nada e contra son buenos en su trabajo y no se meten con los operadores la parte mas dificil fue tomar los ritmos de la linea de producción y lo que mas me gusto es que en poco tiempo aprendí y domine la mayor parte de las operaccdiones

good,good place to work eventually you will get paid really well. good people to work with you can work in different areas. learn a lot of things along the way. At this particular plant you build the dryers there are some parts that are hard to build. Where I was at I built the console of the dryer and it was somewhat easy once you got the hang of it.
good,Although whirpool is a great company management isnt super involvled with coworkers. Also work life balance isnt great and neither is the compensations. but this is because you go through a temp agency
good,"Reviso que se encuentren todos las posiciones cubiertas, que embarques se tienen programados, que recibos se tienen pendientes, que materiales estan urgentes o criticos, almacen de indirectos si existe algun pendiente, asisto ajuntas de produccion, reporte a gerencia estatus del dia, reporte de embarques incompletos,."

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Changing culture for the better!"
good,"Not a bad place to work at all, the culture is a little different than other places I've worked.Pay is decent and overtime is voluntary."
good,"I worked on an assembly line assembling washer.I have learned how to use many hands tools.Management was satisfactory.Everywhere a person works there will be some kinda drama but overall It was a great experience.The hardest part of the job was being moved around from line to line because as soon as I would learn a job,that line would go to 1 or 2 shifts.Seemed like my shift was always the getting cancelled for that line.The most enjoyable would be that it kept me busy.I like to stay busy.I'm not one to stand around waiting"
good,"Buena empresa, aprendes a dar "
good,Conservative company. Must own career and have supporter to advance. Lots of career options. Good benefits. Good but not great pay. Higher level leadership is great. Middle managers are hit and miss.
good,"Had good time to spend of technical work, improved tech knowldge"
good,"The activities use to start with an ergonomic stretch and a safety dialogue with the team. Then I checked my daily agenda, meetings, e-mails, requests and priorities.

good,"As a Project Manager, I was give lot of autonomy as long as I was meeting my timeline.  The project team truly worked as a team even though team members generally did not report directly to the project manager.  Most difficult was that the resources were most times not available exactly when needed even when they were planned for far ahead of time."
good,"Meu dia baseia-se em analisar áreas de trabalho e postos, e implantas melhorias que impactam em ergonomia, produtividade, segurança, qualidade, fluxo de materiais, além de gestão visual e padronização."
good,working with whirlpool was fun and very educative. Thought me how to be a leader and an achiever.

Very good customer service and a great relationship between  managers and all other employees. it always a happy time going to work.
good,"Muito corrido"
good,"Nesta oportunidade de trabalho pude me transformar em um profissional mais adequado ao mercado de trabalho pelos apoios de treinamento e ferramentas de desenvolvimento de produtos. O apoio ao profissional juntamente com o bom relacionamento entre os colegas de trabalho foram os pontos mais agradáveis ao ser colaborador desta empresa. Destaco como ponto forte da Whirlpool ainda, a grande preocupação com o meio-ambiente, saúde e segurança dos funcionários, segurança dos produtos visando os consumidores."
good,Enjoyed a lot.I learned how to communicate with the customers.
good,*dia bem dinâmico e corrido por ser na área de faturamento
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, contando alguns pontos a serem reavaliados."
good,"Set line for 8 hrs. work,nice co-workers management was fair"
good,"Dias corridos e bem trabalhados, aprendi a importância do trabalho em equipe, tanto a direção como gerencia era boa os colegas de trabalho era muito bom pra se trabalhar uma equipe unida e com ótimo relacionamento, a parte mais dificil era acompanhar o crescimento cada vez maior da produção, a parte mais agradavel era o relacionamento com os amigos que conquistei na empresa."
good,Essa empresa é ótima para de trabalhar pois delegava as tarefas e confiava no meu trabalho.
good,"Eu já pensava de trabalhar numa empresa grande como a whirlpool, o que me incentivo foi o meu pai que ate hoje ele trabalha na whirlpool.Aprendi muitas coisas boas como se li da com as pessoas enxergar a vida de outra maneira, buscar seus objetivos profissionais e pessoal. Na parte da direção/gerencia tive um problema que elas não dava tanta oportunidade de crescimento, muitas vezes era muito injusto comigo, eu sempre dava o sangue para empresa, demorou para eu atingir um cargo bom, as pessoas que me deram oportunidade eram sempre a gerencia de outra área. Eu sempre tive um ótimo carinho carinho por meus colegas de trabalho,sempre eu tentava ajudar elas em suas funções de trabalho. A parte mais difícil do trabalho são as mudanças da emprensa e li ta com as pessoas , pois são varias diferencias A parte mais agradável do trabalho é você realizar um bom trabalho com a equipe e receber elogio"
good,"Começamos sempre com abertura de PTTs (permissão de trabalho para terceiros) depois existem as obrigações individuais, integrações de terceiros e instirucional, treinamentos diversos, inspeções de segurança (Programa PARE) e outras."

good,"Gran equipo de personas, sin embargo a veces no son muy colaborativos."
good,"Un azienda che sempre mi ha dato l'opportunità di apprendere e crescere come professionista. La parte più sfidante del mio lavoro è la gestione del cosiddetto cultural shift e quindi la gestione di possibili resistente, ma sempre posso contare su un leadership team di grande supporto. La parte più piacevole è senza dubbio il contatto con le persone e la possibilità di contribuire al loro sviluppo."
good,My experience in the call center of Whirlpool was fulfilling in the sense of how flexible the hours were and having the ability to work remotely.  Most management there was readily available and willing to assist anyone ready for the next step regarding advancement and expanding horizons.
good,Whirlpool of India Ltd is a very good company to work with..having better work culture. Salary is not an issue. Good R&D centre. Also cares for employees.
good,I worked here in two stints with the second being more preferable to the first. The first was very stressful as customers were often angry and we were not being helped by the other departments who should habe been. In the second phase this had improved greatly and it was more relaxed
good,"The job itself is very enjoyable, my only problem is the heat in the summer and the management is very hit or miss. Overall a great place to work and great"
good,"Through the years, Whirlpool has been a stable place to work.  There are 2 main career paths: tech ladder or management.  If you wish to move up the tech ladder, there seems to be a limit at Senior Engineer, when you work in manufacturing.  There is little to no opportunity to advance beyond Senior Engineer.  The only true path to move up once at senior engineer is to transition to management."
good,"Great place to work but never see or hear about anyone for promotion. Personally seeking a admin office job instead of forklift driver but if that's what your searching for this, is the best place to work for."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, empresa dinâmica, muito competitiva, excelente escola."
good,Buenas prestaciones tardan un poco para las categorías cuando ya tienes tiempo laborando
good,"The pay and benefits offered were reasonable. Expected overtime was acceptable. Work was steady, with no layoffs. In general, it wasn't a bad place to work."
good,"Everyone tries to work together which is great, but the company tries to put together employee engagement committees to help management become better at their jobs, but they essentially ignore the message delivered from those committees."
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar , VC tem opção de crescer..."
good,I enjoyed the work of assembling the back of refrigerators the short time I was there management trained us well and supervisor was very respectful and helpful when needed very fast pace so I had to kove quick to get the job done and done accurately.
good,"I like my job in the paint department. I also enjoy my coworkers. I dont like working 3rd shift. I would like a first shift position, but have bid several times and still stuck on 3rds"
good,É um ambiente de trabalho dinâmico e desafiador formado em maioria por jovens.
good,"Work days, at least in the work area that I work in are typically slow paced. Some jobs across every assembly line is slow, but a lot of them are very monotonously paced. Most jobs are easy once you get the hang of the place, and the work days aren't too bad. I learnt hard work and new skills of working within a given space, and following standardized work. The management for my area on the line was great, but I've heard different about other places on lines across the factory. Some lines appear to be culturally biased, but most aren't. Hardest part of the jobs are probably the amount of time you have to complete your job, but it gets easier once you get used to it. The most enjoyable part of my job was that it was usually easy to keep up with, and fairly paced, and I loved the people that I work with."
good,Lots of employee turnover and a lack of cohesiveness. Could be better managed to start with top management involvement. Needs a workflow overhaul to improve quality and efficiencies.
good,"Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, mas com muitas mudanças nos últimos anos perdendo um pouco da sua excelência."
good,"Empresa preocupada com os funcionários, marcas fortíssimas e trabalhando num ambiente de grande concorrência nacional e internacional. Boa cultura organizacional, porém vem piorando ao longos dos anos principalmente após os anos de crise 2015-2017."
good,Whirlpool is a great place to work with. Working there for the past 3 years I would defiantly recommend anyone who has only a  high school or GED to work here because there are so many opportunity to move up to a Team Lead to Supervisor to Management.
good,"A typical day at work is challenging."
good,Whirlpool has been consistently rated as a good place to work by those of us in Knoxville and across the corporation. It's also listed in some major websites and/or publications as such.
good,"Very heavy focus on sales and marketing roles, great place to work, although lots of 'old corporate' culture still permeates the organization which can be challenging at times."
good,"Typical day was to make sure parts were in stock for all promotions for Sears and Whirlpool dealers. "
good,"Great company to join as a recent graduate. Good company to join later in career (but limited advancement due to first item). Company has strong preference for young engineers and leaders they can develop, although many will leave."
good,"Average factory job, management was hard to work with at times. All focus was put into production numbers. Not always helpful when it came to employee needs."
good,"A typical work day at Whirlpool is excited. As a product engineer I´m having the opportunity to create new things focusing on how the make the people´s life better!! So, this is very exciting !"
good,Great please to gain customer service experience. You deal with all kind of people on phone. Management could be improved but it has great bonuses. Great team work.

good,"O dia de trabalhor na área administrativa é sempre muito desafiador, pois existem muitas tarefas para uma só pessoa e isso faz com que você se desenvolva constantemente e busque obrigatoriamente novas formas de entregar cada vez mais resultado."
good,"When I was employed by Whirlpool, I started as a temp and worked my way up. If your not afraid of working hard and you want to be treated fairly this is the place to be."
good,"A typical day in this role consists of calling on big box stores like Lowe's, Home Depot, and Best Buy stores. Advancement is encouraged and rotational in nature but is very ""who you know/who likes you"". The job is anything but glamorous and can get very mundane and isolating if you let it. You need to be extremely self motivated. If you really want to stay in the company and work hard in the role, you will likely climb the ladder. The corporate office is in Benton Harbor, MI so most people find this rather unappealing."
good,productive and fun workplace management is ok i guess i just did not like the shifts but overall good opportunity to grow within the company along with good benefits
good,"There is a calculated focus on people development and growth, not only in the space of professional growth, but personal growth as well. There are opportunities to move within the organization every 18 months."
good,Whirlpool is a great place to work for. It is a fast paced environment but they will train you until you are ready to work on your own. You get PTO right off the bat which is nice and the pay was great!
good,Empresa Boa de trabalhar com ascensão na carreira.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,I really enjoyed working for Whirlpool. The pay was very good and you had just about every weekend off. There was room for advancement if you wanted to go the route. you never had to stay in a certain work area (assembly) you could move around to different parts of the plant.
good,I never missed work  but the new  New absence at Whirlpool showed I had one sick day left but I didn't have the hours  I was discharged without a warning I'm now looking for a good company to work for
good,Aprendí y crecí de sobremanera durante los casi 15 años de trabajo en Whirlpool Argentina.

good,"La empresa cuenta con una buena cultura en general que va desde la no discriminación hasta velar por el desarrollo profesional y personal con su gente."
good,Just be on time and do your job and you will have no problem its a fast pace job be ready for that but all in all not a bad place to work most people are nice and easy to work with
good,aprendi a lidar com situações que sempre levarei comigo.
good,"Pros"
good,"A typical day at Whirlpool would start out by going to your work area and having a meeting with you TL (team lead) of your area giving you updates about things going on in and out of Whirlpool, safety tips and anything else they wanted to share. You would go to your station and when the bell rang you started working, rotating every half hour. Some areas are less physical than others. That sums up a work day at Whirlpool."
good,"it was a good place to work, fast paced, days went by fast and i met a lot of cool people while i worked there, also i had most weekends off, overall i had a great experiance ."
good,"Représenter whirlpool via acosta, c'est bien, mais sans plus. Il nous place dans un ou des commerces durant 1 an, tu apprends a connaitre les employés des grandes surfaces, soit il t'aime soit il t'aime pas car tu représente Whirlpool. "
good,Working at Whirlpool was a good experience. Only bad part is it gets REALLY hot in the summer time.  The supervisors and co workers were good people. Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"Exige bastante dedicação (tempo para hora extra). Pessoas sérias, centradas e corretas. Não deixa clara as oportunidades de promoção."
good,"Es una empresa que ofrece buenos salarios iniciales y las operaciones que se realizan no son complelas."
good,Tough fast but easy. Fun employees. Competent management. Room for growth and progression. Excellent hours. Staff helps as much as possible. Good paid time off.
good,"Lots of work to go around, and the hardest workers are always given more. Hard workers can advance there. You're just one more cog in the huge wheel here, so don't expect to be pampered or made to feel you matter, because that's not so much the case. It is always made clear that everyone is replaceable. Good pay, good benefits, job security as long as you don't miss work. Culture here needs work, there is favoritism and nepotism here. Slackers get by here as long as they still show up, so if you are a good worker you will work very hard while other people don't work at all."
good,"comecei como operador de manufatura, apos 30 dias fui transferido para a produção e comecei a operar uma centrifuga de rotor e um ano depois para uma injetora de tampas, fiz todos o cursos requeridos para ser promovido , so que nunca acontecia pois o tp sempre adiava, o unico contra que achei dentro da empresa."
good,Loved to do Retail and Trade Marketing .its my passion to be part of it. Whirlpool has given  me emense opportunity to decide and work for the benefit of Market growth
good,"I worked for this company for 17yrs until I was let go due to reorganization.  During my time there, I learned from some of the best engineers in the appliance industry.  Some had been with the company since the 1950’s and many knew me from childhood.  These are the people that built the company for what it is today and I would enjoy a chance to work for such a great company again."
good,"never knew what department you would be in for that day.  Moving around all the time. "
good,"Empresa multinacional, com politicas bem definidas, certificação ISO, plano de carreira para algumas cargos, avaliação 360°, uma empresa de ponta no seu seguimento. Gerência competente e comprometida."

good,"A truly global organization where we not only talk about how to Win locally but how we can extended our win across region. A typical day includes discuss with Marketing across the global and aligning on global approach while making collaborative business based decision on regional variations. Then evaluation consumer and financial aspect of it and developing product plans and projects."
good,"O serviço e muito repetitivo e o colaborador não é reconhecido, só tem reconhecimento que tem amizades com os chefe"
good,"Nice place to place. I would recommend this company to everyone. The people are very nice. The workplace environment is very nice. The walking path and smoke free environment is excellent,"

good,"a typical day is to check i have the correct stock delivered to carry out my duties, arrive and repair white goods at domestic and commercial premisis.i have learnt how to diagnose and repair. managemeny have always been very helpful when needed. all co workers are willing to assist should any problems arise. hardest part of the job is the amount of time needed outside work sending and recieving parts.most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and being able to first fix their appliances"
good,"There are many opportunities to work in areas that interest the employee.  Great team environment, however management can drive schedules that are difficult to obtain."
good,There was always a clock with number of dryers that have gone threw during your shift and how many they expected to go threw.  It was nice when you were keeping up but when you started falling behind you made more mistakes.  It was all about getting this many dryers to the end of the line without making mistakes.
good,"Gosto muito de trabalhar como Assistente de Crédito e Fraude na Whirlpool, aprendi muito nestes 2 anos e 5 meses,tive oportunidade de aprender ajustes sistêmicos, análise de crédito,fraude,analisar comprovante de pagamento aprender um pouco sobre conciliação de pagamento, a cada dia vejo que aprendo mais."

good,"Whirlpool Mexico had a great working environment, for new professionals was a great way to start a career. The job was challenging to do, in a global environment at the beginning, but was not crucial to deliver results. The coworkers is one of the best assets, and the culture of teamwork. Benefits in the employee store were good, but others, as insurance, took a long time to be available."
good,have not worked there for the past nine years. when I left I had a few issues with some of the management but over all it was a decent place to work.
good,"empresa  que valoriza o funcionário"
good,Interesting place to work with a lot of educational feedback. The company is very interested in helping their employees to grow. You need to be willing to relocate in order to move up the ladder.
good,"Working for this company has been a pleasant experience, I have grown and developed such a strong foundation while working for whirlpool"
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho iniciava com a priorização das diversas atividades  pessoais a serem executadas. Passando por respostas dos emails, comparecimento à reuniões, discussão e definição de problemas técnicos em projetos, acompanhamento de testes em laboratório e na fábrica."

There is room to grow if you are willing to get results and make it known you want a new challenge and can bring value to your desired roles. Midwestern people so the locals are nice and the surrounding area is nice and offers a lot to do all seasons. Overall a good place to work.

good,"Empresa muito dinâmica, onde há muita concorrência entre as pessoas. Lugar bom de trabalhar, crescer, aprender e ganhar dinheiro"
good,"Aprendi muito a trabalhar com pessoas, não gostei da direção e gerência. Ótimos colegas de trabalho, o que tornava agradavel trabalhar."
good,"I enjoyed my job for many years at Whirlpool. I learned how to do almost every job in the plant. Some of the jobs were more demanding than others but we all worked together and made a top quality product.                                                                             I worked with a verity of people that became my good friends and I feel that we did the best job possible for the company. Most the bosses were easy to work for and made my time there enjoyable. "
good,A typical day at work. I would arrive at work about 45 minutes early.To check out my conditions as in if my line is stocked. Or if the shift before me didn't leave me for success. Everyday I would learn something new. New information on my scanner for the parts I brought to the line or how to be more efficient on doing my job faster and safer. My supervisors were always cool and fun to talk to plus the were really helpful. I would say my hardest part of the job was getting my lids to the line in a safe manner. Having enough to complete the order and having my next set of lids ready to go. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was a forklift driver (Jeep driver) and I was able to drive around the plant.
good,It is a fun place to be around. The trainers are really respectful and very helpful. The staff and atmosphere is amazing and promotes confidence among customer representatives.
good,"I'd go in and talk for a little bit before the shift start. Then we would clock in go to our groups and do all our stretches and get told by our team leaders what and how we did the day before. Then we went to work for 2hours and 45 minutes then we had a 10 minute break then we worked for another 2 hours and 15 minutes then we have a 30 minute lunch break. After lunch break we go back in and have another group meeting and they tells us how much we've done before lunch and how we can improve and if there's any changes in the workplace or if anything is going to happen in the future with the company. Also, they tell us if there's another job inside the company that's became available and what we need to apply for it. Then we go back to work for another 2 hours. After that we got a 10 minute break then we go back to work for 3 hours and we clock out and go home after that unless your staying over for overtime. There's six supervisors and one head supervisor. They can't have more than seventy-five people working that exact shift if there's anymore than seventy-five they send one or more people home to make seventy-five.  Learned how to find and put things together in an limited amount of time. Hardest part of the job is when your trying to do someone else's job and you don't know it 100% yet. The best part of the job is when your ahead of everyone else and you have to sit back and wait for the person ahead of you to get done or something breaks then your cleaning until it's fixed."
good,"It is a good company, but with high pressure. You could learn a lot if you want. The management are willing to listen to you. The co-workers are friendly overall. The hardest part of the job is conflict ion between sales and marketing department. The most enjoyable part of the job is incremental marketing skills and knowledge."
good,"It was a good place to work,but it was hard to have the place that you worked for many years close down."
good,"I enjoyed working in Whirlpool, nice company culture, lovely people to work with, nice and helpful atmosphere."

good,"I enjoyed my 10+ years at Whirlpool, it was a rewarding experience.  I worked a 9:30-6 shift, with weekends off.  The Leadership team as a whole is awesome and cares about you, as you advance it seems it does get much more competitive and more all for one attitude instead of what can we do get you advanced.  Which I never could understand.  I fully enjoyed my time at Whirlpool and would recommend anyone give it a try, given the opportunity I would go back, I would just want to have the opportunity to go elsewhere in the company."

Like what part goes where while it comes down the line in a face past. There was some positions that was hard due to lack of Training. They kept me in one spot for a while and then slowly introduce me to other spots on the line and didn't proper train me.

Whirlpool has successfully expanded through acquisitions which has allowed them to be a leader in the industry but has also created many different company cultures as you move from one location to another.  The company owns several brands and is struggling a little to determine how to utilize and capital on them in an effective way without cannibalizing and sacrificing some of them.  The good thing is that they are focused on being an effective appliance manufacturer who is know for being a world leader in the industry.

I want to explore and grow my career, and reach another level of success."
good,"Being at Whirlpool was a good experience that I was able to learn a lot about the product and build on my customer service skills.

Although there have been many changes lately in Marketing department and this makes the decision making process very unstable.

good,"They say you don't leave a bad company, you leave bad managers. There are a lot of people getting away with too much in this company. If you talk to people that work here; they will often say ""What is going on around here?!"" It's crazy that management isn't aware of how their employees are feeling. The way we are rated on our performance is detrimental to the company."

good,"Great company with a lot of diversity. The company offers the best of the best in terms of trainings. The carrer path is basically administrative. The technical expertise is not really appreciated by the higher management. Poor technical decisions leads to poor quality or high cost products. Huge capacity to deliver the best, but low efficiency."
good,Foi uma grande experiência e aprendizado em todo o periodo que estive lá.
good,"once you get use to the daily routine its not too bad your routine varies depending which department and which area you are placed in the main ones that the had when I was there where assembly lines 1-5, fabrication, and finish"

good,"Whirlpool Customer Service Center is a great place to work a temporary amount of time or have a full-time career. The coworkers are generally great people and there is a game room many enjoy. They have catered lunches from different locations throughout the week and also coolers and vending machines with a variety of selections. The opportunity to move up is readily available if you can get certain scores/ratings. They have a special team that only listens to certain screened calls and grade you on your service skills and wording. Very strict policy on schedule times. Overall, great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Whirlpool most of the time. The only thing I did not like is the politics. Unfortunately politics play a huge role in new product development, and some decisions made out of political discussions does not serve the best of the company's interest, nor the team working on the project."
good,The people at this company were the most caring people I've ever had the privilege to work with. Everything at this company was team oriented and without teamwork no work can possibly be done.
good,Un buen lugar para aprender algo relacionado a la carrera universitaria.

good,"-Ho una buona manualita sviluppata negli fabbrica "
good,"More technical training given to update employee skillsets."
good,I only got to work here for over six weeks passed my training the recruiters are friendly and they want to see you succeed. I enjoyed my classes even though they are eight hours long the training of product is well worth it. my only regret is I had to resign my position due to health issues.
good,A Whirlpool oferece um ambiente de trabalho desafiador e com muita interação.
good,Worked there for 18 years.  Good culture.  They took care of their people.  Management was fair.  You received a bonus every year.  Pay was also good.
good,Whirlpool was a good play to work but overall the management that worked there made it a much harder job. if they would have spent a little bit less time treating people poorly and more time focusing on the plant that place would be a 5 star factory.
good,Good Place but the location is not good. Working culture is balanced and a lot depends on your manager. Slow paced work  with lack of innovation and technology focus
good,A typical work day at Whirpool would taking inbound customer related calls regarding service or technical issues. Depending on each call you would disburse of them to the right department.
good,"Start the line pretty much when we get there.  I learned how to be more efficient and more thorough.  I am usually left alone by management cause i don't cause any issues.  Workplace culture is similar to everywhere else, you get along with some people and you don't.  Equipment not working correctly is bad part of job.  * hour days and weekends offf are good parts."
good,"Short handed, wanted a different shift was unable to move to another shift due to no one to take my current position. waited 6 months to move to new bid job. never moved me."
good,"Overall my experience at Whirlpool was good. I learned a great deal of from the job itself and the people I worked with on a daily basis. I believe the hardest part of my job was learning the job and keeping up on the line. The best thing about my job was the considerate people I worked beside, they were always willing to give a helping hand when needed."
good,"Cultura forte, empresa preza pela formação técnica dos seus colaboradores. Excelente lugar para se trabalhar, porém, gera instabilidade aos colaboradores devido a alta rotatividade de funcionários."
good,Pays good but upper management thinks since it looks good on paper that it will work in the factory. Lots of great emplees and most of the line leaders and shift supervisors are great to work with.
good,"trabalhei por 5 anos, tive varias oportunidades de crescimento profissional."
good,"Worked on assembly line doing variety of jobs,you get switched every 30 minutes thru out your shift so you're not constantly doing the same job all nite.Some jobs are fast paced,but the more you do them,the easier they become.Pay and benefits are pretty decent,but whirlpool is some what strict with their attendance policy,you're allowed 5 pto' s per year (late or calling off =1) after that you are fired,also  breaks I thought were short.Not much overtime in plant I worked (clyde,ohio)I would recommend someone going there,plenty of room for advancement,decent co workers as well.Line I was on was pretty laid back,not sure what other lines are like."

good,"Whirlpool is a great place to work, but keep in mind that it's an old, traditional Midwest company. Most of the senior leaders are still white males with stay-at-home wives who tend to be out of touch with the working style and expectations of the upcoming generation (comically, it's very much like our current government). "
good,"A empresa oferece bons benefícios, paga corretamente, oferece ppr.. e obviamente tem que se trabalhar muito. Afinal é produção."
good,"Loved working at whirlpool. Everyone acts like a team and gets everything done. So many different opportunities to move on to.

good,"A good place to work, but like all large factories, there are good people and bad people. Overall, they treated me well over the 38+ years I worked there. The work culture is very competitive and aggressive. Management depends on the person in charge..some are terrible, some are amazing. I was fortunate enough to work for some incredibly talented and caring managers, yet I did work for the occasional jerk as well, so I guess it gave me a balance. They promote from within..they recognize your experience and reward you accordingly."

good,"La parte más difícil es ascender de puesto, me sirvió de mucha experiencia en el área administrativa."
good,I started work at 2:30pm. and worked til 11:15pm. I learned how to make washers for Whirlpool and our other company's. It's amazing to see how a washer is assembled in just a few minutes. Management was great because they where always their to help with our questions and to make sure the product had no flaws. I became very good friends with the employees I worked with in the factory. We did our job and also was able to communicate with one another in case we would need assistance from another employee. The hardest part of the job was when the line broke down or certain sections was shut down due to errors on the line or machine malfunctioned. I loved our finished work product. knowing we made 1600 washers in our shift made us feel great. That was the best part of my job.

Área que eu mais tiro o chapéu é área de manutenção industrial, sempre que uma das linhas de produção tivesse algum problema elétrico ou mecânico, não demorava muito e logo aparecia a manutenção para resolver o problema. Apesar que tem tenho o braço a torce para linhas de produção, tanto na fabrica 2 como na 3, que todos os dias trabalham em harmonia e sintonia para dar o melhor de sim na qualidade do produtos.

I would provide the information and occasionally sell a large or small appliance.

The management was a little disorganized and lacked communication but we were still able to function as a team.

good,"At Whirlpool Corp. I learned so many new skills and could move from department to department to learn what each department was doing and what was available. I found a home in Thermal forming, I loved the work because it was not on an assembly line, the pay was higher, and the work was more technical and interesting. I worked in the plastic liner department from May,1999 to March, 2010. Some days the machines ran great, and my refrigerator liners look wonderful and some days the machines just would'nt co-operate which meant a lot of hard work adjusting heater temps. and cycle times, sometimes I had to call for a electrician or plumber. The second shift supervisors were awesome and my co workers were nice and mostly helpful when inspecting the liners. The employees always celebrated birthdays and holidays, exchanging gifts and well wishes."

good,"Sempre gostei muito da empresa, é claro que tive momentos muito felizes e momentos muito críticos e pude observar que dependia muito da liderança, da forma que eram cobrados os resultados, muitas vezes em situações desagradáveis a chefia absorvia o problema e ajudava, em outros momentos outras chefias na mesma situação derrubava um mundo de críticas e não assumiam suas próprias falhas. "
good,"Em uma empresa onde as pessoas são o fator chave de produção, a comunicação clara, precisa e respeitosa é sem sombra de dúvidas o diferencial para o sucesso."
good,"Sempre corrido, muitas vezes sem tempo pra descanso, alimentação corrida, muitos colega não tem a mesma vontade que você tem de ajudar, os responsáveis muitas vezes não resolviam os problemas. É uma empresa boa pra se trabalhar, com ótimos benefícios, ambiente bom, mas precisa melhorar um pouco mais. Optei por sair, pois estudo no período na manha e a empresa não deu alternativa para  que eu continuasse a exercer minha função."

good,"I enjoyed my employment at Whirlpool. I loved going to work in the morning. Then there was issueu with managment, I held on for 6 monthes, then ended up pointing out. Would I go back, maybe in another department."
good,First off whirlpool as a company is amazing. They want to keep you safe at all times and in great health at all times. There benefits are top notch. You have tons of room to grow and earn a lot of extra money if desired. However I work 3rd shift just doesn't fit into my life being a full time single parent. With 2nd shift being my other option place just doesn't got into my schedule. A lot of personalities there as well to deal with.
good,It was a simple job just got to pay attention to detail. The people were great I loved my job at Whirlpool I just wish management was better I was a great team leader
good,Whirlpool is a good company but the people out on the floor are rude and disrespectful. They don't treat their employees fairly when they say that they do. The management is lazy they're never around when you need them they're always up front sitting at their desks when they should be out on the floor.

good,Ya no quisieron darme más oportunidades económicas realizando actividades de personal con puestos más altos
good,"Whirlpool is one of the most decent places that I have worked. I do not agree with the way Human Resources handles situations. Many of us have turned in a Group Lead for things that she should not have been doing, but since she's been there so long, they let her get away with things. They let their ""favorite"" employees get away with things and they never have to work. They spend their day walking around and socializing with people. Whenever employees have any questions, Human Resources tell us to call a 1-800 phone number instead of answering any of our questions."

If co-workers needed help I would go out of my way to help them as much as they were my family that we all get along fine. Learning a new job any where you are require to do and are not familiar with the job, that's when you have to figure out how to get it done right and in a fast pace with hardly any supervision, once you learn and know the job, you have the ability to come in with no problem and enjoy your work and your co-workers."

A parte mais difícil do trabalho é quando você trabalha com outras culturas como por exemplo com divisão da EECON existente na china. Por se tratar de um povo muito categórico,se faz necessário uma boa escrita do que eles devem fazer quando precisamos deles."
good,"Whirlpool is a well established work place,co-workers always seem to get along.Work was fairly easy,the most enjoyable part of the job was the people who surrounded you in the work place.The hardest part of the job was when their was'nt any material to work with."
good,"É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, acredito que a melhor que já trabalhei até hoje, pois os supervisores são muito educados, sempre prestativos. As oportunidades para quem trabalha na produção são limitadas a crescer profissionalmente."

Lean sigma and Kiazen were very informative...I learned how to make the motor of the diswashers which by the time I left I could do it blind folded...It was really a great place to work for and I miss it. The management was so-so, but overall it was good."

There was no day that I would be dreaded to get up and go to work. It's a pleasant, professional, environment place of employment. Unfortunately, the company have came to an end at Fort Smith, AR, Division and relocated to Mexico. My long term Job at whirlpool corporation as a Tool & Die maker also came to an end on June 29th of the year 2012."
good,"Pros-Good place to work, providing you are prepared to put the effort in Plenty of opportunity for bonuses, these include getting paid for good customer feed back and fitting built in appliances. Good Team to work with both on the road and in the office. There are those drivers who always seem to be moaning, but you get that everywhere. Just get on with your day and do what your paid to do. Money is good for a job driving 7.5t van 45hrs a week earns me about £29k a year. Holidays are 38 days plus every 4th Monday off paid. Good sick pay. Rota is two weekends in two weekends off. My week is five days and my average week is about 47/48 hours. You do some times have to work on your own maybe 50/50 but the company trains you well and provides you with the kit to do this safely. (You do a 5 day induction course and anual refresher training)"

good,"Equipe boa de serviço, com operadores e supervisores ótimos e todo dia um grande aprendizado e produtos feitos com carinho."
good,"Every day is different working in Whirlpool's Supply Chain I must say. Despite having basic and daily duties such as extracting the stock level, reporting the financial amount of your supplier base, ringing/emailing suppliers, etc. you would often come across with issues ranging from sales/demand changes, broken machinery or labor difficulties that would turn your ""planday"" into completely unexpected which drives your work far from monotonous. The collaborative environment provided by the departments interaction was the most important for me when it comes to learning and becoming a solid professional, as I could not only get to see my area's perspective of the business but also all the others."
good,"Quand on travailles dans cette compagnie, on fini par apprendre à vendent n’importe quoi. "
good,"The management at Whirlpool really care, since they started answering the phones just like you might be doing to start with as well. Stick with it and you'll have a great career with plenty of advancement opportunities."

good,"É uma grande empresa , muito boa para se trabalhar , com bons benefícios e grandes chances de crescimento."
good,It's good place to work and make money whirlpool company also has good benefits for health and retirement.  Whirlpool is a place you can learn lot. It's a work no tolerance for mistakes because of quality of the products the company is making. Personally I can't judge that because the marketing is competitive whirlpool is not the only company.
good,"You start as a contractor through Randstad and the conversion process can be a bit long (mine was 15 months), but as long as you meet your metrics and show up you have a fair shot. The atmosphere is engaging. There's never a dull moment. The days always go by quickly because you pretty much stay busy, and the work will make you have to really think, but it's never anything I lose sleep over. Whirlpool is diverse; they have the Pride network for the LGBT+ group, Women's network, and the African American network (FOCUS). No one feels discriminated and it's welcoming. The dress code is also really relaxed. We are allowed to wear jeans and t shirts (given they are appropriate and not full of holes), color our hair, and have exposed tattoos/body piercings. They really go out of their way to keep their employees happy."
good,I liked working at the customer service department in Whirlpool because it was clean and well maintained. The problem I had working for this company is that I had family issues that could not be aligned with the working hours

good,"A melhor empresa na qual já trabalhei. Grandes oportunidade de crescimento, de desenvolvimento e de desafios."
good,"I worked so many jobs at Whirlpool. I felt the more I knew the better it would be for me there for going to one department to another.

If a certain job is difficult for someone they will keep looking for a position that is a fit for you. the company is very concerned about its employees health and has many incentives to be healthy. I enjoy my job very much.The only negative I could say about Whirlpool is some of the employees need to learn how to just go with the flow and not be difficult to get along with. But that has nothing to do with the company."
good,I have enjoyed & gained every single day in my current organisation. Work culture is very supporting and politics free. selfless approach prevails. Positive work environment is provided to the employee so that they can give their best.

good,I was a trainer in chassis on the assembly line. I got a promotion to move in the back to drive a forklift and handle all the materials that we received.

good,"Over all Whirlpool is a great place to work,there are a lot of fun loving people that work for whirlpool and you learn a lot from the folks with 30+ years on the job. The hardest part of the day is when the first couple of hours before first break, because it seams like time drags along slow. But after first break you feel re energized. The most enjoyable part of the day is shift change when i get to go home."
good,I was able to learn what ever I wanted all I had to do was ask and my co workers were happy to share there knowledge. The hardest part of the job was when we were short on people and they wanted the same numbers and some of the co workers I had didn't care to put the extra work in. I loved that I could get all the overtime I wanted.

Typical day at work involves going in, taking calls, two 15 min breaks and a lunch, little supervision (however, they will notice when you've been in a inactive stage for long periods), and the day is over. Open from 8-8pm. You work very fast and have great attendance, you will get priority scheduling, where you determine your own schedule. I preferred working at night because there aren't many people there at that time and it's a bit quieter. Hardest part of the job is the crammed training (which really isn't hard) and most enjoyable part are the people you work with. Everyone is very loving and awesome, including management."

good,Dynamic and forward thinking company that allows all ages and ethnicity to succeed.  A place that feels like home and management knows who you are and they are not afraid to promote women.
good,"Whirlpool is clean and organized. There is opportunities to move up and advance. The jobs are pretty easy like plugging in wires and shooting screws. The only thing bad is their point system. If you're late, it counts a whole day against you so you might as well take the whole day off. Their Human Resource is basically nonexistent. If we have issues, we have to call a number instead of actually speaking to someone in HR. If we have FMLA, we have to deal with Matrix. Matrix is horrible with their communication. I wish Whirlpool would hire a different company to deal with FMLA because Matrix is difficult to deal with."

I dressed professionally everyday, smiled  and encourage my colleagues and customers. Not to mention people who ranked higher than me I also gave them encouragement. I went beyond what was expected of me. Now to me I would just say it can't get any better than that. I was equipped because I took the time to learn on my own. I wasn't trained to be successful I was trained to get by, but I wanted more and i wanted to know more so that I could prepare others in case I would have gotten a lead position to be successful too. Also, I went to work when I was scheduled and was on time everyday, except for when I became ill."
