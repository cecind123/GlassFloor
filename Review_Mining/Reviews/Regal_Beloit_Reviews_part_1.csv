bad,Te contratan como técnico y solo te traen limpiando las máquinas todas las fallas las hacen los proveedores los supervisores no cuentan con la destreza para solucionar fallas y menos para darte un alluda la verdad no recomiendo estar hay aunque uno traiga las ganas de reparar y sepa cómo reparar las fallas no te dejan hacelo y tú opinión no se toma en cuenta
bad,Never cared about the people and never will thank they can do what ever when ever and never fixing a problem when I was there some people of management just wanted parts out and to lazy to lend a hand if they wanted something done always breathing down your neck and if you did make that one extra motor they wanted even when the order was full and about to walkout the door
bad,I really didn't like working for this company. Management was awful. They was totally against their employees. Only thing backing employees was the union and they couldn't do much.
bad,"Very low moral at this place due to favoritism for a very small circle of people that run that place. You will be yelled at, harassed, and bullied by  co-workers, until you stand up for yourself then they will write you up. If you work on 2nd or 3rd shift it's a better environment (until day shift comes in), without the hostility, better supervisors.  But First shift will have you very angry, and stressed. And to a point of losing your job everyday because of so much conflict, and unnecessary nonsense, the favoritism is so out of control, that people get these few to put in good words for them in order to get promoted, they befriend the few to stay safe from being bullied by the day shift supervisor."
bad,"Will never get the chance to advance there, managers are bias the leads are useless on training. Only good are some few employees who are cool but even though the location is great this company is falling apart."
bad,Learned how to assemble different types of motors. Learned how to spray paint with a spray gun. Worked at a steady pace to produce valuable products. Productive environment to work.
bad,"very hot place to work, safety features very old and not reliable. managment always hires their friend instead of workers that want to move up very unfair"
bad,Worked hard everyday even worked overtime any time they needed me I was there worked there for a year they said I was a good hard worker and I even got a pay raise up until I got really bad sick I went to work with 102 fever I tried my hardest to work through my illness until it became to much and I passed out. So I had to get rushed to the emergency room and the doctor wrote a note saying I had to be excused for another day. I came back to work on monday and they told me that the hospital note doesnt help anything and they said they had to let me go. So I got fired because I had gotten really sick even though I tried and my work ethic for that year was good. They even said once you get healthier you can reapply. Just a bunch of BS!! I have a family that I take care of so if your a family person do not work at regal beloit you can dedicate yourself work hard but any mess up can get you fired they have no loyalty
bad,there was to  much to do and not enough time every thing had to be done yesterday was not a safe place to work every day i thought that i might get hurt
bad,Management is out of touch. The pay is ridiculously low. No opportunity for advancement. No support. Co workers are great. Place is old and outdated. Computers are old and outdated. Management treats you like dirt and constantly lies. They promise the moon and more and never deliver.
bad,They do not care about their employees. Poor training and poor management. Will fire anyone for the most ridiculous reasons. Very few if any resources to perform job correctly
bad,"This is absolutely the worst company in all my experience that I've worked for. The emoloyees are cutthroat to get advanced. Management only wants to push orders and could careless about anyone else. Coworkers rat or make up lies to get others fired. Absolutely would not reccomend any Veteran to work here. If you have disabilities like myself, this company will not accommodate for you. A man recently died in the factory because of their harsh and hostile work environment."
bad,"A typical work day is very challenging due to an aging workforce and machinery that rarely stays up and running. What I have learned from my day to day routine is how to plan for events that have not happened so when an issue comes up, you are ready for it and you can keep moving with out much lost time. Even though the work force is aging, the workers are the best part of the job. Utilizing an individuals experience and growing from there knowledge is exciting. The most difficult part of the work day is not knowing if there will be coverage or parts to keep the machinery running and always feeling that you are in a claw back mode."
bad,"Took incoming Sales orders"
bad,"Management and HR is the biggest issue at the Lincoln, MO plant.  Management and HR displays favoritism towards a select few in the plant.  You will never see a raise nor promotion unless you're buddies with the production manager or HR.  Write ups are issued in an unfair manor.  Again if you're buddies with the production manager and HR you can get away with just about anything including quitting 15 min before the end of your shift and walking to another department closer to the timeclock and visiting until it's time to leave while if it were someone else they'd be written up.  You tell management and HR about issues and they don't investigate the issues.  Issues get swept under the rug when it involves one of their ""favorites""."
bad,Senior leadership took care of the people from GE.  Company just reorganized a lot of these people out of the business because they did not make any adjustments to the strategy.  The new leadership is making the right moves.  Hopefully there is time to save the organizaiton.
bad,"Great job of you want no life,  no management support,  or anything else. If you have personal things to take care of and need to use vacation they will fight you for it."
bad,"This is NOT a good place to work. You will not be paid well. management knows nothing about machining. you will not be trained properly, so you will not advance. African Americans; here is where you will be discriminated."
bad,"Company doesn't want to change their archaic leadership principles.  Company profit far out weighs the value placed on their employees.  It feels like they are continually looking for reasons to cut headcount..."
bad,"Horrible place to work in Union Grove WI. All sides of Managment including HR are unprofessional, don’t do any work, and don’t take care of any problems. Everyone in the office areas are constantly gossiping even right in front of you. Office areas are VERY noisy, Orders for customers are ALWAYS late and never on time. Some of the warehouse management is also very unprofessional and the way the whole company runs there in Union grove is just very not put together and always struggling just to get parts made and sent out. Even small parts are back ordered for months. The  women in the office are extremely rude and are constantly talking about each other like teenagers. The office manager allows all the caddy-ness to go on and actually is the main sorce of the gossip. The job itself is great but the people there make it unbearable and extremely unprofessional. The place could do way better if they just got some new people in charge. The company is located in a small town and people act like they are in the twilight zone. Definitely wouldn’t recommend working there and I believe if the owners knew what was going on with all sides of management everyone would be replaced as they should be."
bad,"Management is incredibly poor, there is almost a predetermined path for some of you're willing to be a yes man. Hourly workers are treated like scum at times. Healthcare is absolutely awful."
bad,"stressful day due to favoritism, poor management, and work culture is totalitarian and much like Mexico, management has no integrity nor is ethical, management team is not qualified to be in those positions, illegal activity going on and management covers their eyes"
bad,"The supervisor informed us that 300 people had been fired from this warehouse in the past 6 months. "
bad,"Poor training, negitivity hangs heavy, safty hazards and standards are scary at best, lack of comunication is terrible.  First aid attendents are scarce"
bad,Stressful place. Management is poor and don't care about their employees. Leads don't discipline like they should. Favoritism  runs high. If your liked alot u getaway with alot. Co-workers are disrespectful and there is basically no team work.
bad,Need to have sick days. U need to have a quality checks on machines and have more time to spend with family they need to be flexible with their workers
bad,company culture of get things done so the BOD's are happy and wall street rates us favorably and stock price doesn't suffer. Work-life balance was also a challenge
bad,Do not like the work ethics too many hours a week no family time very stressful and chaotic work place too many chiefs not enough Indians  all about motors in the box not about fixing the problems so motors can go in a box
bad,"Get used to working 6 day weeks and not being able to plan anything for the weekends, HR lies to new people to get them to take the job, the job itself becomes more stressful as the days go by, the open door policy is non existent and for what you have to do in a factory their pay is far below average"
bad,the company really doesn't care about its employees.the pay is average. they will terminate your employment it seems like for no reason and tell you that they eliminated your job position.
bad,Favortism is ridiculous. Promotions are not handled fairly.  You won't move up unless you're buddies with management.  Upper management  has no clue what's going on out on the floor.  When management finally decides to come out on the floor they are grasping for straws.  The plant manager is a very negative person.  He cannot praise good hard work without pointing out the negative.
bad,They would train u one way then they would want u to learn another. The people were good to work with but the changes were horrible. They move people around to much they pretty much throw u to the wolves and expect u to know everything.
bad,The people (Senior Manager and below) I worked with at the company were nice. The entire IT staff was either from India on an H1B or an L1. They rotated L1s in and out of the country every 6 months and kept them in India at their Indian center so in practice the L1s were just a cover. The Indian people were great to work with but it is discouraging when on a project of nearly 30 people I was basically the only American. The CIO tried to strong arm me into taking a rate cut on a signed contract 2 weeks before Christmas holiday. Pretty low down. The 2 or 3 really talented people they had were stuck working 60-80 hours on multiple projects in fear of losing the Visa. When people had a chance to bolt to another company they did - as the technical lead did and he was average at best (making a 40K bump at a consulting company). This usually occurred after getting H1B status. So they don't pay real well comparatively and they rarely hire Americans in IT.
bad,"Management team fair, flexible, clean shop.  Machines are new.  Bathrooms are clean, and lunch rooms were clean and tidy.  Nice parking area.  HR was available"
bad,I went there never doing anything in engineering and had to teach myself android and IoT 100% on my own they never had anyone in software engineering and would just refer me to IT. Wasn't great. The people were very nice and I loved the management just not something I could see myself doing long term.
bad,"As Quality Manager for Regal Beloit, I spent that days improving our quality system and working with cross functional teams to establish effective and permanent corrective actions."
bad,if you arent related they dont `care about you. i had the highest percentage for the enitre time i worked there. but since i was disliked cause i wasnt known. i was laid off
bad,Regal Beloit is a growing global company that values it's people. Regal continues to acquire companies and integrate them into their culture. I have worked at the company for over 20 years and it continues to be a good place to work.
bad,"My day started out at 6:00 in the morning. Came in and checked out paper work to see what machines I needed to set up. Set up machines and ran production as needed. Learned  to  read paper work and set up machines for production. Learned to use and read dial settings and read calipers. Had a good supervisor and was there to answer questions to help out as needed. Had the best co-workers you could ever ask for, we were more like family. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge and the people. The hardest part of the job was watching them take out machine after machine and moving them to Mexico, watching friend after friend getting laid off and losing there job."
bad,"Poor management and knee jerk planning.  NO communication, no teamwork, poor job culture.  No filing system in place, cant find anything.  No SharePoint,  absolutely no training.  Good old boy KY mentality is very evident.  Horrible cafe food like Speedway"
bad,"Would look some where else unless you have no other choice.Culture is extremely negative, boring job. Hard for someone who isn't a machinist with a lot of negative reinforcement, boring for someone who is a machinist. Environment is not conducive to learning."
bad,I was a temporary worker at Regal the job did not last but one month the employees there were very hostile towards replacement employees. I am glad the job did not last long there was a lot of tension in the air
bad,"Regal Beloit is now closed, which is why I left there. I knew that they were starting the process of closing the doors on the factory and started looking for other work before I placed my family in danger."
bad,Terrible management its like working in a high school a lot of things go on that should not and the management does nothing they don't follow company policy properly either.
bad,"Demasiadas juntas y poco tiempo para enfocarse en lo realmente importante, falta de objetivos claros y evaluaciones poco claras."
bad,Set up and programmed cnc lathes for operations. Made own offsets and learned how to edit programms.
bad,Typical day was answering the phones and then either getting spoken to unprofessionally about motors not shipping out and trying to talk to the warehouse workers to see where the motors are at in the building process.
good,"Tiene muchas operaciones en las cuales, como trabajadores podemos desempeñarnos."
good,"Not a good place to work for.  Management is vindictive and there is a culture of favoritism.  I learned to not to trust management. "
good,"my days went by pretty fast until work got slow"
good,"Regal is ok but not great. Lunch is 20 minutes and you get 1 break that is 10 minutes. Only 5 vacation days once you're fulltime, no sick days and the health insurance is not great."
good,"El desarrollo de siertas actividades se realiza sin mucha seguridad, para el operador, así como también para el técnico. También se puede apreciar la falta de procesos ingenieriles para el desarrollo de actividades."
good,Una empresa buena para iniciar y tomar experiencia después de egresar de la licenciatura
good,Buena empresa para aprender en las diferentes áreas de trabajo.
good,You will get the hours you want  sometimes to make up for the pay..The work gets extremely monotonous after about month working there.If you have a good team and supervisor then in and out be alot more bearable.
good,"Working at Regal was ok but, Management outside the plant was very poor.  From the day our plant was acquired by Regal Beloit they lowered the quality of our motors we were manufacturing."
good,"Tiene muchas desventajas, no hay un salario digno,no hay crecimiento laboral y no toman en cuenta las ideas"
good,"Regal Beloit is a good place to work. All employees work well together. Management is striving to improve the quality of worklife. However, there is still too much ""micromanagement"" in some functions."
good,Overall my coworkers mad the job fun. Although worked many long hours up to 15 hours a day at times and sacrificed family time when I was a team leader after being a painter I know I made a differences to serve our customers
good,"We have recently gone through an acquisition by Regal Beloit purchasing our Business unit away from our previous ownership.  The job environment is pleasant however due to loss in market sales for the Oil and Gas industry, jobs have become a bit more stressful and fears of job security have become more realized.  Compensation is low when compared with market data, and room for advancement is minimal.  Work force is pleasant and we have monthly luncheons as a business unit, celebrate families, and enjoy working together."
good,Warehouse and machine shop. Employees are pretty accepting of one another. Daily work does not vary by much. Safe work environment with some heavy lifting.
good,"Overall, the experience was beneficial and if anything, it taught me how to do things the right way.. The company has some areas where a different approach is necessary"
good,To much mandatory overtime and would also make you work some of the holidays...Ok place to work if you like to work everyday...cant much plan a life though.
good,Es buena empresa pero no te dejan desempeñarte y aprender lo necesario.
good,This was a very laid back easy position. Overtime was available at times as a voluntary option. This is a typical production position operating a machine.
good,worked as team to complete the product needed.  The people I worked with were good friends.  The benefits were good short drive to work.  Location changed 3 times well employeed
good,"A Regal Beloit recentemente adquiriu a Divisão PTS da Emerson Electric, adicionando ao Grupo 8 grandes produtos/marcas, dentre essas a divisão System Plast, que produz Esteiras, Correntes e Componentes para o Mercado de Bebidas, Alimentos, Químicos, entre outros."
good,"good place to work, i really enjoyed learning how to run the machine i am currently running. co workers are very easy to get along with!"
good,A lot of stress to work there didn't how long it was to last. They told us they were closing ! so everyone got worrid
good,This was a new company which just started about a year ago and everything was still basically in the first stage and still finding out what all was needed. Some production was been made and I basic made details for the dies that was in house or details for the presses.
good,Leads out on the floor were lacking in ppl skills. Company offered many types of work. Loved the job I did before I went to semi-retirement. Was not flexible with hrs. would tell us on Thurs. we had to work Sat. mandatory.
good,"A great fast paced working environment."
good,Working at Regal is fast pace.. I have learned a lot about factory work. I work on an assembly line and can work from one end to the other. Coworkers and I work very well together as a team to get our required numbers out for our shift.
good,I learned what goes into making a bearing. People were friendly and helpful. One con is jobs were awarded by time worked not by experience. Very secure work place.
good,buen trabajo lo unico que no me gusto fue su orario de noche y obligar a trabajar tiempo extra al personal
good,"-Día típico en el trabajo: "
good,"Desarrollo de los cambios de ingeniería, comprensión del proceso."
good,"I have worked for regal for 16 yrs  during that time the warehouse had changed hands 3 times  magnetic, a.o.smith, and regal  during that time I completed all jobs assigned during stressful changes."
good,Fast pace environment. A collaborating environment. Management is wonderful. Its not a stressful environment. Lunch breaks are short but you receive multiple ones.
good,Compañía a nivel mundial pero Jefe no preparado para ambiente multicultural
good,They pay very well for the little to nothing that you do. The managers are extremely under qualified they will literally let you be a manager if you work there long enough. They let a guy be a supervisor just because he worked there for 13 years. he cant even use a computer this guy is dumb.
good,good company. great people and excellent culture. Highly recommend this place to everyone. good company. great benefits and wonderful atmosphere. Work ethic.
good,My job was pretty awesome I enjoyed it and the new things that were learned. the robot welder was hard to learn but I did conquer it that was a great feeling. Once job was caught up I helped out in four different departments which made everyday interesting and fun.
good,Regal is a fast paced bearing assembly facility. The workforce and management of Regal is excellent. It is a excellent place to work and there is much opportunity to advance within the company.
good,was good place to work until poor management has sent the best jobs to mexico and other overseas locations.Poor and uncaring office and human resources personnel have contributed to the downfall.
good,If I did not have an situation with my wife I would still be working for Regal - Beloit Corporation and handling all their payroll duties. I really appreciated the opportunity to learn about corporate acquisitions.
good,"Worked for Regal Beloit Power Transmission Systems in Florence through a temp agency. When I first started they were saying there was a possibility to become full time. After a couple weeks of trying to get access to the system, I was informed that after they were done testing their new system I would be let go. I guess that's what happens with temp agencies but really liked the people there."
good,"Strong global company."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits."
good,es una empresa muy buena con excelente ambiente laboral
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent salary, schedules."
good,Buen lugar de trabajo con los cunplimientos de seguridad adecuados
good,"A company that gas grown by acquisition , it faces significant challenges in integrating the many businesses it purchased throughout the world.  The company puts great emphasis on ethical behavior and Lean/6 Sigma practices."
good,Regal has many choices that you are able to advance your career in and out of the company. The hourly pay is well for all employees. The over time that is aloud is very open to the employees
good,Company changed fast and applied the new IT technology in time and used this IT to consolidate the business to improve efficiency. I learn a lot from my 5 years experience there.
good,Empresa con ya bastantes años de establecida en la ciudad (+30). Trabajo estable aunque no hay muchas promociones y los beneficios/salarios están por debajo del mercado.
good,"All I can say it was a pretty good place to work, good people.Good environment. Kept things safe."
good,"This company is on an average good but employee pressure is a bit more than other organizations in the market. Other biggest this is that most of the employees are very old (Senior) as they are working since more than 8 to 10 years, so opportunities for new joiners would be less."
good,Falta de organizacion entre departamentos. Buenas prestaciones.
good,Es buen empresa tiene muchas actividades como semana de la salud y otras cosas
good,Paid well and good benefits. Most of the management didnt really know manufacturing. Spent money on painting the floors and not on machine upkeep.
good,is a really good place to work It has taught me a lot for future work areas and the work area is good. One has a good time while working with others.
good,"Es una empresa muy dinámica en la que aprendes y desarrollas muchas habilidades y herramientas, la vida es muy rápida ahí todo es tan rápido y estresante que te hace ser una persona mas eficaz y eficiente"
good,"Tuve la oportunidad de desarrollar muchos proyectos,"
good,"Es una empresa grande con objetivos muy claros en el mercado, pero con muy pocas oportunidades de crecimiento laboral, con un excelente ambiente de trabajo y estabilidad laboral"
good,"You can shoot basketball play pin pong or fooz ball during breaks or lunch,. Also have a weight room to use on off time."
good,"I worked in the office and the environment was very laid back. Unfortunately the different departments didn't talk to each other. This made your job more difficult because one department would get new information about what you are working on and not tell your department, so you end up changing things after you thought you were done."
good,"I enjoy my job and most of the people I work with.  I feel management tries to shake things up, but loses focus after a while.  Overall I would recommend this place of employment to others.  The grass is not always greener on the other side."
good,"Great pay for the job, company is moving in a negative direction under new management I believe. Create new rules that costs the company money that are not needed, such as wearing safety glasses when just walking around the floor."
good,"My day starts with proactive planning for the goals defined by the Global SQD director."
good,"Most of the people were good people to work with.  Company was a bit tight on their budget."
good,es una empresa buena pero no tiene muchas areas de oportunida para crecimiento s
good,"Like most manufacturing jobs, Regal was a high stress job because of quotas having to be met and orders to be filled. Good days and bad days can be determined by whether or not there are mechanical failures. Obviously this affects production and can put us behind and cause backlog to occur. Also, parts that require more attention than most can slow production as well. Many times parts have a lot of flash on them that needs to come off so we have to take the time to extract it.   When none of this occurs, the chances of having a decent day are good.   A lot of good co-workers and some good supervisors to work for."
good,"I tried to be a very positive person while working at Regal with fellow employees and management. on third shift I had job duties of supervising all employees on third shift while maintaining my maintenance duties. I know all the employees on third liked the positive atmosphere that I showed them. like I would say I appreciated everything they did as far as putting out good parts off there machine and having a positive attitude and they responded very good to that... In maintenance every day your learning something new.Supervising employees on third I was constantly learning how to deal with different personalities with other employees and adjusting how I interacted with each one. I worked very close with management when I reported to first shift on any problems with breakdowns, employee situations, safety concernsThe hardest part of the job would be having a lot of machines go down and have someone crash a machine,The most enjoyable part of the job would be having 3 to 4 machines go down in one night and having all back up and running before my shift ended."
good,"For the most part, my time at Regal was enjoyable. I got hired on shortly before they bought the company which was formerly Emerson."
good,"Can not give an example of a typical day, priorities change by the hour so it is tough to finish anything.  Tough to get shop employees to stay because the insurance is very high and low starting pay for new hires and very little vacation."
good,"al inicio de turno,esta el programa de producción y pedías el material,(dependiendo de la operación en que estabas) en ocasiones había presión respecto ala producción (no muy seguido)."
good,"Es un lugar con un buen ambiente de trabajo, me llevaba muy bien con mis companieros, me gustaba estar rodeada de personas inteligentes. La parte dificil de ese tiempo fue tomar la descion de renunciar a pesar de tener un trabajo temporal, cavia la oportunidad de renovarme el contrato, yo busco algo estable, no se dio esa oprtunidad y estoy en busca de otra, por supuesto que disfrute muchisimo en esa empresa ya que aporte mucho de mi, y al mismo tiempo aprendi cosas nuevas."
good,"The days of work at Regal were usually busy; people can work at their own pace and as much as you wanted (ot), most the time everybody got along well, employees help eachother and share responsabilities over work and always got the job done. Although sometimes management made us feel unaprecciated, there was always a sence of comradery among the employees. The hardest part of the job was lifting sometimes up to 180 lbs. by ourselfs; but most enjoyable was the people can always count with a friendly face there. I learned the we can come from different places and backgrounds, but willingly people can really make a family at work."
good,Existe el respeto a los empleados y buen ambiente laboral.
good,"muy buena empresa en cuestión administrativo y organización, la empresa es muy limpia y ambiente de respeto."
good,"Relaxed environment and from your lead to your supervisor, they leave you alone. However they will tell you one thing about the pay when you are hired and a couple months later you find out the truth. The union at their Wausau plant is absolutely horrible, they watch the companies back more than they help the union members. FYI, welding is not a skilled trade here, only maintenance is."
good,"Always a pleasure going into work every day"
good,The management is approachable if you see them on the floor the will say hi and call you by name and if you have a question or concern you can voice it. The best part of the job is the people it's like a family there. I have learned a lot there I have learn that lots of different things can contribute to one thing that is wrong
good,"This is a great place to work at, loved the atmosphere and the people.  Management is great, definite sense of family.  I loved what working there and would recommend it to anyone."
good,"The workplace was usually very hot but still maintained a vibrant atmosphere, The days usually went by relatively fast and were fill with new learning experiences. The management was good however the didn't seem to care to much for there employees opinions, The coworkers were all lighthearted usually unless under a lot of stress. The hardest part of the Job was finding something to do once we had finished with our assigned tasks. However the best part was probably on days where we got to choose what we did."
good,my typical day at work was to show up on time work with consistency. I learned to be accurate the management was friendly and fair the coworker were nice and did'nt mind helping out if needed there was not really a hard part of the job and the most enjoyable part was lunch time
good,"It is a good place to work, the work is mostly waiting on the machine to finish the cycle. you must be able to wrap your head around .001 of an inch and understand how small of a measurement you are working with."
good,Regal is a good company to work for. Regal provides a good work environment and clean facility. Management is very helpful and the benefits are comparable to that of other companies in the area.
good,Everything was good until I got out back into first shift. The lead man wasn’t a lead man and always acted like you didn’t know anything and pretty much though you were worthless the entire time.
good,"Atención al personal,agendar citas al IMSS para empleados, recorrido de la Comisión de Seguridad e Higiene."
good,"The management was very lenient and easy to get along with. The environment was very relaxed, Great co-workers. A typical day at work could be productive and fun as well."
good,"Emerson that I worked for previously had better benefits and salary increases and 401K contributions were in stock not cash."
good,this company cares about their employees. management takes interest in what you are looking for like advancement in the company. they will also give you tuition reimbursement.
good,"As a TC Analyst, I was able to update procedures to standardize Supply chain security requirements and improve efficiency throughout the organization.  Conducted training as necessary to several department to ensure understanding of supply chain security"
good,"ser puntual es básico, llegar todos los días a tiempo y cumplir con los objetivos de la empresa a diario ademas de colaborar en equipo para engrandecer el producto y la mejora de la empresa día a día."
good,"Horarios flexibles"
good,This company is like a dream job of all person helper to management all are enjoying this company when you come in company you feel freely friendly environment and don't want to go home anytime it's really good company
good,I was working as design engineer at Regal Beloit for 5 years and I feel very secured and nice working place and I got the opportunity to learn a lot.
good,paid for management classes to further my advancement. hours were good staff was easy to work with open door policy
good,Great International business.  Career options in abundance if you are ready to relocate.
good,I liked working for this company but got laid off because they lost some business.
good,a typical day starts with downloading work orders off computer separating them by departments and by priority. From there I go to the warehouse and begin by pulling motors off our  racking system. After that I stage motors  by departments and by the priority in which they need to be delivered. In general my coworkers seem to work well together as a team. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is trying to find  space in our small warehouse to store our vast inventory. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is at the end of the day  after what seemed to be in impossible task. Everything seems to comes together. Example motors are delivered trucks are loaded  with the proper items and documentation and sent on their way.
good,I was able to advance in pay the more I learned new jobs. Started in the tool room an work up in to management as a engineer tech. I develope motor line that help assemble blowers for furnaces
good,"Formas de crecer en él ámbito laboral, pero no para todas las personas."
good,"I would come to work before I was required to communicate with third shift employees. I would stay later than required to do the same with second shift employees."
good,"I leraned alot of knowledge, I like the challange that I have to keep 3-4 lines going ( it gets hectic at times) time goes fast, help pick orders when I do not have anything going on as well as help spiddering ( grease endbells ect)."
good,"For the office staff everyone receives training and many many areas. Company is very big on integrity, safety, and making it a decent place to work. In fact there's almost too much training, about the company itself, so you barely have time to learn your eventual job, because of all the training time involved."
good,"managment 50 people an three differents areas, Stamping, Rotor die casting and ens shields aluminun casting mantain production line running according wit the schedule, coordinate activities with quelity and maintenance departments fill all production reports, etc."
good,Regal is a good place to work it benefits are good.ive been with this company for 15 years i like my job im just in search of a different job for a change.
good,"Muy buena empresa pero estrictos a que fueras en tu día de descanso que es domingo, mucho trabajo tiempo extra y categorías buenas prestaciones etc."
good,"En ocaciones llegue a hacer tres operaciones al mismo tiempo por falta de organización por parte del jefe de grupo o falta de personal, jefe de grupo despota, hipócrita, mentiroso y consiente a ciertas personas. Excelente supervisor, si regreso es por el, siempre se porto súper amable, se preocupa por todos sus empleados, excepto que no le sube el sueldo a personas que realmente lo merecen, pero fuera de ahí todo muy bien!"
good,The company has growth thru acquisitions and always challenge to drive productivity. Through my years I was involved in systems migrations and plant rationalizations.
