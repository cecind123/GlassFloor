rating,review
bad,"This was supposed to be a step towards building my career. Unfortunately, the management staff does not know how to manage or engage their employees. They do now know how to hire or place the right Sr's or leads in the appropriate roles. The leads are equally if not more demanding and volatile then the managers themselves. The Sr accountant I reported to berated everyone below her pay grade. The managers did nothing to correct her arrogant, berating behavior. Several staff accountants have left prior to me starting, which I left within 8 months of starting due to the poor management of the team. It was a very volatile and hostile work place.  The work hours would be tolerable if management was not so incompetent. During Year end the average was 70 hours per week. During month end 50 to 60 hours per week. Even if you put in your time, and work hard to meet your expectations, that is still not good enough. You will still get a lousy review and a terrible bonus for your hard work. Enjoy your time at Exelon."
bad,"Very process oriented culture; Very hierarchical organization that  was culture change while I was there. As a major company in the energy sector, there are many opportunities"
bad,I would have never started here if I knew that it would take so much away from my life. This is a money making endeavor only. They treat people like trash and allow their supervisors to get away with murder..
bad,Exelon promotes people to positions which they are not qualified for  -- rather the promotion is based on how many years that person has worked at Exelon. This creates a terrible work culture
bad,"Just a short contract job-- thankfully. I was hired to fill in for another contract worker. She had met ComEd's limit of 2 years per contract. She then had to take a personality test to determine if she fit with ComEd culture. She fit fine because her submissiveness, lack of self-trust, below par skills, and willingness to play secretary kept the immediate supervisor's ego in check as superior. Another supervisor complains that previous employer was better (after 3 years at ComEd) and that ComEd doesn't do anything right with technology or procedures yet he's first to complain if any improvement processes are initiated."
bad,"The mere size and organizational structure will take a long time to get used to. Your job is very tedious that your brain becomes dumb down and logic goes out the door. It would be very difficult to transfer your skills when you try to change jobs outside the company or to another position within. New ideas of streamlining the processes are frowned upon. Management claims to value creativity, which is a lie. NOT a good place for young people."
bad,"I loved working at Exelon.  The people were wonderful and I was given many opportunities to advance."
bad,they suck to work for worst job i ever had do everything in their power to hold you back
bad,"I left a very stable federal contract contract position, renewed 3 times to advance my career as an Application Architect Excelon but never performed that duty. I was just another Sr. Programmer developing mostly APIs"
bad,Typically hire from referrals or external. Rare occasions will you have opportunity for advancement no matter how hard you work...................................
bad,"Nuclear unit is not a great place to be.  Functions are being removed from the nuclear sites; however, the corporate support isn't adequate to replace the personnel being removed for consolidation at the corporate level.  Often asked to do far more work with less personnel and resources.  Culture is not one that makes people excited to come to work each day."
bad,Work-life balance is non-existent. OT is shoved down your throat every 7-day break. No room at all for advancement. It’s never enough for management no matter how much you work. They do not care at all about your family life or other commitments and responsibilities you may have as a working adult. It’s all about what can you do for the company.
bad,I would not recommend working here.  The cultural has drastically changed and it is not one HR.  You can be a valued partner and work hard but not be rewarded only supported if you have an executive that vouches for you.
bad,"It is a call center, where everyone has certain schedules to adhere to.  You could not pay me to work here again.  Management does not train their employees properly, they will tell you how to do one thing, then when you do it, they swear they never told you that when you have notes showing they did.  "
bad,"As security you are a regulatory punching bag for both federal and company mandated ""inspections"".   There is no work life balance whatsoever.  The overtime is drowning and constant.  People's families are falling apart because they're never home, working 12+ hour days all the time.  The work is meaningless and thankless.  Management likes to pretend its some kind of paramilitary and thus if one person makes a mistake, everyone feels the punishment.  You're expected to be a robot that lives for the company and runs on procedures while you're constantly being made to feel like you are never good enough because the exelon(exellence) way is that you can ALWAYS be better..."
bad,"If you are in security, you are treated like a second class citizen. They rarely look at security for other positions. College reimbursement only happens if it is what they want you to study. HR is a joke and will cheat you out of money if you leave, such as vaction."
bad,"After almost 20 years and 19 years of good performance appraisals i was terminated due to poor performance. A performance based on 3 months with a new supervisor who hadnt clue on her job much less mine. Suddenly i could do nothing right and my workload increase 3X while on a performance improvement plan. Basically setting me up for failure. "
bad,Senior leadership is two faced and CANNOT be trusted.  They think they know it all and do nt value their employees or their thoughts and ideas.  Stay away from this company unless you like leaving your brain at home and want to be used and abused and then thrown out when they are finished with you.
bad,A typical work day at BGE consists of extremely high call volumes for basically the entire shift.  Due to the service level metric goals employees are often required to work through their lunch break and well as stay hours later then when scheduled.  Management seemed uninterested in finding alternative solutions to ease the demand they placed on their employees.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to leave when your shift is over because the operations department mandates you stay to assist with call volumes.
bad,Company abuses contractors and has the worse culture  don’t waste your time with this company  even writing this review is a waste of engery stay far away
bad,"Management turns the otters way when it comes to harassment at work. They follow all the standard protocols for an ""investigation"" but does little to nothing to remedy the solution. The company is more worried about following proper procedures and paper protocol than caring about the employees, specially employees that are in a minority category."
bad,The management for the security department is absolute garbage. If you want to stay in security plan on working swing shift the rest of your life with no advancement. Management is the good ol boys club. If your not in the club you are not moving up.
bad,Patronizing militaristic work place. The work was boring and barely engineering. It is one industry that can pigeon hole you easily so it's important to get out early.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. Co workers are fine. the best part of the job is the paycheck and benefits.
bad,"A typical day consisted of fighting the current fires, struggling to understand management's instructions or vague corporate direction."
bad,"BGE won't supply contractors a phone or laptop, so afraid you might consider yourself an employee. Hostile environment from long time employees. Training was ok, but very little help or guidance."
bad,"Even after official feedback from internal and external employee surveys, Management has made no significant change to address lack of progression for technicians/low pay.  Management does not listen to its employees, accept if you in a specific position, sad. "
bad,Poorly defined processes to execute operating plan impacted the work/life balance of employees.  Many overtime hours spent to complete unrealistic timeframes.
bad,"Exelon is not a very productive environment and there is very little room for advancement. It is a young culture and company so they are not actually diverse and cultured as they state in their policies. Obviously from this statement we now know that there are but a few employees that are minorities. I counted 10 across all departments. there are over 2,000 employees in this location."
bad,The company is great but management is worthless. They give you projects and you get no credit for anything. They are laying people off to bring in new people as contractors and pay them much less. Some of us that are still here as full time employees walk on egg shells because we never know when the next cut is. They are also outsourcing alot of the work out of the country to Mexico and Panama. To get promoted is all on who you know.
bad,"I hired in as a process engineer as a contractor, they do not like contractors at all.  Some of the bathrooms there actually have engraved signs that say No Contractors."
bad,"They promote from within which is good, but not everyone receives the necessary mentorship to excel there. The starting pay good be better, but they offer a great benefits package."
bad,No comment. Not much to say. Work life balance not really there. Management had much unfair political viewpoints. No real support. Felt like you were on your own. No real direction.
bad,"management needed training"
bad,No room to advance. You have to be part of the old Boys Club. Many people there waiting for retirement and are very afraid of change. No new blood brought in with any new ideas. New ideas are squashed
bad,not a great place if you are a remote employee . always understaffed and overworked. i would not apply here if i could do it over .management treats you like a number
bad,"Engineering does not get overtime unless it is an outage, but you will get time off."
bad,Work was established  by calls only not very stable work loved working and making people happy but not enough work
bad,"Ok place to work. Would not go back. Poor management. A lot of nepotism. Culture clashes between DC, NJ and Chicago. Management not very personable or proficient."
bad,Exelon is an ok place for you to work. The hours are long an they continue to modify benefits. Not much of a place to go for the next generation of workers.
bad,"Not my favorite job. The in-office culture was very clique-ish. The on-boarding process was severely lacking, and not inclusive.  It was a basic ""train yourself"" by asking questions here and there without an adequate training on company process, systems, or products."
bad,The culture is very stressful and cutthroat. Not a team environment. There are very few processes and procedures to follow. Managers have no accountability
bad,Hardest part of the job was getting all departments to agree on how to fix a problem and move forward.  This takes forever and never gets a resolution.
bad,The corporate model is a diaster waiting to happen. They put supervisors in place that have no actual knowledge or experience in the areas they supervise. The actual WORKERS that have the knowledge are leaving for better environments. They care more about there percieved image than they do about there employees. They preach about diversity but white is not a color in that rainbow.
bad,Make a ton of money but they force overtime whenever they want. (Holiday weekends etc.) Management is horrible and unqualified. overall good for making money but horrible for social life and stress level
bad,"constant overtime, no outside life/family time, everybody looks out for themselves instead of helping others type of a company and they condone this type of environment, moral is terribly low"
bad,"30 Years ago when Calvert Cliffs was BG&E, the company was an excitting place to work.  Management treated employees with respect  and as friends.  Constellation purchased Calvert Cliffs in the late 90's and nothing really changed. Going to work was a pleasure.  Ceng purchased Calvert Cliffs and 300 people were laid off, afer the drama and fear of not having a job, everyday went back to normal just with less employees. Exelon purchased in 2015, that is when the real change came into play.  People lost jobs without any packages offered, many policies were changed without the company putting any real thought on the changes, managment started treating employees like they were just numbers, it became like the Hungar Games, everyone out for themselves.  Although learning and growth were preached, it was only for certain chosen ones.  The environment is very toxic.  People work by fear.  The pay is excellent, but, the ulcers you recieve from giving 100% and not being  apreciated is not worth working your lifetime.  The hardest part of the job is just dealing with the politics and the enjoyable part is working with many charities and meeting some awesome co-workers along the way."
bad,You are paid well but little to no work life balance.                                               a work culture where employees aren't appreciated.
bad,In the department that I worked it was unbelievable how Management favoritism went. I was treated unfairly on many levels.
bad,"Work was busy."
bad,"There are 1000's of things you have to remember all the time.  You are frequently observed and even the smallest of mistakes are written up and examined with a microscope.  Everyone feels like there going to get in trouble.  They have a strict zero tolerance for things that can be subjective, like when you need to wear gloves.  If they don't like you, they will side with your accuser.  There have been several suicides in the recent years.  They tried to cover their butts. They love their progressive discipline  policy and are always using it on people.  It has become so much worse over the years.  Training is now poor. No one wants to make any decisions to avoid blame.  HR has no idea what sort of messed up things are going on in the plant.  The union is powerless and useless.  The company does whatever they want.  They fired this poor girl instead of helping her learn.  They got rid of a guy going through a bad divorce. It's sad.   They like to kick you when your down.  They threw out some of their best workers like trash!  OK Exelon, your sorry I had such a bad time with you.  I am by far, not the only one."
bad,"Great place to learn about nuclear power. Once you have experience the demands on employees is tremendous. Take any proposed salary and divide by 2 as you will be working 60-80 hours easily to meet all work assignments, without OT pay. So keep this in mind when comparing jobs."
bad,The company is restructured every couple years and seems they find room for another layer of management every time. Work life balance has gone out the window.
bad,"I have worked for 6 other major nuclear utility companies. Exelon is my least preferred. While they promote all the current trendy corporate goals for social equality, social engagement, and causes, they are still basically a quarterly profit based company without a conscience."
bad,"Great pay, lousy culture.  Lots of people in roles they don't belong to and MANY people without the most basic knowledge to perform their job functions.  Very toxic environment and the only reason people stay is because of the pay."
bad,It is difficult to move up in this company due to the environment being political. Its also hard to network with other departments to possible advance because security guards are always busy and more than likely are not allowed. This job is more useful as a stepping stone to move elsewhere.
bad,Very demanding with FORCED OT all the time.. Pay is great because of so much OT but don't plan on having anytime to spend it with your family. Arcos call out system is automatic and not managed by foreman. Expect to work long forced hours and also take call outs or be disciplined. The employees are the ones that make this place bearable. Favoritism is rampant.
bad,Would not recommend. I would not recommend. Thank you for allowing me to submit this information. I hope this helps you to decide about your job in the future
good,The job was ok but the miscommunication along management and the rest of the workers were horrible.
good,"Terrible management, horrible culture, hours suck and lots of forced overtime, but easy and high paying. This will not let me finish until I type 150 characters."
good,Management is delusional at times for how to motivate the work force.  Toxic work environment and the inability to move departments or get a promotion has resulted in approximately 2/3 of the department to turnover in the last 3 years.  No one wants to stay in Engineering at Braidwood.
good,Exelon will get their pound of flesh from you but you get paid very well. The company has very liberal policies and their reactions to things are more of a knee jerk response.
good,"Samll progressive company, later sold to Exelon Constellation, position changes, currently re-branding and employee transitioning."
good,"Challenging work at times, very detail orientated. Swing shift work schedules can be very stressful for employees and family life/activities. Nuclear industry is promising but not in this company."
good,The company has yearly training overview for every employee.  They are very intuitive with employees' needs and schedules.  They give everyone opportunity to reach their goal.
good,"Due to the recent drop is natural gas prices, nuclear power is in heavy competition with Gas Companies.  This is resulting in them having to downsize to compete."
good,"Long Hard Hours, but Excellent Money Potential and Benefits.  Difficult Politics where advancement is rewarded by who you know not what you know. Poor work life balance with management that seems to worry about the bottom line more then employee morale.  Hard to leave through the hard parts when compensation is good.  (Golden Handcuffs)"
good,"The salary and benefits at Exelon are great.  The people at the company also good people to work with.  However, the culture is very fast-paced and very stressful.  Some managers are very disorganized and lack solid managerial skills.  But, there are also some great managers in the bunch.  Work/life balance is talked about over and over again, but they rarely ever live up to having a good work/life balance.   The company is very demanding of your time."
good,You can hardly be productive as you are always in meetings leaving little time for productive work. The company does do a lot of outreach for the community though which is a positive
good,Very rigid culture with limited advancement potential. Very good compensation and benefits but work life balance is not promoted throughout the organization.
good,Very stressful and time consuming. long Shifts Mandatory overtime on several occasions.  Rotating schedule one month nights one month days. Very difficult for a family.
good,"Nice people in a comfortable setting.  Workload is manageable but could be hectic at times because of program updates and lack of personnel.  Overall, I nice place to work but the management is slightly lackluster at times."
good,"Everything revolves around courthouse hours and filing deadlines. Virtually no flexibility in those requirements can create a stressful atmosphere. Fortunately, I worked with people who were efficient communicators; often making it easier for me to assist in meeting their requirements."
good,Has lots of opportunities but can be stressful. To many meetings and lots of changes that can affect employees. There is no much work life balance and compensation can be better
good,"Job was okay for the most part in non-management role, and pay was pretty good.  Days were 12 hours so kind of exhausting.  But then when you get into management the people you have to pacify are unreasonable.  There are a lot of ridiculous expectations and abrasive personalities at the top.  I left to keep my self respect, even though it was the most money I'd ever made in my life.  Still, it was just not worth it to get beat up every day.  Good luck with that crowd!"
good,"I have found that the jobs where overtime is offered have a low salary offered in the beginning. This makes you sometimes dependent on the overtime or call outs. The management in certain departments will not assist you in advancing your career. Some jobs require you to sign a contract, and even after completing the contract length, you are still kept in your position as long as they need you. They may find some mistake you have made in order to hinder you from being able to apply out to another position."
good,"Flexible work time, but poor management, lack of communication, no clear path or support for advancement within the company. Work place culture is dysfunctional and oppressive, learn and gain experience and move on quickly. Force you to be a contractor for about a year before potential hire: no benefits, paid vacation, or holidays."
good,Not a good place for minority that wants a career growth. African female engineers are not given the opportunity to rise into the leadership level in the company.
good,Not a bad place to work. Plant is closing. Most people are trying to leave that are not of retirement age. Not clear where remains staff will end up. Too many open ended promises.
good,"Power plant operation does not shutdown at 5 pm.  That being said, there can be significant strain on individuals when the hours are long and then you go home to work more or attend multiple conference calls.  In addition, it is not unusual to have vacations cancelled due to plant emergencies such as equipment or human performance issues.  Management expectations are challenging with a sometimes heavy-handed approach.  There are good things.  The compensation and benefits reflect the aggressive nature of the industry and the company is large enough that there are a variety of place to work.  This industry is not for everyone and must be taken into account."
good,"Call center is an awesome place to work. Absolutely love the company. The pay is awesome. However, it's micromanaged. They fire you 1st ask questions last. Union is horrible."
good,"same as above, only in security and connot get into other department, wont give security guards interviews, only a few have left. most leave to other places outside the company !"
good,"Fast Paced Environment, however struggling with corporate culture after several acquisitions"
good,It would be a great place to work for a person that is signal and don't have kids. There is plenty of over time and the pay is pretty good.
good,"Large company where you are literally a number. Opportunities of job progression and cross training are spoken of frequently, but rarely happen. Office resembles sardine can. The pay is decent if you can work your way up. The Brightside is that there is a pension plan if you can stomach decades of working in sardine can."
good,Working in the department I worked in the work was simple quick and efficient. Manager was more gloom and doom and didn't make it comfortable at times but the team still worked and did the job
good,Management needs to realize that change is important and holding a successful performer in a position only promotes them to leave the company.  Too many people are “held” because the management can’t find a way to do certain jobs themselves.
good,Pay is good but you are worked in excess of what you receive as pay.  Most employees work well together but there is very little cooperation among IT disciplines.
good,I had an issue with executives making decision that had negative affects on making money for the company. They made decisions to eliminate 20 traders while they were already short handed on a book of business that was essentially a dividend check to the Exelon of 50 million a year.
good,Everything in Nuclear Power in Exelon is scrutinized and looked over with a fine tooth comb. It can become a huge burden and at times will actually have operators and technicians perform worse than they would have in the first place. Too many rules is counter productive.
good,Working for any utility company requires one to work very long hours.  A typical work day may be up 12 hours.  During shut-downs (planned or emergencies) you may have to work 16 hours in one work day.
good,"Working nuclear is stressful in its very nature. It a highly regulated field of work however, your well compensated for your time especially if you are an hourly employee. Best job in a nuclear site is a plant operator FYI...."
good,"I'm a contractor and I've been repeatedly told Exelon is trying to reduce headcount and for the foreseeable future, there is no opportunity to be converted to an employee.  It's too bad they keep dead weight employees around while the strong contractors are walking out the door."
good,"In the IT departments, since it is not a money making area, is now a victim of cost cutting. Different departments are either cutting head counts, licensing or simply service offered."
good,"This was a family owned company, that eventually went out of business.  A pretty laid back place to work, just as long as you got your work completed."
good,Image assets on a daily basis. Clean machine and wipe hard drive. Move machines in Active Directory or delete. Install applications to machines.
good,Continous overload of overtime no work life balance at all. Very hard work to maintain all qualls as well as find time for family and friends
good,It is a very challenging place to work at. There is always work that is being performed that challenges you to think outside the box in order to come up with a solution to the issues at hand.
good,"Many people become disillusioned and believe this corporation will do and be the right things for the communities it operates in and it does, most of the time but at the expense of its employees  work life balance"
good,"6am to 5pm "
good,"There is never a typical day, things always changed but in a good way.  I worked with a great group of people.  The hardest part of the job was adjusting your schedule due to there were always changes, due to the type of work we did things were always changing."
good,At Exelon it seems as if everyone was simply going through the motions and it was a very stagnant boring culture.  As a new employee i was not happy with the people working around me as every 15 mintues was a smoke break for them.
good,"I like to be able to interact all day with colleagues and then have some fun with them after hours.  Even if we have conflicts and disagreements during the day, it is important to let that go after hours."
good,"The project had challenges with weather and equipment failures, but still a good project. We overcame delays due to floods, heavy rain, and equipment. The team worked through all adversity to complete on time."
good,Nice company to work for.  Don't have any other information to give.  I work nights and do not have a lot of interaction with management.  I work every single weekend and I feel that the off days should be rotated. Thanks for the opportunity.
good,Exelon is a decent company to work for.  Certain locations are better than others.  Office politics is very strong and dominant at specific locations.  Individual competition like public accounting.
good,"Worked at BG&E "
good,Poor management and minimal workload. Required too much without enough to deliver in the first pace. Would highly recommend against working here for future candidates.
good,It has been rough for me lately since leadership changes constantly except for executive leadership. Typical day is 8 hours and 1 day to work from home.
good,"Pepco Holdings is a venerable Washington, D.C. company, founded more than 120 years ago.  Exelon Energy of Chicago recently purchased Pepco Holdings, and there is right now a high degree of anxiety at Pepco, due to Exelon's efforts to ""align"" Pepco's internal operations (including the Communications Department), with its larger corporate structure."
good,"Constant learning on the feet required in a fast paced environment. Good team structure and decent hours. Great benefits, market rates with management providing a culture for growth."
good,The Management team at Ginna is pleasant and very nice to work with.  The plant is located in a very nice neighborhood and is a good place to relocate to and raise a family.
good,The Compensation and Benefits package is amazing. Co-workers are good while management is par to sub-par. You learn time management skills and valuable skills needed to help build a career in the security sector.
good,The culture struggles to form into a positive one due to the blending of several companies into one.
good,My immediate supervisor was awesome but the higher up you get in the hierarchy the less in touch they are with the employees. Typical big corporation that is growing too fast for its own good.
good,The Company is working hard to establish itself as best in class. They are constantly going through change as they continue to provide excellent service to their customers.
good,"Once upon a time, it was the place to work. But since the MCI merger, the management has gone from OK to worse. They are not making money, so they have layoffs almost twice a year."
good,"Working for a Company that has recently gone through a merger really showcases one's talents and skills as we are continually challenged to think of better, more efficient ways to execute our current work. Teamwork is key and brainstorming sessions have been tremendously helpful in recent months."
good,"This job is a stressfull job run like you are in the military. Everything is proceduralized, NO outof the box thinking encuraged or allowed. NOT for a creative person or anyone who enjoys working with the latest technology."
good,"The work day was A 12 hour shift,had the opportunity to have off half the year while still being a fulltime employee.The general work day was very long and could get extremely boring staring out glass for 12 hours.Did learn about teamwork and leadership building skills when I was there."
good,"Exelon Nuclear stations have outages each year in which engineers must work a 12 hour shift, either day or night, 6 days week (72 hours per week).  If you can get past that, the pay and benefits are very good, along with job security."
good,The diversified nature of the work that Exelon performs as company offers many opportunities to practice continued learning throughout your career. The job is very time demanding due to the 24/7 nature of the the Electrical Power Generation industry. Exelon is an industry leader and offers many opportunities for industry peer group leadership opportunities as a result.
good,"Working for Exelon was fine. They were a good company to work for. There was nothing overly good or bad about them. The people were nice, management was little detached but that's nothing new anywhere."
good,"Driven to see improvement. Large organization with many level of management locally, regionally, and corporate level. Uncertainty in the utility market. Large player with diverse offerings."
good,Pay and benefits are great! It's a very high demanding job that requires a lot of hours at the plant and being on call. Most positions require shift work and a rotating schedule.
good,company has good benefits good pay and lots of overtime great if like money bad if you like your family time. and that about all.
good,"Working as an Armed Responder isn't hard, but getting your foot in the door is, once there you're on easy street. Training is ok, but the people make the job, Good benefits, lots of O.T. Enjoy :)"
good,"Great company. Learned various things, just ask. Management was very knowledgeable. Co-workers very helpful."
good,"The schedule was great; with twelve hour shifts, you only work half of the year. The pay was decent for the area and the benefits were great."
good,A competitive environment with a lot to offer future employees
good,Contract position.  I would have loved to have been able to work there as a permanent employee.  Salary and compensation are very good.  Plenty of overtime available.
good,"Exelon is FORTUNE 100 company that work​s in every stage of the energ​​​​y business: power generation, competitive energy sales, transmission and delivery. As the nation's leading competitive energy provider, Exelo​n does business in 48 states, D.C., and Canada employ approximately 34,000 people nationwide.​​​​​​  Not a bad place to work."
good,"Not an exciting working environment for interns. "
good,"The hardest part of the job see seems to be communications at times.i find it is very important that all work group are communicated to the status of the equipment before they proceed to the next step of getting equipment repaired.They had been times bolts were ordered for wrong pump and it cost the company money thousands to go back to discovering the issue and fix it.   The hardest part of the job made me meeting committments where rt as humans we are not perfect and the company does provide us the tools to prevent mistakes."
good,"Management isn't very good here, they don't let you have a life here."
good,Management and co-workers always great and willing to help. You would think in a large plant with a union that job security would be a plus of a company like this... however the union is extremely lazy and DOES NOT DO ANYTHING. file a grievance. they will do nothing about it except have meetings.
good,Overall decent experience.Had good days and not so good ones.Work environment not too relaxed.
good,"Exelon is a great company to work with. The company is keen on helping employees grow, however there isn't always a growth opportunity for everyone. This company has provided stability with my career, in addition to flexibility."
good,"Overall my experience has been good. I've learned a great deal of experience from each position. I would like to see older management trained on how to work with all generational backgrounds and trained on how to be effective & efficient managers. I would like to see certain ""perks"" translated across all departments, i.e. make working from home or having an alternating work schedule a mandatory aspect of the position, especially in engineering and work management related departments. This can help with retention. Otherwise, keep progressing and making changes to help internal employees as well as customers."
good,"My team in Exelon is flexible on what technology a developer can choose for achieving the goal of the project."
good,It is a good company but very difficult to move up in the company because of the culture. I would say that it's an amazing culture outside customer service department.
good,"Large utility with lots of opportunities."
good,"Typical day is processing procurement request, communicating with vendors and internal customers and planning future procurement strategies."
good,Great Pay. But Very Stressful. Great Pay. Worked too many hours. Great Pay.Stressful job. Enjoyed the great compensation
good,"Workplace is very competitive with paying employees but 45-50 hour work weeks are the norm. Supervision is required to work 55-60 hours a week. Job also requires possibility of being called in on weekends to support round-the-clock coverage of issues."
good,"Exelon is a conservative company. It's salaries are average and employee benefits are expensive.  As the leadership grow the vision, staff will buy in and become dedicated."
good,"Work life balance sucks, you are required for overtime all the time and if you need off they don't care. you will ask and ask and no one listens to you"
good,The company is good to work at. The benefits are average. There is a threat of multiple powerplants being retired. The company is going through a restructuring phase in the nuclear devision.
good,"Great Work Location"
good,"Work extensive hours of OT even if you do not want it, you will get designated to work it.  Not an ideal job if you are wanting to do things with your family during your off time."
good,"Exelon has the excellent pension, 401k, and more that are desirable for those with family's.  "
good,"A typical day at work requires to be flexible to support emergent repairs and high demand for quality problem resolution. Ensure shop is dispatched in a timely manner, review schedules for future weeks. Ensure quality work packages are written for maintenance work in the field."
good,"job that pays well but working moral and work life balance days , are your off days if your not working OT!"
good,Great place to work You spend a lot of time alone and some of it with good people
good,"Great pay and benefits, excellent people to work with. Challengeing schedule with impacts on quality of life. Mandatory overtime and seniority base vacation."
good,"A typical day at work is never foreseen because of the daily operations of a nuclear power plant. It has many factors that add to it that are beyond your control that it may be affected by. For example weather, personnel or equipment. I learned much in reference to the management training that was made available to me that I will be able to apply at any other job I transfer over to. The workplace culture is what may add to your daily stress due to the fact that it is just as stringent as the FAA in which I also worked in (Military). In my personal experience the most difficult part of my job was dealing with what I considered to be a less than qualified and professional manager but fortunately the company has some of the best and most qualified personnel that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. The most enjoyable part of my job were the challenges that arose on a daily basis which benefited my professional development."
good,"Exelon is a good place to work.  As long as you pull your weight and get your metrics met you will have an easy going time.  management is sub par, and chances of advancement within the call center is not great.  but if you are willing to travel to our other states we operate in there are many opportunities."
good,Good work environment with positive management and capable peers.  Would remain if construction projects continued.  Building something is far more satisfying that turn around work.
good,"I began working at ComEd my sophomore and junior year of high school, the companies objective are servicing people with power for their households. My daily tasks were going around different areas of the city and survey the communities about their opinion on ComEd. My mission was explaining how ComEd had a new product called SmartGrid worked and how it can save a lot of money using this feature."
good,"I worked as an intern here, but they gave me a ton of opportunities to grow my knowledge. Anything that I asked to be involved it, they gave me the opportunity to be an essential part of the project."
good,It’s a nice place to work. A very diverse work culture. Training is encouraged and an overall nice atmosphere to work. Management is supportive in you succeeding.
good,"friendly people here and safety is key "
good,"Depending on your path, you may have room to grow and move up the ladder.  Outages can get long and exhausting but the money is good.  Unions can be tough to deal with sometimes"
good,"A very organized and productive place to work. learned a lot."
good,Constellation has a talented workforce of individual contributors. It is a fast-paced environment with great managers and who challenge you. Great compensation and opportunities for growth.
good,"High paced stressful environment, long hours/holidays, unsafe conditions, outside in all weather conditions.  It was a privilege to provide power to the city of Chicago."
good,"This was the job that I enjoyed the most. It was intellectually interesting and challenging. Additionally, I worked for a manager who was the best one that I have ever had."
good,"Could not arrange work visa from Canada."
good,its a never ending flow of issues that have to be resolved in a timely manner and you are always on call and have a set amount of time to reply back to an issue or call.
good,"reduction in funding to the wrong areas, personnel were not allowed to find other positions w within the company, managers did not relate well to workers"
good,Great company! There seems to be a lot of opportunity and management is pretty receptive to your career interest. Benefits were good and the workload was interesting.
good,"Exelon Nuclear very good place to work . Paid well and great Benefits.  Upper Management is very pushing and always wanting more hours out of their middle management people, Union people are very great to work with on jobs and in their respective departments. During shutdown Outages work is very fast paced for Management personnel , most of time you are working 10-12 hour days 6-7 days per week for 30 days ."
good,Overall a good place to work.  Excellent compensation and benefits.  But the work hours are long and it is a competitive environment with time and reporting demand pressures.
good,Great career potential with needed training provided on-site for each job position.  Excessive overtime available during refueling outages especially.
good,"Serious workplace, driven and focused to meet their goal and standards. Learned a lot about the nuclear environment through exposure. Takes good care of their employees"
good,"Exelon is a good employer, provides a lot of opportunity given it is such a large and diverse company.  "
good,"Engaging project redesigning an internal website. Slow at the start, but things eventually picked up. Nice group of people in my group."
good,"i performed well over here with the team support and management support,some of the needs of employees were not reachable by the management."
good,"overall good fast paced and fun, wish were more fair oppurtunities for advancement. Some people work together and some dont. But over all great learning environment."
good,A typical day at work is like a fire fighter.  We are always putting out fires.  I have been able to learn different software's.  The company is willing to invest in their employees.
good,"Hardest part:"
good,"Daily activities are centralized around the monthly close. Week 1 - accrual/ close activities. Week 2 - monthly financial reporting of actual results. Week 3 - relax / review. Week 4 - prepare for month end. "
good,The pay and Benefits are good. Lots of overtime.  Good people and fun.
good,"Provide desk side, IMAC, break-fix, applications and related technology support for desktops, laptops, rugged laptops, and printers in Main Office building and other office locations. Support includes building computer systems to customer specifications, installation and testing of computer systems, software and peripherals. Remote assistance using Remote Desktop and SCCM Client. Managing accounts and permissions via Active Directory. Migrating user’s data from user’s computer to the new system. Use Norton Ghost to image machines. Working and closing tickets via Remedy Ticketing System. SLA and Asset management."
good,"Although this position lacks a lot of room for advancement, my co-workers are friendly and the benefits are very good."
good,Typical day at work involved an early morning meeting with the senior leadership team combing through reports and assessments to ensure there were no cookie cutter answers.  Identifying opportunities to improve from lessons learned and benchmarking best practices for other peers in the nuclear industry.
good,Good place to work.Friendly co -workers. Excelent training. Very good salery.Medical and dental benefits are competitive.Management and supervision are very supportive.
good,A typical day to day consisted of coding the patches. Executed the self-service reimage of Exelon Windows 7 PCs to Exelon Windows 10 using LanDesk Portal Manager as well as reimaging by a boot disk
good,Exelon is great company to work for that offers a competitive salary and good benefits.  The culture is professional and collaborative however it can be stressful.
good,Good company to work for. Excellent opportunity to grow and advance. Effective work process. Very team oriented. Would not imagine this is a nuclear or power company with Power Gen and Dist company at its core.
good,"Exelon pays their employees very well and the people who work in the Security department are awesome to work with. However, there is a huge disconnect between senior management and the people who work on shift. There is a lack of communication, and discontent towards senior management. Employees feel like numbers not valued employees when it comes to upper management."
good,"Typical day at work was stressful."
good,"The Employees that I worked with on a day to day basis were great."
good,"Excellent workplace, innovative an fast-paced. Team environment , always seeking ideas for improvement., but slow to implement."
good,Same thing everyday. No changes. Job is easy by nature. People are friendly and management is easy to work for.
good,"Exelon is great place to learn and gain valuable skills. I learned a lot about nuclear process, and my coworkers are very intelligent. The hardest part of the job was during refueling outages mainly the long hours."
good,Overall very good job with alot of overtime. Good pay and good working enviroment.
good,Exelon values diversity from all peoples so I give them kudos for walking the walk on diversity in their management and at all levels. There are many opportunities for career movement at this company. I worked here five years and left because my salary was not in line with national market rates and the housing bubble made it impossible for me to buy any real estate in the chicago suburbs. They paid (mostly) tuition reimbursement for my master's degree.
good,Productive and Exciting place to work. Very fast paced environment that never becomes dull. The work life balance can be challenging at times but most managers are accommodating with comp time. The people are Exelon's most valuable asset. Very friendly and smart.  I enjoyed my time at Exelon.
good,"Rules and process driven environment. If you follow the rules and are conservative with respect to risk, it is a good place to work. The structure does tend to stymie innovation and risk taking."
good,"Good leadership. Everyone knows his/her duties and roles. It's a very fast pace work environment, but you'll feel rewarding working there. ..........................................................................."
good,"If working a swing shift is something you don't like then this job isn't for you. There is plenty of down time, but at times it's crazy busy. Any issues are always blamed on the officer and considered available. Security management is good depending on what team your on. Overall, I really enjoy my job but it's not for everyone."
good,I’ve worked at Exelon in the security department for 8 years it’s a great job with great pay. I’m tested with utmost respect and professionalism the only downfall is my plant is closing and I’m in need of another job
good,"Exelon as a whole is a good company to work for.  The benefits are very good, with good health insurance, a fair amount of vacation time is given,  work from home options and good pay."
good,Good company to work for and would any employee apply for positions. Good benefits stability good pay. Great work teams which provide support of your daily activities.
good,"Excellent benefits, culture is good in many ways but a bit stuffy."
good,"Exelon relies heavily on procedures ( very much influenced by its successful nuclear division).  Company places the highest value on its employees and provides ample training to anyone who wants it. That said, people politics runs rampant and you need to fit in very well with your crowd or you face alot of behind the scenes scrutiny. Navigate smartly and the world is yours."
good,Nuclear power is a demanding industry that requires excellence at all times.  Exelon has always treated me fairly and provided good benefits throughout my entire career.
good,Over 100 systems to keep these reactors online. No other place is going to provide the engineer with a bigger facility in which to view everything they learned in school
good,"You will not be paid higher in the nuclear field anywhere else, nor receive as many benefits, but keep in mind it's a BIG company, so work/life balance isn't going to work out all that great if you're in operations."
good,"Exelon bought out our company supposedly with the intention of growing their Midwest business.  But instead within 2 years our lease was up at our office location and they decided against renewing and decided to completely close the Indianapolis all together.  "
good,Be prepared for a lot of traveling to different job sites. Compensation is nice. Nice healthcare coverage. Company is a fortune 500 company. Pretty stable place to work
good,This is a company that requires attention to detail with every task. Employees are to be respect no matter the position and every task done is to be treated as it is the first evolution.
good,plenty of overtime if desired. I finished two degrees while working there.The work is steady but at times it can very repetitive. It is an excellent way to get into Exelon.
good,"Big company very difficult to get noticed very competitive environment . Managers stick to the book with little flexibility. Easy to get lost is some far out office.,"
good,"•Order Construction and Paving materials "
good,"Max hrs. per week with minimal staffing, company downsized management work force in 2001 although work load actually increased to increased government regulations.  Remaining staff had to take on the responsibilities of the people that were released."
good,"A typical day in the Shared Service Center is different everyday. I learned more about transactions, company culture, and shared services. The management I was under was very transparent and authentic. "
good,"Great company and project."
good,"Very diverse culture, but difficult environment to navigate at times. Execution is everything and lessons learned are always mined for improvement. High impact, high demand culture elicits the best out of resources (including people)."
good,"My tenure with Exelon has been a been a very interesting time.  I've had the oppurtunity to learn a lot about the business of Power plants.  I've also learned to deal with a wide variety of personalities and attitudes, both good and bad.  I've been fortunate to have worked with several different crews and the common initiative I've found was safety and efficiency.  The long summer days definitely take their toll on the plant and the operators but its often welcomed after usually slow winters. The only negatives I would personally mention would be advancement opportunity and the lack of a formalized training system. But as i said, I would definitely recommend Exelon to someone seeking employment."
good,"I was only a contractor, so my experience would not be the same as a regular, full time employee.  I found my work challenging and rewarding and the people are fair and balanced.  If they were not forced by laws, I would be staying another year.  I enjoyed this job."
good,Was there on contract and people were nice. A little too quiet for an IT enviroment but helpful when I did ask for info.
good,"Hours are long, normally 12hrs day/nights. Working rotating shift work on a 5 week rotation. School room training is required and soon will be doing oral boards. A poor mixture of management form the field verses straight out of college. Co-workers become second family since working close to the same group of people for long periods of time."
good,"Good place to work if you like a constant challenge, good pay, awesome opportunity for advancement. However, work/life balance is totally awful."
good,"Exelon is a place to work that gives you great benefits and competitive pay, but you need to work a lot of hours. You are always busy and the workload is almost more than one can handle."
good,I was taught the ins and outs of the nuclear industry in a short concentrated experience. My project opened my eyes to the wonders of nuclear energy and the idea of preventative maintenance.
good,"Awesome management and great culture and they promote “progressive” issues, but not pushy with it."
good,company provides several resources to effectively perform your job. Active affinity groups. Allows employees to perform community service projects and provides mentoring.
good,"Exelon offers good career enhancement/advancement and training opportunities, tuition reimbursement, leadership development opportunities, and excellent benefits."
good,"Pros:"
good,Good place to work if you want to make a good income; bad place to work if you love doing what you're good at but don't want to be involved in corporate politics.
good,"Exelon's management culture exists in several ""silos"". Sometimes it is difficult to work with cross-functional teams for that reason. The role I most enjoyed was as technical lead for Exelon's mergers and acquisitions team, focusing (in my case) on Hyperion and PeopleSoft. I have heard other people describe Exelon as a ""high-stress"" environment, and I will say that the level of stress depends on what team you are on and who your manager is. I did experience a stressful team under a ""driven"" manager, but they do encourage managers to move from one team to another after a few years, and after that happened my team was a much better place to be. I would recommend Exelon as a good place to work."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but nuclear power is a very time-consuming field - many unscheduled days at work due to emergent issues. Also have a long commute - 90 minutes or more."
good,"A typical day included financial files, a quiet office...everyone completed their work in silence as much talking wasn't needed...coworkers were friendly"
good,"As an intern, my time was well spent.  The recent merger has caused a lot of internal uncertainty for tenured employees.  Promotions see slim, and career growth does not seem evident for many departments."
good,"The company has great benefits and pretty good job security if you are an employee. Contracting can pay well, but there is no job security. Your contract can be ended anytime, whether you were good at your job or not. There is a sense of elitisim if you work in one of the more formal offices like on point st. in baltimore city."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for this company. Great benefits, great people! I've had the opportunity to learn so much about process and analytics. Currently looking for opportunities internally. However, it appears outside candidates are winning out over current employees, which is very discouraging."
good,Exelon Nuclear offered me a great opportunity to manage a large security deployment and gave me almost 100% autonomy to get the mission accomplished. I would consider working for this firm again.
good,"This is a great company for someone looking to go to work, know everything that is required of them and come home. You get paid very well however I did not like sitting in a cubicle or waiting for job advancement and therefore it was not for me."
good,Found the company to be overstructured and a lot of layers to management but the compensation was excellent. I would still be there but they sold our plant
good,"17 year old company with lots of opportunities. Most people are friendly, knowledgeable and eager to engage with one another. The environment is busy and business. Great group of people and I wish the same opportunity was closer to home."
good,"Work place is staffed entirely with professional, competent, highly intelligent people."
good,I worked on the HRPC migration over to Laborsoft.com for a six month time frame for the project. I had an awesome view of Lake Michigan on the 50th flr of the Chase Building with a wonderful team who took pride in this work.
good,"When I worked at Exelon, the pay was fair and the benefits were superb.  Unfortunately I was involved in a mass lay-off when ComEd merged with PECO.  Oh how I wish that never happened!!"
good,"High Performers expected to do all the work, while low performers given pass and have no responsibilities.  Enjoyed flexible hours of job and the company gives very nice bonuses."
good,"Very good experience learning about the power and energy business sector Exelon successfully is apart of. As a consultant I have enjoyed the opportunity to work in different business environments and under different management styles. When it comes to the people and the commodore it lacks leaving a lasting impression. It's almost like working in a boring library on a daily. No one truly speaks, and takes time to get to know one another building valuable personal relationships."
good,Exelon  is safety consciencse work place that care about the enviroment and its employees. They  give above wages and benefits. The security needs improvement little chance of advancement to other departments.
good,The pay is very competitive. The benefits are good. quality training and many levels of management with the opportunity to move forward. You must be able to pass a fitness test.
good,"A typical workday is 10 hours long, normally including at least 2 - 1 hour meetings. "
good,"good work/life balance and good people to work with. the Benefits are also pretty good. the company has been going through major changes in the past few years, haveing to do with company acquisitions and mergers"
good,"I really liked my chain of command and the people with whom I worked.  The professionalism was outstanding and overall the work environment was fair.  Sometimes you could be stuck in your cubicle working on a project for a long time.  I didn't like the untouchable nature of the union and how everyone was afraid of them, even though they frequently did the bare minimum of their jobs."
good,"I thought Exelon was a great place to work with fantastic benefits and compensation.  THe work life balance is difficult at times, but overall a good company."
good,Generous benefit package/excellent safety practices/diverse workforce/utility expertise/community outreach/long hours
good,"Co-workers were always team players. Line supervision were resourceful and engaged in support of training. Senior managers were involved in oversight and company related information was well communicated."
good,"Exelon is an integrated power and utility company with a large nuclear generation presence and the owner of three public utility companies.  In 2012 Exelon merged with Constellation Energy to combine the latter's Wholesale and Retail power supply business with the former's generation business, essentially matching up supply with demand.    "
good,Integrated energy company that recently merged with Constellation Energy.
good,"Interesting place to work, the job scope changed constantly. It was never boring work. The hardest part of the job was physical work and dusty environment. While working at Exelon I learned to operate a locomotive, front end loader, and a bulldozer plus numerous other jobs."
good,Being a summer intern with exelon the summer before entering college was very rewarding as it helped me gain an understanding of the professional world and develop some valuable security techniques.
good,"When I got on the staff at Clinton Power Station, it was owned by Illinois Power. It was a friendly company to work for. We were bought and sold several times. Exelon was the final owner of the station. The downside to this was Exelon is a huge company that is a large corporation that is mainly looking at their profits,"
good,"I enjoy what I do and the people I work with.  I have high respect for the people and when I lose the respect, I move a different direction. This will help myself enjoy life and what I do."
good,Good company to work for.  Very diverse and always looking for employees to better themselves thru training and experience. Management keeps good lines of communication open to all workers.
good,"Positive: Flexible schedules, very good compensation."
good,I worked at Exelon on a six month contract and I was let go once the project was completed.  Overall I had a positive experience and I though the compensation for my project was great.
good,Very decent company to work at. Good perks and benefits. Can be long hours during storms and outages -- a lot of overtime hours. Good management team.
good,A procedural driven company that demands a high level of accuracy in the work performed. As a nuclear power plant there is little room for deviation from procedures.
good,There were many different and new projects to work on to shake up the normal day to day.  Staff was very willing to help new hires transition into their jobs.  They offered on the job training along with required and self initiated training to help with job success.
good,Exelon is a great place to work with plenty of career opportunities.  The work place is very safety conscious. It has some of the best leaders I've had the pleasure working with.
good,"Working with professionals including site-resident crafts, I treated them with respect and generally received the same treatment. The Nuclear Power Industry dictates an utmost concern for the safety of each other as well as the public."
good,"Constellation is a great company to work for.  They genuinely care about their employees and making sure you become well rounded as a professional; however, advancement opportunities are limited especially if you are not located in Baltimore or Houston."
good,"Company has merged with another organization. CEO created and entrepreneurial environment, that maximized the strengths of each division. The most rewarding part of the job was selling to individual utilities to across the country"
good,Illinois does not support my current needs but for work here Exelon is great.  I have enjoyed working for Exelon and recommend it to any ex navy nuke looking for work in the field.
good,"Exelon is an excellent company. Hard to get into, most stay once they get in.  Good benefits - one of the last large companies to offer a PENSION. Currently 4% of base pay. 15k tuition assistance for grad studies, but you must stay 3 years in return.  Leadership is competent and cares about the mission and the people."
good,Exelon is a great company to work for. There are many opportunities for advancement. Hours kinda suck though. Overall I would recommend working here for a career.
good,"Performed training requirements "
good,"Pay is excellent"
good,"It takes diligence to stay on top of work. The more unorganized the individual is, the more frustrated they will become over time. Those that have clear vision, goals and a god work ethic will see great success."
good,"Great environment, good people, and a fun atmosphere for creativity. Day to day activity included working with different clients and acted as a liaison for business to business."
good,Good management and plant support working on the DCS project to load 4 MPC's this summer. Only here temporally on a contract.
good,Your day is always different . The people I work with are a good group of people and will always make the best even out of the worst kind of situation.
good,Overall good place to work.  Great people.  Good pay and benefits.  Advancement is ok.  At the lower levels they don't promote out.  They expect everyone to be available on weekends.
good,Not a terrible job.  It's on a swing shift which will have you working days and nights during a 28 day schedule.
good,"The company is a good company to work for if you are willing and able to work in a fast paced environment. Management encourages you to work indipendently, especially in you are a salaried employee. "
good,"excellent work and good work exp."
good,I enjoyed working at Exelon.  The job security was there and the compensation was fantastic!
good,The middle management isnt the best. Too much micro managing.
good,"Great location, very cool people to work with."
good,Nice place to work. Nice group of people in the legal department. Volunteering is a good way people together within the Company. Hiring freeze and wish there was an open position during my time here.
good,The work gives you challenges and opportunities to advance in the next level of responsibilites. I like how efficient and results driven was the environment.
good,Changing and challenging work environment.  Hours can vary but also flexible.  Good benefits. Good chances for advancement. Pay above average for the area.
good,I was able to successfully go to school full-time and work full-time due to the flexibility allowed by my management.  It was a great professional environment and company to have as introduction to the field.
good,Exelon was a great experience for me in regards to the culture of the work place. The average employee would love this sort of job. The other interns in the office really enjoyed their experience with the company.
good,"I had little experience going into this first position, and I felt like Exelon prepared me well helping not only understand the business, but how the different units function. It was a great experience for establishing a foundation in risk management with an excellent culture."
good,"I have worked at Exelon "
good,Very nice place to work. Cannot beat the benefits that they provide. Can get stressful at times but nothing overwhelming.  All tools provided. Family friendly place to work.
good,"Corporate, safety, professional, personal development, advancement opportunities, educational support, security easy to get to good group of employees"
good,Good benefits good people supervision lacking fast paced stressful all the time too many deadlines plate was always full ..............................
good,"The government relations team was a delight to work with. We answered constituent concerns on behalf of public officials, coordinated major events, and liaised with external stakeholders for special events."
good,"I was a customer service rep from 2013-2018. This was by far the best for. The company offered a basketball league. Stock options, great benefits, and plenty time off. It’s an on-site gym and great location in center city. There was always tons of over time and the pay rate is great. I wish I would’ve stayed there because as they say the grass is not always greener"
good,"Nice place to work, flexible hours. Had to learn organization in order to determine who was on project team. Enjoyed the travel and learning other areas of the company."
good,"Exelon Nuclear - Great place to work, job is rewarding. "
good,This company is great to work for.  They are a solid performer and will be around for a very long time.  They offer great salaries and a great comprehensive benefits package.
good,"Good company with positive growth and good compensation and benefits.  Work hours can be long.  Fast paced environment.  In order to get promotions or lateral movements, relocation may be required.  Is more suited to younger workers."
good,Very challenging and fast pace work environment. But ideal place to learn since they are on the cutting edge of technology and uses current industry best practices and project life cycle methodologies.
good,"start the day by taking manpower and assigning work assignments"
good,"I enjoyed working at BGE, it is very good company to work for , they treat contractors with respect and the work place culture is little backward they have to update."
good,Productive and good work ethics but very demanding. Supportive management. work is very demanding but also rewarding incentives when yearly goals are accomplished
good,"Good pay and nice place to work. Great benefits package options."
good,"I would recommend this company.  Strong Management, workplace culture and respected in the area.  I believe a self motivated professional would fit in very well and be successful."
good,I would recommend this job to any person who has a good military background and that's a responsible and punctual individual. There's a lot of opportunity to excel and be promoted to higher positions. The wages are probably the highest of any security company in the United States. An the perks are great compared to any other place I've ever read reviews on. Management isn't afraid to accept the challenge to help you with you on any problems personal or work related.
good,Co-op opportunities at organizations where creativity and innovation are the core principals.Friendly and learnt a lot
good,"At Exelon, I am a desktop support intern. During my time at Exelon, I was able to gain an substantial amount of knowledge about information technology. My daily tasked ranged from re-imaging computers to trouble shooting technical difficulties that people are having with their computer."
good,Exelon is very focused on career improvement and betterment of their employees. This company allowed me to be deeply exposed to the power generation industry specifically the wind energy industry. Exelon has management divided regionally across the country with a central corporate office. Exelon Wind is very successful in changing for improvement of their business.
good,"The largest nuclear fleet in the US.  This is part of Exelon's diversified strategy to be the industry leader in energy supply in the US.  Exelon provides gas and electric energy to northeast, mid-atlantic, and midwest states in the united states, and has an unquestionable record of safety and reliability.  Exelon employs thousands of people throughout america and has been a stewart of environmental responsibility.  I spent over 23 years with Exelon and only left to seek a different challenge at Entergy.  Exelon provided a rewarding and challenging environment for over 23 years and my decision to leave was very hard to make."
good,"I enjoyed working at Exelon Mobile, it was great being about to advance my social skills by assisting over a hundred customers a day. My co-workers and I grew close we worked as a team and remained friends outside of the office. There was just a lack of employees and time was cut, therefore I am looking for some place to work thats new and more stable!"
good,Not a bad place to work.  The company cares about its employees and want them to be well trained.  Some people are willing to help while others are not (such is life).
good,"Excellent company to work in US, Good Salary/Benefits, Job culture and Management. However, International relocation not possible since no offices outside US, especially in India."
good,"In transmission system operations at Exelon, a worker would experience twelve hour, rotating shifts under direct supervision of a shift manager, and paired with a team mate.  During a typical day shift, one would face the challenges of assigning job responsibilities and preparing repaired equipment for service.  On the evening shift, a worker would typically prepare equipment for maintenance / repairs on the following day.  The hardest part of the job is the dynamics.  It is ever evolving with constant changes.  The most enjoyable part is the challenge.  You never have the same day twice.  Exelon has helped instill core values, at home as well as the work place."
good,"I work in the Corporate and Information Security Dept, the people are great to work with and they love to have fun..you can learn alot in this department, but that depends on YOU! They are always looking to promote from within...I enjoy working here and there is alot of flexibility with my work schedule.."
good,I started as an entry level guard and within a year was promoted to supervisor.  The hours are long and tedious as you are there to stay awake.
good,"•	Providing Tier 1 & 2 and System Administration support for end users both employees and contractors              who have access to Constellation\Exelon network and applications. "
good,This company has its ups and downs. A great place to excel as a technician. Although the politics do interfere with good work habits and chemistry.
good,"Conduct patrols, escorts, searches."
good,Exelon is a great place to work. Good benefits. Hard to advance in Management.
good,I would help my team review issues pertaining to the various electrical systems in the nuclear power plant. This included reviewing and creating excel documents containing various codes and qualifications that needed to be submitted to the management system.  I assisted a few coworkers on write ups of various issues of particular electrical systems.
good,Great work place. Great bosses and fun people! Always someone to help out and look out for you.
good,"Great culture, Nice working environment. Get to do hands on work as an intern."
good,"My Schedule: Monday-Friday: 7am-330pm  plus every 3rd month on call 24 / 7 days a week."

good,were working in agile environment which I feel good after a long day at work
good,"I worked in the security division at Exelon. I worked a rotating shift that covered 5pm-630am. You work long days and hours. Overtime comes in spurts but when it does you have to dedicate your entire week to it. You dont get too much personal time when working normally but the pay, benefits, and paid time off makes up for it. I worked 3 straight weekends, then had 3 weekends off, except when overtime hit, then you work one or two of your weekends off. There was monthly cotinuous training that covered corporate and homeland security policy and training points. There was quarterly weapons qualifying with rifles and handguns. I wore about 75 pounds of equipment daily and my be body feels it eveeryday. Exelon is extremely safety concious which is good but at the same time can bad because the slightest mistake, even an innocent/unintentional one will get you immediately fired."

good,"I worked here as an intern for PECO Energy (a subsidiary company of Exelon). Overall, I really enjoyed my time here and definitely learned a lot. My manager was very nice and she walked through and showed all the job responsibilities. I wish there would be more tasks to do. Also, repetitive tasks, might just be because I'm an intern.

good,Well I was in training the whole day. Learned a lot of information very quickly. Waste of time and companies money. Management not the best. Having a instructer teacjing the class and having no idea what he was doing. The hardest part of the job was all of the school you had. I would bring the frustration home with me. I will never do that again. Most enjoyable part of the job was able to do work.

I have always felt challenged and supported at Exelon. There are tons of opportunities for good performers at this company."
good,"I worked for a great team. The work Life balance was amazing. If you're new entry level,be prepared. Some teams won't train you. I had to teach myself everything I know. Other teams will help their entry level employees learn the material, So it's not a representation of the company as a whole. Just be a self started and motivated to learn on your own, and you'll do fine."
good,Lots of variety and challenge...never bored and always learning!  Great team and it is refreshing to work for an organization that embraces talent management.

I learned that both independence and teamwork work in tangent. It all depends on the tasks and situations at that moment. The hardest part of the job was the time constraints on certain tasks and client issues and being over-encumbered by them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the configuration of new hire PC's as well as troubleshooting a client's issue and fixing the issue that day."

good,Excellent pay and benefits with great career advancement opportunities.
good,Startex Power was wonderful  on all levels to work for. You wanted to come to work and perform your best. Once it sold to Constellation we lost our culture and it was just a job at that point. Then to be sold to Exelon the job became more of a chore. There was no human side to be found which is why Startex excelled.
good,High energy work atmosphere full of highly driven individuals producing results that are dynamic.
good,Great company to work for until they  announced we were closing a a year and 3 months earlier than expected. A lot of unanswered questions and uncertainty.

good,"12+ hour shifts. Qualifications that you have to re-do annually. Not a real hard job. Lots of unnecessary drama and stress. Great place to work until you have an injury or a health issue, then management and human resources is useless."
good,it has friendly atmosphere. People are willing to teach you whatever you would want to learn. But really hard to move up as a lot of work politics involves. Free lunches and as long as your work is being completed no one pays attention to what you are doing.

Working with such a great team has made it a fun working environment.  There is obviously some small down sides but overall its a great company to work for.
good,"The Nuclear Power industry represents a key component of our nation's electrical energy mix.  Sometimes ""keeping those turbines spinning"" can pose some of the most complex problems, not only from a physical (plant configuration) standpoint, but from a regulatory, and at times, public perception standpoint.

The co-worker are not bad to work with get use to them. The hardest part of the job is being alert for long period of time.
good,"My intern experience with this company was fair, I had a chance to work inside a corporate setting and learn a few new skills such as SharePoint, InfoPath and Data analysis. My supervisor in my opinion could have tried a little harder to provide me with work because I had a lot of downtime which I had to make use of with demonstrating my eagerness to learn and look for work to do on my own."
good,"The company offers great compensation and lots of opportunities to try different roles.  But if you want to really make it, you need to play politics to get ahead at this company."
good,"I was a contractor and loved working for this company, I was hoping to go permanent. I would recommend this place to anyone. The people was awesome and make you feel comfortable."

The job is very dangerous and requires 100% attention to detail. Overall although stressful, the benefits and pay along with advancement opportunities make it a great career opportunity."

As Manager you will have to get your direct reports out into the field in a timely manner, and you will have limited time to be in the field with them and also in meetings and do your computer work as well.

The only thing I will say as an a part-timer they make it difficult to obtain other employment because your hours change soooo much.  Other than that it's really a wonderful place to work.
good,I was given three projects throughout the summer and then presented my work to the executives in August.  My projects were boring because I wasn't qualified to do much but the permanent employees let me shadow them a lot.  Everyone was so friendly.
good,I have been a contractor for 3 months now and I love the Nuclear world. Everyday is very exciting and I look forward to coming to work everyday.

good,"Exelon is a good place to work. Employees are treated well and compensated fairly. The company promotes from within and gives employees opportunities to pivot to new types of roles. It's a great place for smart hard-working people are who seeking a healthy work-life balance (although not all departments are the same in this).  The culture is pretty standard for a Fortune 500 company: people are generally respectful, hierarchy is important but not overly rigid, and decisions are made in a slow risk-averse manner.  Decisions are a little slower than the average company,  but this is somewhat expected given that Exelon is primarily a regulated utility business."
good,Exelon is a great place to work and learn. We received tickets any time while on duty and the whole team has to jump on it to get it fixed.I learned a lot from there pretty much i feel like a tier 3 engineer now fully loaded of experiences and knowledges.
good,The I&C Training Labs are somewhat small.  The management team is easy to work with and they are always open to improvement recommendations.  The distant learning classrooms are very easy to use.  Students use iPads for their lab documents and exams.
good,"Exelon prided themselves on an internship in which we did more than ""push boxes around"" each Intern was assigned to a a supervisor, given a partner and given a series of tasks, that, while supervised were both productive, challenging and informative. My partner and I designed an interactive chart comparing chemical sensitives of all the cable types used by the company, and we were required to dig out the primary sources for the research ourselves."
