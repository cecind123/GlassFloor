rating,review
bad,"Iron mountain keeps pushing you to work fast and fast and fast. they don't care about their employees rather they only care about their profit. All couriers and warehouse clerks and coordinators are part of Union. supervisors are not part of Union. so Supervisors keep pushing the Union members to work fast because they will get bonus. My advise is don't ever think about working with company. Nice coworkers but very rude Management. The management will kill you because of too much pushing. The management members like supervisors, managers, general managers etc... are rude like hyenas who will keep pushing pushing pushing to get job done early so they can save money by giving you less hours."
bad,Was employed there as a driver for 30 years and was fired without warning. The management and supervisors don't have your back. Don't go the extra mile for them they will just let you run out of gas and leave you.
bad,This company made me very unhappy and depressed. Nothing good came from this company. My only regret was being hired. I really dislike working at iron mountain.
bad,the managers are liars they don't have anything else to do other than sit on their computer all day don't answer when u need they're pretty much just unintelligent
bad,one of the worst company I ever work for all supervisor are Caucasian and racist they treat you different from ur other co-work if ur black when they don't have any work for you to do they going to send you out with non CDL Drivers to help them to go pick up papers
bad,"Poor Management, was put to work in a windowless, freezing cold warehouse in winter in East Ham (London), had to pick between 100/1000 medical files which had to be delivered to a hospital."
bad,I had one of the worst experience working for this company managements very unprofessional they don't answer phone calls when you need something important have to file  charge on one of the female that work there.she grab on my genitals.they quick to fire you if you back talk them
bad,The unethical labor practices and client relationship practices are beyond abusive. Do not work for this company. They have been aired over unethical business practices before.
bad,Bad management  no direction wouldn't recommend this place at all I hated the time I wasted being employed by these people they use you until you cant be used any more.
bad,It was ok in the beginning but to much politics you're never going to move up in the company if you're a driver my best advice is work there if you're just looking for a job other than that you will be miserable
bad,"Management will taunt and bully you in front of everyone about anything you do “wrong”. There is severe discrimination and favouritism and only management favourites are immune to their bullying and harassment."
bad,Pouca oportunidade de crescimento. Horário de trabalho excelente.
bad,"Dont ever ever ever ever work in the warehouse. Cheap pay for hard labor. Modern day slavery. Horrible managment, who knows the pay is terrible. So they put mentally unstable people in positions of power to get a point across. Dead end job and noopportunity for growth unless you know somebody in a position of. LIVING in North Korea might be a better option than working in the warehouse for Ironmountain "
bad,Faz excepção de pessoas. Nâo evita conflito apoia so antigos. Mau planejada com PDC.
bad,I was promised a permanent position after working there a year that never happened.Management is always threatening to get rid of the temporary workers but we worked just as hard as the regular workers. Shmeka Green is a poor example of management. Someone really needs to investigate that site in homewood. Working conditions and the Marall is very low
bad,"Sucks badly.  Superviser at the Bristol location is  the worst. Sent me to the farther location because i couldnt do as many otders as HE wanted, bot as many as i was REQUIRED to do."
bad,Management needs training! Supervisors thought they were the OWNERS. If you didnt follower some of the employee's rules  they would turn on you. Just rude!! Racist COMPANY!
bad,"They dont give you a key card to access the building, so you have to wait for the manager to show up and let you in when she feels like coming to work. She would often show up late and then have a attitude because she had to let you in. Even though it was supposed to be data entry, there was a lot of heavy lifting of boxes weighing 40 to 60 pounds daily. They were only paying barely above minimum wage. "
bad,I got terminated for a ridiculous reason. Good insurance. I worked there for a year and I worked more hours than I got paid. I was salary and I always worked on Saturday and did not get paid.
bad,"Very stressful environment, give you too many stops to do with impossible times to complete them. Tell management about safety issues and was told ""Just do it"".Favoritism for certain drivers, while other drivers would have to pick up the slack and get double to triple the workload. Very unsafe work environment."
bad,"They gave you no proper training and expected you to keep up with the rest in your second week. I don't know how a permanent employees are treated, but as a temp I won't go back even if I could. Feel like a prisoner at work and needing someone to let me into my work area and the bathroom. I was told by management that morning how well I was doing so well.   However after my work day was over the agency called to let me know the assignment was over.  Recording information from files in the computer, I  learned how to be fast and accurate. Management did no have too much professionalism. Typical day was spent in data entry are behinda computer off the warehouse."
bad,Pues yo trabaje para esta empresa no hace poco y la verdad es una empresa que siempre busca explotar a su empleado no tienen buena administración desde sus coordinadores ineptos hasta su gerente de plaza...
bad,"bad management poor work environment very dirty old and rusty"
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. The office was horribly managed and they treated their employees very poorly. It was a very toxic environment and they weren't shy to show their lack of concern or respect for their employees. The only reason I staid there for two years was I was able to work there and go to school. The company gave us paid sick days, but would punish us for using them. If you called out sick you were given a write up. I was so happy when I left there."
bad,not the greatest company to work for always pushing and making you work like a slave and don't care about you even though you could be sick one day and always telling you can be replaceable and always under pay and keep saying its cause your getting benefits also the benefits not that great ether
bad,Iron Mountain tolère le racisme et l'intimidation.
bad,"You arrive early to get a parking spot, have to wait outside before they let you into the company, you punch in your time, you wait until they tell you where to go, they have morning meetings, then you start work. You get folders of different company clients and you sort through the paperwork to prep the documents for staples, wringles, bent and folded papers, anything that will prevent the document from being scanned, you sit in an old open warehouse with not enough fans to keep you cool during the summer or no heat to keep you warm when it is cold, the workers are disrespected and treated as though they don't belong there as pretty much everyone is a temp and is a temp for long periods of time and a possibility of never being a permanent employee. the working conditions are not suitable for working. There is in my opinion no enjoyable experience to working at Iron Mountain."
bad,American led organisation slightly out of touch. Felt that there was no structure or clear direction in which to take the business at the time of my employment.
bad,Very poor communication with management. Not very helpful when help needed. No consideration for employees what's so ever.  Work culture was very poor.
bad,"Force you to to run, in a 4km squared warehouse with no heat or ac, for 3 stories of stored boxes. Also, would follow you around with a stop watch to ensure you were moving fast enough for performance without considering the safety of others."
bad,"The management that first showed up here. I thought was ok. But in due time, the true color came thru. Cut throut. I"
bad,Shipping and receiving of information including hard copies and soft copies and put into shelve and scan and submit report to supervisor. timings are 8:00am to 4:30 pm Monday to Friday.
bad,The job wasn’t hard it was the culture and the management of the place .... the job doesn’t treat there employees as grown adults..... the employees are treated as  prisoners with very low pay
bad,"Cut throat, back stabbing, management had no integrity.  Management is very combative with a lack of patience. I would not recommend anyone to seek a career at this company.  Their is a lack of dignity and respect for the employees."
bad,bad management horrible working conditions management cool once they train after that lack of respect towards employees especially contract employee crack of dawn working hours
bad,"bought our company, used us for the transition, then fired us."
bad,"not a place to work, management is unreasonable, not willing to work with you on anything, only care out the bottom dollar not employees.  just a bad place to work."
bad,This company is a joke they let their employees run the show if you have complaints about other employees they do nothing about it the company forces you to work weekends and very long days with a lot of heavy pushing I would never recommend this company to anybody to ever work for their the worst company ever
bad,"if you like not making money and working less then 40 hours. Paying too much for health insurance, then this is the place for you."
bad,When I worked here I was told I didn't have a desk in London so needed to commute to Reading every day.  Management was terrible with a culture of intimidation and mild bullying.  Some good training programs but overall a bad place to work.
bad,Would have never thought I experience what I did at this job. So unorganized and in need of new management ASAP! There only concern is getting more money for the company and could care less about there workers.
bad,The company closed and changed hands to become Iron Mountain. The company was before it changed has was productive and had a great environment the staff were all either terminated or given buy outs.
bad,"Muy mal trato al personal que postula, íbamos a entrar 3 personas para el puesto de movimientos iniciales, nos hicieron pasar por varias entrevistas, hasta examen medico ,firmamos papeles para entrar  un lunes y nos llaman diciendo que ya no iban a contar con nosotros, eso es una falta de respeto y poca seriedad señores."
bad,You better not have so much as a parking ticket on your record let alone anything else or they wont hire you. They act like your applying to work for the FBI or something.
bad,"Muy mala gestión"
bad,It was a temp job but the work environment was horrible. They people I worked with were good but the management did not do their jobs properly. Unorganized!!!!
bad,gestores arrogantes e forçam você a fazer do jeito deles e se der o problema o culpado e você.
bad,"Some workers did whatever they liked and no one said anything. "
bad,"If you don't care you licence and you want to broke your back come and work for iron mountain , managers in Jersey City they don't care if you lose your license for because you take care they customer they fire you they don't care your family they don't care how much you work you do ,they don't care how much year you work for the company this company need teamster union immediately ......"
bad,"In the 8 years i worked here, we had 5 transportation managers, and 4 directors. All but 1 was an outside hire. They kept changing the workplace . My first year was great, after that this pace became toxic. Would work you 59.5 hours in one week and take your keys from you to unload your truck so that the DOT 60 3 day off period wouldn't kick in. Very shady and unstable. Would of bee alot better with a Union in place."
bad,"This place is a joke. The managers  don't know what they are doing. You are given lots of sick time, vacation time but you never get approved to actually take the time off and if you do because of an emergency they will make you do double shifts. They don't take care of the trucks and they will let you break down in a different state and then leave you there. If you're not a butt kisser good luck getting a promotion. They don't pay you enough for what you do. You can get fired for any little thing. TOO much stress! This place SUCKS!!"
bad,This was by far the worst job I've ever had.. this pathetic company will work you until you drop and still try to get some work out of you..if i could give a zero rating i would if you want to get worked like a dog iron mountain is your company when i worked their we called it slave mountain that's how bad it was I'm beyond happy to be away from this place..
bad,"They treat everyone horrible, they push you to the maximum limits and honestly treat you like garbage. They don't value the long hours that you put in, the time you are spending working overtime. So that management can meet their end of the year bonus quota, only to let you go once it is met. They use people."
bad,If you care about your license and your safety don't work here. It's every morning management will give you a route that only superman can complete with no regard to your license or health whatsoever. Management will act nice right to your face then stab you in the back when you are falling behind on your route. They only care about their trucks and the pick ups being made. They refuse to reward their hard working employees with good raises instead they'll just pile more work if you're done early and just watch every move on your scanner. Overall not worth 17.02 per hour to be treated like a common criminal.
bad,"If you want to waste your life away this is the place for you pay peanuts get monkeys, management don't care about issues from employees. This place needs an overhaul especially with gung-ho loose cannon managers, this place always has a high turn over as the money is poor and the average age of staff is in  the fifties.avoid."
bad,you are paid off bin scans and not worth the headache. there is no growth with the company and they cant keep driver because they dont pay but want you to work 50 plus hours a week . you have no life and the trucks are trash. u get paid every two weeks which sucks for a truck driver
bad,It was the most unprofessional experience I've ever had they scheduled me for an interview and had me work 2 days fired me and said i had to take a drug test but never informed me of this before my employment. And when they asked the manager why they hired me before doing a drug test and background check she responded ''i just figured that he had taken a drug test''.
bad,"Always on your feet all day."
bad,"Had to resign due to unpaid compensation."
bad,Worked there for 8 years and they did not know I had 2 degrees? There was a layoff to off shore jobs
bad,el ambiente laboral es pesado. los ejecutivos no son responsables
bad,"uma empresa muito ruin de trabalhar, não indico a ninguem."
bad,moving big boxes down stairs with out help. doing thing with out any help.
bad,Steady work and pay check. Hostile environment and stressful place to work. Extremely rude and incompetent people running things there
bad,Don't work here they don't care about you that's all I can say I worked at tha one in port allen la an I will never go bck there again bc its not fair they have their picks an chooses who they like
bad,Management really has no care in the world about their employees but themselves. They force you into changing your ways/benefits to see fits within their budgets. If not you pay more either way. This is why they encourage employee's not to vote in making this company a union. Can always have control.
bad,A lot of work. The department is very unorganized. You have to contract for 1 year. Still don't know if you are hired full time.
bad,ik ben gewoon toe aan een nieuwe uitdaging.
bad,"New people are lucky if they can survive a year in this place. Training for new employees non existant, as seasoned employees withhold information in an attempt to sabatoge new employees for fear of saving their own jobs when the quarterltly/ yearly layoffs rear their ugly heads. Different standards/ rules apply for different workers depending on which work clique you belong to."
bad,"All work, no play, stressed teamwork but you worked so hard alone without support; little job satisfaction and poor salary based on efforts"
bad,They have decent benefits. if not for the benefits I would have quit a long time ago. I would not recommend working at Iron Mountain to anyone. In my 5 years with the company I’ve had 5 supervisors.
bad,"Worse place I ever worked.  The work itself was not bad but management and coworkers were horrible. Vicious backstabbing people who lied and if they target you, you don't stand a chance.  Anyone can decide they want you out and make up lies and you're out!  The HR manager was the biggest liar I ever met and couldn't look you in the eye without her eyes batting rapidly.  Horrible woman.  The C"
bad,That had to be one of the most stressful jobs I ever had. They pick on you for ever mistake you made. I never saw a company that showed so much favoritism.
bad,"Have never worked in a such a poorly organised place of work! "
bad,"Driving all long island picking up different companies documents, in a day the driver had to do 15 to 18 stop's and in each stop had to pickup from 150 boxes to 200+ by yourself, and if you finish your trips early and go to the terminal they would give you more stops, the pay was not good, I was there for 2 year and no rise, when it was time for a review they let me go..."
bad,"People with double-standards who only aim to cover their lack of skills by interpersonal relationship within the workplace. No chance to advance in such environment. Toxic atmosphere and lack of communication in between the shifts. Managprent calling themselfs professionals when acting like banch of kids at school wshispering behind everyones back. No respect for workers, discrimination from the manager who is showing her power by treating people like they don't mean anything. Double-faced supervisor and team leaders who are exchanging personnal information about employees with each other."
bad,"Iron mountain should never be mentioned in the same breath as the word Employer. They are not. There is no mutual respect given for your work, time and the physical use of your body.  All employees are treated as slaves who are expendable. They will ask you to do things that could compromise your physical health. Managers and supervisors will play mind games with you because they are too concerned about losing their positions then sticking up for and doing whats right. You will be asked to do other jobs than what you were hired for. "
bad,iron mountain is the worst workplace i have ever seen dont send any candidate there if he is well educated .. this company is only fir illiterate people
bad,iron Mountain is not concerned about their employees needs.  They work you hard and for long hours.  They have limited staff and resources and the employee must still work under these conditions.
bad,Unorganized place to work for. The management will give you a enormous amount of stops for you to complete and really expect you to finish them all ....mixing off site shredding with on site shredding is against company policy but the supervisors don't care...the turn around ratio is high....the can't keep people there at all...
bad,"3 yrs casual..got picked on the entire time."
bad,"It is a growing company in India. We had many opportunities to participate in business activity and organic growth. KRA was not clearly defined as well as ground employees were not willing to follow KRA.  HR policy was very poor and unsystematic. Conflict of role and responsibility. Poor work culture. Inefficient systems and waste of resources due to undefined policy, SOP/SOW. Very few people were dedicated to their duties but they had to suffer to discharge their responsibility. Majority of workforce is contract staff."
bad,"The company had no safety vests for workers to wear and saw nothing wrong with this clear violation of labour law in an environment where forklifts and heavy equipment routinely operate. Management is inept and demanding, blaming workers for being unable to meet impossible quotas while offering meaningless or even detrimental advice to achieve these quotas. "
bad,My coworkers aren't very interesting people and cowardly. Bosses walk all over us while they lounge in their fancy offices and fancy cars and give themselves pay raises.
bad,"I had received an hour of training and if I have the nerve to ask any questions, I get a snarky/snotty remark IF ANY at all."
bad,If you like pulling boxes like a robot it's the job for you. Sucks. That place is a joke. They treat you like you can't find something better.  I have  Class A cdl and was in between jobs.  I make 10 dollars more an hr and 90% less work.
bad,Poor management. No team work ever! No reinforcements from management to apply on certain employee(s) who misbehaves and let them get away with it. Management need to be reviewed.
bad,"Stay away from this job. Low pay, even harder work! The operation manager is a complete fool. Micro management to the extreme. Alot of politics. You push a trash bin in office buildings, hospitals, etc, weighing  300+lbs. Worst professional driving job in my career. Driver turnover HIGH"
bad,Got hurt on job and when returning to work was not given work that was reasonable to complete. Then got offered a place to work that was in another city(k.c.mo) and poor location. When i asked for another opportunity was told that none others would be willing to work with them and yet i found more on my own that said they would welcome the needed help and to have hr give them a call. No one would answer me or call back for me to relay the jobs that were accepting new hires using the new plan from iron mountain. Had worked in the same location for 17 years and they literally turned there backs on me andlet go unceremoniously to put it mildly. Was really hurt being treated this way after my devoted service and commitment to the company.
bad,Unfortunately like most companies the management team is lacking.  I firmly believe that most managers should be required to take extensive training on leadership and management.  The company overall doesn't much care about their employees.  Most people there are unhappy and demotivated.
bad,"I needed work so stayed, but every day was uncertain and a dread. We basically worked ourselves out of a job. Greatly underappreciated and the spirit of competition effected all.  Obvious favoritism along with ones blatantly thinking they were better than others."
bad,"One meeting they tell you a cost of living adj is coming, then it becomes merit based 2 out of 15 drivers get nothing. No incentives (used to give a turkey,that ended too) management could care less. No one listens even up the chain of corporate. HR is worthless. Alot of issues would have been fixed if higher ups gave a flip. Hired 3 ppl, all quit in same week. Ridiculous expectations. Better pack a lunch you can eat while driving, because 27 stops in 8 hours means no break."
bad,Back breaking days hauling heavy bins of paper while they track your every step. Your route is made by a computer and guy who never did your job. Remember you never work hard enough and your manager will tell you about the time he supposedly did what your expected to. If you have a CDL you need it to drive a non CDL truck.
bad,"Large bureaucratic company lead by Old thinking leaders using antiquated technology and business practices."
bad,"Very poor management. Don't care at all about workers. If you working there you are like a robot. Just make them targets.. Work places very dusty. If you do not relative with management you have no chance for increase your qualification. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be being out on sales calls. I learned a lot on document storage and security. Management was constantly turning over to the point where customers were noticing. The workplace culture seemed to be quiet, especially for a sales focused business. The hardest part of the job was the leadership turnover. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,"I became an Iron Mountain employee during the transition from Recall to Iron Mountain, so it was expected to be stressful during the merger. During the merger the work hours became longer. Training had to be provided to two offshore teams. The offshore teams both acquired all of our positions that I previously managed."
bad,the day is spent trying to get through your emails. the sales team is always at your neck while your manager tells you not to do certain things. lots of mixed messaging.
bad,"Empresa comtém varios funcionarios, várias tarefas"
bad,"comp system is outdated & counter productive, I am not allowed to say much more. happy to no longer to be working there, everyone but one person likes working there"
bad,"Bad management"
bad,Management don't want to see you get along with co workers unless you are one of there favorites    The way they route makes no sense at all. You will be in an area and see 3 other Iron Mountain trucks and that makes sense to them.
bad,"The workplace has become extremely negative driving most of the good people away.  Advancement is via ""buddy system"" not merit.  Constant management rotation, non good.  Very difficult to get paid commission"
bad,"Was employed through agency. Worked there for one week, then the agency rang me up and essentially told me I was fired. Zero explanation as to why. I worked hard and was never late, made a couple of mistakes but this is normal in any job"
bad,"You have to live for the company."
bad,"Gestores ruins, ambiente sujo, horrivel, gestora escolhidas funcionários para  fazer intrigas."
bad,i went through the the whole process of getting this job as a class B shred. I get a call out of the blue one day saying were not going any further with your application. I have a clean record and class A license. When I asked why not they said it was a discrepancy on my background. When I asked what it was the HR recruiter said she didn't know. Lol. Wow! I had to call the background company myself to find out a date on a job wasn't correct. All they had to do is call me and ask those questions I could have provided any information they needed. Words of advice cover yourself if they give you an offer letter. Make sure it has whatever you need to cover you in it if they decide to rescind the offer. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone especially with all the teamsters and union harassment. Stay clear of iron mountain.
bad,"They recruited a moron to run the team. He bullied me out of my job and I had to take them to FWA to have the issue resolved in my favour."
bad,"Had to work extra hours on a consistant basis.  Tied to my cell phone 24 hours a day.  Manager was VERY unapproachable, very distant."
bad,Comme travailleur dans le secteur de productions dans la région de Montréal depuis quelques mois la compagnie a dû réduire leurs coûts en coupant plusieurs postes de cadre car la compagnie ont des difficultés financières.  Cette situation fait en cause que nous devons maintenant travailler dans un environnement très stressante.  Nos superviseurs sont surchargés de travail et n’ont aucune patience à notre égard et nous comprenons leurs situations mais par contre nous n’avons pas à subir d’être traiter de cette façon à cause des problèmes financiers de la compagnie.  Nous sommes des employés syndiqués ce qui veux dire que si cette situation ne change pas dans les semaines qui suive l’équipe aurons recours aux représentants syndicaux.
bad,There is no work life balance at all. Managers will call after hours near bedtime. Unrealistic goals in most markets. Manager will not respond to help
bad,"Stressant et haur dirigeants rien à fouttre des employés sur le terrain. Axé sur la productivité."
bad,no cumple con lo que le dicen a uno en el momento de la cotratacion
bad,"I believe they grew too big to quickly. Management too cocky and full of themselves. Was a great company when I first started but they changed. Daily quotas for everyone, sales, drivers, cold calls, inside workers."
bad,very much a poor place too work. Unable to communicate adequately about unrealistic performance guidelines for employees. Unfair hiring and firing policies. Was let go after17years of very dedicated hard work for no reason.
bad,"Would have recommend Iron Mountain a couple of years ago but recently the turnover is awful, the new senior leadership could care less about employees and everyone likes to throw each other under the bus. Its very sad to see as it used to be such a friendly & supportive culture. I do not recommend working here, the continue amount of change and turnover is alarming, most of the good employees have left due to this."
bad,"Poor training,  difficulty with verification of procedures, clarification of expectations & requirements. Little to no training on how the systems work & how to utilize them."
bad,"The good: It's growing by acquisition and most people are nice. Cafeteria is nice."
bad,"All leads had bad attitude. Un helpfull when training! played inappropriate music. not organized if u ask questions they would get angry.also one lead would say do it this way then another would say its wrong then when u questioned it the whole lead team would be"
bad,"I work there for 8 months as a teamleader after being with recall for 6yrs( the company they bought out). It was by far the most pathetic demanding job ever! Ridiculous targets, clueless management! Untold amounts of work and if you was caught having a breather you would be called to the office to explian why you have stopped. Cant even get your phone out to check the time! Just a tip avoid this job if you have a life because this company certainly doesnt care about its employees."
bad,It's all about who you're friends with over . Who's is getting promoting by doing a good job. You never feel like your job is safe. High turnover in management.
bad,"If you really need a job, that's what you'll get here. They won't pay you a CDL drivers' wage. They'll promise you lots of work and as soon as you get used to it, they cut your hours. They say they promote from within, but if you apply to move up, your app will be ignored. You'll end up with 4 or 5 supervisors and not know which one to listen to. The majority of the people I worked with were actively looking for other jobs. And if the supervisors' lips were moving, they were lying."
bad,"Recall has a parent company in Australia that put Recall up for sale last August. They terminated 6% of the work force in preparation for the sale. After 10 months, all interested buyers had backed out of a potential purchase due to poor cash flow and declining profits. Brambles is now retaining Recall, but is still looking to dump this business to focus on CHEP and IFCO."
bad,Working at iron mountain was alright at first but then they started cutting back salary and not working their employers enough hours. It good if your just looking for a place to get a little extra cash but if your planning on surviving off of it then I wouldn’t recommend it.
bad,"Insight Global provides them a steady stream of disposable people to do what they need done, all the while lying to them. Promising to get them hired, get them a raise, get them benefits. Then one morning the temp gets a phone call saying ""you are no longer needed, do not report.  We will send you your things"" which they don't do.  1 lady's belongings sat there for 3 weeks, I boxed them up for her.  You aren't allowed to go vack for your stuff.  Swcurity doesn't let you in."
bad,"The condition of the buildings was so poor, that I would get alarm calls constantly. Many requiring me to go to the buildings in the middle of the night. I've had flooding from roofs, flooding from sprinkler breaks, a fire, homeless camps behind buildings, break ins, etc. I could never go on vacation, or get a break from these calls."
bad,This is the worse company I have ever worked for the  management is very unprofessional they go in and tell all your personal  business for instants if you called out
bad,The hours were the best part about this job. But management did not appreciate the hard work that we did each and every day. Very physical work environment but horrible pay. No career advancement either and toxic work environment. I would not recommend this job
bad,Most of the colleagues I knew were only there for a few years.  None of the peers really enjoyed working for Iron Mountain.  In my department our head was the Narcissist type and wanted everything his way.
bad,"Typical day is not knowing what the day will be like. there are not enough man power to get everything done. The have engineers that calculate how long it takes to put a box away on a empty shelf. When it's not realistic because you will not see an empty shelf and to put away a pallet of boxes that would have taken 30min to put away takes 1 hour to put away because you are looking for empty locations. What is most discouraging, is  Iron Mountain has out sourced their Human Resource and IT personnel overseas. You must be careful how you ask them for help, because asking for D.O.T. information may not make sense to them because they don't have that lingo over there. Instead  you would have to say "" Department of Transportaion"" info.  The hardest part of this job is the lack of communication between employees."
bad,"A company in constant turmoil, lack of talented leadership and a complete apathy for the people and vendors that held the whole thing together.              ........."
bad,"Your workforce is constantly looking for newer jobs outside of the company. You are not addressing real issues within your own organization. If you don't fix this, one day you will lose all of your best people and your stock prices will plummet because you've outsourced all of the positions and your customers are unhappy with their service. Work more on building your company up within and then work more on expansion.  A happy company with happy workers is a profitable company."
bad,"Paid Holidays, vacation time is great if you can get the time off."
bad,"Worked fulltime in the shredding plant, okay position, management a little rude to workers. Overall experience with the company was okay."
bad,Bu sirkette çalışarak hizmet veren 5 le 6 sene arası arkadaşlarım var ve işlerini verimli yaptıkları halde yukselememekteler
bad,This company has very little diversity.  It doesnt seem like they promote or develop or believe in being a diverse company.  You can look at the top players and see this is the case and continues to be the case.
bad,If it's your first job outside of flipping burgers you would think you made it. They are the lowest paying job I have ever seen. I was a temp and they wanted me to go perm for the same pay! Wasn't having it. I did DMS the smallest team in the building it was literally 3 people doing 15 people's job. They are disorganized and have a fake persona just to close the merger. 90% of the customers hate them. Account Manager are pointless they sell a dream and disappear and frontline has to take the lashing ...they only have 2 cancellation people funny seeing as people want to close their accounts left and right. There is only 1 billing specialist which is the dumbest idea because every call someone needs help trying to figure out what the nickel and dime here and there is. The job physically made me sick. I can't tell you how many nights I sat up trying to figure out what foolery would take place. I was a great worker I gave them hours and policies to enforce. I completed the work of my entire team in a single shift. I even helped my manager. I hope the merger happens my advice to the new owners lay off 80% of the people at headquarters in Norcross.
bad,"If you have respect for your health dont work in this company. As advertised required heavy lifting up to 70 lbs. Did not emphasize that one person should build at least 14  skids with 48 boxes in every skid. Plus very dusty boxes most are decade or more old. Dust and molds are other factors encountered daily. Every week at least one employee get sick. Very prone to hurt self and pay is not worthy."
bad,This place is a sweat shop that should be shut down. No air. Unrealistic goals and productivity to meet each and every hour. Management is very rude! They talk to you like you have no sense. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to work at this company.
bad,1.5 out of 5.
bad,I was there 7 years and the last 2 were not great. The company overall lost focus for the customer and decided that it was all about the #'s and if you did not meet the #'s you were hounded and harassed. Then the company changed there minds and tried to refocus on the customer instead of the #'s but this changed from week to week. The moral was very low and when you tried to talk about it with a supervisior you were told things like you are costing the company 10's of thousands of dollars or that you were attracting negative customers through the phone lines and could never get a straight answer from anyone. I am no longer with this company and i would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"When I was there, there was huge exodus from upper management. I was shocked at all the people leaving. I tried to keep my head down and focus on delivering my objectives, but eventually got axed. They were understaffed and I felt like I was the dumping ground for work nobody else wanted to do. They hired a new director (who became my manager) and the guy was embarrassingly lacking in basic communication skills. I was there for less than a year, but it was so stressful because of the chaos going on around me. I would not recommend for anybody. Don't waste your time here."
bad,The management at the company is divisive and doesn't support the employees like they say they do. There is always some type of racial undertone going on at the company. They are never satisfied with you doing the route that they gave you to do.
bad,"Te mantienen 6 meses con contrato externo, si tienes algo de suerte, luego 6 más por planta y luego te finiquitan porque no tienen proyectos para más gente, ilusionan con una estabilidad que nunca llega.Y después te vuelven  a ofrecer volver pero como externo otra vez, así  juegan con la necesidad del trabajador.Y de los afortunados antiguos cada vez quedan menos porque igual los están finiquitando."
bad,If your looking for a good paying jobdon't go to Iron MountainHorrible compensationAnd horrible yearly raisesAll while the company buys other companie
bad,"This is a huge corporation that does everything it can to give you as little as possible, while wasting vast sums of money on bologna. Your only chance for advancement will be if someone leaves. The work is tedious. It's way too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, as you may expect with a warehouse position. It's the only job I've ever had where there was such obvious sexism and favoritism."
bad,"Could be a great place to work Poor management, poor routing long days No team sprit all ways short handed have to work in warehouse after route makes for a long day"
bad,"go help out with early Moring pull's then go to box put way all day."
bad,"horrivel ambiente de trabalho, aprendi muitas coisas com esta emepres sobre a direção pessima,colegasotimos era nun lugar muito longe de casa,colegas incriveis"
bad,"I started with them through an Agency.  Then, was fortunate enough to work for them direct (something they call a ""casual"" employee).  They do not give benefits to many employees at all, and the time that I was there I noticed something that basically told me a lot about what kind of company it is.  While I was there I saw four employees (who receive benefits from them) lose their jobs (various reasons).  Although I am not arguing with any of the reasons, I noticed something.  If four employees who receive benefits lose their jobs, that means they have room to permanently hire four temps so that they will now receive benefits, right?  You would think so, but they did not do it.  That was a big hint right there.  If they had given four new employees benefits, then I would have felt that if you stay long enough you will be rewarded, but that isn't the case with this company.  When I was ""laid-off"" it was because I was there for so long if I had stayed any longer they would have had to have given me benefits by law...so what did they do...lay me off."
bad,I would not refer anyone to work for Iron Mountain. The security manager is more into relations with his fellow office personnel than management of his officers.
bad,"The processes do not make sense, leadership is a joke and they outsource like crazy so watch out and not to mention management lies to your face and it is one double standard after another. The billing makes no sense so constant problems, customers are rude, you are constantly being watched and they are more concerned with numbers then employee happiness. When you ask a question you feel like you are being interrogated over the question you are asking, the royersford office is like a middle school, other employees have nothing better to do then eavesdrop on private conversations then go complain to management if they overhear something they do not like. You feel drained from dealing with customers and it is very hard to keep a level head in that environment. If you want to keep your sanity and stay happy do not work there because it is miserable. The job is way more complicated than it should be and they do not do anything to make the systems better since it is all outsourced."
bad,"I worked for iron mountain for almost 3 months. Management gave me more work and responsibility than anyone else with my same position which I am fine with...if the pay increases with responsibility. It didn't. Management acted like I was lucky to have this responsibility and didn't see any reason why I would require a raise. This job looked like it was going to be perfect for what I was looking for. Whatever you do, do not work for iron mountain. They are a careless, extremely unorganized company that don't treat you with respect. My manager actually hung up on me when I notified him that we were low on a certain supply. If you are unlucky enough to get injured like my co-worker, you expected to work anyway and deal with it. Again, don't do it. They have very high turnover for a reason."
bad,"I was just a number to them, they don’t give to bits about you or how hard you worked. You are 100 % expendable. You call the help desk or HR you don’t give your name you give an employee number."
bad,"Hired under 8 month contract with possible perm. "
bad,"I had a bad experience with them.  I was expected to know everything before working there, despite telling them that I had no experience working with the specific parts of the jobs.  As you would expect, with no training provided, it didn't really work out."
bad,"For many years, IM was a fun place to work for and we were fairly compensated for our sales production. Once they brought in a new management team along with their ""friends"", some of the more ""experienced"" existing reps were pushed out. I understand that happens. It was the way they went about it with unfair and unethical accusations that created a path for them to avoid any kind of age discrimination law suits."
bad,Not something that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for an upbeat and fast paced organisation. Very boring and dull is the way I can explain my time here.
bad,"Great environment to work in, allowing for career advancement and challenge"
bad,The training is horrible and they expect you to just know everything about the company without any training.
bad,"Primarily, I thought most people I worked with were incompetent. And that goes right to the top management. The CEO was axed last year. At every quarterly meeting, I did several face palms due to the lack of intelligence up on the stage. Many here work their way up by starting at entry level jobs, then are promoted within. This means many there have ZERO experience in the real world. There also seems to be a revolving door for hiring. They ALWAYS have jobs listed, ad the same jobs over and over."
bad,I worked Years there and i was laid off by mail. I would not return to this company.
bad,"I have never worked for a place so unprofessional. There is at least 2 bosses for every 1 employee,and they don't know how to manage. They have a open door policy which means everyone knows your business.They would sooner bring on temp workers and use them then hire someone who is skilled. They allow bullying and the managers are the biggest bullys.There is a lot of favoritism and also conflict of interest."
bad,"don't work at this place.  Very very high turnover since they treat thier workers so badly.  The quotas are such that literally NOONE can achieve them, thus people just leave.  Not one single person out of 12 I know of lasted longer than 3 weeks.  People couldn't wait to get out of there."
bad,They will over work you and under pay you! Management watches your every move on the scanner and telematics and will never be satisfied with how much you do. I would stay far away especially from the shred department in Port Ewen!
bad,"You had to cross your legs under the table that they gave you to sit at.  You lifted up to 100 pound boxes of work.  It was a horrible place to work, till they finally got these car mats to be put under your chair, to keep the chairs from rolling on the floor"
bad,I hated the hours and the pay rate wasn't that great the management was ok but could've been more informative with job description
bad,"I was dealing with the recruiting department for a Data Center Manager position and it was a very unprofessional experience. The recruiter I was dealing with had to reschedule multiple times and then  vanished after my first interview and never scheduled the second interview. After multiple phone calls and emails to the recruiter, I had given up! I know that Iron Mountain is an awesome company to work for but I have witnessed first hand a large issue with their recruiting department. Good luck to future applicants!"
bad,this place sucks no advancement......management are clueless.....low pay......
bad,"log itto systems"
bad,"Llegar a las 7:30 am comenzar a abrir las bases de datos, mirar que  todo este en orden en el archivo, recibir y eviar correspondencia entre otros."
bad,"A lot of walking,lifting,& moving around in three buildings everey day on three floors. there is no more. going home nothing,i already knew order picking.Long. Was go to me"
bad,"Iron Mountain is a great employer. On the other hand Corestaff that I was employed under is not.  They always made excuses not to pay you on a weekly basis when there was a holiday involved. They pushed to get you to take a debit card thru them instead of wanting to make a direct deposit to your bank account."
bad,Same exact thing every single day.  If you like walking into the same building every day to do the same exact thing all day long then this job is perfect for you
bad,Trabalhar na Iron Mountain era muito bom no começo porém o tempo foi passando fui mostrando crescimento comprimento desenvolvendo meu trabalho bem e percebi que infelizmente não teria possibilidade de crescer porque trabalhava como prestador de serviço para a previdência do banco do Brasil e não teria oportunidade dentro da empresa de crescer .
bad,Empresa passando por processo de mudanças com foco em redução acabando não visando a qualidade de vida dos funcionários
bad,This company does not belive in american workers on a full time basis. Would rather outsource fulltime work and contract amercian workers. Do not expect to find a great environment for promotion.
bad,"Great job if being outsourced is your goal. Company send emails daily about being loyal to them; however, when the same is asked they fail greatly!"
bad,"Most exisiting employees continually band together in an effort to ostracize and sabotage new employees due to layoffs which are conducted on a yearly basis. Fear and job insecurity permeates every corporate department, some more than others. New employees are the sacrificial lambs when yearly layoffs occur. No training, extreme cronyism. Certain employees permitted to take 10 smoke breaks a day because of the work ""clique"" they belong to and can cruise without doing anything all day long. The lone wolves without the protection of clique have to work 10x as hard to avoid layoffs. Narrcisstic, bullying, and lying managers are rewarded. Culture of paranoia and always being told to watch your back. Micromanagement with no logic to an extreme. Unpaid FORCED overtime. Workload unmanageable. A very physically and mentally unhealthy place to work. I would encourage anyone who has experienced such treatment in the Boston, Collegeville, or Royersford offices to band together and file class action lawsuits. Only then whill this company begin to treat its workers like human beings."
bad,"I can remember that a lot of the times, the scanning machines did not work and affected my daily work. I always got the blame for low production because of the faulty equipment."
bad,Iron Mountain is limited is regards to employee development.  Their leadership is under developed.  The teams are not cooperative and unprofessional.  A lack of direction is evident
bad,"Lack of leadership, long hours no work life balance. Inappropriate behavior from leadership, family came last. Over worked underpaid and disgruntled employees, poor working environment, toxic behavior from management lead to poor customer service and satisfaction."
bad,"Stressful work environment and no opportunities of self development."
bad,Was a bad place for as a temp worker. Too many rumors float around the warehouse due to jealousy and lack of authority. Hours were great but not worth making a career choice in staying. Dead end job with no promise of moving up. I worked there for 1 1/2 year. Was glad I left for better pay and better management.
bad,"They grind their people and 'eat their young'."
bad,Fexilbe work hours but low pay. Elavators not equiped to carry empoyees but only records.  Broke down quite often. Poor comunication beteen managerment and empoyees.
bad,At Iron Mountain you work just because is better than not working.if you work there for the rest of your life  you are gonna die poor and you are not gonna own anything e.g. a house or a car not even a bicycle .
bad,"This company hired many temporary employees for a rush scanning project. There were many disrespectful, untrustworthy, nasty people there, who were allowed to engage in illicit behavior during breaks. Management turned a blind eye. Security was poor and people were being harassed."
bad,The work to personal time is not equal or even close. You never know when your day will be done. You are required to complete a certain amount of work in one day. If you don’t you will probably be laid off or fired. It depends on if you are liked or not.
bad,"I find this job to be for men who are very physically able to lift multiple boxes of different weights from 5 lbs to 100 lbs , daily and for 8 hours or more per day."
bad,"The people that work there are nice, but the management is not.  Sometimes you have work, sometimes you don't for weeks, and sometimes you come all the way to work to find out that there isn't anything to do and you get to turn around and all the way back home.  There is no 9-5 hours at this job.  The attitude is that production is more important than accurate work, and there's rampant favoritism.  If you ever need anything or have any problems, you basically have no support from your manager.  They also tell you not to share what you make with anyone else which is illegal."
bad,"A typical work day is stressful. Everyday, you're bracing for impact. Management constantly challenges and consistently undermines you efforts."
bad,I would avoid working for this company if possible.  The roles are 100% remote and that is extremely difficult in project management.  Not great people.
bad,"Came in as a temp and all I got from the Iron Mountain employees was treated as a redheaded step-child. In the Data Entry Dept the employees bully their temps by yelling at them and belittling them in front of everyone. One lead in particular actually challenged us to turn her in because it was not the first time she had been turned it and it would not be the last and we need to grow a thick skin. One lead was helpful and at least approachable with questions. They gave you no proper training and expected you to keep up with the rest in your second week. I don't know how a permanent employee is treated, but as a temp I won't go back even if I could."
bad,A storage and data shred company - is typical in it's working environment. Physical security of all data is paramount. It has good security safeguards built into its day-to-day activities.
bad,"aprendizado na area de previdencia,colegas de trabalho bons"
bad,"Working at Iron Mountain used to be so much better than it is at the current moment.  Blatantly  racist managers, supervisors and some employees to watch out for.  We were asked to forget our personal lives and family commitments to go out and bust our butts for up to 12/13 hrs a day.  Some drivers had part time jobs that Iron Mountain made them quit or get fired because they couldn't make it there on time after numerous 12 hr workdays.  We worked in the city of chicago were we felt neglected and overworked compared to our suburban counterparts.  We expressed this to no avail until we reached our boiling point and unionized.  A year later we went on strike to get better pay and rights that we surely deserved and thought we would only strike for 2 weeks or so just so this company whom we made great sacrifices for will see we were seriously unhappy with some things going on. Iron Mountain felt betrayed so instead of paying us they paid for drivers, helpers etc to fly out from there markets to help our market while we was on strike!  They even paid their hotel fare and gave food them stipends!  Also they paid a million dollars for a security company to ""watch us strike""  just in case we did anything illegal ha!  Well after the strike they fired over 40 good experienced drivers and replaced them with idiots who don't know a 65 gallon from a console! Nobody does their jobs correctly and then they call on the experienced drivers to fix the mistakes.  So you want to work at iron Mountain?  Go ahead,  in a year you will be fed up with their backwards policies and illegal practices."
bad,"In the past year, Iron Mountain has gone through a transition that involved laying off employees and moving jobs overseas creating a terrible culture. The micromanagement and scripted conversations reminds customers of calling Comcast."
bad,You work hard all year complete day and receive a .27 cent raise horrible company. Salary Cap $23 and it take 23years to get there
bad,"A typical day here would involve sitting on your bottom and typing in pointless details over and over sgain on the computer,counting down the hours until you knew you could go home."
bad,It's an eye opening place to work to say the least. You won't regret finding a different job.
bad,"typical day required a lot of paperwork and computer work. The work is very consistent at times, but then can be very slow."
bad,"I temped there, very unprofessional setting, loud music, the permanant workers really dont want you to know what they know, dirty looking, NOT what you see on their website, low pay"
bad,"Tener más en concideracion con las áreas de trabajo crítico ,salario, igualdad en festividades y más apoyo a sus colaboradores y dar protección correspondiente al área de almacén."
bad,"Managers do not care. Your job is whatever they want you to do, regardless of what your job title or job function is. Much favoritism. Meetings are treated as a game with no questions wanted or answered by managers. Very restrictive work environment."
bad,THEY LIE AS THEY BREATHE. Their deception could cost someone their apartment. They tell you you're doing a great job while planning to fire you. RUN!!
bad,"Lots of leadership turnover.  The company does not value employees and the leadership is out of touch with how to run a business.  There is no IT leadership and IT strategy.  IT leadership turns over every 2 to 3 years and each CIO brings in their people and then the next CIO cuts the prior team."
bad,"Az én tapasztalatom, hogy a menedzsment el van öregedve, innovációra nem befogadóképesek. Kötött a hierarchia és horizontálisan mozogni sem lehetséges a szervezeten belül. Az IM-nél töltött időszakom során skill-jeim nem, hogy fejlődtek, javultak vagy újabbal gazdagodtam volna, lehet romlottak is."
bad,"Empresa boa mas não dá muitas oportunidades para quem está lá dentro , só por indicação ."
bad,"Usual Warehouse work. Busy company, always overtime available."
bad,A empresa não possibilita crescimento profissional
bad,"Reportas a Recursos Humanos temas de conflicto de intereses, carga laboral, ambiente laboral, pero a la empresa no le interesa, el director está de acuerdo con todo lo malo que ocurre y Recursos Humanos no hace nada."
bad,"Cette sociète a bien changé en 3 ans."
bad,Excellent Brand recognition. Huge customer base. Very disorganized internally. Company grows through Acquisition. Customers are not valued. Too many departments are outsourced.
bad,Day was constantly driven by unrealistic targets being set by management.  These expectation pre-empted into an unhappy workforce.  Majority of staff employed appeared to be agency and so therefore the turnover of staff was frequent.
bad,"Worked as on projects and maintaining production"
bad,management is no help at all they do not know what they are doing .first you have one person telling you do this then when another manager comes in tells you something else by yet the worst team ever
bad,The new managers only care about the quota they make hour meetings and they mostly talk about the quota they nees to realize that they havegoos hard workinf employees. And stop worrying about making that quota
bad,"ambiente em constante mudança"
bad,"The position was a temporary job in a warehouse setting. I cannot comment too profoundly, but nature of work was very fast paced and repetitive. The documents we handled were confidential and clients we represented were high-end and well known companies."
bad,"I found my co workers really nice and easy to get along with, but management wasn't so great. Felt like I was working slave labour. No job satisfaction."
bad,"Iron Mountain was a great place to work until about 3 years ago. They contracted a company called DB&A to come in and streamline policies/procedures and basically lay people off. It has never been the same company since then. Then they started offshoring to Bangalore India. They started with the IT group and then worked their way to Finance. They offshored AP, AR and the Contracts departments. Believe me.....they are not done. Be very aware if taking a job in the Finance department."
bad,"My experience here both was of balanced good and bad. I first started here as a temp worker and later got hired as a casual worker with them. The work is pretty simple but over time it does get uninterested. As a casual worker, you're not getting any benefits or anything. The pay is low, no overtime and shortage of work. This job is just only good for if you want extra easy money."
bad,"Year after year its the same thing , Low raise higher expectations and same position.  Time will fly by and you'll notice you are in the same position with barely noticeable pay."
bad,"No job security. An DATA ENTRY OPERATOR  also doing Data entry and aside loading unloding, no time punctuality. There are many vogas rules, bad environments. Junior has no scope for upper lavel."
bad,Management/HR utilizing culture change initiatives as an excuse for poor behavior. Constantly downsizing teams to make their financials look better. Business on decline and management managing the business with a quarterly view vs. mid to long-term.
bad,"Hostile environment"
bad,Don't expect advancement or respect here unless you suck up to management and work way more overtime than you should. The job is very physically draining and more tasks you take on...the more you are given. High turnover rate. Low wages. Takes a very long time to get acepted to full time (if at all).
bad,"Management unwilling to listen to employee's concerns or attack problems by the root cause. Unwilling to hire much needed help, forcing employees to be overworked and exhausted. No room for promotion within my district. Hard workers are punished with more responsibilities while lazy workers and excused and ignored. Management expects certain employees to make no plans in their personal lives because they're expected to stay late or come in on their days off due to the company staying consistently understaffed."
bad,"You give 100% and they expect 150%...no matter how hard you work they are never satisfied and you are always under achieving. Management has NO CLUE what they are doing and the ""brains"" above them are just as lost! If you like banging your head against a wall everyday then apply otherwise save your noggin for something better!"
bad,"Micro mange everything. Never get any help with big pick ups or delivery. With all the meetings they have, it's a wonder we got to service actual customers. "
bad,"Long hours but the people there make the time fly by the jobs not the best job, its physical so i enjoyed it, it's a fast paced job and you learn as you go."
bad,"The company offerings are very good. Respected in industry."
bad,"It would be a cool job if some of your fellow employees didn't try to throw you under the bus just so they can look good."
bad,"Lack of sales and strong leadership brought a once enjoyable and productive environment crashing down. Top talent was eliminated due to budget cuts and unrealistic goals, culture become that of a ""cover your a**, customer focus was lost, etc, etc."
bad,New CEO came in and decided to outsource many of the positions out of country therefore letting a lot of great talent go.
bad,Company has potential for growth and development but has been held back by parent company.  Hopefully will change so the right investments can be made.
bad,day starts off with a meeting with supervisors stressed to hit their numbers set by a person with a computer with no knowledge of the job.can never take a day off and when you do you are frowned upon or chastised. co-workers are good people.honestly the hardest part about the job is being mentally perpared everyday for the unknown. the enjoyable part was and always will be my customers
bad,εντατικοι ρυθμοι εργασιας.μονοτονη δουλεια.χαμηλη αμοιβη
bad,Fue buena la experiencia de trabajar con ellos lastima que no dan planta
bad,"Not a bad place to work. Very boring and not very energetic at all. Management was horrible. Very political place, they are worried about offending everyone and you will pay the price if you offend anyone for anything. Was spoken to by my boss for being too happy in the mornings! Alot of the underground employees are rude, but there are some wonderful people there as well."
bad,"It is not that motivating working at iron mountain, there's always complains from the management side about costs and bonuses especially when it's time for the employees to get them which is a real turnoff"
bad,"This job was not what I was expecting. High demand and quick pace, which was not a problem. Although, all the employees did was fax all day and that seemed not to be productive."
bad,"work is not hard,training is on a consistent day to day basis because of customers requirements for job may change from day to day. 2 different shifts may mean different types of work to be done per shift."
bad,I only worked there temporary and for the location it was taking me more than 2 hours to commute back and forth to work; poor location with a car.  The company experience educated me to becaome a better CSR
bad,"Data entry, received and shipped camera media to different locations for clients. responsible of making sure that media data is safe and stored in a secure location"
bad,"The management at Iron Mountain is still running a company based in 1957, storing boxes of paper. No customer value, Management is checked out, good old boy culture."
bad,"A typical day for me."
bad,I don't know what you want me to put here. I put things and its still red. I don't even want to do this review thing why are you forcing me to its stupid.
bad,Service clients each day on route. Attention to detail is very important in all aspects of the workday. Safe driving is crucial to success in this position.
bad,This company is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for and if I didn't absolutely need the job I would have walked out two weeks in. Their hiring practices are atrocious.
bad,the pay is not good you work alone with no help then get yelled at when they don't reach quote because they can't get any temps to stay they want you to work 6 days a week too from 7am-6pm
bad,A typical day is 4 hours of Case Time and 4 hours of Non-Case Time. You receive a daily spreadsheet of assigned requests to respond to client related issues during case time. On non-case time you are on phones handling the same types of client related issues you see on case time. The expectation is to handle client related issues per hour. A request can take more than 15 minutes which affects productivity.
bad,"I was asked to build from scratch an TAM offering for customers."
bad,"When I first started everything was good.  Management was competent, fair and understanding especially concerning employees personal time. But then came a change and the only thing that mattered was making sure you hit your metric goals. Ever since then it has only been about the numbers. Your life matters, not at IM."
bad,I came in this company as a temp. The pay was awful for the amount of work they want you to do and management treated it's full time employees way better than temps. We were barely included in anything. The work environment is so boring and employees there just came to work to get paid paid leave.
bad,"Unfortunately the core business of the organization is records management, which is no longer a growing industry because of less expensive backup options and items being stored electronically. This has created significant amount of job loss. At one point it was a wonderful place to work, compensation was fair w/great benefits."
bad,The typical day at work was long and some of the clientele are not very nice people. While i was employed I learned to operate a Shredder truck. The management at the location I was employed at where not very professional and understanding. Some of the co-workers was alright to work with and others not so okay. The hardest part of the job was having to dump multiple bins without help.
bad,"A typical work day- Boxes in the hundreds a day. What I learned Leave when a job/company has run its course. Management - One sided. "
bad,"This company has gone downhill with its current leadership in North America over the last five years."
bad,"The Department was very unprofessional and the training service was very poor. The Department lacked communication skills, However their was a set schedule with excellence But the Department needs improvement on the way to handle business."
bad,Wasn't a great fit for me. There's wasn't a lot of Team work nor accountability in the work environment. I didn't look forward to going to work.
bad,"Not sure how Recall is in other locations, but the Lanham location is very unorganized. The supervisor wants to change things everyday and he has too much on his plate. The warehouse is a mess . the trucks are a mess.and the supervisor is a total mess.not a good place to work ."
bad,Kirby day started off selling their product door to door. I leanrned the value to presenting  information to a client. The hardest part was to sell the product.
bad,"good work with good people, had to move on to work in trucking where I belong"
bad,"Não estou vendo resultado, muitas coisa para uma pessoa só resolver."
bad,"Prefiero no especificar nada....fueron unos años muy buenos, pero en el día a día eran muchos esfuerzos para poder seguir bien dentro del trabajo."
bad,"o trabalho na iron era muito complexo por que eu trabalhava tercerizada para o HSBC na seguradora era um trabalho detalhista de agilidade raciocicio logico onde aprender muita coisa,adorava trabalhar na seguradora do HSBC apesar de ser terceira"
bad,Sales management has gone completely off the rails.
bad,•Assist in development of new centralized destruction process
bad,Started as a great place to work when core values were the culture. Co-workers are great. Life/work balance does not exist.
bad,"If not for current employees helping the new , starting is very difficult to get the information required as management is very lacking on proper training,  even when fully experienced for the position. "
bad,"Rotina intensa,"
bad,I was with Iron Mountain for about a year.. If you ever decide to work for Iron Mountain do not trust what your manager tells you. Do not trust them. Iron Mountain  is a very disorganized company. The work load they give you most of the time it requires a helper and they don't  believe in helpers. It is the last company that I would work for.. And if they promise you anything  make sure you have it on writing. Thanks
bad,"I worked at this company for over 14 yrs "
bad,"This was a temp job I applied for and after 3 months was hired as an employee. There were a few good employees and management had a bad rep. Lots of problems were unresolved until a good Supervisor was there for a few years. I worked there over 10 years with the best of attitude. Stressful at times when no help was available. Most of the employees were lacking a personal dedication to teamwork.  The general manager is too lazy and lets her subs do her problem resolving. The supervisor is best described as a self-centered jerk, as his subs kiss his ring. Google department was clearly the only department that held it's head high and the employees there make a good team. Don't miss a thing even with a perfect attendance record and going out of my way to be somewhat respected with the knowledge and experience applied to a somewhat lackluster and dirty warehouse work environment."
bad,Just management miss a lot of work. Even brings her kids and Dogs into work. Just don't get it. Never work at a place that let anyone get away with this. I guess I will say just bad Management. And are not behind there Drivers run us into the ground. Just done with this company wittthisthcompany
bad,"Some of the employees at Iron are selfish and not friendly.  Some mangers show favoritism . If you are a temporary employee, be mindful of how you will be treated.  Temporary employees are not included in any of the leon Mountain events except the Christmas dinner. As a temp.at Iron Mountain, you constantly reminded that none of the important events or meetings pertain to you so therefore you are excluded from alot events. There is very little room for growth throughout the company."
bad,"Empresa Sólida,  porém após mudanças na gestão de 2017 para 2018,  houve um declínio por completo. Inúmeras demissões para se atingir os resultados ao invés de identificar os problemas. Preza pelo coleguismo para se alcançar cargos e se manter na empresa,  mesmo sem competência para a função."
bad,"work 12 hours a day, learned how not to mistreat employees, management needs to treat everyone fairly. The culture could be better if everyone was treated the same. Hardest part of the job is long hours and working by yourself on large pickups. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers."
bad,"I worked as a temp to hire with this company. Everything was fine, i did good on my quality reviews, came to work on time, and even got recognized for some awards for excellent customer service. After 7 months of working there i was told this is around the time they would hire me on and i get let go because they didn't have the ""work load"" but they were always complaining about all the work they get. Not able to trust a company that treats people this way. I would not recommend this company."
bad,Massive reorganizations has taken the buzz off of this company. Plus it being a dying business model doesn't help either but the worst part of it is the local management. Cut throat and dishonest is the nicest things I can say about my immediate manager. Took credit for things he did not do and was borderline racist/sexist at most times. He cultivated an awful culture that continues to this day. They cut a lot of people but not the cancer.
bad,You are working for a global organization that is way behind technology by way of its core product. Managers are required to micromanage a rotating wheel of new initiatives to make sure their worker bees are buzzing the way senior leadership wants .
bad,"Whenever certain events were happening I was kept in the dark about many things. From work running out and suddenly being told not to come in with no reason, to the management being very childish and too secretive to the workers."
bad,"Was surprised after 17 years that my position was reduced, and I was apart of a workforce reduction. I was very hard broken how much time, sweat and tears I gave to this company and they just released me. After that several other full time employees quit."
bad,o mercado está em franca evolução o que exige produtos e serviços mais inovadores
bad,"Empresa iniciando o processo junto a grandes clientes precisa de processo melhor de gestão e treinamento para lideres que ainda não se adequaram ao processo."
bad,There are a lot of hard workers here but a lot of disengagement due to constant corporate metric measuring of more and more job functions creating more and more responsibilities and subsequent finger pointing when things go wrong. Processes and equipment which are not functioning properly almost never get 100% fixed. Most of the burden gets put on supervisors and hourly staff with little to no support. If you are an excellent self educator and highly motivated you can go very far in this company if you are willing to move and relocate for promotions.
bad,"en general es una empresa buena para trabajar , con buen ambiente laboral, se puede aprender bastante en el ámbito de la documentación y en general los colegas son muy son personas de trato bueno."
bad,they don't handle the staff with the important that they deserve and do not see how much work people put in everyday.  we work a lot more than what we get paid.  we need to be more counted at the time of sharing the welth with the fellow workers.
bad,Director and Management in NC and SC are the best team to work with and provide direction for the day to day activities needed.  The hardest part of the job are the internal process which make this job unenjoyable and give a sense of constant confusion.  Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customer's and winning new business.  The company has had lay-offs in the last two years and the company constantly changes sales roles.  There is no sense of job security or trust.
bad,I packed sensitive documents away in boxes that wieghed 25-60 pounds on high shelves. Extremely stressfull and strenuous on the back.
bad,and terrible benefit's overall great values but under the managment that they have it's hard to work for
bad,I love working for Iron Mountain the problem was I as in Data Entry for 14yrs.  I wanted to move up but my Manager at the time wanted me to stay.  It is hard to advance in any company when the Manager is the one holding you back. Iron Mountain needs to work on that because keeping customers happy means keeping employees happy too.
bad,"I was recruited to work for IM and I absolutely enjoyed my job and the team I worked with Throughout several culture shifts, the atmosphere changed.  The work load increased, hours spent in the office increased as well as adding work at home to keep up.  The work/life balance became troublesome.  Support from the leadership team all but vanished.  I would have loved to continue my employment with IM...just couldn't do it under current circumstances."
bad,"This was a job that required the location of files and boxes withing the warehouse through a alpha-numeric system.  We also received these items to put away. The biggest thing I learned was the importance of records.  Whether its medical or legal, these records hold our lives and it was massively important we handled them with care."
bad,"Wouldn't ever recommend this place to anyone. If you want any kind of social life, you best look else where. The management doesn't seem to get it and only care about themselves and their god forsaken numbers. They could careless about their drivers."
bad,"worked hard whether by myself or with others. we learned and asked each other questions."
bad,"Es un empresa que presta servicios a otras. No hay una estabilidad laboral, se entra por contratos con agencias y tardan en dan en efectivizar."
bad,"terrible warehouse layout and the way boxes were stacked. it affects performance, to meet their near impossible quota expectations..maybe if say, two people work together you can pull 200 boxes a day. but they are asking one person to pull them because they fired like 7+ employees before for slacking off and now shoving all the production quotas down your throat. when you are working in that type of environment, takes 30mins to move a box and another 30 just to put the boxes you don't need back..they require you to rearrange everything...it's dusty as hell, terrible warehouse layout with tight aisles for moving boxes, half broken boxes with no handles for pulling, limited equipment (ladders, carts,etc.) favoritism, near impossible odds of success...the pay is decent/good but not worth it in my opinion. you can get injured on the job and then what...the whole warehouse needs remodeling."
bad,"Company was continually going through restructure. Day to day work life very structured with KPI’s. workplace culture seems to be improving."
bad,"I love Iron Mountain as far as the workload and and the fast paced environment and the benefits. However, if your looking to be a cohesive team look elsewhere. I can't speak for all stations but leadership is poor and plays favorites. I dont look forward to going to work like I did at my previous job. As I have previously stated every person is out for themselves and individuals try to preach team work but are clueless. Finally, the managnent here will discriminate against you especially if you're a disabled veteran."
bad,I was told I couldn’t come back to work because I was pregnant even though this was not true because there were other pregnant employees. I was then told I couldn’t come back due to a performance report they had neglected to tell me about. Even though I had not been informed of any mistake and there didn’t appear to be a record of a mistake on the system
bad,"Driving a mobile shred unit to customer locations, picking up big bins of paper to shred at the truck. Doesn't seem like much but, some locations take 1 or 2 hours to service...by the time you finish you go to the truck and remember that you have another 18 stops left. Drivers do not get help. This job is not for the weak because it is extremely physical...it is for the fool. They claim to be local but they bought out companies which have customers 3 or 4 hours away in the middle of the West Virginia mountains. With that being said picture yourself on a Friday driving 4 hours away to service 7 customers with each customer being 45 minutes away from each other because you're literally in the middle of no where with no phone reception. Management does not care, they do not pay enough to drive up and down those mountains (especially during winter). "
bad,"Muita coisa pode ser feita em , Favor de todos colaboradores !"
bad,"enjoyed my time at this workplace, team members helping each was a major factor in my enjoyment at this work place."
bad,"The bonus is that you get to work with some great and very intelligent people. Work is challenging and there are good growth opportunities for talent."
bad,"Scanning tapes and putting them into boxes for storage, I learnt how to use an RF scanner. The management of the workplace was managed appropriately and the workplace culture was fun, getting to learn about the others that I enjoyed working with and their culture. The most enjoyable part was handling the RF scanner because I became more and more confident when using it as time went by."
bad,"Iron Mountain was not a horrible place to work at culture wise, but as an employee you are just a number.  Every year there is a wave of layoffs due to budgetary cuts in North America.  It doesn't matter whether you have a track record of excellence, whether you are a critical member of the team, or even if many things wouldn't be possible without your expertise.  A huge part of the problem is that leadership at higher levels make very costly decisions/mistakes without studying their possible impact in different markets.  Who pays for those mistakes?  The folks on the front lines.  The problems are unfortunately systematic, I would not trust my future to Iron Mountain."
bad,"The day always starts with an issue as it is expected in the Network Engineering domain."
bad,"Look at my start date to end dates and figure this one out."
bad,Poor Manager never looked after his staff he never listen to them. I was pulled into the office  and was told that I was not getting a pay rise  because I never asked for extra training however I had asked for more training  and I said this to him. He said ok then I will get you more training in a few weeks. four weeks went by and I asked for more training again this time my supervisor and I was ignored.
bad,"You'd think that a company like Iron Mountain would have it together but they don't.  I worked in the shred division at the West Chester location.  The job wasn't difficult but the schedule they wanted adhered to was unmanageable.  The route would be different every day and was given to you in no order.  You had to rely on others who had been to the locations to let you know the order you should approach the route and what times these locations would open.  Seems that would be something the ""Transportation Manager"" should have done.  The TM has software that if used properly is capable of putting the route in the proper order for the quickest run possible.  It was a complete mess!  I would not recommend this job to anyone except a person who knows every address and location off the top of their head."
bad,Impossible to make local choices. Very corporate driven. My position started off fine but then staffing fell off a cliff. Nearly impossible to hire new people despite missing customer service requirements due to lack of resources. Benefits are great but leadership is a bit delusional and old school. The philosophy is to just grind out the work with as few people as possible despite morale and work / life balance.
bad,Fast paced 20-26 stop/day job where 70% of time is spent out of the truck.  Pay is below average.  Job is secure and you do have benefits.  Unfortunately the pay does not come close to the labor required hence they get 2 stars from me.  Understaffed 80% of the time also is a huge problem. I can't recommend this to anyone at this time.
bad,I started as a warehouse working.   navigating large warehouses to locate boxes or individual files for customers.  Then moved into a position as a courier.   Near-minimum wage pay.
bad,"A typical day at work?"
bad,"Much was expected but you didn't mind working for it. Past experience was great, ability to learn, appreciation for hard work, teams worked will together. Company now works on fear of losing your job as no consideration is given to contribution when laying off employees. Everyone is looking over their shoulder."
bad,"I have enjoyed my position at Iron Mountain up until about 4 years ago. The company instilled an Operational and Performance Excellence program. The program was very much needed to instill "
bad,"Enjoyed my time at Iron Mountain, Learnt different skills for programs etc."
bad,J'ai beucouP aimer travaillé la bas.c 'était vraiment cool
bad,"Buen ambiente en el dia a dia, siempre preocupados, lo que mas me gusto es que tenian buses de acercamiento y los horarios que tenian, eran bastante comodos para una persona proactiva diariamente. buena empresa para iniciar labores de bodega."
bad,"You are over worked, under paid and there is no respect for the workers there. The benefits used to be really good, however over the last several years they have gone downhill."
bad,"Diversidade de projetos, com metas e resultados desafiadores. "
bad,Considero q la empresa no ofr ce la estabilidad q uno quisiera. Solo ofr cen puestos por proyectos cortos ya q tienen a su personal de planta.
bad,The pay is low.      For the cost of living in Charlotte Nc.   If you get a 40 cent raise a year it’s considered a lot of money.  I had a great experience in other locations but when I came to Charlotte it was disappointing
bad,this company is so tight financially that raises are extremely low. I'm not sure if its management but they also have a strict dress code.
bad,"Buen ambiente laboral, gran empresa pero sin motivaciones."
bad,"Iron Mountain was a great place to work."
bad,"to much of respect of persons i learned how safe they gaurd thier information, coworkers was sneakee the enjoyable part of the job was benefits the hardest part was my mangement"
bad,"Uma empresa de cultura e ambiente familiar, que não é pro ativa com os padroes de informações e procedimentos, que pouco da importância para esses quesitos. Tanto que a KPMG não emitiu o parecer do exercício de 2010."
bad,Typical day was spent in data entry (in a warehouse behind a computer)
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of answering emails."
bad,"Iron Mountain purchased the company that I was working for in April.  Because of too many reps in our area, I was one of the unfortunate employees who lost their job.  However, during the time that I was still with the company, I can definitely see why they are so successful."
bad,"es una empresa muy buena , trabaja prestando servicios a enpresas grandes con savia peru o tambien america movil ."
bad,"I've been working at Iron Mountain since April 20, 2015.  I enjoy the company and the work environment.  I've learned new activities with them.  I felt I've grown with the company.  Everybody has a positive working attitude.  The most enjoyable part of the job was doing projects at different company sites.  The most hardest part of the job was doing activity called destruction where the coordinators hand you tons of labels to the aisle where the box I located to be shredded."
bad,HF and then we have a few months of the new York city and then we are you can be a bit of a lot to client is not sure if you are the new York NY to be a few
good,the HOURS were ehhh but they would send you to different location and was not paying for the transportation as a temp and working for an agency and it was calm and cool but the houirs were bad
good,Good experience if your just looking for work nice people good for college students. Extra money good for a second job and a lot of busy work lunch breaks too short of duties
good,"[Supervised team of five people]"
good,Management changes often I was their less than a year . Brach manger was terminated within a few months of me being their . Plant manager and branch manager say they were on same page until plant manager was away from branch manager then it was a different story.  Way too many contingent employees ( temps ) more temps at times then employees. Did not practice what they preach. Matrix way to high for what the limping equipment can handle . No raises in ten months
good,"Arrive at work, given daily plan upon arrival to where we are designated a singular task which we have to do until the end of our shift. "
good,Lastimosamente no existe la calidad humana en esta empresa.
good,Bunch of people with double-standards who only aim to cover their lack of skills by interpersonal relationship within the workplace. No chance to advance in such environment. Toxic atmosphere and lack of communication in between the shifts.
good,"Good job but the management team in Las Vegas, NV has no concerns for the workers personal life and off time. They will have you work 60hour work weeks and have you come in on the weekends. Your annual raise is on average $0.30-$0.35. There isn't room to be promoted."
good,J'ai été placé chez Recall par mon agence de placement. Donc c'est un CDD. Il n'y a pas d'opportunité de développement ni d'avancement afin de construire une carrière.
good,"convivi com vários colegas da profissão e me dei muito bem. aprendi a mexer melhor no computador, porem uma empresa com baixo índice de oportunidades internas."
good,Aprendi como agir em um ambiente profissional e como uma empresa funciona em sua estrutura.
good,Management is horrible. They can’t be trusted. They will throw you under the bus to save themselves from their mistake. They don’t respect employees privacy. I’ve seen employees reprimanded on the floor in front of everyone.
good,"empresa boa no geral. Nada que desabone, empresa muito sólida."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, padrões americanos de poucas mudanças"
good,"long hours, not always the best work environment, management not always reliable, awesome supervisor and director. stressful environment some days others not so bad. good pay and benefits."
good,"Pauze mari, fara target, fara motivare, fara bonus"
good,En el tiempo que estuve se presento el problema por la situación económica que estaba pasándola empresa en ese momento que no era el mejor por esta razón se vio afectada mi continuidad dentro de la compañía.
good,This was a good company to start. You will understand in short order the working of a conglomerate that has to report to a board of directors. The Shred division seems to be ever changing and was very hard to keep up with the expectations of ever changing roll expectations.
good,The job was not bad could have used team leaders and it was hard to get hired by the company full time and the pay increase were few and far between
good,Iron mountain does not care for its workers just to make sure the work gets done. They do not give help when you need it. Your co-workers never help you. Working in dust full warehouse with bugs and rodents.
good,The company isn't exactly what it used to be.  Consultants have succeeded in gutting the company's morale.  There are still some great people at Iron Mountain and there is hope the company can turn it all around.
good,"driving 296 miles in a day, different place I seen driving to many locations. my supervisor was great and very patient, my co workers were very helpful. the hardest part is all that driving for one driver."
good,Could be a good company to work for however NO support system is in place to difuse any customer related issues.
good,I was driving from Terre Haute IN to Indianapolis the was getting to mcuh for me. When they moved my working times it became more difficently to drive 160 miles a day
good,wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww I did not like this job at all poor management and communication.
good,"Iron Mountain is a company that is full of potential. However, there is a critical need for the company to be audited by the EEOC. As an employee of Iron Mountain, I had the opportunity for several years to discover that at Iron Mountain your chances of advancement is not determined by your merit and performance. Your advancement and success is based on being a puppet of upper management. You may be appreciated by many associated based on your performance and involvement. However, if you find yourself at odds with an upper management team member, your career is controlled and human resources actually does not work in the best interest of the employees. The upper management is quick at shifting blames to the associated and does not seek to take employees inputs to better their operational shortfalls. It may be a excellent company to work for only for those that are seeking the status quo in terms of career. In order to better advance career wise, you have to be ready to fit into the internal politics realm."
good,a fast paced position.The hardest part of the job is getting all internal departments to work together and at the best interest of the client and company.
good,some managers care but even then their hands are tied by uper management.  the pay has gone up but you have little to no  job security . you screw up and your escorted out.( done ). benefits have gotten better as well . a stressful job you deal with lots of customers 20 to 30 stops a day. high security job LOTS OF REGULATIONS!!!.   Every thing runs on numbers you don't  really  matter.
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Iron Mt,but it is extremely corporate. They upper management has no heart for its workers and if they have a quarter that didn't meet their expectations..heads will roll. So the job security is not strong, I don't want to work for a place where someone else's mishaps can cost me my job."
good,"I qot 3 month contract job and work very hard and honestly at the oakville branch. Only 3 week, I was kicked out and was told there is no more works to do. I really think the company should give any workers mask to protect their health because the working environment very dirty and dusty"
good,I entered information from paper form to electronic form. Days went by quickly and I enjoy that staying busy. Everyone is very helpful and willing to assist where needed.
good,Iron Mountain is a great place to work if you are self motivated. If you are able to self learn you will do great. Excel skills are very helpful however if you are not experienced they will teach you.
good,I work here as a temporary through a temp service            the bad thing about working for Iron mountain as a temp you doing know how long you will be working there
good,The people who work there are pretty decent people easy to get along with besides the upper management and the supervisor the only guy I have seen in my life that gets happy to fire someone and  don't say something they don't like you will be kicking rocks or getting wrote up for nonsense that they get away with
good,"When i worked there you never even had a lunch break they got you a cheap sandwich in which you had to eat whilst still working, very bad pay, and overtime was standard rate."
good,"uma boa empresa. nao tem muitas oportunidade, mas foi um bom aprendizado ."
good,"Ask for to much and pay doesn't match."
good,"A typical day at recall consisted of picking files from the warehouse. Other people would prep the work for myself, when work was prepped and ready i would scan all files and scan into a system."
good,"This company does not take care of its employees, only the bottom dollar.  The medial benefits are expensive, Management does not listen to ideas only their way."
good,"A kedvezőtlen munkakörülmények, a kevés fizetés miatt nem jó itt dolgozni."
good,"I worked here as a temp and I started as a prepper. I would have to pick a box from a pallet and was given direction on how to remove the papers or documents from the box so they didn't lose there order. I had to remove staples, rubberbands and clips from all pages amd make sure the edges were not bent. I basically had to prep the work and prepare it for scanning. It was all busy work. Atmosphere was very quiet but you can listen to headphones in other departments you were able to listen to music outloud as a group. It is a warehouse setting and you had to keep a log of everything you did and everytime you left your desk. Worked 7-3:30 and had 3 breaks. Two 15 mins and a half hour was to be taken in the kitchen because you wouldn't have time to leave the building on your break and get back in time unless you are very fast."
good,"It was in a warehouse so I'd grab a pallet full of boxes which was full of boxes at least 25-30, each containing several manilla envelopes.  The information written on the outside of these envelopes was to be keyed into the data system, replaced on a new pallet and prepared for storage."
good,Ce travail ne correspond pas a ce que je recherche. Etant a la recherche d'emploi j'ai pris ce qu'on me proposer . Cepandant c'est un travail de rapidité et répétitif. Toute la journée je devait taper des chiffres dont 10000 dossiers reparti dans des boites de 150 dossiers. Il suffisait de taper le numero de dossier pour ensuite les archiver.
good,"There as a temporary worker. Learned many projects. Feel like a prisoner at work and needing someone to let me to my work area and the bathroom. Was doing an awesome job , i was told management, however once my assignment ended there was no advance notice and my temp agency didnt even have anything setup for me."
good,"Iron Mountain as a company is a great place to work.  However, the senior management in the Dallas market provides a hostile work environment under the threat of termination on a consistent bases.  The pay is good with a high chance of overtime including nights, weekends and out of town trips."
good,"lack of communication that only hurts the customer, last minute changes that hold you back from getting a normal start to your day and be on time to your scheduled stops. When your watched and told stops per hour are a big thing in our goals."
good,"	Data entry of medical records, law firms and data retrieval companies. Answering all incoming telephone calls for ROI (Records of Information) from Northwest Community Hospital."
good,"You start with 40hrs weeks, later on to end up doing 50-60hrs with very little pay difference. Management gets angry if you don't show up on your day off or work the overtime. There's never enough people and no new employees seem to be getting hired, instead the existing crew is constantly being pushed to do more. Those who have anything against either quit or are being fired."
good,Management was poor and if you said 1 word your labeled as a trouble maker. The nepatisam  was unreal.. the upper Management never came around much when they did it was Breif didn't really want to talk to you. Just work an shut up. You'll get screwed from time to time.  So Just work shut your mouth. The customers get over charged you are the face of the company  be prepared to lie. It's always the driver fault so be on high alert.
good,"Es buena, solo que es un poco difícil el crecimiento laboral"
good,Working for this company it OK I have been here Long enough it time for me to advance my career it been a up and down the work flow is not hard but the decisions
good,Was rarely granted vacation time due to no coverage management turnover lack of knowledge given a day and half of training. Concerned about numbers only not about employee
good,"Every day was punching in, scanning things for 2 hours, break, scanning for an hour, lunch, scanning for 2 hours, break, scan for an hour, then home"
good,Nos piden realizar varias actividades pero la remuneración es muy poca.
good,"Very good job nevertheless the culture could have improved and possibly has since I exited in 2008 (nearly 11 years ago).  Furthermore, the training and collaborative workforce did not have much in the way of synergy.  It basically came down to who you knew and who wanted to support you.  Improvement in culture and working as a team should be taken more seriously to retain good employees."
good,A typical work day in the workplace is very stressful. the management team is very unprofessional to employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet deadlines with non proper tools to work with and not fully having the support from upper management.
good,"Horaires flexibles et personnel agréable."
good,"I love the job itself but cannot live on the pay due to many bills."
good,Employees are not compensated fairly. Few advancement options and mission statement is not carried out on any level.  Lack of professionalism workplace
good,Boa empresa. Tem um ótimo plano de saúde e odontológico.
good,"Stagnant career; Success not rewarded. "
good,"Empresa agradável, legal para trabalhar e com boa convivência"
good,Trabalho muito confidencial aprendi muitas coisas pois a trabalhava com documentos de bancos pra mim foi uma ótima experiência
good,"Foi uma empresa de uma grande qualificação, aprendi a obter responsabilidade e formacao profissional."
good,It seems like a reputably company to work for and it is a billion dollar corporation but I felt lack essential equipment to do the job more efficiently
good,"It might be a great company to work for if you can get in as a driver permanent full time since it is unionized. Coming in at entry level as a Records Coordinator is tough to endure."
good,"No sufficient training is provided"
good,Unorganized place to work for. The management will give you a enormous amount of stops for you to complete and really expect you to finish them all ....mixing off site shredding with on site shredding is against company policy but the supervisors don't care...the turn around ratio is high....the can't keep people there at all. They hired me as an Casual worker I didnt receive any heatlh benefits for 5 years since i started.
good,Middle management was great to work with and frontline employees were generally good people. Proclaimed work/life balance was not as such.
good,"Iron Mountain is a great company with an identity crisis in sales. There is a large depth and breadth of services, but Business Development Executives only have quota for a single product line. Sales methodology does not align with quota and compensation."
good,"Typical day starts at 9 pm co-workers were great the culture and environment was great but benefits, room for advancement was non existed."
good,"Dia de trabalho é corrido depende do dia da semana, mas nada que não seja feito tudo o que tem que ser feito aos dias."
good,They only hire from a temp agency and they lie to your from day one.  Its not 3 months of temping its 6 mounts to a year.  If you are under the age of 27 it will be less then a year.  they like people to be very young there.  They also let go of there employees every few mounts.   The management don't interact with anyone under them unless they have to and they look down on you.
good,"Pay was commensurate with the rest of the market, but you will never get any kind of a reasonable raise. Benefits were excellent. Hours were a nightmare, on-call, weekends, swing shifts, every holiday. Don't plan on having ANY kind of a life working there. Management started off great, but then became fractured around 2013. Micromanagement, in-fighting among managers, insane metrics that couldn't be met. A lot of people that worked for Amazon were hired into management roles, and they ran the place like Amazon."
good,My work day would start with a round table meeting with management and the transportation team for about 15 minutes to talk about our failures and successes gather afterward gather all important itinerary necessary to complete my jobs for the day load up  inspect my vehicle pick up and deliver all documents and be safe.The work was challenging and physical but I was able to withstand all the pressures and physical requirements of the job.
good,"J'effectué une journée de 8h30 à 17h"
good,"realizar mantenimiento a los circuitos cerrados, los compañeros te ayudan en tu desempeño, se necesita mucha responsabilidad."
good,Too much manual labor. I just was not prepared for the heavy lifting and dust and rearranging of boxes.
good,"Em dias de pico era os melhores dia pois já chegávamos e já estava no quadro quantas contas teríamos pra digitar, então era foco total no serviço, pra entregar no horário. Nos outros dias eu fazia outros serviços, aprendia outras funções, como a de auxiliar de líder, centralização de documento, preencher relatórios,controle de qualidade ver se era erro ou não.Os colegas de trabalhos sempre nos tratamos com respeito e companheirismo porque precisávamos da nossa equipe unida pra conseguir o resultado, nossa trabalho exigia muita concentração e a parte boa era quando entregávamos tudo no prazo estipulado.Os nossos lideres sempre compreensíveis e atento a equipe, vendo as necessidades passando feedback sempre que possível e necessário."
good,"Company doesn't  have any new products to sell, so to please the stockholders - they are cutting costs any way they can. Older lines of business, multiple confusing internal processes , outsourced much work to Phillipines and India. US employees just waiting for next outsource- short sighted senior leadership that creates overwhelming workload for mid mgrs. and sups. Hourly employees bleed blue and are given thanks and fairly nice perks, but this nice treatment doesn't make up for lack of cohesion, advancement , or team building. Unless you have prior management experience, don't expect advancement here. Front line managers are generally understanding and very supportive - upper leaders are totally out of touch with anything other than analytics and reports provided to them."
good,"entrada 7:45 am, reportarse en el área, preguntar por los que ha seres del día al supervisor ."
good,This company was a wonderful stepping stone.  I would recommend this company to other area professionals.
good,"Overall good place to work....if you don't mind hard LONG days...first time your not needed they will throw you to the curb though. I ""exceeded expectations"" every year on my review and got pennies. My job ""disappeared"" after 6 years."
good,Enjoyed my short tenure at IM. Difficult business to learn without consistent training and time on the job.
good,"IM has a great office atmosphere and does not look or feel like other call center jobs. The management team for the most part were very understanding and most of the time had an open door policy. The hours were great, no weekends, the staff/management team did little things to show their appreciation (ex. cooking breakfast for the whole center, dress down days, etc)"
good,"Tareas mecánicas de manipulación de expedientes administrativos con repeticiones muy altas. Tareas muy simples. Ambiente de trabajo muy agradable gracias a los compañeros, en la misma situación que yo."
good,"Poor management no communcation between them, lazy co-workers"
good,"Well for what is was, i enjoyed working here as well, just to many leaders and lack of communication."
good,"Drive company van to pick up documents for storage and shredding, Scan  boxes for pickup, complete paper work. stage records on pallet, shrink wrap, placed in proper location at the warehouse using forklift or electric pallet jack."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalha lá, só que tem vezes que o gerente te coloca em outra unidade pra fazer serviço que não é adequado a sua profissão."
good,Iron Mountain had a contract with a Hospital in Denver where we would complete the ROI Requests. They lost the contract for the hospital right before I left the company.
good,"if you are just looking for a job to get by this is the place for you.No real compensation for the work that has to be put in for ""them"" to be successful"
good,"Organized , strict like the military.  Fun and easy to understand job task."
good,"The Company is good to start out with but if you are looking to advance within the company it can be rather challenging. I currently relocated across the US for a ""promotion"" in which i was already working at the tier above this and now the chances of reaching the next tier still seem highly unlikely. The culture for advancement is driven by favorites and more often than not the favorites are not good choices for business."
good,"I was placed there as a temp. If you are planning on being a temp there expect to be easily replaced if you have to miss 3 days or more due to hospitalization or for any reason. You will be fired or let go due to ""slow key strokes""."
good,"Everyday is not the same every project is not the same. "
good,"Same as any other driving / warehouse job.  Long hours sometimes, pay is meh and there is no real advancement.  You drive, you lift things and then you go home.  Good people"
good,"This job involve quite a bit of camaraderie. The work was extremely hard, the warehouse conditions were safe, but uncomfortable. Record center Employees needs seemed to be an after thought. I leaned a lot about how to advocate for my team to reduce churn. I did enjoy the team environment, but it was difficult to enforce overtime standards by ""encouraging the team to work faster/harder"
good,I loved the ability to work from home two days out of the five day work week! I worked with some of the most talented people in the business. . You must be willing to  work long hours each day in order to have  a successful career.
good,"Its a good place to work, but i worked thru an agency and they only sent me when work was available. It was just on and off work, and thats why i stopped working there."
good,"I came in the door at $7.50/hr and after 17 years of hard work, I never reached $20/hr. I would fill in for everyone else who called in, working many days solo...especially in snowy weather. 2 time recipient of Employee of the Month/Quarter. Recognized by more than 4 customers winning Special Awards directly from them...not from Iron Mountain. I solved problems where some of the managers could not find a solution. I was dedicated and enjoyed my fellow employees and the common goal. Then, I suffered a debilitating work injury and was discarded. Fought to get my claim acknowledged, could barely walk for 9 months while waiting for surgery approval. Never was called back for an exit interview (as normally required) and was terminated as an employee via letter in a Fed Ex envelope. Now 5 years later, I am still waiting for my Permanent Partial Disability payout. Could have been much better."
good,Salary should be higher but they do make up for it with good benefits and 401k. It is a friendly environment with opportunities to advance your career.
good,"Escritorio fica junto com um dos galpoes espalhados em SP, por isso é mal localizado, fica em um local mais parado, sujeito a assaltos, e fica longe do ponto de onibus, o acesso para quem é pcd é dificil."
good,"The business is stable so a great place if you want a job for life! but you will work for it, and often very long hours. This may be one of the most challenging places ive ever worked but the upside was career advancement hitherto unknown to me, excelling in credit control ended up with me as UK Billing Manager. When I stopped enjoying it I left, simple really! The people there are knowledgeable and patient, and overall it is a meritocracy, the standard battles exist between sales and the operation, as this is a very logistics driven business so contracts and customer service are paramount, but these are driven by both areas being very passionate about what their customers need and what we can deliver. Although by the end I really had had my fill of the place overall i really enjoyed it and benefited from it."
good,"Started out good and learned a lot."
good,"Good group, if not a little lazy, no stress, but they tend to leave you with heavy work alone for hours, its tough getting vested, but the pay was decent"
good,"Was a stressful environment without proper ergonomic office support. The trainer was fallacious in informing you what to do, and she brought many personal issues to the job which affected the work environment and how you were treated. The system is a bit antiquated, and if these things were improved, it would be ideal for production purposes."
good,"•	Trained new people to index records to customer specifications and follow Iron Mountain security procedures to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,Management says they want you to succeed but don't give you to the tools to do so. Leads and distributed unevenly. A very what have you done for me today culture.
good,"Company is very good because of few people company name is spoiling."
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar , porém n tem cargo específico para cada área tudo q se fazia era o mesmo registro, só quem tinha registro diferencial era as líder e encarregados"
good,"You take your job seriously because you are collecting confidential wastes from customers."
good,I am neutral right now. Recall has a lot of potential. What they do with it is dependent on what happens with the company merger.
good,Enjoyed working at this place. It has its ups and down. Very physical  labor. Sometimes it could be a bit overwhelming. Learned a lot about warehouse and warehouse safety working here. Enjoyed working in teams tho about Eighty percent of the time you worked alone in the warehouse. Very big company with multiple locations.
good,"learned data entry , teamwork, communication better with manger and upper management level"
good,The work environment was bland. Didn't have a lot of interaction with management and didn't have moral boosters. Everyone to themselves.
good,"Staff helpful, management was a learning experience to prep me for my next posting. lots of heavy lifting, it was hard on the body but good for the mind."
good,Daily I sit in a dusty somewhat clean area and input information into the dusty computers as fast as I can. Love the free coffee. Not a fan of the spiders throughout the warehouse and on the pallets. Co-workers there are always kind. Hardest part of the job is really in my opinion DEALING WITH THE DUSTAND THE CHANGING TEMPERATURES. Other than that its a great environment.
good,"-courier"
good,"Very little room for advancement unless your their ""type,"" a higher-up that can be controlled by upper management. Pay is fair but management's egos make working here more difficult. "
good,"always a dived between departments good bunch of lads but the money in not very good and long hours , not enough gratitude from management"
good,"Layer after layer of middle management  who's main purpose it seems was to keep upper management shielded from the real results of their decision making. They have a open door policy that leads to a closet. It's a company that says all the right things to it's hourly employees but lack of action and acknowledgement spoke much louder. "
good,I prefer not to provide my review to the public.I prefer not to provide my review to the public.I prefer not to provide my revI prefer not to provide my review to the public.iew to the public.I prefer not to provide my review to the public.I prefer not to provide my review to the public.I prefer not to provide my review to the public.
good,ma mission était de saisir des documents variés au but de les archiver informatiquement
good,Come in enter information in the computer database there were friendly people there just the position did not last long I was working through a Staffing Agency.
good,"Serviço muito repetitivo,salario é pouco e nao tem chance de crescimento na empresa."
good,Managing daily workload by scheduling employees. Good overall benefits. Hardest part is staying up on all the new processes.
good,"No opportunity for growth, was there over 10 and 1/2 years, a knowledgable, devoted, and responsible employee. Supervisor position opened and I applied. They hired of the street, someone with no knowledge of the business. I was let go 1 month after supervisor was hired. I feel I was making to much money and they wanted to cut down on payroll."
good,If you fulltime your work is easy and temporary employees are not valued as much.They treat the temporary employees less than fulltime employees on a constant basis.
good,"Hours were fine, leads were fine. Management was MEH. They kind of let you go about  your day just fine,but weren't really interested in your opinion."
good,"Can be a rather stressful environment, as a driver primarily serving D.C. customers, I was often given too many stops to do with impossible times to complete them. The company never offered a helper. Favoritism for certain drivers, while other drivers would have to pick up the slack and get double to triple the workload. Very unsafe work environment."
good,"I enjoy my work for Iron Mountain & adore our customers. I support internal and external stakeholders by addressing their concerns. These concerns range in nature and complexity and are the core reason I enjoy the work, it is novel and every varying. My key difficulties with my role tie into accountability and management culture. They express a Leave alone, Zap mentality towards performance which reduces drive."
good,"I worked in shred dept. 3 years, the guys u work with are awsome. Pay was ok,starting rate was. 15 per hour, long hours, by the time you know your route, they totally change it, raises are insulting upper management is set in there ways and will lesson,  but thats all, the trucks are ok, no help for drivers, stair carries were you out, glad I quite"
good,"This was a great company to work but over the years management has falling off. Recently I had a supervisor that was working for iron mountain 19 years, she no longer works for the company anymore."
good,The benefits could be better.  If you stay focused on your job you will succeed.  Many don't get recognized by management for what they have improved or added to the team.
good,I learned alot about logistics side in the records center.You can learn alot thier.The culture is diversity .Alot of Overtime thiert too.You get 4 bonuses a year based on how the company does.You will work in different buildings based on who may have more work . Management is not good .The hardest part of job is lifting over size boxes an reaching far in order to go into a 3 deep or 3 high locations  .Best part about job is know one will bother you if you doing your  work.An it's not  fast paced .Very physical job
good,empresa boa para se trabalhar mas a vivencia e a rotina foi diferente das outras empresa onde já trabalhei.
good,iş cok rahat ve güzel sadece maaşı ve yönetim olarak zayıf bir şirket ancak iş olarak cok cok güzel bir iş
good,"It was okay, not a lot of career advancements and they liked to shuffle people between different buildings to fill gaps. Depending upon your job you'd have to change your routine every day, which was both a benefit and a hindrance."
good,"That's just what we were told by a driver from a different market."
good,"I was able to gain experience managing a team that was customer support oriented rather than sales. "
good,Seems like the company doesn’t care about the employees. Always having new rules. Working till every stop is done no matter what time. Only give certain people cost of living raise.
good,"Manager QA team around the world. Promote Agile-scrum Framework within QA, standard QA process cross the function. Challenges are management not equipped to handle difficult situation and foresee any risk could arise."
good,"Em geral é uma boa empresa, só acho que deixa a desejar quanto a oportunidades de promoção.E alguns gestores deveriam ter um preparo melhor para as funções desempenhadas."
good,when i first started this job was great fair amount of work and hours that weren't so hard. over the last year however management has shifted and our days have become difficult beyond what it should be.
good,"Empresa agradável para o trabalho,um ambiente muito bom. Apesar do trabalho ser temporário tive um bom rendimento."
good,"The people I worked with were fantastic.  However, upper management had demoralized staff by continuing to outsource jobs over seas even though past history has shown that they necessary tools to think outside the box are not part of the culture."
good,"Main interest is on profit and not service"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of removing staples, paper clips, as well as prep documents. I've learned to be more organized and very attentive to detail. The managers were easy going. The hardest part for working with Iron Mountain was the setting. It was a warehouse setting and it could get extremely hot while working. The most enjoyable part on the job was the fact we could sit down while working as well as listen to our media players. The people all around me were great spirits and worked really good with each other."
good,"Much felt to be up in the air as non-core business areas were evaluated."
good,"love the work everything seems easy and all the supervisors seems nice and fun to work with. i've learn different skills and it was a fun experience working at iron mountain. the work place is clean have friendly coworkers and fun to work with. the only hard part of the job is when you work out of the company other than data entry, they have different position and they will make you travel to a lot of different location that are far from home. the most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to learn different kind of work and they are really helpful too... the supervisors will always help you on learning new skills cause this is a really fast based job, if you are not fast enough to hit there goals and don't finish the work on time they will let you go or terminate you from work if you are not fast enough to get the job done."
good,This was a temporary job at the time that paid bills but didn't pay very much and didn't allow any room for advancing.  Ones the work ended I was laid off.  Management were helpful here and supportive of our efforts while I was working.
good,"Trabalho de atendimento à demanda de clientes. Por causa da crise, todos os empregados necessitam aprender de tudo um pouco, o quê faço com prazer, mas a gerência tem procurado organizar os processos com cobranças de metas severas, porém não leva em conta a pessoa que realiza o trabalho. As equipes são interessadas nos resultados, e nos ajudamos com o resultado em equipe e até pessoal, mas nem sempre recebem a valorização justa."
good,"Great People"
good,"Management changed alot. It had its ups and downs, not alot of pay increases, sometimes the work is slow so you dont get alot of hours. Your check fluctuates with the hours"
good,"Trabajo bajo presión."
good,"I would pull and put away files also box. "
good,If you are looking for a place for steady employment with little or no experience then this is the place for you. Basic ready & math is required.
good,"Fairly decent but not the best place to work.  Upper management is usually biased and there is hardly any scope for promotion among minority.  Although there is no pension plan, their 401K plan is decent enough to replace the pension plan. Working condition are terrible both in the winter and summer."
good,"Era uma empresa que valorizava os seus funcionários e sempre fazia o possível para que todos tivesse o mínimo para que desempenhasse bem o seu serviço. Aprendi como se deve atuar com documentos, e a ser ágil e atento ao que se desempenha no trabalho."
good,Routing drivers and paperwork that was needed to be done daily. learned more about the computers that I worked with. Supervisor was great to work with at this building. All co-workers were fun to be around and they were very nulligable in there fields. Making sure that all work was completed at the end of the day before leaving.
good,Una empresa con muchas oportunidades para aprender con crecimiento personal y laboral
good,"Avalio a empresa em questao como boa, pois, tem seus pros e contras, onde buscam diariamente o equilibrio exato."
good,a empresa anteriormente era chamada de Keepers Brasil que foi adquirida pera Iron pois manteve os mesmo chefe a onde a chefia sempre foi de ter uma boa comunica com subordinados os gerentes gerais sempre atencioso a empresa otima de trabalhar somente alguns supervisores que estregava a empresa em si mais ate agora nao encontrei outra empresa que nem esta a Keepers Brasil/iron
good,There are a lot of great people who work there but Senior leaderships disconnected to employees and customer needs. Reorganizations are now a norm.
good,"A Typical day at work is from 8:30 to 5:00. I been with Iron Mountain for almost 18 years, I learn that you really have to be able to work with different personalities and be physically and mentally healthy. The most enjoyable part of the job is making it thru the day and knowing you did a good job."
good,"fun work and plenty of it, too many unproductive meeting. Completely focused on hourly employee experience. Most people were great, confusing compensation structure"
good,They bought out our last company Cornerstone records and within a four to five month period they let everyone go almost. just kept the higher ups but us little guys got the axe.
good,"A physical 8 hour shift where you get to learn and teach different processes to and from your co-works. Really isn't brain surgery, just physical. Most enjoyable part of the job would be that your able to converse with pretty much anyone in the facility."
good,I m working in this conpany in last 3 year. my job prifile is preocessing activation of sim cards.
good,"Sadly, over the past two years Iron Mountain has become obsessed with measuring every action taken in the workplace in the hopes of increasing productivity. This movement has caused moral to plummet company wide and made the workplace less desirable while having nearly no effect on productivity. Even longtime employees are seeking new horizons as it becomes less possible to complete tasks."
good,"Very Busy "
good,I moved up in this company also. I went from just pulling files to working on creating shelving space for barcoded systems and i also did delivery services and sales so this job also gave me a lot of experience.
good,"Well i was a very responsible worker, always in time and willing to help other drivers to get their route done."
good,"Since new operations chief took over some years back,there has been an environment of stress paranoia and vindictivness.a kind of petty dictatorship.Customers concerns were usualy ignored or treated after multiple calls to the point the company lost a major client ,it is a shame things could have went better for the company."
good,o processo de gestão deles não é bom pios só são reconhecidos os funcionários que eles querem
good,I continually demonstrated success by surpassing all quotas. Won and attended Chairman's Club every year.
good,answer phone
good,"A typical day was moderate. I learned most about admin and HR skills. Management started off well and changed during the reorg. My co-workers were the best part of the job, they made it easy to get by during those hard days."
good,"Want to experience more from a company. I have learned a lot from here such as Kofax and Ascent Capture 7.5, I have also learned a lot about business management."
good,All of the workers at the warehouse agreed that the workload was too heavy for 4 workers to handle. This was due to management not hiring enough workers to cover the workload.
good,"On a typical day, its smooth. The co-workers are smooth also. The hardest part of the job is when we have to load the cart and move them to the next designated area. The part I like is that we get to listen to music, it helps the time go by pretty fast."
good,Loft style office made for comfy work enviorment. Very close team.
good,"Ok if you like micro management. Very high employee turnover, low wages, management lack skills to successfully perform their duties or evaluate their subordinates."
good,Man gewöhnt sich an die Firma. Arbeitszeiten sind ok. Überstunden sind zu leisten ggf. Mit den Vorgesetzten ist gut zu reden.
good,"Not sure, but few thing not well going on at work place. shift changes sudden. that impact on health. allowances benefits not on time and well."
good,"I always found that flexible working was always on the table for me in my role, although that is not always the case in other roles.  The Company could be accommodating where possible."
good,"A typical day at work is varied."
good,"The climate and culture at Iron Mountain shifted dramatically since its conversion to a REIT, and other fundamental changes. Diminishing employee satisfaction and job security looms."
good,"My 18 years with the company has overall been a positive experience, allowing the right balance of Benefits and personal life.There is no room for personal or career growth as the company is fed from acquisitions and seldom trains and promotes from within. My experience is that IRM if a great place to work for up and coming career seekers looking to establish a good working balance while preparing for the next step."
good,"My day at work consists of not really knowing what I'm stepping into. My department does mostly does job site customer purges and pick ups mainly, but when I am in the warehouse I do anything from box write ups for information, Data Entry, and also Digital Imaging work. I've learned a great deal of computer work from working in the data entry and data imaging departments including DCS, Excel, and MSDOS formatted warehouse programs. The hardest part of the job is communication within my department which lacks also with trust. There also seems to be no room for moving up. It seems to be a dead end job to me and I want more. However, its not all to bad the good side is I have had a stable job and no signs of being let go. Job security has always been my number one concern, but it is time for a new learning curve and commitment to a company that will take better care of me and in return I will give them my all."
good,Depends on the group you get in with.  If you are a worker they will use that for sure but at the same time the non workers have few repercussions for not contributing to the team.  Room for advancement is really tough if you are not in the right group.
good,Très bonne formation en interne Bonne ambiance dans l ensemble
good,"Uma empresa que não cresce no mercado, devido sua administração."
good,"nice place to work"
good,Load vehicle with computer tapes to different companies to drop off and switch out. Get directions to and from companies and manage your time and driving laws while in company vehicle.
good,"There was no room to advance primarily due to the size of the operation in Winnipeg. The management was strong but overworked."
good,"In General the company isn't bad.  Its good hard work but it is very stressful. No real advancements in moving up the ladder in a career. They do pay for lunches from time to time and try to promote fun activities for the employees. "
good,"People to work with ok. Management pretty bad, with a lot of expectations. All based on metrics and once you fail at something, feels like you're on trial being treated like biggest criminal. Management had no communication skills with employees and just care about metrics instead of hearing out employee concerns. Good benefits and bonuses."
good,"A typical shift would be 8:30am to 5:00am with 30 mins unpaid lunch. I would clock immediately once entering the building. I would then receive work orders to complete while checking my work e-mail for possible additional tasks. I would continue to do so until the tasks are complete on time and when the shift ends with occasional overtime. "
good,Just be on time and finish your work and the day will go by smoothly. You also need to keep track of your work throughout the day. Some computer skills are required.
good,routine and physical but a good job if you are a student or if you can climb up the ladder of management. not alot of interaction with people so the days can get long but overall it's not bad
good,I started there as a temporary employee to hire from a recruiter.  I was offered a position full time after 60 days pending a urine drug screen.  I worked there for approximately 1 and a half  years until I was able to secure a better offer with another company.
good,"Great company in terms of stability and smarts when approaching the market. It is firmly entrenched with fortune 1000 companies and aggressively investing in the future of information storage."
good,The job culture was nice. This is a great place for millennials to work and to gain new work experience. The new work location is very bright and pleasant.
good,"hard work, fast paced environment. Big on safety and security. Hard to balance home and work life,,,,, Very demanding company. The CEO has no compassion for his work force its all about the $$$$$$$"
good,"Go out on route and pickup destructon from customers, along with deliver files. Come back off load truck at the end of day.Pick up boxes at customer locations."
good,The front-line employees are usually ignored as management dictates almost everything while setting unrealistic goals.  Limited resources often forces employees to improvise by taking short-cut.  The overall work environment is a friendly one but many unproductive employees are not coached.  Compensation could be more for the type of industry.
good,This company can be ran much more efficiently if management followed company rules and employees truly embodied the teamwork work ethic! There is no work/life balance in my particular job position.
good,"I meet some of the best people at Iron Mountain.  Team work, employees very engaged in their jobs and willing to help others. You work hard and you can move up."
good,"O dia a dia era muito puxado e corrido,mas era um ambiente bom de trabalhar."
good,This was a low paying Job pulling records and making copies.  There was not a lot of room for advancement.  I wouldn't work there again.
good,Learned Customer care and working with sales also leaned how to use Sales Force and SKP. Great people to work with. Working as a Customer Care Advocate gave to the opportunity to use my communication skill help customers.
good,A typical day for working in the RIO department is a mixture of rude customers and nice ones. Some days it is laid back while other days it is hectic.  I have learned a lot about processing medical records for various types of request.  It is a great learning experience but I would not want to retire doing this line of work.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer that get mad that you are just following procedures being just outright difficulty.
good,Iron Mountain culture has changed in the past 4 years. It is focused mostly on targets and profits. This culture change has seen a decline in employee and management engagement as everything is aimed at reducing cost and finding larger margins of profit. Local leaders are focused on profits rather than the people that work for them.
good,"lost in the woods,  no strategic direction.  No internal communication or cooperation. no long term stability, VERY HIGH turnover"
good,"gezellige bedrijf waar veel werk is en veel te doen is"
good,"Uma ótima empresa de trabalhar, porém com poucas oportunidades de carreira !"
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho , bons benefícios. Localização um pouco perigosa e de difícil acesso."
good,"Was a temp worker. The job wasn't overly difficult or stressful. Management was relaxed and friendly, but the job itself is insubstantial."
good,"A typical day starts with reviewing performance and targets.  This is followed by a short daily meeting with direct reports reflecting daily and weekly goals, along with miscellaneous business updates. After the morning meeting the rest of the day is to follow up on emails, assist customers, perform research, follow up with employees regarding their daily performance, perform or follow up on safety and security concerns, and help any employee with any concern."
good,"Decent pay, but they overwork you for the money that you get...needs to be Unionized!!! Management changes, just to change!"
good,"Typical mon-fri job with a 45 minute lunch. Great Co-Workers. Difficult to ""move up"", Pigeon holds. Decent bonuses."
good,"This company has the ability to be very flexible for their employees, which is wonderful. I work on a great team, and my manager is very good. However, there really isn't much room to grow or explore other areas within the company. The bonus structure is fair, but the salaries and raises are less than desirable."
good,A typical day at Iron Mountain is assisting with customer needs. To ensure that ours customers are satisfied and to maintain a great relationship. I work well with other team members as well as management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the changes. Change is good but it takes times to get use to. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I know that I have done a great job at completing my work and that my internal and external partners are happy.
good,"Shipping and receiving "
good,"Très bonne collaboration avec les équipes de travail."
good,"La empresa es solida con pocas opciones de crecer"
good,Protect and Transport confidential media data for various Fortune 500 companies throughout Southern California
good,I experienced understaffing for several months that resulted in very long hours. Upper management would not authorize additional staffing.
good,work day started at 8am to deliver to customers i worked within a team( i did not like the idea of compulsary overtime no one went
good,i enjoyed my time here. nice people. good work flow. good hours.
good,Good Company with not so good management.
good,"A typical day at work, is to come in at 8am, sign into your phone and computer and work cases/requests all day trying to meet production."
good,"work is good sometimes management shows partiality. be good with them."
good,"Incoming work is usually received daily, then sorted and filed.This is a warehouse environment with workstations. Most of the workday is spent standing up . Safe work practices are continually stressed. Management is lean but usually fair. Performance-based compensation (bonuses) are paid quarterly. Opportunities for advancement do exist."
good,"Office environment, rigid schedule, high phone call volume, lots of tracking and reporting, biggest downfall they treat you like a number rather than a person."
good,"No es un lugar que recomiende para laborar, ofrecen un buen salario, un buen horario pero son poco consientes de lo tedioso de las tareas, es entendible que cuiden la calidad del trabajo que realizan, por lo mismo no es un trabajo para cualquiera, pues es difícil crecer laboralmente ahí."
good,"Empresa com excelente infraestrutura, porém péssimo acesso."
good,"I am not sure why this is brought up as an option or why I can't remove this request as I never worked for Iron Mountain.  In past employments I have had interactions with IM, and it seemed to be an efficiently run organization."
good,"This company is good for workers. This company pay his workers a good amount of money, good work timing (9hrs.), Workers safety is the first preference to them. But they force his workers to do some work which is the particular worker's out of the job role. Otherwise this company is good."
good,"I was referred to Iron Mountain through a temporary service.  I worked a year before I was hired. Iron Mountains setup is great & but the people they hire as management is where the problem comes in.. You have to be able to put your personal opinions aside & do your job. Iron Mountain has good benefits, ok pay & they get bonuses every quarter if you make your budget per quarter."
good,"Simple enough work, and a good way to earn extra money for retired and students; however, the conditions for working in the cells located in the warehouse are less than desirable. Few workers are able to be in the air-conditioned rooms, when the majority of us are subject to the heat of the warehouse, even with several fans on. "
good,The management had their pic with their favorite employees . So it was hard for other employees to be able to grow. Other then that the job was ok to work.
good,"Great place to broaden your exposure and hone your to management skills. Facility management, team performance, fleet operations, chain of custody, customer service, audit preparedness and customer service."
good,"The job itself is very boring. You sit there and just take staples out of old office documents for 8 hours a day. The pay was nice, and you get 2 15 min breaks in the day that are paid. The biggest complaint I have is that the location where most of the people (including me) was located in was not air conditioned and almost unbearable to be in the heat for 8 hours a day in a warehouse during the summer.

You are not allowed to take any water or beverage out at the warehouse while you work. So I would prefer to be on the road receiving and purging files from hospitals and Law Firm
good,"It was a fun place once. Management has changed you are left off in abondonement. Some have gotten raises and I for example hasnt. Management has recognized the error and promised a fixture but three years in to it and nothing. The demand is high, you get overworked and others parade on your work, it is demoralizing. There is lack of encouragement and naturally we need some at some point.  Selective preferences and bias behavior."

good,I work as part of a team archiving information from the aircraft industry onto a computer system.  The hardest part of the job is sifting through all the technical information then deciding what is relevant to the records.
good,"Excellent job to have  ! Your left alone as long as you get your job done .Management on the other hand dosent care about you at all . If they like you well then your golden but if they don't watch out . Their is no team work at this job it's man/women  for themself . Routing and or dispatch push you to do more and more after a 10,11 Hr day very long hours . Work is very physical if your scared to work not the place to apply for ."
good,fun place with supportive management not about numbers but how yo personally grow and develop.it is an ok company becouse i believe the management can improve in a lot of things to manage their staff properly.
good,I started at a time when the company was restructuring.  I would not be fair to Iron Mountain if I gave reviews during that tumultuous time.
good,"3 man ISP and computer repair shop.  We did everything from troubleshoot/build computers/servers in shop and in home to designing and implementing network solutions for large deployments such as school districts and national reach corporations."
good,"Start by learning my assignment for the day."
good,"I worked for Iron Mountain for almost 7 years and all but a few of those years were positive.  The company has been going through many changes, from corporate structure, to local management, which at the end of the day has hurt the overall environment, at least in the local territory where I worked.  I learned a lot about management and myself over the past 6 years at Iron Mountain, and at the end of the day, I wouldn't take back any of the good or the bad, for it has helped me grow and understand the type of manager I want to be.  I've learned that the people are the most important part of a company and when you neglect that side of the business, all can fall apart fast.  I love being around and managing people, and this job gave me the chance do hone those skills over the years.  Though things did not work out in the end with myself and the company, I am happy where I am at and look forward to my next growth opportunity."
good,"When I started with the company I started as a temp and moved up within the company.  I have done the data entry and even project management.  That was up in Des Moines, Iowa.  Working up there it was more of a family than just a work site.  Moving down to KC, that was a different story.  I became a manager and didn't have the backing that I had up home.  I had a lot of problems with my employees and didn't seem to have the support of my higher ups to see what was actually going on and fix the things that needed to be fixed.  I got selected for a project that took about 8 months, in the beginning it was a nightmare and again didn't have the support that I needed to do the job correctly.  I got the hang of it slightly and got a good crew to work for me, then when I was about done I got a severance package.  I thought it was the end of the world when that happened, but I no longer have the stress that I had when I worked there and don't have to try to change things that need to be changed to only get told no.  Not a bad place to work if you want to go with the flow.  I was with them for about 8 years, but they are always looking to consolidate all departments and make things run as efficiently as possible.  Problem is that there is no room for human error or taking time off.  The teams are so lean that if 1 person is off for any amount of time, everyone has to scramble if something large comes in the door."
good,"bom eu fiquei nesta empressa dois anos conheci bem ela o dia de trabanho era muito repetitivo,mais eu gostava,eu aprendir muitas coisas boas que eu gostei,a meus colegas de trabalho era todo de bom.,bom a parte mais dificilpra mim não tinha,mais que eu gostava de traballha lá eu gostava."

good,Actual work is good. Relaxed & friendly environment. High security for work projects. Compensated (non monetarily) for good work production. Hired as a permanent employee relies on budget or client flow for that quarter.
good,"dinámicas, atenta, compañeristas , mejorar el ambiente social sostengo que laboralmente somos muy buenos"
good,"Iron Mountain  is leader in records management. Good place to work for freshers and experienced. That is all i could say. Now outsourcing IT to HCL, which should be considered before joining."

The management team and staff were helpful, supportive in all areas, friendly and they assisted me with any information I that was needed which made the job a pleasant work environment.

good,"As a note, as I was a part-time worker, the star ratings of this particular company would probably be completely different coming from a full-time employee as they probably have more benefits, pay, etc."
good,"There are no two days the same. As a Territory Field Auditor and Implementation Specialist, I work with outside clients inspecting facilties for shred service and internal clients for Safety, Security and Standard Operational Procedures."
good,"If they stick you in REBOXING you are stuck there forever, it is repetitive and they require you to rebox 120 boxes a day, that is 1 box per 3.5 mins. That is a lot for anyone who is not used to Heavy lifting. The wear and tear on your body is not healthy. They speak safety a lot of the time, but also expect you to try and reach the quota. This job is for those well fit. Otherwise, I recommend not working there."

Se eu pudesse, voltaria pra lá sem problemas."
good,"A typical day with the guys in the warehouse ( only 5 workers in the plant) would sometimes be very quiet, mostly work related. I learned more on keeping excellent standards and good communication with outside vendors. Management I would rate at least a 3 with communication. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say the overtime, weekends off, and company events. Lunches are separated so each individual eats alone."
good,"Se puede confiar en tus jefes, y compañeros de trabajo Al momento de tener un problema siempre están ahí para Poder ayudarte y solucionarte el problema."

good,"Worked on records management side of Iron Mountain.  Good company, almost recession proof. After 2001 lots of companies went out of business, but by law you have to keep records for a period of time.  Really enjoyed the work, delivering and picking up records.

good,"Bad management, all the union workers are lazy, they get people trough staffing agencies, even tough they shouldn be in that area. Job could be better, they just"

good,"I enjoyed working with the company and my co workers the middle management was out to create little or no harmony and did not listen to common sense, while performing my job but if I was so bad I guess they would not have used me to train other drivers and never laid me off or fired me even if they were incompetent and ineffective as leaders. They were only out for themselves and often it backfired on them. Middle management was ineffective higher management were ok and sometimes needed to intervene when they did not."

good,IRON MOUNTAIN has a very good management team . They are striving for larger contacts and a more secure future for their employees !!!
good,"Iron Mountain is a great company to work for when you are getting numbers and meeting quotas that are expected. As with any very large company the benefits for healthcare and 401K are excellent. Unfortunately, the downside of working for such a large company is that when you do not have a large revenue in your department, the department closes. Overall, I would recommend them as a good company to work for as long as you are willing to do any job available."
good,It's a fair work environment good place to learn computer skills. Its a large provider of information management services. People are not a priority. Slow to accept and adapt to change.

good,nice company but was a temp project. medical record company. we are not aloud to say what happens in this company.
good,Had to consistantly keep on top of the staff to assure the work was done in a timely manner. The moral was low as the work was repetitive. Management was a huge problem with poor communication skills according to the new company take over.

good,"A lot of talented people have worked at Recall over the past 5 years or longer. Multiple product lines allow for potential growth in market and looks like Recall is poised to grow through acquisition in near future. Base pay is solid, not great.

good,"Great company... unfortunately, layoffs are routine as of the last few years.  The company does alot via e-mail and several different online portals.  If you are a person with a flexible schedule with the ability to do several different tasks in a fast-pased environment, this job is for you."

good,"era muy llevadero trabajar con mucha documentación, aprendí a ser mas responsable con cada carpeta y cada proceso que se me asignaba"
good,The job was fun. It was like a treasure hunt looking for files for the customers. The team i worked with was wonderful and welcoming. The only problem was the fact that it was hard to move up in the company.

good,"Empresa em crescimento que oferta grandes oportunidades, porém peca na gestão de conflitos e na ausência da gestão."
good,I started at Recall as a temp and worked my way up to operations manager.  It was very rewarding as I wish Iron Mountain did not purchase us but that is business and sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.  My day to day work was very educational as some days I would fill in for drivers and do routes and actually get to see the clients face to face to assist with any issues they might have.  Other days I would work with the sales team to assist with new possible clients and add my expertise as it pertained to Operations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training new drivers in my area and other states.  I have always enjoyed training people.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with vehicle breakdowns and traffic.

good,"Good place to work to sharpen your leadership skills, due to working with many people with different backgrounds. "

good,Day would start with staff meeting to discuss pervious days production numbers and any issues that prevented team from meeting goals. Reporting numbers to management.

good,"Des conditions bonnes.  Mais le management ne semble pas savoir ou il s'en va !"
good,"I received in confidential media from many fortune 500 companies to store it in the vaults as they are and off site data protection agency.

good,A job is a job. It's boring. Cool for young college students or retired ppl looking for work. You're able to listen to your music while working. Off weekends
good,Company does not worry about their employees  all about themsthemselves.  To many people get away with alot of stuff like helping others they rather sit and get paid for those 2 or 3 hours everyday. This happens everyday
good,print label for the worker to pull boxes every morning. You could talk to the manager if you had a problem. When it  was cold it was cold because you worked on the docks. Working together with the guys and not micromanage
good,High pressure to meet productivity numbers by management.  Hazardous work conditions can be present.   Opportunity for advancement available.   These circumstances also depend on the geographical location of the business.

Pour finir je reviens à mon poste jusqu'à l'heure de partir. Voilà ma journée type. Les opportunités de développement ne sont pas de mon ressort."
good,Considero que lo mas dificil de este trabajo fue la mala direccion de los jefes ya que el proyecto a realizar se encontraba en un desorden total y no se realizo una previa organizacion para no cometer errores o en el caso de nosotros que en ocasiones se hicieron procesos que no tenian que hacerse o ese no era el orden.

good,"a typical day at Iron Mountain consists of first having to prep work area. which consisted of putting skids in front of each dock for the process of trucks being unloaded. which was used by a forklift. also i had to use the forklift to put gaylords in the tipping area for the use of co workers using the tipper machine. after those tasks i had to check in with supervisor to see if any miscellaneous tasks which may have been sent from the coordinator which had to be handled if not then i would log into my scanner and log into the computer. i used the scanner to scan the bar codes on the boxes. i used the computer to print out sorts for each man on my shift including myself. the sort lets you know what boxes are on the truck, what are the characteristics of each order,and how many boxes the driver loaded onto his truck threw out the day. my co workers were alot of fun and dependable. which helps your day go by very quickly. the hardest part of the job was having to unload trucks when the volume of boxes were higher then the volume of skids we had to unload the boxes on. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about the warehouse industry threw iron mountain. as far as keeping track of inventory, and operating different types of machinery."

Ik heb geleerd hoe ik met een scanner om moet gaan, en eigenlijk ook nog heel veel andere dingen. De directie heeft af en toe moeite met een goede communicatie, maar ik heb allang begrepen dat het bij een heleboel bedrijven het geval is. Het lastigste vond ik eigenlijk wel dat er iedere keer veel veranderingen werden doorgevoerd, hetgeen betekende dat je dat in je werk weer helemaal moet verwerken.

She assisted each employee with direction on task that were more difficult. She also communicated any changes that were suppose to come down from upper management in a timely fashion.The open door policy was the most genuine I have ever experience. There was a mutual respect between the managers and their employees. When the company decided it need to do some re-structuring that would result in department elimination and lay-offs the way management handle the news was with class and grace. The information was relayed to the departments with a enough time for employees to either find other jobs within the organizations or make arrangements for when they left the company. I have never experienced such respect when dealing with lay-offs, it was reassuring feeling that although the company was and is very large employees were not just a number."

good,"Iron Mountain Incorporated is a reputable company in North America. Dealing with numerous confidential and classified documents sent from several companies, it was my responsibility to organize boxes in the warehouse according to our operating system. On an average eight hour day, i'd store around 800 boxes. These boxes weighed anywhere from twenty to sixty pounds, and no doubt all this lifting amongst three stories in our warehouse was extremely physically demanding. If no boxes were to be stored in a day, my other job in the company consisted of going through these paper documents, and scanning them in our system once they were requested back from the company, making sure we kept copy of the files. For the company's sake and privacy of others, I am never to disclose any information I have seen when employed for Iron Mountain. For the greater portion of the summer, I worked alone in the warehouse, I grew very tired easily and had no one to support me morally nor physically. It was very hard labour and I certainly did struggle at times but I had to stay mentally focused to get the job done and complete what was being asked of me. My manager, did not work in the warehouse, but several in times in the day he'd come check up on me, making sure everything was running smoothly, very good guy. Very small staff of four members, but we did work extremely hard and accomplished plenty during a day."
good,"Distribute daily work load."
good,"I entered customers information for the storage of their hard copy materials. I answered phone calls to retrieve this information as well as their orders for the labels they need to put this information into the storage facility. Most of the managers were extremely nice.

Both are critical to ensure that we are hitting our annual targets and creating that balance is key.

While I worked at Iron Mountain, I learned about the importance of confidentiality and protection of the information. Also, working as a team is part of the learning. A daily part of the job is creating a good environment of interaction with co-workers as all the preparations to go on the road are done. Many customers with different personalities are waiting for you at all kind of companies. The daily duty of a ""Mountanier"" courier is to do deliveries and pickups of the items required by the customers and register them on the system, using a scaner software. It all need to be done in a timely manner. Driving through trafic and doing some lifting, might be the hardest part of the job. Finally, all picked up and/or returned items will return to base.

It was a job where I learned by doing and that was the hardest part, for me, since the verbiage/company standards/customer expectations all had to be learned at the same time. I became quite efficient and was awarded several of the company's internal recognitions called ""Atta Boy""s. At some point, I assimilated the duties of Initial Move Coordinator into my other responsibilities as CSR. I loved those duties. When the Sales Team brought on a new account, I was identified as the customer's first point of contact for all service related concerns: how to navigate the company's online inventory system, verbiage, billing, etc. There was no time limit to when these new customers needed to move on past a dedicated contact but, with encouragement and patience, most were independent within 2 months. The main reason I sought other employment after being with Iron Mountain for barely more than a year was because the Branch Manager left and it became more and more difficult to properly execute my duties.

good,"Working at Iron Mountain was my most favorite place to work. The management and workers were all very friendly and always willing to teach and train their workers. This company had hundreds of boxes of ol files, that had to be prepared for scanning, the scanning process had to have no dust lines going through them at all, and after they were scanned, they had to go through a process where every single file was checked individually to make sure everything on the page was legible. Then all the pages would go through an indexing process, which all the file numbers had to be re-entered to ensure the numbers were entered correctly. It's a very long process, but there was always work to do and usually a few projects on the go. I absolutely loved working at this place and hope to again someday. "

When you love your job and enjoying much of your time than just working for the sake of being employed is something that I learned from my previous companies.
