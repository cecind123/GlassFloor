rating,review
bad,"They are all out for themselves and don’t care who they stab in the back. As long as they look good they don’t care what they do to others! They are evil people!"
bad,"If you are a ambitious talented growth oriented qualified candidate steer clear of this place. Its a slow moving, bureaucratic, reactive, old boys club."
bad,Bad place to work. Enbridge does not care about the employees and is a poorly managed company.  The management team is not connected with the real issues within the organization.  There is a vey bad culture at Enbridge.  Very low employee and contractor morale.
bad,"At this moment in time this company is a terrible place to work. I don't know how it used to be in the boom times or any other time but as of now it has reduced itself to a combination of poor to non-existent management and little to no organizational structure. Somehow these guys still churn a profit but I think its a fraction of what it could be and its most likely because they have given staff 3 pay cuts in the last year alone. there are layers upon layers of mgmt. that most employees don't even know about and speaking of employees, we are almost one year after the merger w/ Spectra and we still have no clue wtf we are supposed to be doing on a daily basis! Everyone makes it up as they go along due to the lack of leadership because managers are too busy at each others throats most of the time. if you have a choice, save yourself the grief and stay away from this company altogether."
bad,"Rude, spoiled employees and insecure managers. Not a place I would want to work again and glad it was only a contract position.  Cheap company and HRIS team is a joke."
bad,"Team Building were great, to get to work and interact with others ."
bad,"Management was very poor to say the least!! "
bad,"PE owned, the management is basically focused on making millions when they sell this thing in a year or so. Seems like these guys are at sea, I don't think they have it in them to manage something this complicated successfully. Directionless short term career here."
bad,"the management of union gas is so poor because their emplyees not get a salary and the contrct for this compny is fake"
bad,"People Leaders do not have the best interests of employees in mind and do not care about employee development. "
bad,There was so much turmoil within the complex where we were located and the employees where very stressed about job security as Enbridge was in the process of selling off parts of the company and the stress was terrible and made for an ackward work environment.
bad,"Slow, reactive, mismanaged, bookish, elitist. Have no clue how to retain and grow talent. This company is a haven for predatory consultants. A very stifling environment."
bad,Prior management was very good and allowed the business to grow.  once management changed the company went downhill.  Too many policies and procedures that did not add any value but allowed poor performers to hang on to a position and title.
bad,"Wages are ok, but the company is run by a bunch of useless back stabbing middle management that do nothing. Management are more concerned with their interests then that of the employees or the publics safety. If you are related or have some ties to management you can get a job here, just be sure you are prepared to kiss their butt, and watch your back with fellow employees."
bad,"Pros: A lot of PTO"
bad,"Enbridge culture is truly awful - years of layoffs and thousands of jobs lost and very little leadership to help employees through this or help staff focus on an ""end game""... few employes (if any) would be able to explain what the point of the endless restructuring is. Very profitable company, but employees feel like a liability and easily disposable. High performers are jumping ship, with high voluntary turnover in some offices. Leaders only communicate in a very scripted way, and while Corporate can churn out endless programs, initiatives, and hashtags to try to improve the culture, they've missed the obvious - that people just want to be talked to and treated like humans, respected and valued."
bad,"Watch your back.   Colleagues are out for themselves and do not care who they knife in the back.   Management leads by example.  "
bad,"Was lured with false advertising; job title originally stated as Field Construction Analyst requiring engineering technologist. Actual title was Field <b>Cost</b> Analyst, and the work requires accounting or economics. Orientation was to read a completely irrelevant set of manuals about efficient work hours, projecting cost benefit formulas, and a 6 page job description. Management is <b><i>extremely</b></i> treacherous, unwilling to take responsibility for their mistakes, of those of their minions, unwilling to provide meaningful support, and constantly set-up their field workers for failure. (At least 2 of my predecessors were constructively dismissed under similar circumstances.) Presently filing a lawsuit against Enbridge for their attempt to deprive ~$3500 in vehicle expenses (former supervisor essentially acting as a bully by using quasi-legal means.) Hardest part of the job was dealing with arrogant, conniving, and ignorant office people; extremely long hours with no time off; extremely heavy work load with zero support; waiting at least 30 days to get paid; and the office people allowing the vendors to tell the client what to do, instead of the other way around. The only enjoyable part was the pay, if/when it came on time, and the good relationship with the field team (i.e. construction manager, field inspectors, safety inspectors, and admin assistants.)"
bad,Was a contractor for 7 months in the accounts payable department. Managers just throw projects on new contractors that they don't know themselves. Nobody likes to accept responsibility for mistakes and put it off on the next person. I was very unhappy there and glad the contract ended. I would not recommend this company to anyone. The team has no morale and everyone is just going through the motion like robots.
bad,"Transition after the merger was rough.  Many layoffs - most contractors and many full time employees, many people quit, projects lost nearly all (project manager, cost analyst, schedulers, project controls, etc.) who were familiar with those projects."
bad,"When I joined Enbridge we were located downtown, great atmosphere and  a great place to work.  Fast forward and we (they) are now in an old building in the Galleria area, the power goes out monthly, the building is old and stuffy and the climate has really changed with unhappy employees, poor management, layoffs, etc."
bad,"In my experience all values are dramas. No freedom to employees for highlighting beneficial aspects for company. Buddy system for jobs. No appreciation for performances, etc."
bad,"I've worked with small, medium, large, and multi-nationals.  As well as government.  And never before did I experience the intensity and excessiveness of internal politics, strife, and game-playing."
bad,Brought me in to review a project but withheld information required to properly perform review. Then they blamed me for not being able to deliver in timeframe required.
bad,"very poor"
bad,"Enbridge used to be a fantastic place to work for, but since the Spectra acquisition, they care more about their bottom line than they do their employees.  Their work/life balance is hit or miss, depending on who you work for.  Some floors, such as the Corporate Floors, talk about it, but don't really demonstrate it.  Working hard is fine, doing overtime is fine, but it's expected.  They say they don't want it, but because Corporate floors are all about optics, they care."
bad,"A supply chain specialist with invaluable knowledge of managing projects, resources and staff in an effective and efficient manner. Professional with a comprehensive understanding of logistics, procurement and the supply chain. Boasting a consistent & proven track record of successfully employing best business practices that improve efficiency, reduce operating costs whilst increasing performance with tight time scales and within budget."
bad,"Too layoff and silly politics, this company will low-ball it's employees. You might not get a raise, even adjusted for inflation, for years and when you do it does not cover the inflation."
bad,The HQ are now in Canada. The Houston office is known for its low morale and disengagement. The leaders know this - but do nothing about it. Every week people are leaving.
bad,Current issues with the company conducting layoffs and numerous resignation among senior leadership.  Company needs a revamp of culture and employee to employer confidence.
bad,This company is in a downward spiral. No one there is happy and just goes thru the motions. I am a minority and I felt like an outsider with the people I worked with. They mad racist jokes and stupid comments and management didn't do anything when I told them. I was really miserable there and I am so glad im gone!!!!
bad,"Don’t accept any position here if you want opportunities for development, mentoring or career advancement. Since the merger with Spectra the US office in Houston is an absolute chaotic mess."
bad,The Management at Spectra Energy lacks professionalism.  Most of their managers do not know how to motivate or treat their employees.  It is pointless to go to Human Resources as nothing is done even when you go.
bad,While at Enbridge I was consistently under utilized.  Working 10 hour days and only having 1 hour of work to do in the day.  requesting more work did not seem to help.
bad,"Typical work day - shuffling useless/needless papers around, creating make work projects, basically doing nothing of value.  What did I learn?  Nothing - well, no, not true, I learned that if you have no personality and are a robot you will do fine there.  Co-workers - a joke - I hated everybody.  The hardest part of going to my job was walking in the door.  There was no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,Could not have worked for a less caring company than this one. The last 3 years were very stressful and companies transparency was a joke to say the least.
bad,"Hi,"
bad,"Let go right after a positive review"
bad,"Enbridge talks about consolidation of people and processes, yet appears unable to align standards for the multiple business units that operate under their own personal agendas. Politics are rampant among BU's with in-fighting between similar departments such as health and safety. Training is hit or miss depending on your manager, department and BU. Suspect the good pay received while employed there was the trade-off."
bad,"From the CEO down there is a lot of pressure for the company to make shareholders happy, but there is no support. Management throws everyone under the bus. Upper management makes sure they get paid first. Pay and benefits are ok. Time off can be good depending which department you work in."
bad,"I was a full time ""temporary"" employee for over two years. Was given heavier workloads than regular employees and had no chance of advancement based on union rules. Had to train people who's jobs I could not apply for."
bad,"It used to be a great place work, however, current managers are dishonest and the hiring process is corrupted. The company needs to examine their managers' integrity..."
bad,"Enbridge was a good place to work, great people, great safety culture, Daily meetings, the hardest part of the job was educating people on processes. I enjoyed helping people to understand work processes, and working on a continuous improvement ideal."
bad,This is a Canadian company - the center is in Calgary. If you are at any other location you are expendable. The company is very slow at making decisions and behaves/decides much like a very immature smaller company.
bad,"Was never paid market rate. They are in the midst of outsourcing most of the services, and it is not going well. A constant air of negativity is posing a serious risk to the mental health of all individuals. Only saving grace was my immediate supervisor, otherwise management gave us no reason to be productive."
bad,Not as nice at Spectra Energy. There is no focus on expansion.  I am in the natural gas pipline group and we are still downi sizing to combined with Enbridge.
bad,"A good place to work, challenging projects, technology based, work from home, good work, life balance, dynamic work place, training offered to CWR's, coffee......"
bad,There’s many other oil companies where you will be happy to work for then this company. This is a new company that’s an Canadian that took over from Spectra (which was much better). They lay off a lot
bad,"Used to be a great company. Good work life balance. I want to say positive things about this company, but there isnt much. I believe in a few years it may be a great place to work, but for now there are too many people leaders that do not care, and the weekly organizational changes are hard to keep up with."
bad,"Hopefully with the Enbridge transaction will come a change of the overall culture.  Outward the company looks great, but many workers feel unmotivated, disengaged etc. I believe the is equally on the part of the company as well as the workers, and therein is the issue."
bad,"The organization is unstable, there is a clear miscommunication between management and the employees. A lot of perks that were given to emolyees have been removed, along with merit increases for 2016."
bad,"In this company you have 2 project camps."
bad,I experienced absolutely no work-life balance at Enbridge. The expectations of supervisors were completed unreasonable and created the most negative work environment. It was exhausting coming into work because everyone was so unhappy. The benefits and the pay are great but not worth the sacrifice of your personal time and sanity.
bad,Very fast paced & stressful. Management changes happened at least 2 to 3 times a year. Lack of guidance from upper management. Lack of adequate training programs for employees.
bad,"It's been about 3 years now of layoffs, everyone just living in fear everyday, and there is no end in sight. This company does not care about it's people. The executives and the BOD are a bunch of greedy, heartless individuals. Do not work here."
bad,Since this was a contract position there is very little I can say.Was not happy when they cut ALL contractors pay by 10%. Working in a culture where you had to depend on fellow contractor for help and could not/would not get it if they wanted to move a friend in to take your place.
bad,"Enbridge cut my turnaround work scope by 25% and terminated me on lack of work."
bad,"Management was very intense very skeptical, did not empower its employees or leadership, lack of collaboration very negative environment. Not a positive."
bad,"A company at the end of the day, looking out for the safety of those they service.  Safety priority is key and the main objective of all working there."
bad,Top heavy organization with limited advancement and terrible Management. Very little regard to the personnel safety of its staff. Many silos in the organization with many Managers believing they run the company. Low producing workers are rewarded with long employment while high producing workers are frowned upon.
bad,"Not the best learning environment. If you want a stress free job. Then this is the place for you. The environment is very relaxed, but depending on your personality this can be bad since almost nothing gets done. There is really no sense of urgency or need to improve things."
bad,Enbridge is a very top heavy and bureaucratic company that is highly disorganized and has lots of waste. Enbridge's management usually care more about meeting arbitrarily defined measurable than innovating and trying to create efficiencies. however some managers are great but most are not. Management is usually unable to properly plan project staffing requirements and leave the people that are there to perform extra work without recognition.
bad,"Traditional and non-transparent management style, lack of communication, silos, politics and family/personal relationships, poor leadership and spoiled staff. Middle managers and people leaders are pushed to do all the work and receive poor support from management."
bad,"Aggressive targets set out by management has severely compromised work/life balance and expectations on employees are unrealistic.  After 3 rounds of layoffs, the company has committed to transactions requiring twice the staff to execute. "
bad,Enbridge had the wrong VP who risked all our jobs by envesting in construction projects that were cancelled.  Manager did not know how to make decisions based on temporal analysis.
bad,"Used to be a great company to work for, but tough times means they only care about the bottom line. Many changes look good when looking at it from the executive level, but at the individual contributor level, things are less efficient, less productive and some times just does not make sense."
bad,"Years ago Enbridge was THE place to work if you wanted to work for  a large company. Excellent compensation, benefits, and a defined benefit pension plan that you rarely see any more."
bad,Constant threat of down-sizing (while the top 10 increase their bonuses) makes this a stressful (toxic) environment. Current CEO is an accountant and bean-counting is his specialty - not a great place to work.
bad,"All management cares about is the bottom line. And if a manager does not like you, it will not matter how effective you are at your job. If you like brown-nosing, this is for you."
bad,"Its an ok place to work if you dont want to advance and you  are a supervisors favorite. I am disappointed in the direct supervision here.  They pick favorites, and if your not one of them, you will never be able to advance. The pay is good, the benefits are good, but thats about all I can say."
bad,"Too focused on union issues."
bad,"The company transformation is obvious under the current management. Focus on the numbers, less information is better, outsourcing critical activities outside, promotion is based on the loyalty. Very sad to see cultural transformation."
bad,"The morale of the employees has drastically diminished over the past three years prior to the merger with Spectra. I've learned that you don't have to know anything related to the job, you just have to know the right people."
bad,"This review based on my experience at Enbridge Gas. I was unlucky to work with one of the worst managers and hence i had a bad experience. I believe that Enbridge should be a good place to work but any company can be either fantastic or bad place based on your manager leading style. "
bad,"Great pay and benefits.  Poor management, and atmosphere. My belief is that in the not so distant future all of the Duluth/Superior offices will close, and the only office in MN will be in Edina."
bad,"Early incarnation of company was extremely positive with fair-minded management and ample opportunity to learn and advance."
bad,"The people executing the work at Enbridge are generally a fantastic group.  Unfortunately the torment of the past 2 years with consistent and substantial lay-offs has greatly affected the staff."
bad,"A typical day at work I spent trying to get resources that are scarce or extinct to mission critical work. I have learned to get by with less, and what the real meaning of CYA is. Middle management means well, but has their hands tied by decision makers. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing anything."
bad,"Stagnate growth to be expected in large corporate community. Work life balance is best in class, maybe too good."
bad,"Over the years I’ve been working here I’ve been seeing the team spirit and employee satisfaction go down. Christmas parties removed. No more team engaging activities. No encouraging team leads. Poor management and job advancement. "
bad,"The culture has gone down the tubes, especially in IT. I wouldn't recommend working here. The staff is mediocre and there are no longer any opportunities. The benefits and work\life balance can't really be beat though"
bad,"Large Separation between Management and the Front Line worker. Large number of Temporary employees who with poor Union Representation remain temporary for years. Management controls staff using fear of outsourcing, and it shows in it's workers who will do what management wants instead of what would benefit customers. "
bad,I worked there for a few years  and from day one the people in that company were awful. Nit picking everything you did from getting a coffee at a certain time to if you didn't shave that day. Management is and has always been out of touch . The company preaches diversity yet has really no people of colour working there. I would recommend staying away from the company..
bad,"Experience depends greatly on who you work for, some managers are great to work for while others are not so great."
bad,"Not much career advancement opportunities. "
bad,"Enbridge just acquired Spectra Energy in 2017 which means that executives receive golden parachutes and regular employees get laid off; some with severance pay and others with very little. When you double the size of the company, the board of directors and shareholders don't want double the employees, and whoever is not laid off picks up double the workload with the same pay."
bad,average place to work; average salary; some opportunities to learn
bad,• Efficiently worked with the clients to understand the workflow of the AS-IS business process and helped preparing Business blueprint documents.
bad,"With 7 years of service, I made the choice to leave because I was tired of regularly working 11 hours days (2.5 of those unpaid...there is no overtime at Enbridge for salaried employees).  This was the norm, not the exception.  "
bad,"Great pay and benefits, ability to move up within the company were good provided you were willing to put in the hours which would include bringing you laptop and cell phone on vacation which didn't provide very good work/life balance."
good,"You will be viewed as a 2nd or 3rd class citizen.  Workload is untenable.   You will not receive recognition and will be left out of all celebrations.  Unless of course you are tasked with organizing them.  "
good,"Lack of direction from management"
good,"Company is going through lots of changes with the merger, not very consistent with work within different disciplines. Didn't receive proper training and didn't renew my contract with them."
good,"Assigned to 9 utility Inspectors and 9 welding Inspectors to Oversee the preparation,   maintenance, and testing of various quality control standards of utility Procedure Specifications, preparation of procedure qualification records, Subcontractor quality surveys, and final inspection determination by DOT, State and County specifications."
good,Too many relatives working at company. People get promoted not based  on merit. Company does not walk their talk. Culture is based on who you know etc.
good,Working for them was a fast pass but interesting. Pay was not bad but could have been better. The people there are great but losing that friendly work environment.
good,"Do lot of walking every day sun or rain , daily dealing with anger customers. Work alone remote areas good team of co-workers ...friends for life"
good,"Overall a great company to work at either as fulltime or contractor, there is a sense of great urgency at the strategic level however staff and employees do not appear to be convinced of the relevance of this project"
good,"Depending on the department that you are working in, it can be a good experience, but for me, the work environment is great but training sucks. No one wants to train you, let alone train you the right way. Everyone has his or her own way of doing things unbeknownst to anyone else. They do not work as a team, and everyone is territorial of his or her work. Limited information is given, and is only on a need to know basis. Their ideal of training you is ""let me show you this"" and then they walk away. There are no set standards for the department, and if someone leaves, it is unknown as to what the person was doing at that desk, or the status of his or her work. When asked “why do you do that’ the answer is “I just know.” When asked why we do this process or the purpose of this process “no one can answer the question.” When there is a problem, the individuals that have been here the longest will not say anything, leaving the person that has been here the shortest amount of time to take the fall. No one is held accountable for his or her actions, problems are not solved, a Band-Aid is just placed on it until the next time. Spectra is a good company, however this department lacks leadership, direction, communication, respect, and teamwork."
good,it was a very un happy and un social place to work  management is very distant and not friendly   staff was not happy and often there were issues amongst each other
good,"Most days are spent in meetings, on conference calls, or in a car driving to a meeting that should have been a conference call. Management does not encourage learning or growth, so many employees leave to escape career stagnation. Performance is not rewarded. Promotions are given very sparingly and politically. Coming into the office feels like punching an attendance card. It pays well, but not compared to competitors."
good,"Safety above all, getting things done too slow, too many inexperienced managers and controlling; very little team concept.  People likes to take credit of their own work."
good,"I was contacted re working the 6B line from Jan11 to Mar11. At the time I was working a project in North Salt Lake, UT. I left the NSL project and reported to Howell, MI."
good,"Enbridge is overall not a bad place to work. They pay decent. Management doesn't always make the best decisions in regards to staffing and work volumes. The work environment is fear based, due to many job losses in the recent years/months."
good,"The best part of working with this company is the people; professional, team-oriented, and willing to work towards common goals and objectives.  "
good,"I was Spectra employee and ever since Enbridge bought Spectra the layoffs have continued that demoralizes the employees."
good,"Working for Spectra was great; hired with little experience, I was mentored by a 25yr employee.  I gained a great base of knowledge from him and was able to use that to expand my skill set and eventually acquire a full time position with them."
good,Enbridge has a lot of good people working at it.  Unfortunately there are a lot of factors that make getting projects done quite difficult.  I do not think it is a bad place to work but it doesn't have the healthiest environment.
good,Enbridge was an ever changing landscape. There were continuous initiatives focused on improvement. The culture was very safety oriented in a fast paced environment.
good,"Since this is the company that acquired the one that hired me, I can not honestly speak to its merit. I do know that the merger was far from clean. Lot's of missteps."
good,A good company with a lot of very good people. Current environment is in a state of constant change. There has been an atmosphere of change over the last 3 years.
good,"I was brought in on an interesting project and had the opportunity to work with lots of excellent people, however, this seemed to be a culture where there were a higher than average number of opportunists who felt the demeaning colleagues in front of leadership or peers was the best way to advance.  This lead to micro management, poor work life balance and somewhat cut throat business practices within projects.  Quite unfortunate as the offices were nice and opportunities were exciting and there was a lot of talent in their work teams, but many, many very stressed out people."
good,Good workplace atmosphere. Great hours. Some situations could have been dealt with more professionally by management. Very poor communication between management and employees.
good,"Hopefully with the Enbridge transaction will come a change of the overall culture. Outward the company looks great, but many workers feel unmotivated, disengaged etc. I believe the is equally on the part of the company as well as the workers, and therein is the issue."
good,"Spectra Energy culture is resistant to change, requiring significant change managment and stakeholder engagment skills. Supply Chain organization is continuing to eveolve."
good,"- Very busy"
good,"Interesting job, always making changes on the fly. Home life suffered during employment due to call outs and alternating shift work"
good,"Management didn't seem to focus on employee development, or on realistic short/long term goals. The best part was building relationships with peers and clients."
good,Not much to say as a contractor. Just performed assigned tasks.
good,"The wage is good, but since they started hiring on a contract basis only there are no benefits. When the contract is up which is 3-4 months you are done there and they will advertise for hires again on contract basis.  A revolving door!"
good,"In terms of working in the materials procurement group; management is weak. They haven't done a good job forming any type of succession plan. There is a huge gap in employees, which offers some opportunity, but also a lot of frustration. Management tends to treat employees as hourly workers. Promotions are hard to come by. Work load is intense and no one seems to notice. Worst of all is that the company overall doesn't seem to shine a good light on supply chain. It's depressing and gloomy."
good,"they is a lot to learn from the company and very interesting company to work with but so stressful again because when it comes to salary its so confusing it doesn't matter how long you work or know the job as long the management and supervisors don't like you nothing will make a change , everyone management have their own people they like and favor and if you are not one of them forget it , you will work so hard for nothing and at the end of the day you are nothing , give their own people good shifts and good salary and if they don't favor you they will ignore you like you are invisible only when they need help from you to cover the shift yeah now you are friends and  overall I can say if the management was controlling the situation and NO favoritism the company will be ok .Its a stepping stone I can say ................"
good,"Multiple ownership changes in recent years, make it difficult to evaluate.  Spectra Energy, (previous owner), practiced a 'Hunger Games' Leadership style from the top.  Enbridge never assimilated these assets and immediately divested them.  All of which is a story of chaos."
good,I enjoyed my experience working with them but was told there would be plenty of work and when the project was near completion I was let go with no assurances of continued work.
good,"Decent job if you can put up with weak leadership. Pay is good, with good benefits. Work is not to strenuous with most days being fairly calm. Lack of clarity and not much room for advancement make this a little less appealing."
good,Working at Enbridge initially was a dream. The company cared for its employees and pushed them to be better. Now its the exact opposite. opportunities for advancement are also minimal and acknowledgment of good work is few and far between.
good,"I was a long term temporary contractor at Spectra Energy formally known as Duke Energy.  Only benefit that I received was paid vacation at my managers discretion.  I did not have health, dental or any other form of insurance.  I ended up leaving after my manager told me that there wasn't an option for me to get hired permanently and if I wanted I could find employment elsewhere.  So I did."
good,This is now a very unstable company since Enbridge purchased. Spectra Energy was once a great company but those days are long gone. I will leave when I can.
good,"Good salary, but large and complex organization to work in with lots of levels to navigate.  Lots of layoffs lately due to the economy, and job security is very low."
good,High visibility amongst executive leadership. Low advancement amongst immediate managers. Immediate managers wish you well but actions prove otherwise.
good,"There was a disconnect between senior management and lower levels, hopefully the latest restructure will correct this issue.  Had great manager at last position.  Would work there again."
good,"Good salary, travel is required at least 50/60% sometime more.  Long day minimum 10hr/day is required in field offices.  No work/life balance. Hardest part of the job is the travel to field offices during winter."
good,not much down time in betweem calls. most costumers are nice but some are very rude. too little pay for what you have to deal with.
good,Drive to office every morning for inspectors meeting. Went to job site made tie-ins and lowered in main line sections on pipeline.  Made sure all safety precautions were in place and followed at all times. Also oversaw back fill of pipe.
good,"wide variety of equipment to work on, good work schedule."
good,"The company has many good people.  Unfortunately, it seems middle management does not have a clear focus on true business needs.  Canada corporate has better benefits and job security than US side (many good jobs recently were taken away and moved up North) and some really good people left.  Seems like a lot of people pit-stop here on their way to other companies.  Atmosphere is very laid back but at times borders on very unprofessional and virtually no recognition for exceptional employees.  Management does not listen to employees concerns."
good,Typical day is checking email to see who requires work. Prioritize email on importance. Always get the Transmittal out if required by engineering. Make sure date and data is on transmittal properly. After sending out transmittal. create folders of transmittal and put into SharePoint. Update a register of all the data and also send out confirmation to other companies that we have received their transmittal and approved the data.
good,"Typical day at work: meetings, walk around the plant site, planning & Scheduling work, order materials, SAP data entering, create PM plans and task lists."
good,"As there have been so big changes at Enbridge, I feel it's time for me to have a change of pace and look for other employment. I enjoy working here and have great co-workers"
good,"You work for Enbridge you are working for the best.  They expect the best or nothing else.  They pay extremely well and expect you give 110% at all times.  "
good,Great safety culture with mature and knowledgable Mgmt. Lack of support made for plenty of overtime but hurt the life balance. Finished my scope of work as contracted and moved on.
good,"Whatever they offer you when they hire you get it in writing.  Work atmosphere fairly relaxed.  Allow workers quite a bit of independence, but upper management will tell you one thing and do another."
good,"This business division does not have the future within the company that it once did.  A very small but dedicated team supporting this division, and likely limited opportunities within that team at this time."
good,"Lots of time off."
good,"Spectra once upon a time was possibly one of the best companies in Canada to work for.  Things change, a New President, a few new vice presidents, they basically destroyed the company, the work culture, turned into a brawl, everyone fighting everyone then they fired hundreds possibly thousands of people...not the people at the heart of the problems but the people actually getting the work done...next up, company gets bought and they get the boot..."
good,"Lots of good, well-intentioned people at Enbridge, but many have no sense of direction or leadership.  Management needs to make some tough decisions and lead their teams better."
good,Still under Stabilization phase after the merger. Once stabilized it might be a good place to work long term. Good for work life balance and has a few great managers.
good,Coworkers were awesome and the job was not hard.  Just thought I had a full time position and this position was contract.  Would return if I could. Wish things were different.
good,Enbridge/Spectra is a good place to work. It is a very stressful job but all DOT Pipeline work is stressful at times. Good part is working with people from all over the USA .
good,Good work life balance. Poor upper management communication. Disconnected from the Manager level down. Canadian office very arrogant toward the Houston office. That may change with the Spectra merger. I hope so for them.
good,Culture is declining due to several restructures.  Unfortunate. Enterprise wide efficiency exercise has taken one 10th of the employees and more to come.  Not a place to start full time career.
good,"Company policies were excellent but not followed in area worked."
good,"I loved working at Enbridge and think it is a great company. Unfortunately as the company has grown, the need for significant structural changes became apparent. Ongoing reorganizations have resulted in many job losses and work consolidations. This will be  compounded by the upcoming merger acquisition with Spectra Energy and the ongoing energy industry downturn."
good,"It is split into 2 groups, the unionized employees and the non-unionized employees. this system doesn't work."
good,Enbridge is a fine company.  It is currently in a state of flux as market conditions have provided a goad to move toward reorganizing and reinventing themselves.
good,I have worked in the oil & gas industry for a number of years and find Enbridge a company who I would like to be an employee with.
good,Great place to work and learn the oil and gas industry. As I did not have any previous Pipeline experience. I would work their again.
good,"- work hardly to accomplish the tasks."
good,"A lot of good people from all over the U.S. working together to Build a better way of life."
good,"A typical day at work will be planning and scheduling mechanical integrity inspections. Meeting with vendors, looking for new tools, technology and software to make our job safest. Great group of co-workers, not highly motivated but willing to do their best. The hardest part of my job is to deal with a management culture that don't like changes, that cares about safety but doesn't learn from their mistakes. The most enjoyable part of my job is to motive my co-workers to do our best."
good,"Great pay"
good,"I loved the people they were great and collaborative.  Open communication and lots of laughs.  Too much idle time and forced to stay in your chair made it days long,."
good,"In 6 years working for them, I have not had a proper promotion (I started as a jr. assistant and am now an EA) with HR, just in workload. I have only received to raises in 6 years, one was 0.1% and the other was COLA, which everyone got. I have been denied more vacation time, I have been denied educational help, I'm basically stuck in a dead end job. "
good,Fine place to work. Nice people to work with. i don't want to write anything more about them because this is unnecessary for me finding a job. thank you and goodbye
good,"Has been a good place to work as I have learned lots about the industry.  Have a great supervisor so work-life balance has been great.  Unfortunately with all the resent restructuring there is very limited job growth potential within this organization.  When I first joined the culture was very pro-employee development and pro-employee retention.  This is no longer the case.  Employees are just numbers now.  "
good,Good company to work for overall. downsizing is one of its cons. Work environment is generally healthy however there are some workers who are not happy with recent company organizational changes.
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Worked there during deregulation in its early stage. Was a friendly place to work. Learned a lot about the HVAC industry. Fast paced and challenging workplace.
good,Good company. Has gone through a major boom in expansion which has slowed in recent years. Many good people but like many oil and gas companies is under pressure due to staff reductions and efforts to contain costs.
good,Job was fine. Culture was fine. Learning was fine. Typical days were fine. events were fine. Leadership was fine. Management was fine. It was a fine job.
good,"a lot of cost cutting measures, poor communication, leaders pretend to listen but no action taken, good people, flexible work schedule, no advancement opportunity"
good,Great people but low employee engagement. Transformation is causing a lot churning. Great people are leaving due to lack of growth opportunities. Still pay well.
good,Great company while I worked there. Eventually acquired by Enbridge so I'm not sure of the state of affairs today. I generally liked everyone I worked with and it was a good company culture.
good,Good company with good benefits. Very fast paced work week. Always a learning environment.  Great people to work with. Was a great place in the height of the oil boom.
good,"Large company mentality, employees are just a number. Good pay, not bad benefits. opportunity to advance. good safety culture and very enivironmental."
good,Union Gas is a good company with a number of areas of growth for the average engineer.  The structure of the company allows alot of opportunity for travel within Ontario which could prove very desirable for a young engineer.
good,"Good, extensive training with great pay and incentive and motivation to learn. Ability to advance within the company."
good,Strong system and processes to facilitate people to do their jobs. some politics in upper management.  experience resources across the organization and lots of growth potential
good,So many changes to management over the past few years has left a culture of uncertainty and constant change.  Frequent reorganizations make it difficult to have consistency in direction of day-to-day tasks.
good,"With the ongoing changes in the work environment there is no longer any job security for certain departments. Prior to the changes for globalization it was an exemplary place to work at. Good work/life balance, good salary with great benefits. Management was typical for a large Enterprise environment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Enbridge and they taught me a lot and for that I will always be greatful they great benefits but if you want to move up in the company not that easy it's based on who you know not what you know
good,"As business, Enbridge is ok, but people are no longer the driving force in the company. Decisions are made strictly on a monetary basis without regard for the repercussions of said actions. All executive decisions are made in Canada (parent company), and there is a real disconnect with their U.S. counterparts. Also, in the name of confidentiality, significant money has been wasted. Advancement opportunities are all but non-existent below the manager level. Maybe after everything settles it will be fine. Average company, average compensation."
good,"Company is going thru a lot of reorganization"
good,typical work day is 8 to 5; culture is pretty laid back; I like the people I work with; small company with some room to move around to different positions
good,I signed a opinion clause not allowing to express my opinion Unable to express positive/negative opinion about Enbridge.
good,Balance between work and family life was good. Company was great first 8 years I was employed then in my opinion a lot of mistake where made and that's when then company hit it's down turn
good,"Enbridge used to be a better company several years ago. From my point of view, the senior management/executives have promoted people with lack of knowledge and poor personality skills. It is a tendency to promote people from project control personnel who usually don't have enough understanding of design and construction. "
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Organization is good.  Like most large organizations, there are good areas that are well managed and other areas are more challenging."
good,they don't do what they preach...like the saying goes ...the rich get richer...us poor people get stepped on....they r a bunch of liars...
good,Worked within a contractal bases offering support during office moves. Helping out the IT department with disconnect's and reconnect's of various workstations.
good,"Nice environment to work in; at this time, there is limited project work due to projects on hold or completely cancelled."
good,"Good company to work with. Performed a variety of duties. Introduced to SharePoint 2007 and assisted with permission, document, taxonomy activities."
good,Enbridge provide very good benefits. Middle management could use better communication with their direct reports. Co-workers were very capable in their particular jobs.
good,"- One of the biggest oil distribution network"
good,"Uneducated leaders could distroy the will to go to work."
good,A lot of smart people but not a lot of communication.  A lot of new people.  Management is very busy and chaos results.  And there is a dress code!  Men must wear ties.
good,"A great learning experience.  As with any large company, there is some difficulty maintaining a consistent corporate culture with so many individual personalities."
good,"Good benefits and working environment ."
good,its a very good plave to work people there are friendly they also help you in whatever way they can.
good,I was given a great deal of independence and responsibility with this internship. I do however feel I could have been better utilized the majority of my time working there. I received the bulk of my experience the final month of so I was there and wish I would have been able to work with a senior member more at times to aid in the learning process.
good,Challenging workplace.  Management is there when we need support but not to the point of micro managing.  Great team members makes for a positive workplace.  Good time management is a must.
good,Work load was reasonable.
good,Did not work at the acquiring company Enbridge long enough to give a meaningful review.  I worked for the predecessor company Spectra Energy for 18 years.
good,"I was disappointed when I was laid off with the rest of the safety personnel."
good,"Good work life balance with alternative work arrangements, earned days off and ample vacation time and sick pay. Unfortunately, the morale has recently declined in the company due to all the cut backs and layoffs."
good,"With over eight years of experience in the pipeline inspection industry I have had many roles which include inspection over welding, environment, installation, repair, excavation, coating removal/installation, coordination, grading, surveying, sweeping, etc and the list goes on and on.  The one thing that ties these related fields together is the one thing that I believe is the most important aspect to them all, Safety.  From the minute, I'm in the vehicle driving to work to the last second on the job safety is always my number one focus.  "
good,"Decisions being made in upper-management reflect sound business decisions."
good,"Paid extremely well but don't expect a 40 hour work week. The culture at the field locations is focused on teams, continuous improvement and collaboratively getting the work done."
good,"When working for Enbridge, you are surrounded by fun, polite, hardworking individuals who are very intelligent. It is a safe work environment that is very productive and welcoming. However, due to oil controversies and prices, along with restructure within the company, there have been a lot of lay-offs making job security a concern to many of its employees."
good,"Interesting Job assignment but lack clear communication of procedures to job duties."
good,"I enjoyed working at Enbridge because you never knew what was in store for the day.  I enjoyed not being stuck behind a desk and was able to be out and about in the field."
good,Senior management had elements of partiality. The senior manager was more understanding. Great comradery amongst team members. Working conditions was excellent.
good,I work at a station by my self to keep units running and water hauled and well as to sale condensate. I cover call for 4 locations every 6 weeks. It's a good job just needing a change
good,"The company is with long history and being the monopoly it does not have competition. It has a relaxed atmosphere with which the employees can enjoy work/life balance. However, management seemed weak and need improvement."
good,"Good place to work, but like everywhere management has its downfalls. People who know people get picked over ones with the experience and knowledge to be a good employee."
good,decent company to work for wages are fair work good people to work with constant payroll issues were very inconvient and bothersome aside from that overall good experence i would welcome the oppertunity to work for this company again
good,"At a time of significant change at Enbridge, ECS was a short lived attempt at saving the company money.  I forget how long it lasted, but we were soon back to being part of the parent company."
good,I worked with some outstanding people that worked well together and had a sense of purpose.  Rapidly changing work requirements never allowed to get bored.
good,"The company is undergoing a major cultural shift, leading to much unrest and uncertainty.  It is still a good company to work for but the uncertainty will remain during the transitions upcoming."
good,"Good atmosphere and culture but has gotten worse lately due to viewing contractors as temporary workers.  Cooperation and communication has gotten worse due to morale issues with layoffs, merger."
good,"Direct supervisors and coworkers are great to work with, pay and benefits are great, too. You will spend most of your time on the road and will be expected to work weekends and holidays regularly."
good,"Management needs to work together more, Bonuses and Pay are amazing for day's worked."
good,"Very good company with great benefits. Being in charge of a whole area is challenging but interesting, it takes a lot of organization and self motivation to keep 8 plants in alignment and in compliance. Everyone in the company is a hard worker and this can facilitate your job in the long run."
good,"Spectra Energy is great company to work for if you would like to grow and stick with a company for years. It has plenty of opportunities for growth. Overall, this company is fantastic!"
good,Enbridge is still in the midst of the Enbridge/Spectra merger; many are still getting used to the changes. Management is putting an effort toward improving the workplace culture.
good,Reporting to someone in another country is awful. Work is slow in some departments and crazy in others.  Hard to advance with all the changes due to the merger and reorganization.
good,Enbridge is a great company. Management is still trying to finalize the shape of company after merger with Spectra. Compensation package is not very competitive
good,Enbridge acquired Spectra Energy. The culture is changing and is a little stressful right now. As things settle down maybe the company will be a great place to work for. It is to soon to tell.
good,Spectra has changed from a BC based pipeline and process company to a Houston based multinational company. That change brings all the plusses and minuses that you would expect
good,Great place to work for work life balance.
good,"Great co-workers,lot of things to learn."
good,"•	Received escalations from fellow employee, analyzed the account and then forwarded the e-mail to the appropriate department."
good,Work a project until it's complete then on to the next one.  Love working with new people in different parts of the US experiencing their cultures and learning new things all the time!
good,"It is not what you know but who you know, but this is the story everywhere.  I thought the pay was good and the work was not difficult, however the company could do better by being more organized from and evaluate employees."
good,"Midcoast energy, was an educational experience that made a great impact in how I talked to my coworkers. It also gave me insight on how much I can do with some much time."
good,"The company has been in transition for some time lately.  Particularly the common shared services.  These have been a challenge in keeping people motivated with large changes in the last 4 years, continual outsourcing and layoff."
good,"As a telecommuting contract editor, it is really not possible for me to provide a perceptive evaluation of this company. However, I can say that they did not live up to their commitment to me in terms of number of hours."
good,at the time of work we learn more to improve our carrier in batter way. the management was fully cooperates to the fishers more over it is the best platform to grow in our carrier.
good,"Fulfilling place to work. The typical work week consists of at least 60 hours for the project management personnel. Due to the nature of the projects being supported, the work often extends to personnel time."
good,a typical day at work is work 100% of the time other than breaks and lunch normally worked through my lunch. not much time for anything else other than work.
good,"Galleria location is ideal, depending on demographics of your manager you can take advantage of the work life balance the company offers.  Office space is old depending on what floor your on.  Cafeteria food is good.  A lot of the  management team and supervisors have been there for over 30 years.  Very limited in leadership diversity.  Departments function like indenpendent mom-pop shops.  Very clique-ish.  Better working relationship with the contractors and newer employees."
good,"Enbridge has and continues to be good to me. I am currently employed through STS Consulting as an Inspector. I am contracted to work for Enbridge Energy as a Lead Pipeline Utility Inspector. I oversee new construction from beginning to end as well as Integrity Operations and repair. They do a great job to keep the good inspectors working year round even though that might mean traveling across Texas, in which I have done several times. They are currently little to nothing as far as new construction goes in East Texas, but have employed me to make repairs on anomalies on pipelines in service. Most lines being repaired are H2S and Liquid Lines in and around Plants."
good,"Had a wonderful time, wish it would not of ended, but glad it did for the enviorment."
good,"In the largest catastrophe in the history of the community in which I was raised, I helped to oversee all of the finances that were allocated throughout the first year of the major response to restore the city of Battle Creek after 1 million tons of oil flooded the Kalamazoo River. Not only was I honored to help rebuild my community-physically and mentally, but I also gained tremendous confidence in my abilities during an extreme crisis response where compensation for damages reported over $550 Million."
good,"- Every person may have a different experience. I had good times and bad times."
good,"Positive, management was interactive, co workers were friendly. I worked there until mid 2016 when the price of oil began to collapse. The price collapse led to many people either getting laid off or finding work elsewhere."
good,"Enbridge is a well run company and have a great support team. The sub contractor also was well run, and the workers were highly skilled. Positive attitudes, combined with great skills made this an enjoyable company to work for."
good,"The average day at work for a member of the IS department at Union Gas is largely a matter of responding to emails. Attempts to update systems to more modern equivalents have resulted in applications that are less stable, more error prone, and more likely to have the work being done within excel spreadsheets than the actual applications. Company culture is largely a process of ""failing up"" and management reflected this fact. The largest saving grace of the job is the co-workers you will interact with, as the vast majority have a small-town charm to them."
good,"It's hard for a single parent to balance out the shifts, but overall a great place to work!"
good,Lots of meetings with no decisions being made. Good company but you can't speak up. Talk about budget but nothing changes.
good,"Good work place, good team. flexible hours. work from home option. good benefits. good manager scope of work properly defined. expectations are managed well."
good,Spectra Energy was a nice company to work for. They had a focus to become a top pipline company.  Since they were purchased by Enbridge the whole feel of the company has changed.
good,I worked as Consultant and appreciate their processes. The working conditions were favorable for employees. However due to low oil prices they let go many people.
good,I enjoyed my time at Enbridge for almost 10 years.  There were a lot of layoffs in the last few years but that comes with oil and gas industry. Everyone there was very nice.
good,"We operate across North America, fueling the economy and people’s quality of life. We move nearly two-thirds of Canada’s crude oil exports to the U.S."
good,"Currently engaged with enterprise-wide transformation initiatives, so be patient as business and functional units undergo their respective changes. Good benefits and great place to start your career"
good,Enbridge Energy provide opportunity to learn more of the clerical role of Human Resources. It also provided the opportunity to learn in the area of Human Resources data entry.
good,Worked during the time that Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business - including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas - to form Spectra Energy.
good,"Large Company"
good,Enbridge and their land team that I worked for were great. It was a great learning experience for me to work as a contractor to such a big client. If I were given the opportunity I would very much enjoy working on another Enbridge project.
good,"Although Spectra was at one time, a thriving, fast paced and challenging environment; the change of management may be contributing to the lackluster environment that now remains."
good,"Overall, a good company with many good people trying to do the right things and ensure they execute their work effectively being as environmentally friendly and safe as possible."
good,Great place to work but management was not professional at all especially the accounting department.  I was a contractor working an 1199.  The paperwork was thorough and good.  Everything was done in accordance with policy and procedures.  I worked for a shop called turbofab (solarpanals out of San Diego in which this one was loved in Channelview TX.  They also had horrible management.  And when they laid me off due to budget cuts they did not give me any warning (Spectra Energy)
good,"great group of people to work with who are supportive. compensation for employees is competitive. good development opportunities for engineers in the organization, developed some strong friendships with people I have worked with over the years."
good,"Very focused on safety, respect, and integrity. However, efficiency can be enhanced, and pace of work can be picked up a bit."
good,Great company to work for. They are still strong despite the countries economic situation. Work/Life balance is good. Always work to do. Downside of being a contractor there is very little to no growth opportunities.
good,Good people. Very focused on doing the right thing. Motivated to provide safe and reliable energy services to communities. I really like the people and culture here.
good,"Great company to work with. Although I only worked as a co-op student through my college and with out pay, it was an excellent opportunity."
good,"I spent 3 and a half years with Enbridge. I enjoyed my time there, my colleagues were very welcoming and friendly. Enbridge is very much a company that is closely linked to the economy as all companies in the energy sector. When the economy hit its worst point in fall 2015, I was one of 500 employees laid off."
good,A great company to work for in the oil and gas industry.  The SCM group is growing and learning new ways to be more efficient to the projects on the pipelines.
good,I would maintain the 42 inch Vector natural gas pipeline from the Illnois to Michigan state lines. This included the Springville Compressor station and it's two Solar 15 thousand hp industrial turbine engines and all instrumentation and Allen Bradley PLC's.
good,"Good Company, Great people. Challenging tasks everyday, but very manually work. Company invests in its people and not much in its systems which creates more work that is needed sometimes."
good,Great place to work. Days were long but rewarding. Tight community need to be able to manage change as nothing stays the same very long.
good,This company gave me a lot of opportunity I would not have gotten in any other setting due to the larger work environment
good,One will learn a lot.  Management lives out its core values.  One of my best employers ever.
good,"The company holds strong to maintain a positive standing with the catastrophes that damage the world and local markets.  The cost of benefits in the company are very low in comparison to other businesses, as well as the low deductibles and out of pocket costs.  Safety is also a primary focus of the company.  Promotions and hiring of underqualified supervisors/superintendents is repetitive withing all departments of the business.  Unequal treatment of employees based on personal differences is allowed.  Employees must keep record of every communication to avoid the twisting of the facts that can take place with management and HR employees."
good,It was a great work environment with amazing work and life balance.
good,"	Assisted with filing of the 8-K on a quarterly basis. Including: gathering and processing of financial data from various business segments. Consolidation of the data, edit the presentation format, footing and send it to the printer."
good,"Enbridge has an incredible benefits program (pension plan, medical/dental, stock options, education reimbursement, flex days, vacation days)."
good,All the projects that I went on were productive and fun at the same time.  All the people I worked with respected each other and everyone got along great.  This was my learning point for construction projects.
good,"Good people, benefits and great immediate management. Encourage leadership through influence."
good,Good company but not so good on safety. Excellent benifits but lots of traveling.
good,The job is to ensure the rules and regulation governing pipeline are followed and understood. Also ensure the restoration of streams and slopes are done correctly.
good,"Good company to work for. Very high stress and long hours, but worth the pay and benefits. Would recommend to anyone. Not a lazy persons job. They take care of you."
good,Typical work day is an 8-5 with a busy schedule of meetings and tasks to get done to run the company. Management is working to align all areas. Hardest part is having multiple offices and head offices which can create many emails and phone calls. I enjoy the people I work with and liaison with different departments. I continue to learn everyday about something new or how the business is changing.
good,"Union Gas is very understanding of a work/life balance... In addition, employees are compensated well for any overtime hours required. Union Gas is is also known for strong safety, which is another factor making the company a preferred organization to work for."
good,"With constant changing leadership, it's difficult to adjust to departmental leaders.  Expectations and even responsibilities are constantly changing.  The poeple and contractors are great to work with.  I received great training and certificates while working here.  A strong safety culture exists here as well.  There was a fair bit of driving however."
good,"Great work environment. But no stability. Lots of Lay offs. "
good,"it was excellent work experience, I have the chance to interact with PHMSA & US operation & learn about US  operation culture."
good,"good place to work"
good,Enjoyed many years at Enbridge and have only good things to say about the company. Every business has its challenges and Enbridge is no exception. I would return if the restructuring and right fit was available.
good,For Enbridge safety come first and pays so much attention to avoid accidents. It's multi cultural and people are helpful. I didn't see much of a friendly environment and it is a flexible work environment
good,"Enbridge was a positive place to work, and they invested in common sense quality processes. Was involved in some very cutting edge vendor qualification processes, that are still ahead of many oil and gas owners today."
good,"Very challenging conditions for this project doing underground concrete supports and foundations in very cold conditions, difficult to keep morale and the crew focused but we did complete wit no recordable incidents."
good,"Professional, hard working, legally aligned, good management and co-workers, flexibility of working hours keeping in mind the core hours  with approval of your People Leader, online and hands-on self learning"
good,"No detail review at this time. Will rate company at a later time.  Overall, I'm happy with my experience with Spectra. In process of merging with Enbridge. Not sure what the new culture will be."
good,Overall the people are pretty good to work with. Good opportunity to see different parts of the country. Enbridge continues to grow and is improving every season.
good,"Loved working for this company. Learned additional skills. Liked the staff and job role.  They hire top notch employees.  Need to find ways to reward all levels of employees, not just young staff and management."
good,"very rewarding, good opportunities to move into corporate positions. Great benefits, opportunity for advancement, high responsibility.  Enjoyed the travel."
good,"Conservative company but well respected."

Long shifts in a fast paced environment and harsh working conditions."
good,"Lots of good work as a student, really fun, and many opportunities to learn about the industry"
good,"ENBRIDGE is a great place to work. A lot could be done to minimize internal completion between staff members. Also, attention is probably needed in the area of mentoring for new people"
good,Good place to work. Education benefits and job advancement available. Enficence on honesty and reliability. Must be able to work alone or with a group smoothly.
good,"Was in a contract due to short term light duty work. "
good,"Working collections call list and setting client payment guidelines."
good,"Utility in Toronto that distributes natural gas to 2.1 million customers. "
good,"The job was fine. It was an internship during a summer while I was in college. The people were very nice but the work was fairly solo. There was not much collaboration, unless I was helping the other interns with filing and other administrative tasks."
good,Management listened to concerns/ideas. Had one paid day off every month and work from home wasn't a policy but management was opened to it. People work collaboratively.
good,"Good all around company, geared towards family. Great paying company along with a good environment to grow career wise, and skill wise. No complaints towards them."
good,Overall good company to work for.  Great work/life balance program.  Lots of opportunities  to further education through courts offered in house.  Biggest challenge is the fact that it is a large company and things don't move quickly at times.
good,"No jean Fridays"
good,Expectations were high of middle management. There were a continuous number of initiatives happening. Change was expected but not always accomplished.
good,"Very good at following regulations. Very busy and  very rewarding employment, Very good company on safety policies. Great work environment if you enjoy being very busy & moving around lots"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  My manager was incredible, a great leader and very understanding about my need to have a flexible schedule.  I would gladly work for this company again."
good,A good place to work but must navigate constant change. The company has gone through a corporate restructure and large acquisition which has left a lot of people displaced.
good,"A place to learn more, people's respect is of importance from top management below. Opinions are for the most part given a chance. Job security is not base on performance though."
good,"Good benefits and vacation. Pay is below industry standard, but they make up for it with paid vacation and holidays.Work life balance is average but room for advancement is minimum."
good,Great place to work. Loved buying high field fittings and pipe. A little stressful at times when manufactures don't meet on time delivery but a good place to work. I was on contract so I had no benefits. When the project I was on contract for ended my job ended.
good,A good company to work for before the merger. Listen to employees voice and take actions to improve all. Concerned about employee's problems and tried to help.
good,"Get plant readings, walk through plant, monitor gas pressure inlet & outlet.  Learned multi tasking, management wishy washy."
good,"Culture is made by people, and some departments' culture is better than others. I was privileged to work with peers and leaders who were leaders in industry and technically savvy, yet humble, caring and fun."
good,"Enbridge is a great company! Majority of my co-workers were very friendly and inviting. However, due to on-going company re-structuring, Job Security and Advancement have become nonexistent."
good,Nice place to work. Job is not secure these days because of oil crisis world wide otherwise very good salary and culture.
good,"Great place to work, friendly and polite co-workers, opportunity of advancement, strict management yet there is a stable balanced work environment. Interact with different clients on a daily basic who put you technical and interpersonal skills to the test."

good,"I enjoyed working there, although there was no room for advancement, you felt comfortable within your position. the management was great and always ready to help."

good,"Have roles and responsibilities explained in great deal with contractor. "
good,The overall experience is very positive and supportive.  Upper management does not micro-manage the field supervisors and is very supportive of the process which creates an positive environment in the field.
good,"I work in the field for Enbridge as a contractor. The people working in the corporate offices in Duluth and Superior, for the most part, are great. Work life balance is an issue as I am gone 95% of the project duration, but that is why they pay well."

good,"We start the day @ 6A at the work trailer, then we have the morning meeting, then we go to the job site where we work from 10-14 hours a day."
good,Unionized work environment my be difficult to adjust to. Things do not  move fast due to this. Fair salary and benefits. Lots of good people in the organization.
good,"Union Gas was a great start to my public affairs and communications career, with many experiences. The workplace culture was up beat, and optimistic. My position entailed many different areas of Public Affairs and Communications."
good,the working environment at Enbridge is great and family like. its good for a work life balance due to the flexible schedules. and safety is always first
