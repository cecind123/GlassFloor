rating,review
bad,"Don't become a truck driver. The industry is awful and Werner is a prime example. You are better off getting a job a Costco or even Walmart. Unfortunately most people have to start at the big carriers like Werner. It's a sweatshop on wheels.  It's basically slavery. Werner doesn't care about you, none of the big carriers do. In fact no one does. You'll be treated like garbage by Werner and all of thier customers. This is a great job if you hate yourself."
bad,"Scam promise you the world pay you 20 cents a mile . Treat new hires poorly  turn over rate is crazy. Need to win are class action suit to recover some of the money they stole from me and time .Truck broke down all the time took hotel bills out of my check, put me in a truck to train with a crazy person who should be in jail"
bad,Werner employees were very pleasant folks but the paychecks were not.  Company driving is no longer feasible nor profitable for the people who risk life/limb daily on the road.
bad,"The dispachers are horrible people, they don't care about their drivers I guess it's ok if you're fresh out of school, just for training but I wouldn't recommend it for long term employment they're slave drivers."
bad,"If you want to break your back and get paid LOW  wages this is the job for you..."
bad,The thing about this company they donot back up their driver's in situation in some altercations with people that have disrespect us at and work place or doc.
bad,"They are trying to hire women drivers but they are not ready for us. You can feel the discrimination everywhere you go in this company. Is good just to start your career and then keep moving. They promise you new equipment, is a lie, I am still driving 2016 Volvo with 400,000+ miles , the worst truck ever, but the majority of the driver get better truck before 400k miles. So why no me. Maybe because I’m a woman, or because I’m black or because I’m latino or my accent, who knows.latinEverybody lie about everything. I’m in my way out."
bad,Will cut you throat when you leave good luck trying to get someone to talk to you about getting a negative mark off your record that they should of never  put on never again  never recommend
bad,"Cheap company. They don't pay their employees well, treat you like poorly and management is dishonest!! Shop manager was stealing parts and letting mechanics take the blame."
bad,"I didn't have a good experience with Werner because I was just trying to get a day off to see my step-daughter, but Werner didn't want to give the time off for my step daughter's school graduation, so werner dropped me from employment."
bad,"The new safety manager routinely forged DOT physicals, violated ethical standards and even more...I was the whistleblower in this case and was belittled, nagged, and picked at until I couldn't take anymore. STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKED EVIL IDIOTS"
bad,Don’t work for Werner enterprises all they car about is their loads not the driver. You’re just another number in that company and they’ll treat you and make sure you know you’re disposable
bad,"This job was horrible, the people were horrible. The dispatchers were liars and sought to punish you if you wanted sometime. I would rather be starving and homeless than work for this company again."
bad,They are unorganized f m doesn't know what they are doing it really sucks there i will never work here again never they be put people on sleep machine that doesn't have 2 be on one
bad,This is a scam company. They have no feelings for their employees. Blame people for things not their fault.. Don't give new drivers lick of a chance..
bad,"This job does not give you any opportunity to advance."
bad,Would not recommend to anyone. There is no career advancement there and you don’t learn anything about engine work. Everything has to go to the dealer when it come to engine work
bad,"Recruiter hires you for one thing, But Warner gives you what they need you to work. And if you question it they hang up on you.. I won't recommend them to my worst enemy"
bad,"My overall experience was terrible. They treat their drivers like another number. The only thing they care about is their loads. Dispatch in Omaha is disrespectful, rude and truly not understanding."
bad,"Werner is a pathetic joke of a company that treats their drivers like dirt. If you are a driver for Werner you don't matter to them. They don't pay detention and their layover pay is a joke. Werner staff is unprofessional and different departments can't coordinate at all. No wonder Werner has one of the highest turnover rates and one of the worst CSA scores. Do not waste your time applying here, they are one of the absolute worst companies I have ever seen.Werner lies non-stop and will tell you what you want to hear to shut you up."
bad,They are supposed to do a full background check on you before hiring you on they wait two weeks after hiring you and then they send you home if they find something.
bad,Worked their two seperate times both times more then 5 years allways got promised better pay never happened management sucks wouldent recommend anybody to work here big turn over people come and go due to management and pay promised new shop never happened so if u like to be lied to apply here worst placer to work art
bad,if you are starting out as a truck driver this is a place to start at. i left because they were missing with my home time. so i would advise you to think about when you want that time to start and finished
bad,"In 7 months of total scam with this company and 5 of those months with 4 different trainers and so called training so the trainers could sleep and earn off of your hard work and zero backing or other important training techniques. I was Also injured on the job and the work and comp at this self insured company is shady to say the least. Total gross pay 18K. Run past this company and document EVERYTHING"
bad,"Like all trucking companies, they only care about equipment and freight. Drivers are equal to guard dogs, we guard freight and equipment for days while stuck at a truck stop for free. Worked for them for almost one year......that is one year of my lifetime wasted. I say get in for one year then get out quickly, make sure you have extra cash to help you out that year because you will not earn much."
bad,"You have good and bad review but please believe that bad more then the good... doing my training there people was leaving once they became a certified driver, me I stayed to get the experience before going local. The dispatcher that they hired be so young manly in their early or mid 20's very disrespectful with a slick mouth.."
bad,"lied to from the start promised a return to home every two weeks only got home after leaving there employ two months later."
bad,Not a good place to work treat workers unfairly management is terrible the pay sucks just nothing positive about the company just not a good overall work experience
bad,Werner craps on new employees. They give you the shortest amount of miles. They don't keep you in the route you signed up for. Not a good company for new drivers. Some of their trainers are just along for the ride and not teaching like they are supposed to be doing.  Would not recommend this place for new drivers!!!
bad,"During the interview process the coordinator sell you a false dream. They tell you there is growth opportunities, their benefits are great, culture amazing....etc. THESE ARE LIES. The training is horrible. The “manager” half train you and have an attitude when you ask questions. The manager complains about everything bringing down the  morale. Upper management feeds you lies. Everyone is telling different stuff. On top of that one of the staff has thrown out racial slurs. Currently in the process of contacting EEOC. There are no opportunities to move up at all. The pay is awful but want you to overload you with work like they are paying you well. The benefits are so bad that my dentist don’t even accept the insurance. You will literally working out of a closet. The “logistics support coordinator” title is false advertisement because the position has nothing to do with logistic. It is a below entry level and the position should be title  data entry"
bad,Worst place or company to work for ( modern day slavery) they would lie to other company so you don't or can't leave them. The start up pay suck . I f you get into an accident doesn't how big they will get u.
bad,"This company will make sure you can never get a job anywhere else. They put a false report on my DAC report. I had a small accident, and NO damage occurred. I sent in the pictures of not a single scratch!!! And what happens??? They claim there was $1500 of damage...."
bad,"there do not do what then say .  me trainer did not working with to help me get the jod done. my traber was annoying and diid like to cus "
bad,"Mother was in hospital I was 1,500 miles away from home I had an emergency had to go home because mom was in hospital and they tried everything they could to not get me there I had to cuss up a storm with driver relations so that he could FORCE my fleet manager and supervisor to book me a rental to drive home m. They also did not pay me the previous week so I was hurting on money which they knew I even told them otherwise I would’ve bought a plane ticket myself cause apparently Werner barely has loads so they can’t afford to buy a plane ticket for an employee family emergency so I was forced to take an advance of $200 for gas that they haven’t reimbursed and they still haven’t paid me for that week and when I finally get home I check to see if I got the new pay and guess what they withheld that too cause they got upset that I went to HR and they still haven’t inquired to see how I’m doing or how my mother is doing. So happy to be leaving them, a much better  company that gave me a local position home everyday and company  is worth more money so they have way better benefits and pay hired me the instance I applied thank you to my new employer for hiring me as far as Werner is concerned I’d rather work for a gas station as a toilet cleaner then go back to them..Now Pay department  says they can’t do nothing about my missing pay????like WTF your  group is literally called PAY DEPARTMENT that’s how horrible they are"
bad,this is a training company for new CDL drivers with no prior experience. they don't care about you as a driver just how fast you get there loads transported. Expected to work extremely hard but left without loads for days while not getting compensated for the down time.
bad,"Stay away, drivers. You can be held up at a dock for 10 hours and get $0 for your whole day being wasted. Luck of the draw on good equipment, I went through multiple junkers before eventually getting a decent truck. Poor management/dispatchers."
bad,"Werner is one of the few companies that do not supply power inverters in the trucks and will terminate drivers or confiscate them. Safety doesn't work out situations with the drivers; they simply play the ""blame game"" and without any consideration for needs of a driver, enforce the directives often unfair and imposing."
bad,"I could go on and on about how awful this company is. I would say the one of the worst things is their “trainers” some of these guys only had a cdl 6 months. Some have experience but don’t teach you anything and others don’t shower and like to complain about everything and yell and scream at people. Second thing is the pay. I made more on trianing than as a solo driver. Ecspially beware of the dollar general account. They will rip you off. This is after I sat in a hotel 2 weeks with nothing to do, can’t go home then have to drive a rental car to a terminal 14 hours away with 1 hour notice. As much as I hate to say it. I think I’d drive for swift before these morons again."
bad,"I want to make this very clear. Werner Enterprise is a terrible company that is poorly managed and should have been shut down years ago. I would talk about the pay, but there is nothing really worth talking about. If you like working hard for basically nothing and being treated like a dog I will continue the review for you. When I was there the pay was all over the place so it is impossible to tell you how much money you will make. perhaps $300-600 per week working 7 days. "
bad,Management is horrible. How they treat emoyees is horrible. Notholding drivers more accoutable is horrible. They pay scale and raises are horribble.Lack of female employees
bad,Dispatch was disrespectful in ways that would compromise job duties health and safety regulations according to FMCSA laws. Pick-ups and deliveries were always being set back. I sat in states for over 24 hrs a day across the country waiting to be planned correctly. Never had more then 185 miles per day across the country. Would be out for 3 to 4 weeks at a time 70 hrs a week.
bad,This company wants you to drive no matter what. Below zero temps outside no cab heater in the truck it's ok spend the night in the truck in Maine in the middle of winter.
bad,"I worked there, had a good manager on the account, then switched too Dollar general Out of Ardmore,ok and had a great manager up until he quit and then the route planner became manager and started favoring dollar General over the drivers  and treating the drivers like Poorly, on top of that I was getting 37% taken out on taxes and them editing how much I made in the year  so I did not get that extra they were taken back at all..."
bad,"A typical day at work would be getting loaded and driving across the country."
bad,Stay away. Far far away. Allentown terminal is heck on earth. Trainers are horrible. My trainer abandoned me 400 miles from home because he went on a crack smoking binge. They lock you down for days in the terminal and won't let you leave with no explanation. Scary chit when your 2500 miles from home.
bad,"This place is shady.  They will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat to appease their drivers.  Management is inconsistent and they offer no chance for advancement."
bad,Worst managed company on planet earth. Trucks constantly breaking down. Had to get advances on my own salary to pay for hotels and things that most companys  provide company debit cards for. had to argue to get paid my due salary
bad,"It just was not for me. I was told i would be home every weekend and I wasn't, If I asked about it, i got the run around. i was only supposed to work in the midwest and was sent all over the the north 48 without being asked if I was ok with that,I was on the road 3 months before being routed home. once home I left the truck at the terminal and left the company."
bad,"at the time a was there to charge you money for everything and they dont  give you work to make the money , if you pay a lumper to unload the trailer  they will charge you for  asking to comcheck  you ask money to pay the toll you get charge  fee"
bad,"I was a fleet coordinator, and the job was easy and fun but the leadership is just horrible. HR department doesn't know how to do their job right, and management is extremely toxic."
bad,"Minimum wage, minimum respect, management is horrible, dispatchers suck, no raises, “ Werner Doesn’t Care”, waisted 3 years at this company.. don’t do the same.."
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company they screwed me out of my home time on many occasions and really are not caring about there drivers at all. I had a family emergency and it took them three days to get me on the road home and sent me under a load so it took even longer to get home
bad,"Terminals are a mess, dispatch was inconsistent at best, long wait times between loads, poor equipment. Everything is a hard sell from management or an outright lie."
bad,"I was hired right out of truck driving school, rode with an experienced driver for 2 weeks.  Then I was on my own.  I never knew where I was going next, or for how long.  Communication with dispatch was poor at best."
bad,"I got paid nothing i was away from my family all the time. This was stupid, they were suppose to be paying be back for school They taxed the money they paid me back."
bad,"No option to make more money, fleet manager is not nice all, talks to drivers anyway he wants to. shag pay is $20, no room for advancement. Only work or them i no other options are available"
bad,drove team set at truck stops or terminals .14 cpm and got no miles never got home and averaged 200 a week pay so had to get away from that job. I was going broke on that job
bad,This job was not for me they told me that they only expected there drivers to be out for 15 days at a time I would  stay out for 15+ days and then put in for some off days 15 days before that date and was never able to get home ontime
bad,I was working 14 hr days.  My avg pay was 350.00 a week with no benefits.  It got hurt on job and had to spend an hr in er.  all werner gave us was workmans comp and it paid 200 on er bill.  i was stuck with 1500.00.
bad,Its a training company you go to get experience for your next job. Its not a lot longevity there people go there to get experience then they move on Great training company.
bad,When you are making them money your gold but then you have an accident they put you on the back burner and god for bid you get caught out of your state you pay for your own way home after they leave you in the middle of no ware  I had to find my own way home I lucked out my brother came to save me I still had to spent my hollidays away from my family but like I said if you keep them in money your good as gold but when it came time to put money in your pocket you really had to fight for your miles
bad,"This is my first job as a CDL driver and was very disappointed. This company is ALL about themselves. They say that Werner Cares, NO THEY DON'T. I see its a way of new drivers to get a start but look for other companies before you settle with this one."
bad,"Just a number, drove a tractor trailer for 11 hrs a day stopping to get fuel take breaks and showers. Drop loads of merchandise at facilities or yards."
bad,"Work day- Driving all day"
bad,"Worries place to work . No one cares about the driver , it's all about the  money . You will have to sit for weeks waiting on trainer and then you are held on the truck for training for 2 months because they delay you hrs to benefit them and their loads."
bad,"This was my first job as a truck driver after receiving my CDL Class A. I made a few mistakes as an inexperienced first time driver and they've shamed my name as a CDL driver and have made it hard for me to seek employment in other places. My mistakes were honest ones that a rookie driver would make who is still learning the rigors of the road and they absolutely did not take that into consideration. My fleet manager was very rude, inconsiderate and disrespectful of my circumstances as a veteran and single parent trying to make the best out of a driver for Werner. And that was displayed towards me while taking home time and trying to communicate effectively while on the road. I was treated as nothing more then a number and I successfully delivered every load safely, not always on-time, but nonetheless safely sometimes while driving in unsafe environments and none of my best efforts were taken into account. They have good equipment, but horrible communication and bad manners with most of the fleet managers there that do not care about the safety and livelihood of the drivers."
bad,Good company for new drivers to get 1 yr experience then leave. They don't pay enough or understand how hard it is out on the road. Wouldn't go back to work for them again.
bad,"This place will chew you up and spit you out. They do not care about the driver, its only about doing as much as you can for them, and screw you. get your experience and get out if you have to."
bad,"Coming into this company as a new driver is very stressful. If I can, I would have loved to start with another company. Driving for Dollar General , is complete madness."
bad,I delivered products to Family Dollar . The equipment was horrible . The way they packed the trucks was very unsafe and dangerous . I would never do this again .
bad,I was a trainer but had to drive and was not paid the salary for the miles that I drove.  There were not any benefits for trainers and I needed to find local driving.
bad,"This company treats its office staff like its drivers. Like everyone is highly replaceable and no guarantee that you will have any job security, not a professional atmosphere at all."
bad,My opinion I was just a number to them. I would not recommend this company to anybody. They do not care about you. They promise you everything and deliver nothing.
bad,Don't come here thinking you are going to be able to pay bills this company is a complete joke they play with your check every week and then give you play play miles and have the nerve to think it's ok. Your fleet manager is always a rock head incompetence waffle brain. DO NOT WORK AT THIS COMPANY!!!!!! This company is very inhumane
bad,"Never even made it passed training. Three horrible trainers led to me being released from training and sent home. Not at all my fault. Lack of trust, communication, and simply the worst place you could ever work at."
bad,The only thing good i can say about werner is that you can get your foot in the door with truck driving but get your time in and Move on quickly. the miles are not worth the hassle and i worked for them twice and the only way i would go back to Werner is if i got Local only
bad,Great company to get logistics knowledge. No room for advancement unless your family or your friends with the family that owns company. Many issues with upper Management. Owner has come out of retirement to get company back on track.
bad,"For real they shouldn't be open for business, they is no word that I could say that will do justice for this company, they is nothing good about them."
bad,My paycheck was always wrong always had to fight with fleet managers always had to fight for my pay always had to fight for loads always had to fight for more miles one of the most stressful experiences of my life I would never consider going back to work for them eagle trans. Is worst I could make more money stocking selfes  at Walmart or target waste of time.
bad,"Your peers are great to work with and its a fun, fast paced environment, but anything above your direct supervisor is just straight toxic leadership.."
bad,In the beginning they were a good company. But as time went on it was constant bickering with my fleet manager. I had to constantly fight for home time
bad,this is a horrible company to stay with long term...lowest pay I the industry long time spent on the road with very little pay to show for it no home life what so every they say werner cares yeah
bad,This is the worst company to work for in omaha if looking for a RPG programming job.    They micro manage you and are very critical.  A what have you done for me lately management attitude.  Very stressful environment
bad,"You are just a number. They will fire you for anything, anytime, no problem, you are just a number, that's why they don't care about you or your situation."
bad,"Little home time, sleep etc for really low pay. I have had weeks where all they gave me was shag loads that pay little. I have put in over 70 hours for under 200 a week."
bad,"It should not be legal to put veterans in these trucks 18 days on 2 days off for less than 30K/yr. They are taking advantage of people. One example: 60 day lane. Every 2 months, at the end of an 18 day work week you have to wait in the 60 day lane for a maintenance inspection, for free. No pay. It could be midnight, 4 trucks ahead of you and they expect you to wait for what could be several hours to help the techs. How? To turn on your blinkers, pump the brakes... They do not care about your time, your life, or if you stay with the company. It is a bad job."
bad,"Worked at Werner for four years , lost everything went bankrupt. Had to beg for food for the first 2 years, the pay was so bad. They gave me a million reasons to quit. Some reason I was stupid and gave them 4 years of my life. Don't let them fool you by there logo we care Werner cares lol. They should change it too the big blue screw. Also they made me sleep in the back of a trailer with my wife and dog instead of giving me a hotel that's how much they care! Waiting for truck assignments  they made me sit outside in the pouring rain with no shelter if you want to have a dog with this company I strongly advise you to think again. Constant short loads. Keep in mind dispatch is not your friend if they don't like you they will starve you out.i can go on and on but I'm finally at a decent company that treats me like a human being and its been going great."
bad,Not a good company to work for at all.... Not a fair company. if you do not do things they want you to do whether it is against policy or not they will make you pay.
bad,Very bad place to work they do not have your back on anything and they come up with things to blame you for what other drivers done so you have to prove to them that you were right non recommendable job
bad,"Training wasn't the greatest, but the actual job was not what we trained on for 4 weeks.  Management has no real idea on how the operations works.  Bonus was not based on performance, but randomness."
bad,Couldn't bring home a part check. They took it money for benefits. When it come time to use them they told me I didn't have any. I asked for a reimbursement they said we'll sign you up. Horrible trainers.  Home the times in a year. I could go on. There are so many good companies... I would strongly to go any where but here.
bad,This is a school where you learn to drive a truck. They teach skills to obtain a CDL drivers license. The class is approximately four to six weeks to completer
bad,"they did not treat there employees very good and could never get home when needed, dispatchers did not care about there drivers"
bad,"The time That was spent out on the road was not worth the money they paid. The management would no listen to any concerns. Also, would not listen to their drivers when they were trying to get information."
bad,"Constantly lied to and taken advantage of. They didn't want me to go home, found out I could drive good and kept me in training for four months solid with no home time."
bad,"The work place was dirty, The managers only cared about getting the job done and not the employees. The hardest part of my job was putting rollers in trailers"
bad,"Poor conditions. Forced unfair labor practices that at times actually violated the DOT Laws. Work conditions such as safety issues and the quality of trainers was deplorable 99% of the time. The compensation was extremely poor and often did not get paid on time, or had to wait for the correct amount over a long period of time."
bad,"i wouldn't recommend to anyone. no good benefits without 50+ yrs of experience. low pay rate, no good miles per week like express before i was hired.  suck i really don't like this job"
bad,don't go with them don't go with them this is a warning don't go with them too many bad stories to tell on here just don't go with them.
bad,"They let driver become trainers after 3 mo of driving. and most trainers are looking for someone to drive while they sleep so, you really don't get adequately trained, making you a safety hazard."
bad,"Management had little to no knowledge of DOT regulations, constantly expected drivers to violate the laws. Constantly making up new policies at whim to force drivers into bad situations."
bad,"I was told my pay would be good but my first check sucked really bad and I cant even pay bills or buy stuff for my kids"
bad,This company is for truck drivers who have no experience. You will not make any money working for this company. I made more money working for a local company than this over the road company and that does not make any sense.
bad,I would not go back to this place if they offered me 10 times the amount of money they were paying. worse place Ive ever worked at in my life.
bad,Worked for them for nearly a year couldn't finish it out. Couldn't afford to give them two weeks notice trucks were always breaking down and due to this was only averaging 300$ a week. The fleet managers have no clue what they are doing and will be the first to drag you under the bus for anything they can think of. Be sure to check your DAC report when working for this company come to find out that they put two accidents on my record that never happened and because of this i cannot find a decent trucking job anywhere.
bad,"none, they don't care about there drivers ship them in like cattle ship them out like dysfunctional idiots send drivers out west to get either a trainer or a truck! time frame can be as long as two weeks in a motel room not enough trainers  trainers are not respected as people they push learners on the trainers, company does there best to push in every aspect of the business on the drivers 14 hour days everyday  7 days a week they are not considerate to the wishes of a driver especially home time is the worst if you request anything other than doctors appt. or legal matters it can take them up to 2-3 days after your request date of getting you home. Maintenance request on trucks are not done in a timely manner either it can take up to 24 hours or longer to get maintenance completed Loss of pay when this is done.  there are no enjoyable times being away from home for long periods of time."
bad,"If you plan to make it in the trucking industry, this is the wrong company to think about. please don't work for this one. Management  was unorganized."
bad,"horrible pay, horrible schedule. too much time away from home. horrible communication. hard to get a hold of hr people, or anyone you need, for that matter. worst company ive ever worked for"
bad,This was a terrible job that I was led to believe would be better than it was.  You drive until you can't drive anymore.  Seeing the country was the only thing about the job that was worthwhile.
bad,the staff does not have any professional skills when it comes down to understanding the drivers needs. they have no regards for the drivers that are trying to follow DOT rules. and there is almost never any home time for the drivers.
bad,"i had to hitch a trailer work the qulacom. Drive to location, I learned nothing here, the hardest part was to back in trailer in little areas, i most enjoyed seeing different states"
bad,This company blows as far as a training program. If you are thinking about them for training prepare to be screwed. the pay isn't worth it. Half of the trainers have less experience than the trainees.
bad,They mislead me to begin working for them. the compensation was not feasible for the conditions that had to be endured. They showed no real concern for me as an employee
bad,on the road to much .. drivers are more of a number than a person .. management solution is more miles .. hard to get in touch with other parts of management to ask questions about pay ..over the road training pays more than going out on your on .. they don't understand the every day struggles on the road with traffic or personal problems all they want is to get freight to the customer on time
bad,the last 3 weeks The trucks breaking down and they put me in a different truck and I'm not even signed in the trucks or brakes down do not get paid for it losing everything net ops home everyday no money in it i need a new job now so i can quit
bad,"This company has a horrible CSA score. Reporting any safety concerns takes over an hour. During that hour you are harassed by dispatchers to roll regardless. Dispatchers lied about runs routinely. Told to work log books routinely for ""more time"".  Time is rounded up so if your required 30 min break is not really 30 mins long. Forced loads and if you refuse you will be threatened with termination. Home time is when they get around to it."
bad,Can't have a life or family and took too long to get you you running if you like downtime perfect job
bad,wasnt a good company to work for had to many issue. the equipment was poor etc..
bad,Not a good company to work for. Pay problems as will as bad driver managers
bad,"They are very unfair to their employees!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,not good if you want to spent time with your family. good for experience on the road!
bad,Joining this company was the biggest mistake I ever made. Don't do make this mistake.  This job is a scam.
bad,"Work environment is horrendous.  Felt like I was in ""Office Space"" I had multiple bosses that would email the same issues multiple times.  They listen to your phone calls and record all your IM's to other employees.  Low pay and would not allow me to apply for other positions w/in the company due to lack of staffing and poor management.  I would highly recommend no one work here. Would be out of business if they did not screw over the new drivers so much.  Rate of turnover is insane.  Forced to work weekends and a 55 hour week with no overtime pay."
bad,horrible exp. trainers were bad and things just didnt work out. dont know how they got their rep that high in the first place.
bad,Stay away from werner I told them I needed more backing training before I went on my own dipatcher didnt want to hear it
bad,This was the worst job. Trying to get deliveries in time. Playing around with home schedule. Lack of communication.
bad,"If you want to have a life, this job isn't for you. It's typical OTR work, just with a severe lack of adequate pay."
bad,Horrible company period..I worked here 3 months and it was the worst 3 months of driving over the road smh
bad,not a very good company to work for most of the drivers I met were very rude and did not  attempt to relay any vital information about the job as required
bad,company does not care for employees. drive your hours do not make any mistakes. bad directions to consignee. next load may take days. dispatchers don't care where you have to wait. seeing the country is the only +.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was staying in a motel.  My trainer was MIA most of the time or the truck was in the repair shop.  The motel in Atlanta, Georgia was very dirty and had bugs.  I slept in my car and showered at the motel."
bad,"I came from another trucking company to Werner, having not completed my training. The people at Werner are so ""left hand does not know what the right hand is doing"" that they categorized me as a co-driver and not a student, and demanded work I didn't know how to perform. There were days when they were demanding I drive after being awake for 48 hours. Didn't make any difference how many times my trainer explained it to them. We'd have to explain it over and over because no one would relay the damned message. I finally had enough when they routed us to a rural location where there were no truck stops with showers and then kept us there for more than a week."
bad,Did not like working for this company they kept me out 3 months straight without any home time. I missed Christmas News Years my kids birthday and my favorite uncles funeral
bad,"Worked at Werner as a OTR Flatbed driver, Don't have a lot of good things to say about them, I know I was new to the industry but it should be illegal to use people the way some of these companies do. Took me three weeks to get my first paycheck of 350.00 for seven days of work. Ok sure Im new, I can suck up the training pay period for 8 weeks. Made more money in training 350.00 a week than I did as a Solo driver in the field some weeks. Was lucky to get a paycheck at this company. 0.25 CPM they did paycuts as I got closer to my 1 year OTR, now down to 0.15CPM and who is going to work for that?? Really?? I was starving I quit!!!"
bad,Your whole day is spent around getting the load to where it needs to get to and when your HOS is over dispatch wont leave you alone so you can get some rest  for the next day. The situation is to the point you are pushed to go into violation and risk fines by DOT and potentially  loose your CDL.
bad,"I waited at the hotel room on a trainer to come for two months and when he came he was crazy. So, I quit ."
bad,"Horrible place to work for, demanding bosses who only refer to you as an ID#, hard time getting home as well, not to mention the way they take advantage of students who are human beings as well but they do not see it that way!"
bad,The company did not hold up to their end of the miles. They offer employess the moon but did not deliver upon. Management was lack luster you had to fight to get information and or any help.
bad,so unorganized with the runs and directions not to mention the dispatch expected you to do things in a time period not permitted by the circumstances
bad,"werner is a bad company to work for they run yo messed up, and treat you pretty bad, you are just a number to them."
bad,Drivers are used like cattle with this company unless you are a good ole' boy.  As a driver trainer (only 90 days out of school) I was asked to take raw drivers and turn them out on the road where they become incredible hazards to the driving public.  The final straw was when a student tried to turn down a busy Los Angeles off ramp (going the wrong way) and when I tried to fail this less than competent driver (this was the third deadly mistake this student tried to make) Werner completely ignored my review and gave this student his own truck. (watch out Seatle and the Western 11 region)
bad,I would not let or recommend any one to this company bad news an pay an bad dispatching benefits  an all with this company there for there self not the drivers the don't care about you
bad,this  employer  cares  nothing  about  you  as  a  person  and  teaches  you  nothing  except  to  learn to  do things  on  your  own you are just  a  #   to  them  as   sad  as  it makes  me  feel  to  post  negative  things like  this   but it is  true
bad,"I am at grayhound right now!!!! When I first arrived I was floored the hotel was on there property which was surrounded by a bobwire fence. It felt like jail! My continental breakfast was a honeybun and coffee my Lunch was a barbeque sandwich. Same hit everyday! Oh and limit only 1 water! I was ready to get a trainer.... Well..... I got one alright! A older man that barley speak english!!! He ""accidently"" left me at a truck stop, he had to loop back to get me and HE WAS MAD... I should have been mad! I called and complain, they acted as If this was normal get over it and move on! Oh she said some trainers kick there students out and take off!!! This is a nightmare!!! You are treated like nothing"
bad,"Did not appreciate sitting in a hotel room for weeks on end"
bad,"substandard pay,did not get all the miles promised,not enough hometime"
bad,do notpay well  no home time do not get you home when time too be home
bad,"The trainers don't teach you nothing they ride on your hours they don't care about  your safety my trainer out of lakeland fl told me to keep my foot on the gas pedal no matter what the ramp exit would say 35 mph he would do 45 mph the safety Dept don't care its all any money if you roll over flip the truck or die you just another number in industry they don't pay you nothing never get on the Dollar General, they work you like a slave the training is two months it's all a pimp game "
bad,"bad pay, bad hr, bad management.  ok routes, ok accounts, decent equipment."
bad,Do not begin with them they falsify DAC records and will ruin your career to extreme measures
bad,"I made a big mistake going to work for these people. They don't care about the driver. Its a ""numbers"" game to them. Don't pay good. Would NOT recommend working for these people. One star is too generous on the ""5 Star Scale"""
bad,Typical day is extremely busy with no opportunity for learning or advancement. Difficult part of the job is making your own decisions without any training. Management is good at pointing out everyone's mistakes but not improving situations. Very poor morale.
bad,"The days of trucking being a cool job are long over. You see, in 2005 a new law was passed, truckers can only drive for 14 hours at a time, they must then rest for 10 hours and begin again, not a bad rule, however if you're new at trucking, you're out of luck. Since the passing of this rule, many companies have focused more on the seasoned drivers, as they'll get the most done, faster, because thats what pros do, and God bless them for it, they earned it. However if you're new, you sit till a company takes a chance with you. That means you can sit in your truck, god only knows where for up to 3 days waiting for a load. If you're not moving, you're not making money. Sad fact, but there ya go."
bad,I wouldnt tell anyone to work for Werner they took advantage of me not knowing the driving industry and treat there driver very bad. Its the worst company ever.
bad,A typical day for me when I was at Werner Enterprises was getting yelled at by my trainer for not being able to drive a truck as good as he can since he's got years of experience over me.
bad,"driving to location. I learned how to drive from one location on a 18 wheeler to the next. nothing to say about management, never saw coworkers, the hardest part of this job was no time with family in a truck when sleeping and no air conditioning truck fumes and little money for food. The most enjoyable part of this job is the different places you were able to visit and be able to see the different areas of new states and towns."
bad,"This company has one of the highest turn around rates for driver i have ever seen and it's no wonder,no home time low cpm a lot of waiting."
bad,"In an effort to obtain more drivers, they make promise they cannot keep. I worked 60 days without a day off."
bad,hand offload trailer pushing rolltainer
bad,"liar liar pants on fire!! about everything and anything, it's amazing they even one load delivered"
bad,"Probably the worst experience of my life - I finally achieved my dream of becoming a trucker only to end up in a terrible company. I was promised a company that supported drivers, paid well, never asked a trucker to break the law, and guaranteed ""2 full days"" of home time. None of that was true. I never made it home in 10-14 days as promised. If I rolled in by 6pm, I was told that was ""a full day off."" I was expected to report by the next day. I saw my family 80 hours in 6 months."
bad,It was just an experience to becoming a CDL driver. Always on the road. 48 states class A driver.
bad,This company never allowed home time and their pay was not that good.
bad,"The best part of working for this company are a few of the people who work there. The days are long, about 14+ hours a day. Equipment (trucks) are nice for the most part, trailers are not quite up to par though. Pay and benefits are not very good either. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting other people on the road."
bad,Trainor tried to make me urinate in a bucket refused threatened to throw me out of the truck around nowhere so I would be stuck.
bad,This was just a place for training and to get experience for other jobs.
bad,Training is Slave Labor on you; NOT training
bad,"At Werner, I had two Driver Trainers, the first was assigned to Dollar General, the only thing he taught me was how to move stock off the lift and place in the store. Even though trainees are not allowed to help unload. I was used as a lumper."
bad,"If your looking For  good company with great leadership This is not the one for you, They force you Into doing things you don't want to do, They don't care whats going on in your life, or if you have  a family. If your single and don't have a life go for it, If you Love Your family and want to make sure they are taken care of and want to be there for them skip this company. Low pay for tons of hours"
bad,Leadership all have different ideas in departments. You are pulled in too many directions to try and satisfy all these different ideas. They need to meet together and all move in the same direction of management and goals.
bad,"The company man will come and talk the company up to be the number one leader of the business. They will boast about being debt free as well. This company is absolutely the same as any other company that cares more about fleet and running you until you have no feeling left within your body and soul, but are unwilling to pay what you are worth. They are all the same. Liars in suits behind telephones. They do not care if you have a family waiting or if you are physically fit for work.  They only care about one thing. Increase for their shareholders"
bad,"My team mate did 2 34hr resets & I was 4hr away from doing my second 34hr reset. They will give you 2000 mile run then have you spilt it after 300 miles to make sure other driver's get miles off that load. I was given a brand new truck with 44 miles on it & after 4 months returned it with 44000 miles on it, so you do the math. They told us they were paying the truck 49cpm, but once we calculated the miles with cpm we realized they were only paying us 45cpm. We both decided to return the truck & find something different, which Werner Enterprises have failed to send our information over to other companies."
bad,Recruiting is a total joke. Chained to your desk for 10 hours a day. Can't talk to coworkers without getting harsh looks. Absolutely no advancement in the department. Low salary pay with a low capped bonus. Not to mention working Saturdays and a holiday. Management is a nightmare
bad,One of the worse places I've worked. Was due a raise i never got. Was promised hometime i never got. Managemenr and fleet managers were never on the same page. Lack of communication all around.
bad,Get your time in a get out  will steal pay your earned an keep telling you next weeks check it will be on you manager tells you your getting a pay raise an you never get it because it’s an someone else desk.
bad,VERY mismanaged.  Psychotic manager was more interested in gestapo tactics rather than productive atmosphere.   No team camaraderie.   Dungeon environment.
bad,"Horrible company, stay far, far away!!  Unless you just like to get worked to death, and never go home, because your family doesn't matter to a money loving company like Werner...."
bad,"Teamming. FM and dispatch keep giving us 3 to 500 miles freight and making us wait long hours (detention not paid) for a new load. 0.23 com for teamming OTR  on the 48 states,  but they keep us around mo, Illinois,  ohio, while we live in California, make us stay 3 weeks away from our families with fake promises and getting paychecks under $1k every week, in some weeks low as $400. But when they give us a load they start rushing us in the Qualcomm. Nobody to talk about this, drivers relationships suppose to help but they do nothing. Safety department is like internal affairs for a cop or MP for a service member, not on your side. As an example: 3 days ago we waited all morning until 1500hs to get a split load, 263 miles trip, Qualcomm silence after that. At 2300 I drove Bobtail to Joliet terminal. That day wages: $60. I'll stay for my resume for at least 6 months."
bad,"OTR operator,  whenever my truck required service or broke down, no matter how long it took be repaired, I did not recieve hourly wages. Paid only by the number of miles driven. sometimes on the road for10-14 days. As far as culture on the job my interaction was only with dispatcher."
bad,"Low level managers have absolutely no respect for other human beings. Have never been treated worse in my life. "
bad,"I worked at Werner headquarters for almost 4 years and would never consider going back. Environment is EXTREMELY cliquey and management is very obvious about choosing favorites. Basically, if you are not the brown-noser type toward your boss(es), you are disliked. Management constantly gossips together about their employees and discloses confidential information about you to other employees without hesitation or reprimand. They are discriminatory, and if you are not a practicing alcoholic who joins the group at their weekly happy hour binges, you are an outcast and gossiped about. Management is very shady and corrupt. There are countless inappropriate affairs between married employees and supervisors. It is a disgusting, atrocious norm at Werner. There's also a lot of harassment that goes on..but the harasser does not get sufficiently reprimanded. All they get is a little slap on the wrist and the case is closed. "
bad,"Unless you are a member of the Werner family, you will go no where with this company.  Poor pay, poor management, and a horrible place to work."
bad,"Recruiter will lie and act as if you are going to get the truck that you ask for. In orientation you'll be staying in a roach motel. They'll lowball your pay. They won't get your truck fixed. I went through 3 trucks in 3 months, most because your manager act as if you should drive it until the dam wheels fall off, literally!"
bad,"Dispatch will send you anywhere and love to keep you out till the very last second of hometime. Speaking of hometime dispatchers will call you on your days off, make sure your vacation time is cut to a minimum and pressure drivers to drive on faulty equipment."
bad,Management was not involved in day to day operations there was no company format
bad,"My typical day here was awful, they treated you like you are not worth a penny."
bad,Drivers are treated as burdens that the non driving employees have to put up with
bad,"Seriously, working for Werner is better than nothing."
bad,"The job is extremely busy. I learned about the transportation industry. I work on truck boards to ensure freight is delivered on time. The hardest part of the job would be the hours for poor compensation, and home/work life balance."
bad,"no one works together when you need help you dont get it,everyone is for them self"
bad,The whole environment at the dallas terminal is toxic.If you are not part of their group they will turn on you and run you off. Mgmt  in Neb is aware .
bad,"Management culture believes that without them company would fall into chaos. To many chiefs not enough Indians. They don't train drivers properly,  they don't audit their training program. To many drivers showed up and couldn't back a truck up. They gamble with the lives of the driving public, by putting out sub-standard drivers. And they steal pay from drivers. Don't believe me, look into the class action law suit filed against them."
bad,"Low pay, long days."
bad,"I hate this company, they have outgrown themselves, they don’t recognize you as a person, your a Mile Mule, just another idiot to hold a steering wheel for them, and if your not compliant with being a mile mule your easily replaced, they graduate a new mule every Friday from their school Roadmaster. They lack integrity, they lack empathy and compassion for a driver. I understand that it’s trucking, but we are human and we have families, deaths, births, divorce  etc. They don’t care"
bad,"From the time I was recruited, until the time I resigned and turned my truck in their fleet management and recruiters were dishonest scheisters who sugar coated what turned out to be a very bleak experience."
bad,"Treat you like a commodity not a person will lie to you and try to force your hand when you are just starting out, they'll exploit the situation you're in financially and try and force you onto a truck with a trainer."
bad,"To them your just another number, bot a person. They don't try to ensure you get an average amount of miles per week, you never know what your pay is going to be, some managers are fair some are oblivious on how the industry works and how to take care of the problems you face. Equipment isn't great and if you have a problem or a safety issue with your truck they won't even address it.it.it.yorecruiting tells you, you get 2 days off,"
bad,The dispatchers can't be trusted they r 2 faced will go behind your back an lie to get u terminated if u refuse up North . Meanwhile smiling to your face like all is well. DNT WORK FOR THIS PLACE!!!!!.  Not worth it .
bad,The brokerage side is a joke. Poor management thats very immature. Stressful environment. Management screams at you literally. Cannot take any days off. Worse job ever.  Save your time. Uber and Amazon taking over anyways.
bad,How can you pay your drivers so little i almost lost my house .i recoverd a truck for the in Colorado they promised to pay all expense they did not i hope they and all CEO s go bankrupt
bad,"If you are looking for a company that will have your back when being accused of something, they won’t. The money is good but the job culture and standards are at an all time low"
bad,"Did not get compensated for my training hours logged. Paid $0.33 per mile loaded, $0.18 per mile deadhead. Dispatch left me stranded with no load several times. Home time was hardly existent. Terrible company to work for."
bad,"no comment to be made, Supervisors are made aware of situations and nothing in done about it, office workers don't respect the drivers and drivers life needs- make fun of drivers that need to take care of family issues and can't take delivery load"
bad,"I've been lied to from day 1, as soon as they pay off their school in which they own, I'm gone. Next time I'll know what questions to ask, but I was just starting out."
bad,"If youre just getting into trucking, its an ok place to start to get your experience. After you have your year in the best thing you can do is leave that place."
bad,I gave a year of my life to this company sacrificed time with my family and was terminated for something that could happen to any driver road hypnosis could happen to anyone i got out of it without damaging anything or hurting anyone and i got terminated for it and yet another driver totaled a truck and they gave him a new one and sent him back to work which just proves to me the type of drivers they value.
bad,Werner is a “Very Bad Company”. They thrive on new drivers. Wages at a lot of trucking companies has increased significantly. Not at Werner! They do not need to up the wages because their company is a “Revolving Door”. They employ new drivers without the experience to get real pay in trucking. Then they use them and abuse them until they have enough training to leave! Werner even decided to cut the middle man out the equation and naught Road Master Driving School! Now when you don’t like they pay and how they nickel and dime your paychecks. They could honestly care less! They know how many students are lined up to take your place. It is great for business horrific in morals and a nightmare for each and every driver! I am not going to list all the horrendous practices I have had to deal with while employed at this trash bag company. I just want to warn you before you come to Werner. It’s BAD! The Salary I listed should give you and idea! It is what I am at after tax as of NOV!
bad,"Wait 5 weeks stuck in hotel waiting for trainer, spending money all this time, they only give you lunch the first 3 days of orientation, after that, your on your own, finally  assigned trainer, get on the road, and couple weeks later, trainer has to go home and leave me in terminal and again waiting for another trainer,  for several weeeks, money issues, they told you something and not keep it, they cut my training short put me to work, send me to get a recovery tractor,that was no working, have to sleep in car rental and drive another state to get it with a lot of issues, work on winter without heather, got sick, they promise me a new tractor at the beginning and have to wait a beg for it, spend many weeks out and they fail me on sending me home on time and I miss important family events, worst , got injured and the have me working under workers comp, ended on the hospital cause they never send me on time to dr. They never paid for my medical bills, or my time off due to the accident and the people keep passing the ball to other departments, but time I left they own me money never paid."
bad,"Okay to start. Trainers need more training. They shoukd believe some of their students more.      So i think they should do.that "
bad,"One of their slogans is, ""Werner Cares,"" which is questionable. Both as a student driver and as a driver, I saw multiple time where making money and making sure the load was delivered on time took precedence over driver safety."
bad,Bad company when you go for training they will have you in a hotel for 3 to 4 weeks stressful when you have 6 weeks on the road on top of that and a family at home but they don’t care 🤷‍♀️ if I was you stsy away form Werner
bad,"16 hour day, not compensated for sitting a dock. paid per mile SUCKS. I was there 8 years, I have no family, no house, no rent and when I left WERNER I had no money, that in itself should explain it all."
bad,"Working for Werner was a great experience to get my career started, however management expects you to be a pushover for your drivers because they’re more focused on making the drivers happy rather than you. If you are willing to put in 70 hours for a 50 hours a week salaried job then go for it. I preferred having a life on the weekends."
bad,I found a way to improve The position I was in by 75% producing 75% more loads and making 75% more trailers available then the average driver that held my position before me and in return they cut my pay in half because I was making too much money by doing what I did.
bad,typical day includes having your hands tied while being yelled and cursed at by drivers. Not a position I would recommend to anyone not desiring a heart attack.
bad,over the road driving of tractor trailer. communication was moderately component; people management was unskilled & neglectful. they did not care about their employees and did not meet federal compensation standards which is why there is a class action suit against them.
bad,No communication between anyone. Management turnover is outrageous. Terrible company to work for. Inhumane at times and no regards for human life. End of Story.
bad,Go out state for 3 weeks or more and comeback home for 3 days. Good for getting to know the states but always away from the family
bad,Tough living Conditions and being far away from home and family on a daily basis was something i was not fond of.Driving and lifting freight although steady work and hours were a guarantee. The work required a large amout of time with minimum pay for the position at hand.  I learned alot about the values of being close to home and family.
bad,"While the company as a whole treats its employees the same, sadly the treatment is all bad.  Training company that puts new drivers into the operator seat way too soon, then over works their safety team because of it."
bad,Poor management and load assignments. Did not have a god experience with this company. Uses deception and empty promises to appease you then goes back on promises made
bad,"Hated Working for this company you get cheated out of your earnings if you are a student drive, Unable to get any rest as a team diver because truck is always moving"
bad,"This company lied to me about my miles I would be running, my home time with my children was limited to only 3 days a month. A lot of lies."
bad,The experience was wonderful. I was able to travel across the country. Meet a lot of nice people and made some friends along the way.
bad,"This company pay only  22 cents per mile new drivers.  Other company pay decent money. I was thinking how this company pay good money to the personal office like fleet manager,  receptionist, human resources,etc and they pay only a little money to driver when the drivers are moving the company. Stay away. Any mistake you do they count accident and damage your CSA score. Please don't trust nobody special in your fleet manager. Everybody in this company have two faces. First year here 25,000 or less. Other company 38,000 or more."
bad,"Pick up load at shipper & deliver load on time to customer"
bad,"good day at work is to have enough miles to drive for the whole day. bad day is to spend 14 hours to earn 26.00 because you are sitting waiting for werner to get you a load or to be unloaded. i am a very responsible person, never have missed a day of work, hard worker and aiming to please. i have learned a day in trucking could be very uplifting or heartbreaking, and unfortunately its not what you do its what happens to you. most co-workers are all very friendly but all very frusturated like i am. the hardest part of the job is sitting all day long watching your day tick away and getting nowhere and is out of your control but in someone else. the most enjoyable part of my job is the feel of accomplishing the task that was given to you."
bad,Long hard days and away from home is not worth the little money you make.
bad,"Just quit today after working dollar general acct in indianola for exactly 30 days....and this is the god honest truth...STAY AWAY from these people....lies lies @ more lies...you do back breaking work unloading 7, 8, & 9 hundred lb rolltainers ...truck leans..wheels ragged on rolltainers. ..stuff falling out as u try and move..work work work...and severly underpaid...u work saturdays too..u work 6 days a week and you're busted up too after all that...they're truck don't idle unless it's under 30deg or over 80deg so u sleep hot with windows cracked...800 bucks in 6 days is all u can make...no hm time they micro manage u to death all so u can hurry up and get to a store only to wait because they wont unload u until its time...so go ahead give werner a shot...electronic log u to death...all kinds of obstacles on this acct..hope u enjoy backing from all angles..62mph truck...so many things thrown at the driver...driver takes blame for everything over here..."
bad,"don't recommend the company to anyone... I was having mainly problem with the dispatcher....... week day was okay.... weekend was full of s**t..... whatever you sign up for, they don't give it to you... your just an employee identified as a number... not by name.... the more miles you drive per trip... the less cent per miles you get paid.... so yes... it sucks.... I sign up for Western Regional Driver and end up everywhere..... they don't keep there bargain..."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the Fleet Manager job at the Zanesville OH site was working with the diverse group of drivers. The hardest part of the job was the leadership requirement to have little interaction with the drivers.
bad,Werner doesn't care about you. They will replace you in the blink of an eye. They treat their drivers with disrespect I've not seen before. There is a very good reason why most of their drivers leave the company after a couple months.
bad,"Werner Enterprises does an excellent job of presenting themselves as a wonderful company to work for with lots of benefits, great pay, and a great environment. This is far from what Ive experienced working in the maintenance department. Management wont resolve issues, the shop equipment is in DANGEROUS shape, and the damage you're asked to “let go” is absurd and sometimes, illegal. Compensation is one of the lowest in the industry. I can not recommend this company to anyone after having worked here for more than two years."
bad,"Constantly being harrassed by safety for most minor things.When your at 5,000 mile mark in the week all of the sudden your getting shag runs until pay period ends low pay.They report everything on Dac report which is in my case blantantly wrong or plain lie,exagerated, non reportable as reportable or completely wrong accident description accident description sk you either have to fight to correct in order to get job elsewhere.."
bad,I worked for them for 6 months and had 2 small backing insistents no property damage small dents  and was fired and now when other companies call for a reference they say i have safety issues so nobody wants to hire me they are career killers it's not all the recruiter says it is
bad,"Understaffed and overworked office associates work a minimum of 45 hours weekly. There is never a day where you are felt caught up on your work, always walking into a varying degree of chaos. 80% of employees are given laptops and cell phones, which at first sound like an excellent perk, only to find you are taking work home with you on nights and weekends only to stay caught up with your workload."
bad,Extremely unorganized.  Fleet manager was unsympathetic and disrespectful. truck was broke down with no pay. you learn everything on your own. the most enjoyable part of the job was the actual driving.
bad,"12+ hours a day ,6 days a week for 950 a week that you MIGHT get...it's the same as making 11.00 an hour.. Swift had trip planners Werner doesn't even train their guys...i almost quit the first night.  get prepared to be driving til the sun comes up."
bad,"I was unable to get more than 4 to 6 hours sleep in my truck.  I was uncomfortable driving an 80,000 pound vehicle among other motorists for 10 hours a day on that little amount of sleep every day.  The company has accounts where the driver can be home every day, but the company refused to transfer me to one of those accounts."
bad,"I drove for Werner for 6 months after already having a year of driving experience.  Drivers get treated the worst out of all the employees an, in my opinion, are looked down upon."
bad,"To many to say, unloading a hot trailer everyday and sometimes two at a dollar general just to make 35 cent a mile and 26.00 Dollars a stop with most loades being one stop"
bad,No leadership and very poor management. It is a very stressful place to work with little communications from the managers. Sometime what is communicated is contradicted the next time.
bad,Werner is by far one of the top companies out there. if you are starting out or have experience. Do your job and you will excell. Dont do your job and you wont. The Training and fleet managers do their best to be there for you when they can. Weekend dispacthers need more help. If there were more of them things would run a whole lot smoother and business would be even more profitable for them.
bad,"Being a 24-7 shop it takes a act of congress to get a weekend off. Never closed for any holiday. Pay schedule sucks, people behind the counter unhappy, but look where they work. So many unhappy shop employees, but none of them have the balls to leave like I did. I was there 6 months and couldn't believe how a major company like this is run this poorly. SAD"
bad,"I hated this company dispatch would make me sit for days on end I barley made enough to pay my bills, To them your just a number . you would be given loads at the last minute and would run you to absoulte exhaustion and not care about problems with the truck. you could never get an empty trailer when you needed it even at the terminals the staff is clueless and unreliable not to mention shaddy. I had to grease more than one palm to get what I needed. theft was so rampet at the terminals I would carry anything of value with me at all times , trying to keep the truck cool was impossible at night they turned on the anti idle and with no apu I was having to find a hotel each nite just so I could stay cool so I could sleep . the terminals are filthy and showers are disgusting. ill never work for them ever again."
bad,No didn't happen these guys were talking to married women while I would be driving now what kind of trainer does that someone that just doesn't care
bad,"You begin working as soon as you sit down at your desk and don't stop until you leave.  Sometimes you don't take a break because you'd hate to leave your lunch partner with your work when they can hardly handle their own. The training is terrible and the operating network is old as dirt so it's very confusing and not user friendly at all.  The atmosphere is negative because they're willing to get rid of anyone at any time so it's very stressful.  There is no loyalty or concern for any employee regardless of how long they've been with the company.  They say they care about the drivers but all they really care about is the bottom line and trying to out-do each other individually.  They promise a lot to the drivers and the office personnel and very rarely deliver.  They make the staff on the lower end of the totem pole do all the dirty work.  It is extremely micromanaged to the point people are afraid to say anything at times as they may be at risk of losing their jobs.  The only good parts about the job is every now and then when you have a spare moment to talk to drivers without having to rush off the phone you actually get to talk to some pretty nice people.  Even though most of the time, the drivers are very angry and yelling or complaining about how their being mistreated by the company and shorted pay or promised something they never got.  I've never worked for a company where I really feel like I'm not really a person, just a machine."
bad,"A typical day on the job was come and quiet. I learned how to safely handle the tractor and trailer combo really well. I learned to estimate distance. I am confident behind the wheel of a Semi. The hardest part of the job was the lack of good food on road, most of what you can find is fast food. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving the truck and back in to the dock doors."
bad,"Had bad experiences with werner, not professional company."
bad,Pick up and delivered in 48 States of freight.
bad,"There are a lot of things to watch out for with some companies as far as promises of salary, hours, and the type of equipment that you will be using. I am still grateful for this company giving me a start in the truck driving field."
bad,You will be accused for everything no matter the circumstance you will work long hours and not get compensated enough for it you will have to deal with terrible accounts as well
bad,Werner will fire you for the little thing like braking hard to avoid an accident. They said the dash cam is to protect the drivers and the company. That’s a lie. The dash cam is their to fire the driver the little thing. The safety guys in Joliet Illinois terminal are like snakes the will change the drivers word and type in their own word so they can look good in front of cooperate. The dispatch suck. Werner doesn’t care about their drivers. All the care is about money. Driver are nothing but just a number to them
bad,"RUN!!!! RUN FAST!!! You’re just another number and body to put you in a truck seat. Any little thing you do, they’ll put it on your record (NOT ME). You’ll get fired for dodging (making an out) a collision. I’m guessing they want you to wreck so they can write the truck off and have your DAC screwed. Safety suppose to be for your safety. For God sakes it doesn’t work like that here"
bad,"If you don't have a life, family or friends, and want to be on the road all year round, trucking is for you!!!!!"
bad,"They will do there best to make sure u dont get paid enough to survive and pay ur bills."
bad,"I had never been in trouble before and mistakenly eaten a breadstick that was not communal leftovers as I was led to believe and was terminated for ""withholding information during an investigation"" even though I had admitted that I had eat the breadstick."
bad,They will cheat you out of a lot of money with their pay packages try to force loads on you and do band aid fixes on their trucks will lie to get you on a route and won't follow through
bad,I loved truck driving but this company was not the best choice they never paid me per diem and then they shaved miles off my loads and paid me less i am extremely unhappy with them
bad,do not start your driving corer with Warner. thy do not care abut you only the money thy get from the GOV for putting you threw training.
bad,"Got into a dedicated acct (3M) as a team, and got paid $.09 a mile Each. NOT A TYPO ****9 CENTS A MILE**** dispatcher said take it or leave it, so we did (teamed with best friend) leave it. We were told so many lies and other drivers were told the same lies, dispatchers must think drivers dont talk. Try and get anything done on nights or weekends?? Omaha is too busy IMing and playing games to take care of you. Dispatchers have 500+ trucks to tend on nights and weekends ?!?! Anyways, dont expect much, and you won't be disappointed.  Oh and dont break down.... EVER. We are off to USX maybe."
bad,nothing to but work work work no time to yourself I'm more of a family guy
bad,Made promises that weren't kept. Lost my training due to a family emergency.
bad,Werner Enterprises has poor trainers and even worse time management however their were some good routes that could have been exploited more for strict weekly routes that they over looked.
bad,"I was promised things that was never granted. I didn't mind staying out a long period of time, but I wanted to be able to spend a little more time with family."
bad,No hometime for a 36 hour reset no bob trailing.  Dedicated account for Dollar General is not worth cause u dont get no Holidays off you work every holiday as long as da store is opened u have to deliver Tues - Sat
bad,My regular fleet manager was great on TCU account. weekend dispatch would never answer phones or messages from the truck. Log dept. was unreasonable with personal conveyance. refused to let me come home on my scheduled home time. I stayed out over 4 weeks at a time and they never once got me home on my requested home time. stress level was high. sitting with no loads often.
bad,It’s a revolving door company don’t plan on being here for your career. Pay is below average and don’t ever get into a safety situation they will black ball you.
bad,The people are nice and are patient. Not many route options if you live on west coast. Cheat you on pay. Miles just somehow come up missing with them.
bad,"They have poor communication skills"
bad,"Werner started off as a FANTASTIC company. I invested 4 years and in the beginning got 11 hours a day driving and fantastic miles. Since then into 2018 Werner has far exceeded their ability to provide driver support from Ohama Nebraska. Despite 2 billion in revenue it is the age old story that they expect the most amount of work from the least amount of people and get the most out of skeleton crews. I understand some drivers make Great money. I was down to less than $250 a week and its getting more common. Canada briefing is run by 1 person. Seriously it could be staffed by 5 minimum. Breakdown took a week to authorize my last repair. Payroll stopped reimbursing me . i faxed reciepts in that got lost. Safety stopped processing my DOT inspections. My dispatcher stopped giving preassigns. Night and weekends there is nobody to dispatch after a delivery."
bad,Started with the recruiter telling you lots of great things that were not offered by the company. Constantly being told by Disbatch about the loads rarely true. Had several loads that I wasn’t paid for.
bad,"When I was driving I stuck in the mud place they considered me an accident, and let me go."
bad,"I think that the overall business aspect of this company is wonderful. if it had more good employees than awful people that take their positions for granted because they hire drivers that live far away. Too far for any outside resources for -HELP. It is basically impossible to do anything about the way they treat drivers. The treatment I witnessed and was subject to while employed here was horrific until I finally got my Fleet manager after going thru I believe four of them. I also wrote a complaint letter that got somebody's attention because I was able to get my two years OTR experience with low level drama. By this time the damage had been done beyond repair and the treatment became hilarious. It got to the point I awoke extra early everyday anxious in wonder as to what nonsense was in store for me. They exposed me to mold in their truck on company time. told me what it was, took the evidence via of starting a fight with my dog, and told me it was not a workers comp issue so if I was gone past thirty days seeking treatment I voluntarily quit and laughed about it. I didn't find it funny. I refused to quit and wrote a complaint letter, despite everything they threw at me. I do give them credit because after dealing with all the chaos I learned to become an excellent driver. Thank You Werner for this. Not that it's doing me any good now. They terminated me one month prior my two year goal for a completely bogus reason, no proof, no explanation, they can do what they want. Now they have labeled me in a way that will follow and hinder me forever and others are following their"
bad,"This is strictly a beginners truck driving company, a person with experience would do way better working for another company. They did train me to drive a truck, but the pay for the first year and half I was there wasn't sustainable by any means of the imagination; that's why their financially strong though because they have hundreds of drivers getting less then a quarter of the pay other drivers get, yet they charge the same rate for a load that the other companies charge. Job security is high is you wish to stay with them forever getting the lowest wages in the industry! Home time wasn't good though but due to having a dedicated run I got home every weekend."
bad,I felt like the management team disrespected me. Workers comp did not pay for my on the job injury which hospitalized me for 3 days. A self insured company makes their own rules.
bad,It's not a good company it looks great on the outside the people at the terminal or great Fleet managers for the most part suck and you will definitely get cheated out of your pay
bad,"I only took a total of six days off for this company in the first year i worked for them and nobody in management noticed or said thank you."
bad,"It was a love, hate relationship. they are lairs, they got more faces then an rubic cube. so i will not recommend this place to my worst enemies. sorry more bad then good."
bad,"Werner is one of the most unprofessional and cheapest paying companies in the entire industry. They will have you to only run about 100 miles a day and have you sitting, plus only paying .25cpm"
bad,"A company that makes poor management decisions. When you ask questions to your supervisor because you want to know what is going on. Expect answers such as ""Upper management made that decision and they are upper management for a reason"" If you are a Yes man then this company is for you."
bad,Idk if it was because I was new and it was my first company but I had 3 to 4 dispatchers within my first 2 months solo.They didn't pay me layover pay and the last thing that had happened is somebody over the dispachers cursed me out over the phone and I told him I'll  turn the truck in.
bad,When I started I was told that I would deliver Monday through Friday be home Saturday and back out on Monday morning. This never happened went through three different divisions in the company and not one of them kept a promise of getting me home. Sometimes I was gone for as much is three months. When doing 48 states the pay was ridiculous. Stay out anywhere from four weeks to 12 weeks sometimes making only seven $800 a week.
bad,"Culture of lies and deceit punctuated by a cult like belief and loyalty that causes any expressed criticisms to be met with anger and disdain. The  lies start from the recruiter, and extend to the CEO himself. "
bad,"Pick up loaded trailer, take it to the stores, unload the trailer."
bad,"not liked at all,the staff was hostile not like was the worst place that ever worked my last trainer was dirty no clean himself it was a mess"
bad,"So this company is a stepping stone. If you are a new driver do your time. You are a number. I told the fleet manager my name and he had no clue who I was. Maintenance wait times are terrible. I have sat many time for a 10 hour break just to get a flat fixed. Pay is poor compared to others. Trainers(75%) don't know what they are doing or do and are doing other things illegal. IE. Drugs. Equipment is hit and miss. I keep getting old trucks so have no stayed in one more than 3-4 months. "
bad,"2 weeks before I finish class A training I was pre-hired with Werner because they told me I would get a regional route and be home every 5-7 days & drive in the CA, AZ & NV states. My first trip out I was sent to Denver CO with a trainer that was disgusting. There was food & empty soda bottles on the floor of the truck & it smelled like something was rotting away. My 1st trip was hit with snow & black ice, my windshield froze and since my training had so much junk on the defroster vents they did not defrost. I asked for a new trainer the next day & was advised that he was the only one at the moment so I have to “take it or leave it” So I left it, working with Werner is not worth my safety or life."
bad,"When i was recruited, i was told I would be in the West 11, werners idea of west is west of the atlantic. I found myself in the dakotas and running canada constantly( I should have never said I had a passport)."
bad,"i signed up to work with them after getting my CDL from school. "
bad,Great managers and fellow coworkers but the equipment was horrible.
bad,A typical day at work you wake up in your truck you pick up aload and drop it off at the next destination. That destination could be anywhere in the united states.
bad,The Good:Very respectful for most part for mega 2000+ drivers Very safety oriented company and will give you all the tools that you need to succeeded great support network Brand New Trucks for new drivers...The Bad: I had to stay out 3 weeks just to bring home enough money to cover bills and they dont pay layover or detention
bad,"the job is the worst place I've ever worked. treated like children, manager of dept was changed 3 times in one year. hated every minute of the day!!!!"
bad,"Went out on two OTR as a trainy, never heard back from them again. Kept calling and waiting for next trip with no communication from the office at all."
bad,"I was told I would be home daily making a minimum of $875 a week with room for advancement but I have been making $875 a week since I started this job one year ago and I am working between 60 and 65 hours a week, you are not an employee to this fleet you are just a number and all they care about is pushing out product no family sympathy whatsoever ."
bad,"They paid well for the hours and job expectations. But very toxic environment, with toxic managers, and hostile and competitive coworkers in the insurance department."
bad,This is good to good company to start in the trucking industry to teach you all the good rules and regulations  To get you started a good career the trucking industry
bad,It's a good starter company for new students but that's it.  Experience drivers they try to take advantage of you and the pay is only sub par.  Not impressed working with Werner.
bad,"When I first started with this company there was a sense of comradery, then the colors started to change. When an opportunity came ot advance I was looked over for people who were not working in the department. And when was asked why it was a given that they had already decided on the person but had to post the position. What I was told was not what was shown. If you decide to work for this company understand that a smile doesn't always mean that you won't get a swift kick when you turn aroaund"
bad,"I like to start my day around 02:00 and drive a straight 7 hours before my first break. The most important thing I've learned is to read each line of your dispatch if you don't know ask questions. The management is very courteous, and helpful. The main rule of the day is safety first and always be friendly and courteous. The hardest part of my day is trusting the company's GPS coordinate. I have to break out own maps, for the best times and safety. The best part of any job/day is it's end, that's shower/ meal time."
bad,"Werner does not pay their drivers enough to eat while out on the road (you live off cash advances), and the dispatchers are under-handed. I had one dispatcher put me on a route where he thought I would run out of gas(rounds for immediate dismissal), and acted surprised that I didn't just rely on my GPS (where he did not send me the authorized route) and got my load to it's destination on time."
bad,A typical day for work would be going to the shipper to pick up product and then delivering the product the next day or it might take two days to deliver the product that you are hauling.
bad,would not recommend working there poor management was there 10 months would never go back there very hard getting them to get you home for home time
bad,Excessive workload for TERRIBLE pay. Very high turnover at this company. It's a revolving door which is why they are advertising all the time. Good place to start but very little hope for a good future there.
bad,"I was a driver at Werner for 4 years...very low pay and short runs. Good runs are only given to trainers and students.  Teams fair ok, but solo drivers suffer. Often I would sit waiting to get loaded for most of my 14. (No detention pay) Once loaded I would drive less than 200 miles and have to give the load to a trainer or team.  I was lucky to bring home $350.00/ wk on good weeks. Weekend and night crew dispatch was argumentative and not interested in helping drivers. I was on a southeast regional acct but spent most of my time in the northeast.  Would have to threaten to quite after 7 - 10 days before they would get me out of there.  2 months after getting off my trainers truck they were begging me to train...  ( the blind leading the blind). Safety is always on ur back for hard braking, over idle, over speed etc. Home time is not guaranteed and short. Do urself a favor start here, get a year in and move to a smaller company that actually takes care of their drivers. This company is too big and only concerned about their bank Accts. A lot a lot a lot of unnecessary stress w no extra perks"
bad,"started at werner when i started driving over the road and i liked the job but i was not happy with the company, i thought they did not pay enough."
bad,I have worked at Werners in the past and moved on for more growth and opportunity with a different company. I worked her for several years and obtained experince.
bad,Dispatchers do not respect drivers.  Training was 3 months long with low pay and no benefits.  You are treated more like a number than a person.
bad,"Shop kept pushing other trucks in front of me on the waiting list so I was prevented from going home for my approved home time,"
bad,"Work hard with low pay,Ask you to work over hours,and pull heavy loads"
bad,There was so many unexpected mechanical issues and it was really bad pay.
bad,"One example involved a trailer that was oversized and due to cross bridge into Canada.  Was threatened with termination for refusing the load, no matter how many times I stated was not refusing the load, just could not legally move it until permits were provided."
bad,"This was my first job as a truck driver for a company that I was told later on was the worst company to work for if your new at driving. My days were fourteen hour days. I only got home on the weekends which was my only time to get a shower. I started my day about five o'clock in the morning after sleeping in the truck at a rest stop. The rest stops in New Jersey were the worst. Most of them did not have rest rooms, just parking spaces. Often I had to make phone calls at the end of the day or find some means of researching my stops for the next day because the dispatchers addresses were not correct most of the time. This caused extra stress on me and added more problems than necessary. Some places I had to depend on sheer luck that I was headed in the right direction because by the time I got to call these places they were closed for the day. My boss expected me to figure this out all by myself. He refused to help and some days he called off of work and that made the job even harder. All of the other drivers had the same problems but helped me out as much as they could. The hardest part of the job was preparing for the next day. The only day I enjoyed was the day I brought my wife with me so she could see what it was like to on the road."
bad,Not a great company to work for. On a week to week basis you will not be dealt with like a human being. to them you are just a number.
bad,They are horrible. You are nothing but a number and who cares if you need to go home for something. We told them we needed to be home and it took them 2 months to finally get us there.
bad,"werner is not good at all just a start company just to get your exp. in but other then that no home time not much pay truck keeps breaking down and then they take forever to get to you. starters will not get anything out of it you will go though hell before anything. if you go to werner . think twice you will not be making nothing for your time with them and time away from family. best thing to do is talk to the drivers like my self and they may tell you its bad but not that bad but you will see the look on they face they are going though it. most of them will tell you its bad. but most will tell you its just a start true but a bad start.not much runs and they barly have a mt ready for you. so you can keep moving. and we all know if you aint moving you aint making no money. .good luck werner seekers but take it from me and listen i rather you not have you go though hell ,LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELES"
bad,In a typical day I would go to each stop and unload and load my trailers. Also I drove all 48 states.
bad,"I was wrongly terminated, I was coming up on my 10 years, what that means is another week of vacation, safety bonus and close to my million miles truck, but why pay me what I was making when you can hire a student and pay them a lot less per mile than I was making. I was a very loyal employee till they threw me to the wolves, watch your back at this company."
bad,I was stuck in a motel and they wanted me to stay there in a hotel for more than two weeks away from my family not do doing anything with no food and no money  for food
bad,"Drove out of Hazleton Pennsylvania .I drove up and down the East coast from Morgan Town, West Virginia and up to New York city and a few trips to Michigan. Plus I learned to read a highway map."
bad,"Your a number. People don't know you. Sort of like being in jail. Your on the road. They do have many locations and have allot of work. Low pay, $500 a"
bad,they make it seem fun but it is not. most drivers should not have a license. if you are not moving you are making no money. if your load is delayed a day you loose a day of pay. management could care less if you a stuck for a load without any food.
bad,Very hard and long driving hours and low pay. That's why I quit in one year. Most of the CDL driving that drove for Target DCS quit at the same time.
bad,"dispatchers yelling, google directiond to big trucks which the company knows are either wrong and or dangerous, trucks never maintained, not enough compensation for time and no benifits"
bad,"Enjoyed driving a truck. Liked doing a good job daily.Good trainer. Good customers.  Learned alot about driving safe, being alert, most people I talked with at werner were good to talk to. My fleet maniger was angry most of the time. The hardest parts of my job were on the road 28 days or more at a time. Trying to talk to the boss when no loads were coming. Im a very good worker,willing to do all jobs.I get along with almost everone.Im not a complainer.All and all I had great training at werner enterprises.I thank them for that."
bad,all I can say is I hated it here.  even with experience they start you out between .26-.29 cpm.  no real potential for advancement and poor driver relations.
bad,I got the job in 2008 and the only plus side was the dispatcher that i had on the 3m account. The hardest part of the job was dealing witht thier maintinance program in general. They take frever to get any maintinance done whatsoever.
bad,This company has issues. Not getting paid for all the driving that WE do.
bad,"There local accounts pay complete trash. I asked for more milage runs but they said they cannot do anything for me. When I asked for more pay, they said your benefits is you get home very often. If you have no experience then go slave at a company like Werner. If you have experience,  run fast"
bad,Werner is a decent starter company but the pay is terrible my paychecks range between $300-900 a week. Miles are non-existant averaging 1100-1500 Miles a week and that's on a 48 States account. Their Trucks are nice but unfortunately have no Inverters or APU's. Dispatchers are useless.
bad,"A good enough company to get qualified as a solo driver. After you get your time in and can go elsewhere, go! It is a driver school now and they feel like experienced drivers are replaceable so if you complain they will release you."
bad,"I have found this company to be very unprofessional and little to no help from your management. They seem to blame everyone else for their lack of drive and trying to get the job done correctly and or professionally. After working many years in a corporate environment, I have just never seen such a lack of taken reasonability for your own action and lack of wanting to help and teach others."
bad,You will get the miles on a dedicated account.  Not on 48 state.  No sense of a home life at all.  Constant issues with safety department who sits behind a desk and has no real sense of what goes on.  I have a clean safety record and still had multiple issues with them putting holds on me.
bad,"They take trainee drivers almost exclusively, and you’re paid accordingly.  Barely enough to live on and you’re on the road 28+ days a month.  Lots of detention time is unreimbursed and lower pay for empty miles."
bad,they treat you as a number not as family they always want you to keep going and never ask how do you feel they treat you like animals when we are human beings
bad,"This was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. I went to trucking school and the I got sent out from Sacramento,CA to Fontana,CA and just that alone was a lot I wasn't ready for what was coming my way. The was and the life of a truck driver is very rugged and hard core just to say the lest to all the other truck driver that you meet and the way you sleep and the way you take showers and the way you just live just ingeneral was to much for me I mist being home I did get home sick and motion sick from the truck never stopping it's for some people but not for me the best of luck to who ever wants to give it a shot."
bad,"It was my first job with my CDL licenses. The training didn't go so well like I thought it would be. The third training that I had,  had a bad attitude, didn't like to wash, etc."
bad,Just as a normal day you go pick up your load delivery it. At time you may have to wait now that part is not fun cause you not making money. To many DM trying to tell you what to do and cause delays in you get your next load. When you want to get home you will be about 3 days later than planned. You not make much money when you have all your endorsement inculding twic and passport.
bad,"This company will run you to the absolute limit the law allows, or not at all."
bad,deliver loads of electronics to best buy stores. help best buy employees unload product and load returns. it was a good job. werner does not offer any paid holidays no weekends off and there was no advancement available.
bad,i didnt like the job driving for dollar general its bad they dont care about the driver and the products
bad,"Management does not back you up, makes decisions and fails to notify you of them. "
bad,A very great place to work. The people are great. A job where you can see the country.
bad,alot of huury up and wait
bad,Company will tell you what you want to hear..Till you are employed with them.........Saftey is not a concern.....On dollar genral account.............
bad,"It is chaos all the time, you have to stay on them about everything.  They don’t seem to care about you as a person.  Other drivers try to get other drivers in trouble.  Trailers are in sad shape."
bad,"Make Werner your last option as a driver, they care little for drivers, I spent 9 days in breakdown in my first 2 months no one would get me into another truck, same problems with truck every time, the kid who ""fixed"" the problem with my Qualcomm was an oil change tech at a Chrysler dealership 2 weeks prior! This place is a joke. I started on 48 state dry van spent most of time sitting and waiting for loads, now I'm on tcu and the loads are better but the truck is broke down again."
bad,"They spend their money on Trucks, Trailers, Terminals and Training. That doesn't leave enough to make as much as you can with other companies. My home time was frequently not honored, even when I was less than an hour from my house. They switch driver managers if you have anything to deal with, and give you the newest, least experienced one who will defer to the rules and their supervisor instead of knowing how to think things through"
bad,"From the start, they are a mess. Orientation is good, but getting you to a trainer is a long process, most trainers don’t care or teach you anything at all, than once you are done with training and you get something wrong that you didn’t learn, is on you. Fleet managers are all over the place, average 2200 miles a week, if you translate it, is like working for $9.50 a hour. This is a good place to get experience and leave, .38 cpm is not enough for you to survive."
bad,no comment it was not a good place to work so that is why i did not want to comment on this question it does no good to talk bad about a company i would just never refer anyone to them
bad,"The days are long for most accounts. Any Dollar accounts (Family dollar, Dollar General) are TRASH! A lot of accounts such as coke account, home depot, flat bed, and dollar accounts  are VERY UNDER PAID. The Coke account needs new management all around. I worked for Werner for 4 years and the company has went down hill since.  "
bad,"IT DID'NT TAKE LONG FOR ME TO GET THE CULTURE HERE. THE MANAGEMENT STYLE IS TACKY, TRASHY, AND THIEVISH. plenty of henchmen willing to screw you from Management to dispatch and even the shop. office staff gives off a Vapid vibe, leaving plenty of room for phony. If you are an assertive experienced driver who's seeking to find a suitable division don't! Stepping outside of your assigned  Werner box. And they'll give you  little to no miles and Hold ups on your loads. "
bad,The company offered fair compensation and benefits.   The truck provided was clean and in good condition.  The organization and communication between fleet mangers and drivers was good.
bad,"Typical driver work."
bad,"A baseline company in the industry, an easy place to get started and develop credentials to take elsewhere. Uniformly low wages for driving and training positions."
bad,"good job nice people"
bad,"good employees, not much advancement in company to become management. ran a front loader , worked for body shop for close to 10 years then switched to fleet sales mechanic shop. the pay was decent but the raises were poor."
bad,"Long 10-11 hr. days, valuable work experience, a lot of micromanagement from supervisors on up, pleasant co-workers.  Overall, a very negative work environment with very little reward."
bad,"You'll have to become a trainer to make any money with this company, they'll send you students that make you wonder how they even tied there shoes in the morning, you'll be running a lot with zero sleep due to the students inability to drive."
bad,It's a good job if you don't have a lot of bills to pay and if you want experience. As a student you will not make much at all and once you finish you still won't make as much as you can make somewhere else. But it's good for learning although trainers could be impatient. They will use you for miles.
bad,push us to keep making ladders at ridiculous numbers. machines always broken never has supply we need to finish the job.
bad,job sucked your just a number to management hardly any time off. only good thing i have to say about them is that they gave me plenty of practice driving a big rig and helped me figure out that i did not want to do that for a living.
bad,The supervisor made it impossible to advance/transfer out of the dept so if you tried to transferred the supervisor would find a reason to write you up so you couldnt.
bad,The boss are out for one thing only and that is it them self. i would never tell enbody about this job...
bad,I would be gone from home months at a time and only was compensated only 300 dollars a week.  It was not ethical anymore.
bad,No value for their drivers and offered me work more than 30 days after training? Bills couldn't wait that long!
bad,a trainer should have more than 3mo experience. You should be able to go home during a family medical crisis.
bad,defensive driving skills long hours on the road meeting people from different ethnic backgrounds learning how to handle the big rig.
bad,"Drove 11 hrs a day, every day. 48 states and Canada. I stayed out at least a month at a time. They wouldn't let me go home without a battle. I liked my dispatchers. The supervisors were terrible people.."
bad,"Safety was always a concern on the Dollar General account  Trailers were frequently overweight, maintenance issues, shop slow making repairs.  Werner was more worried about keeping the account than addressing the safety issues. Still the account with the most driver injuries."
bad,"I worked as a tractor trailer driver cross country. It was nice seeing different parts of the US. However, after coming back they tried to put me on a job that required unrealistic expectations of any driver. They told me before taking the job that I would be lifting a lot of boxes, but I found out when doing the job it was 4000 packages a delivery. By the time I was done I was physically exhausted. They did not have any other jobs available after that."
bad,"Werner runs you hard. Running g you out of all your dot hours fast. Then having to split with someone to get the load there ontime.bimuy, having the fleet mgr run you out of dot time time and again is not good mgmt. the drivers suffer from getting burnt out quick."
bad,Company changes rules after you comply. .leaves driver stuck at shop. Treats drivers poorly. Unless you turn other drivers in. Unsure when you get to go home. Loads on time time with family when ever. Pass d o t medical. Company doctor or safety says no . suspended with out pay. Now you abandoned truck now no more truck driven for you.
bad,"You will be lucky to have a goo fleet manager "
bad,"long days of b.s from every direction, trainer was a pig and filthy, $400 a week was not enough to even provide much of my own items for living,equipment broke within the first week o training and we got blamed for it"
bad,"Good job just to start wrenching career, but no job advancement or proper training. Have to beg for raises that never come. False promises with pay raises and job advancement. Shop consist of favouritism no equality.  Horrible previous managment but new manager is very fair and helpful but he still cant provide any advancements."
bad,"They could have been more honest about the companies they hire out to. Way too much micromanagement on experienced drivers. They need to contain those practices to the students."
bad,"Do not want to pay very competive, and want to u do do things that will not pay extra. Will not route u like they say they will when needed.had to fight for every mile I could get"
bad,"Did not pay well or took care of drivers,set a lot  and did not get home when I was supposed to ever. no vacation time and kept in one area dispatch could not get good loads that had good miles."
bad,"Werner is in the business of bringing on new drivers and on the premise of driver training. Instead they keep you out on the road for 4 times the amount of training hours they require to get your own truck. meanwhile paying you slave wages and keeping you away from home for multiple weeks at a time. meanwhile you are going broke,  bills are stacking up.You are away from your family and totally miserable! !!!!!! They really took advantage of we and left me out to dry. Horrible operation! !!!"
bad,NO real advancement unless you work on a Dollar account or are a trainer or team. they treat solo drivers like whatever.  get that experience then leave.
bad,"I love driving for Werner, but the management was unfair at times. There was no job security or any loyalty to the company drivers. None of us were advance to management position."
bad,"Okay full disclosure, I was terminated from this company.  but I do promise you that I was ready to quit if they didn't.  This company, as big as it is, refuse to pay their drivers.  they just see you as a number and can care less for anything going on in your life.  Now their are some people who are cool there but the opposites beat out the rest."
bad,Good place to start off at but fleet management turnover is very high and those who come are not trained properly and lack understanding of truck driving!
bad,"Although this job allowed me to see many places I had not seen before, the inside office personnel left a lot to be desired.  Open-ended promises were made as far as home time and the dispatchers never made that happen."
bad,Its a truckers life. The only true objection for me was that a dispatcher treated me in an unacceptable way and the company didn't/wouldn't do anything about it. Dispatchers have no real trucking/on-the-road  experience so they expect you to drive and do illegal things to meet deliveries. I am a family man first and this lifestyle was not conducive to a long time family man.
bad,i hated working for this company. they treat u badly over work you and pay you next to nothing. i can make more money working fast food
bad,This company is a training company and only cares about getting the student through the training period.. No growth advancement opportunity. Freight is limited.
bad,Distributing goods from different areas  across the U.S. either delivering or picking up products.  I learned how to be able to multi-task. The hardest part is showing up for a delivery and the receiving store is not ready nor do they have the room to receive the products.
bad,"Working dedicated account is very hard work, long hours, and they will cheat one out of their just compensation as a normal way of doing business."
bad,"i could not make any money with them. dispatchers are the worst,ever!! they dont care about you,at all!!!"
bad,The most enjoyable part of traveling was meeting new people from other states
bad,they do not want you to go home. I had to leave because my daughter was being born and they tried to make me work.
bad,I was disqualified because one of the recruiters ignored the fact that I did not meet the qualifications to be hired and hired me anyway.
bad,"Hi expectations, minimal support.  Particular dedicated account I drove for had some routes that paid fairly well and some that averaged penny's an hour when scheduled to deliver 20 miles away  with multiple stops scheduled on different days."
bad,"Good starter company but once you realize your worth you’ll be looking for another job! Definitely on the job hunt right now. Home daily is nice but I work nights so still barely get to see my family. Pay is garbage but the dispatch acts like it’s good pay. Would love to see them in our shoes for a week, and see why we hate the job."
bad,Good way to see the country. It's a lifestyle change and most people can't handle it. I only could for a year. Home time sucked. You get paid good if you run good. Forced dispatch was annoying going in downtown LA and long island NY first couple of months ever driving. They are very good about letting you make a decision if you feel safe to drive.
bad,Upper management was very nice along with safety. They treated me very well. Manager was detached from what drivers go through and he appeared to have favorites. (Getting proffered loads). When asked how to improve he danced around the subject. Pay is only decent if you become a driver trainer. If you want to be left alone then your pay will suffer. They do not teach their trainers people skills or care if they lack in this department.
bad,"The pay is not great. They will screw you over, make it hard for you to get another job when you leave. I’m a veteran, us my G.I. Bill, they screwed me over bad. I can’t get unemployment because of that. They will make anything you do an accident. Wish I didn’t use my school money for this company. I did 9 years in the army, now I can’t get another driving job because of them."
bad,"Paycheck hit the 1k mark twice in 6 months while being away from my family 3 weeks at a time, the rest of my Friday nightmares were $600, $500, $250, $700"
bad,Werner burns it’s drivers. They mostly hire from truck driving schools so they can exploit the naive students. They do not stand by their drivers in accidents even if DOT issues a no fault status. Do not drive for Werner
bad,"I had 2 trainer in two month barely spoke English and one was obsessed with clean, who called me names and put me down because 'I was too stupid to do the job' to a student learning. The other would horde urine bottles, barely shower and didnt do my observation hours while he chatted on the phone in French. Plus both had me on the top bunk while they drove, no straps and me bouncing around.  I didnt know better. Reported them both and....recently saw them. They are still employed with new trainees."
bad,"Horrible account. Your days may consist of waiting 2-3 hrs for a load but they don’t start paying you after you have been waiting for 3 hrs. Which means you’ll be paid on the fourth hr. If you’ve been waiting for too long they try every excuse to make you stay. It’s days where I have seen guys waiting for 5 hrs. You don’t know where you are going until you get the load. They claim you have to work your “shift” when it’s convenient for them to say but they will give you a load that will have you back after your shift. Between waiting, driving and dealing with slow stores, you’re averaging like $12/hr. They try to force loads on you. They don’t care whether you are sick or tired, which is illegal. It’s also illegal to force someone to sit at their job for 3 hrs and not get paid."
bad,"managers have NO experience with the department they run, people that train drivers have never driven a truck and have no idea how to teach and are more concerned about how they are viewed by coporate"
bad,I got the job straight out of trucking school so for that I thought the job wasn't as bad. Checks were low but not bad for not having any experience. Spent a lot of time away from home. Had to drive for a week to have 1 day of home time.
bad,"It's a mill for rookie drivers. My trainers had terrible hygiene. I was a truck number. I was treated only as an asset, not a human being. Very stressful work environment"
bad,Low pay equals no drivers. Everybody should quit and move on to better paying companies. The cost of living is higher and this company is raping its employees. But I guess that how the big wigs sleep at night. SMH.
bad,I enjoyed my job but my manager was not fair. He would not help cover loads and demanded that I did regardless if thee were any available or not. He would yell and scream.
bad,Werner Enterprises is a joke. the training is great they pay 300$ a week to train for 6 to 7 weeks. after the training they recommend u team up with someone only to pay u 0.12 a mile and give u very little loads. when we first got a truck it was falling apart had numerous dot violations and my teammate ended up getting a citation for it.
bad,"This company makes more money training new drivers and turning them over then they do on there pickups and deliveries."
bad,"Spent 8 Months at Werner...."
bad,"Morning management as far as safety lane was unfair and verbally abusive. Did not allow breaks, not even the 15 mins required."
bad,my time at werner was one of long hours followed by short breaks and very little to show for it. I find that the company was far more onsider with lining its pockets then helping it workers. very sad to say the least. And my dispatcher was a real pain to say the very least.
bad,Was out to train with another person for two months with no home time.  Also with very limited experience behind the wheel was sent to places where more experience drivers needed to drive.
bad,Only use this company from gaining experience. You will not get rich with this company. Worked here for way too long. You are just a truck and a number with this company.
bad,once recruits make it through training they are in such need of money they will do anything to make some and out of a home usually.lkdgfrmslrjg;oaserjgtoae;ijgo;njbgo;dnfoierhgoisejrgosdno;igenrgiohdfoibnso;bhnso;drighnsro;ighsnr;nhsro;nso;erignso;egrn;seoigrnoseirgn
bad,"I worked for this company a long time, gained some experience. However,  they are very picky who they let advance. The better you are at your current job, the less likely you are going to move up in the company."
bad,company needs new management and continuously lies to its employees
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of load planning to find quick and easy routes so I could pick up and make deliveries in a timely manner. I learned so much with this job! I learned things such as time management, organization skills, communication skills, and route planning. The most difficult part of this job was being away from my family for a month at a time. The most enjoyable part about over the road truck driving was being able to see most of the United States and going to places i never thought I could. I also enjoyed knowing every day I had a safe trip it saved lives. There wasn't much contact with co-workers but when I saw other drivers they were always friendly and helpful. I was to work with my managers and had a good relationship until I was asked to do something I felt was unsafe or was against my work ethics. I wasn't willing to break the law or do anything I felt wasn't safe for myself, the equipment, or the general public."
bad,there was no regard for the driver. Tried to make me go over my hour an had no regard for saftey
bad,Driving across the eastern regional states hauling freight.
bad,"Good company but .Managers need a lot to look for drivers as human beins,.not as a number"
bad,Turn over is quite high. The training was not what was communicated.
bad,Management doesn't care at all about their workers. If you don't try to speak to them they won't speak to you. You'll get sent out on the road with no clue how to do most of what is required of you aside from the lackluster training you get.
bad,Couldn't quite seem to get my pay right after training which was salaried. Poor load planning and poor communication between dispatch and drivers made for an extremely difficult operation.
bad,Stay away from Dollar General account. This account does not care about the drivers. They just throw loose cargo on top. Heavy items fall leak or injure you. Load bottom product with lifts and except you to unload 400 lbs or more. Even store employees complain about cargo and how hard it is to move. Also places where stores are located no semis should have been introduced to.
bad,"Dedicated delivery account for 1.5 yrs.  Trailers often in need of repair, consistently overweight, and customers rarely prepared or compliant.  Werner upper mgmt. seems determined to maintain deniability at all times to issues. ...presumably so as not to jeopardize the contract.  Drivers will likely learn to dodge weigh stations and learn minor trailer lift repairs or lose 30% pay weekly"
bad,It’s a job can’t complain no job is the best job but it’s what put food on the table to feed my family. Even though it did keep me gone away from my family alot
bad,"Long hours, lower pay, high expectations with inadequate training.(the positive) If you’re a keep your head down do your job type of person you can have a long steady career there."
bad,"They pay well but at the end of the day, it's trucking. very little home time, long-distance hauls.  trucks were nice and well maintained but you are just another worker bee here."
bad,"Management is concerned only with the bottom line regardless of the human cost. Pay is mediocre; a 2% increase for an ""excellent"" performance review is considered a gift. Upper managers will ask for honest feedback then use it against employees. A very stressful, emotionally exhausting company to work at. After 19 years and the recommendation of doctor, it became apparent the toxic environment was affecting my health and it was time to leave."
bad,I would work long hours with this company and they would always mess up my pay then make me wait till next pay period to get my money. I would request my days for home time a month in advance and they would never get me home when i asked always 1-3 days late and they would blame it on me. I spoke with my dispatch and their supervisor and was always told it would get better and it never did.
bad,Just get your experience and find something local.......That’s all I recommend. Nothing more to say. Just keep in mind you run 48 states you don’t make good money.
bad,"Don't have enough time to get delivered , because truck breakdowns . Then lie about termination  and say you quit the job. Everyone that works for Warner fill betrayed."
bad,I like the traveling part of the job. But the rest of it was to much to deal with. I had problems with my fleet manager most of the time. It's just a very stressful job.
bad,"In this job I work in Canada acount for Werner enterprise, I am in my job a sefty person responsible never be late always on time with very nice reputation"
bad,"Only for students. The truth is  that almost all companies lie when hiring, mabe thats way each year there are fewer people interested in become a truck drive, my advise, make a very good reserch before chooising a company"
bad,"no miles and pay was not great.  equipment stayed tore down more than running.  Management team was not good to work with, did not want to hear what the driver had to say"
bad,"I don't really like this experience at Werner, because I deserve more ,after 7 good years working with a big company like Werner, every year you make almost the same salary"
bad,its a good place to start but im not sure if its a place for long term employment. a typical day is just driving a route thats what they set not what you've chosen.
bad,"You have work 6 days a week twice the loads to get paid good on this home daily account. If not, your subjected to fail at making any good money to afford your bills on a weekly salary in  my opinion. Just do not think any driver should make less than average of 900-1,000 a weekly net pay at any company."
bad,"Pay is on a sliding scale and on forced loads. Fleet Manager controls your pay. Their pay conversation is always based on the top of the scale , but it is not explained to you that your fleet manager controls what loads you carry, if your relationship with him or her is not good, your loads will not be(political)."
bad,the training was not what i expected i dident learn very much thereit turned out to be a company for me there trucks were ok the culture need some work
bad,"Horrible Flatbed department, rude people, below average pay (29 cpm), nothing was as promised by the recruiter (I should have known better), and no apologies for anything they screwed up on, never can admit they are wrong."
bad,"very poor company to work for . poor weekend dispatch and regular dispatch had too many favorate upper management very hard to get to talk to and never seem to see your side of the story, when i was on dedicated it was good but not otr"
bad,"Working for Werner Enterprises was horrible career move but personally it helped me tremendously. The pay was constantly fluctuating so you never really knew what you where getting paid, I could not get home time when requested, I had never been in with such a cut throat group of people (other drivers) in my life...and I came from the car business!"
bad,We are scheduled to log up to 11 hours a day. We wake up around 6 and complete trips pre-assigned to us by our managers. The most difficult part of the job was getting trucks that were not road ready or trucks that easily broke down. The most enjoyable part was being able to see the United States.
bad,"I would come in every morning to move freight and not have freight on our board. Werner Enterprises frieght was hidden from Account Manager and given to her Husband to work on. Management knew and was scared to address it. The Management in office played games on their cell phones all day, everyday.  I would sit there majority the whole day with nothing to do.  NO Advancing in the Chicagoland office."
bad,Company did not tell the truth to new drivers when they were hired.  Promised drivers weekends off and high pay but was not true.  Turnover rate was high due to bait and switch tactics.
bad,"After getting my CDL A I chose this company to provide my training, they have one of the best programs to prepare you for real life work experiences. However, pay is terrible while you are training, it's close to minimum wage if not less than that since they pay you by the mile rather than hours worked. You are only given pay while the truck is moving, any time spent at shippers/receivers is not paid. Though I drove upwards of 70hrs a week I actually worked close to 90hrs a week. After I completed my training I wanted to work as a team driver but they refused to let me work with the partner of my choosing so we both quit and went to a different company."
bad,very confusing  wasn't very professional very unorganized hardest part of the job was the learning of parking the tractor trailer and waiting on the shipper to fill out the information
bad,"I was an OTR Driver with Werner, and I drove all over the country and Canada. If Werner would put more money into driver pay packages and less on all these super fancy terminals life might have been better... for the driver anyways. I only left because of shag loads. Was tired of getting them... and the company doesn't compensate OTR drivers fairly while doing them. Actually I feel they abuse the services of OTR drivers by making us do the work of local drivers, but not paying us properly for it. So I left."
bad,"I loved the trainer and I learned a lot from him. I loved driving the truck. I did not like driving for them when I got with my teammate. I was from a small town in North Carolina and they wanted to me to stay up in NB, driving in cold weather that I was not use to driving in. I learned real quick that I did not want to drive for them."
bad,Its a good company tho my training was invalid it was more like just a teams run. They did not train me to be a good sólo driver. The trucks are good all in all i just dont beleave they have good trainors.
bad,"I enjoy driving, meeting new people, traveling from place to place. seeing the difference with drivers and their personalities however fleet managers/dispatchers do not always have your best interest at heart"
bad,"Be prepared to do a lot of sitting around at truck stops. The weekend dispatchers do not have a clue of what they are doing. You get no miles and the pay sucks. You wont be moving much freight, youll be chasing and hunting down empty trailers. The people are ok but some fleet managers just dont care about the drivers. It really sucks how you get treated."
bad,Pretty good company with not so good job selections and management that should be monitored regularly  with guidelines enforced through out the board  evenly and and communicate more. Between dedicated accounts to make it better for the driver the only good part about it is the work out
bad,"You are in charge of 65 drivers that want answers ""this second"" when they call in to be dispatched on their loads and there is a bad chain of command where you ask for have to ask 4 different people to get those questions they have taken care of. Payroll and every other person will ask you to ""refer to your fleet manager"" almost to pass the buck and not help the cause. When you want to take a break, you come back with a million problems that weren't solved and you realize you shouldn't have taken a break anyways."
bad,Moving product to Dollar General was fun.  It was my first trucking job  learned a lot on my own. traveled to different cities met good people.
bad,this company doesn't want to pay employees for the jobs done. I felt like I had to fight for my paycheck or continually check my slips to make sure I was being paid correctly.
bad,run delivery from different places. drop orders to different companies and give good customer servicer to people. make sure that the truck is in good working condition.
bad,Werner drivers are the lowest compensated drivers in the business.  The equipment needs to be updated and maintenance needs improvement.  And dispatch needs improvement.
bad,"Expect to be watched like a hawk. You will be ran into the ground, they don't care. No APUs, no inverters, no cooking in the truck. Terrible quality of life for all drivers."
bad,"Some of the dispatchers were great. Some of them not so much. I had a dispatcher who was great. When I had an emergency at home, he made sure I got home. "
bad,"Sometimes an opportunity sounds really good, but doesn't meet your expectations. This Job was one of those times. I decided to come off the road to be a local driver for this position and found out very quickly that it was not what I had expected it to be. The management was not friendly and the other drivers were not nice to other genders or races. it was a very uncomfortable place to work."
bad,"a typical work day"
bad,"after a 4 month experience of OTR with Werner, I now have had kidney infection which is about gone."
bad,Werner is a good company for new drivers.I only lasted three weeks because they lied to me.
bad,Setting at terms are at site I learn coming straight out of trucking school you get the jobs that really don't as much lol management could have been a little better the hardest part about this job is the start up pay co workers are not that nice I guess because of that pay thing the thing I like about this job is that I got the chance to see how bad it could really be..
bad,Transport materials in 53' trailor within network lane...
bad,"I'm a woman just starting out, & I have to say, I was impressed in the beginning, now, not so much. Only making around 300 bucks a week, & away from home alot!!  I love traveling, just don't like the fact that this company promises a bunch of things, & doesn't deliver!! I just have to say, where's the BIG BUCK'S?? After I get my experience, I'm going to look for someone who actually cares. There motto is Werner cares, I'd like to know where at in the driver's lives do they care?? When I bumped into a man that his wife was only born with one kidney, & cancer is attacking it. That poor man is working to keep his wife alive!! Wonder how much there paying him per mile?? And he hadn't eaten for 3 day's!! I had to give him some food!!  God be with this man & bless him & his wife that's on her death bed!! And ""Werner Cares""?? Please!!"
bad,"a typical drivers experience, and I had issues communicated with management. they did have plenty of freight"
bad,"Poor management, they just let you go by releasing student drivers on the road."
bad,"what else can i say as a truck driver, but truck life is all raod and safety."
bad,I never saw home for 5 months. So I quit.  Gave up my CDL after that.
bad,for a big company there was no miles to drive.Management was poor
bad,"I had a good dm and I liked their saftey people .But the rest of the people dont have no personalitly, I try to get on another board and was told that there was none.I was told what I had to run not what I wanted. I believe that everyone should be respected."
bad,"Testing and situations changed as often,i learned what to expect and not to expect.Management not to understanding in some areas of the drivers challenges on the rode.NO hardly with co-workers,having patient with non-profesional drivers from different part of the nation.I enjoyed traveling."
bad,"Company tells your one thing and does something different for example with pay, benifits and time off."
bad,"they dont care, got tired of my truck breaking down the.traing was sub par.they take short cuts and rush you throw the training."
bad,Simple i would like to come home every night and not stay in Tractor.
bad,I was in training to be a Company Driver. It was a adversial work environment. Trainers never mentioned a sense of direction for me to understand my progress.
bad,This is a great place to get at least 6 months of OTR under your belt and move on. It is not set up for you to advance so get experience and find a better company.
bad,"good stating company, my opinion. Pay is low to other companies."
bad,"Training was trouble, took me 4 months, 3 trainers quit before I even got on their truck.  Managers did not care wanted to go home and would not let me off the truck, said could not remove the load.  Just my experience some of the trainees I met did not have a hard time like me., But think do not care"
bad,I learn a lot of new stuff learn how to use the Qualcomm but the hardest thing was having to stay overnight at a shipper and having to reroute but I love driving trucks
bad,"Management doesn't work and care about employees it's all about the load, you can drive a lot miles and your paycheck gonna be the same, under $1000,00 a week...."
bad,"If you are new to the trucking industry I suggest you sign up with Werner. Their training program is excellent and will have you driving like a professional in no time. There are several things I didn't like about Werner and that's why I didn't stay long. I was treated like a number overall while I was there and I worked for the Dollar General account. "
bad,"I'm relatively new to the Ferguson account but I've learned in a short time that not many in VA knows what's going on or maybe they just don't care. I've been lied to too may time to count and asked or told to do things that just don't add up. In other word ""forget you just get the load there on time"" and oh yeah ""I never said that"""
bad,"This place pays so little it's ridiculous.  Once you get enough time in, leave as soon as possible.  All you do is work, and God help you if you take the Dollar accounts, because you are going to unload that trailer, by hand, by yourself, with no help mechanically or otherwise.  the on board computer will hit the brakes for you for every car that is making a right hand turn in front of you.  It just slams on the brakes.  You have to call your dispacth over every little thing that the computer senses you did wrong.  Hit the brakes a little too hard?  Call dispatch.  Turn a little too tight?  Call dispatch.  Or they call you, because that computer will keep going off till one you calls and finds out why the computer went off.  Truck breaks down?  No replacements, you just sit without work till it's done.  Here's the big thing as well.  God help you if something goes wrong.  They have safety managers who run to the DMV to get whatever you just did on your record.  They can't keep a driver for the life of them, so they screw your driving record over with chargable accidents.  Have a retread tire blow out?  Chargable accident.  Hit a pot hole and put a dent in the rim?  Chargable accident.  It's a starter company that won't let you leave."
bad,dispatch did not give enough driving time. Standing  2-3 days unpaid provided a minimum paycheck. Despite the fact I was never late for any of my deliveries.
bad,"Good learning curve for beginners like me. 5 months in and I hate it here. Fleet manager sucks. They don't pay attention to your miles so you may end up with 1500 miles at the end of the week. I'm dictated Goodman route and it sucks. Now if you want to be home every 2 weeks and don't like running this for you, but you like running and want miles then don't come here"
bad,"Pay isn't quite high enough. I run a team truck and dont make any more than I did running solo. Manager is great but HR sucks, a clerical error left my teammate unable to drive, and when I called to complain the HR lady said, and I quote verbatim: ""Well, you made good money last week."" Only problem is this is a team truck and we ended up stranded a few hours from home because Werner messed up."
bad,poor pay but good for new driver or driver with no experience  long day behind wheel with most likely a co driver or trainer. dispatch are pretty good
bad,"Entry level drivers get hired, but they don't pay well. turnover rate is high. Good facilities, but should spend more money on keeping their drivers paid for breakdown, layovers, and detention. If they REALLY DID PAY THESE THINGS, I would have never left werner. Nice trucks, but that doesn't mean much when your not getting home, or getting paid. I moved onto a company that pays all of these things, and within 6 months, I made more than I did in years average driving for them"
bad,Sit down and make calls all day. No room for advancement. No direction. Weekly meetings discussing company improvement. Waste of time because nothing was implemented. Very disorganized.
bad,"sometimes sit for hours, many drivers assigned to 1 fleet manager, fleet manager always on phone, after fleet manager leaves for the day, night dispatch sucks and doesn't know anything."
bad,Werner Maintenance is as secure a job as you can have work isn't hard management is easy to get along with pay is mid range to low no advancement possible
bad,"With Werner Enterprises, you can start your trucking career, but there's not much advancement once you get beyond that.I started my career there, and I started at 0.28 cents per mile loaded and 0.15 cents per mile deadhead. This was and is, my worst experience as a  truck driver."
bad,"Expect to drive the 3 months on netops for very small runs, "
bad,"I learn not to trust recluters,in this company you was only a number, you don't interact with co-workers,you away from home a lot,nothing to enjoy here,day at work heavy and long"
bad,A typical day at work was getting my loads there on time and I learned that everything isnt always as easy as they seem and the managment was not what it was supposed to be my co-worker was the best I could have thats why I stayed with the company as long as I did. The hardest part of my job was the hooking and unhooking of the trailers the most enjoyable part of the job was traveling from state to state seeing new things.
bad,"drive to exhaustion "
bad,"this is a company who will hire any ""Joe"" off of the street regardless of past history. They treat the experienced drivers the same as new students so the general public does the same, which creates to much friction between all parties for a productive work environment."
bad,"I've done truck and trailer maintanence. Mostly minor. I also help customers get a truck that will help move whatever furniture they have. I learned the basics of pretrip inspections on a truck. The hardest thing about the job is the customers. A lot of customers are upset due to personal reasons, and they take their fustration out on other people. The enjoyable part of the job is doing maintenance, because time goes by quick when your hands on"
bad,I was dedicated to Family dollar stores. I would take a loaded trailer home on Friday night and be at the first store with at least ten hours before I was due to go on duty.
bad,Not enough pay. Detention pay and breakdown pay isn't enough. Home time is never guaranteed. Not enough miles to be on a OTR/48 states account. Overall just not satisfied.
bad,Decent e we equipment dispatch rides you keeps you busy if things are going there way your good if not your in trouble they expect you to be on time even if you don't have the hrs to make it when they give you your load
bad,After I got my CDL Class A I was hired by Werner to be a OTR driver for the lower 48 states. I picked up loads from shippers and delivered them across the country to consignees.
bad,"Where to start... the hours.  Due to DOT regulations, I could only drive 12 hours per day, then have a mandatory 10 hours off.  This meant that my hours were constantly in flux, with no set schedule to sleep.  The pay was .32 cents per mile, which is low, and I only got that much because I agreed to stay on the road 5 weeks at a time, with only 5 days off in between.  Just a really tough job hours wise, and the pay just wasn't enough to compensate for it."
bad,"You are offered the world during training. Once training is done, The initial offered suddenly is no longer available and you are placed in a position that nobody wants. Went OTR and was fine for the first few weeks until they made me do a SHAG Run (where you go 20 miles out, spend 4-5 hours loading/unloading and 20 miles back to terminal) which only paid $0.35 (yes 35 cents) for the miles ($14) for the day."
bad,"No pay progression.The longer you are there you still get same pay as new employee. Your yearly bonuses do increase every year the longer you are with the company,"
bad,Constantly driving long hours which I dont mind at all but atleast I wanna make money doing it hardly had any loads to florida so it was hard to get home and relax and be with my family
bad,"Spent way too much time sitting wasting your clock,no detention pay, no one seemed to care, no respect giving in those regards. treated like a number,Werner's mission statement is Werner cares,as a company this may be true but in dealing with the individual, dispatchers planners, and so on this a out and out lie ."
bad,Just so happens Werner is one of the trucking companies that specifically caters to graduates straight out of school. Because of this your compensation will be low at first and adjusting to the lifestyle of constantly being on the road is difficult.
bad,"Werner tells you what you want to hear to get you to work, but never follows through. You will not be home for two days. You will unload unsafe deliveries."
bad,Driving trucks over the road gave me experience being in different states all over the united states. Working with this company made me see how different the states is. Becoming a student trainer it made me see how i can teach others my skills of working.
bad,"typical workers and management"
bad,Trucks I used were poorly maintained. Management is a hit or miss got frequent new managers. Payroll dept. is very unorganized.
bad,"how to be come a successfuk truck driver, once given the chance"
bad,"I must say, my fleet manager, his assistant, and the Milton Ontario office, were very good, very nice people."
bad,there is the dollar tree account..they only pay you 15 bucks an hour. You get another $70 unloading the trailer. You’re usually unloading 3000 boxes-whole trailer. The dollar tree people are the worst people to work with. Its an easy job and no one is on your back.  Their slogan is “Werner cares”... If they cared so much how come they never give raises?? Drivers have been making $15 for the last five years.
bad,"Wasn't there long enough to give a decent review."
bad,Stay away if you have no patience don't like the run around don't mind getting your local account snatched from you don't mind driving over the road then go for it I recommend it.
bad,"Manager did not treat my situation fairly and I tried to do the correct policy and give a 2 week notice due to looking for a job in my local area but because she had another driver just leave the account and treated me poorly and telling me to turn in my truck that day and not giving me a opportunity to complete my time, so I left the company."
bad,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! This company has been the worst mistake I have ever made. Everything I was told in orientation and training was a lie from the pay to the pay back of the loan I took out for my schooling. Student Services is just as bad they do not care about the students or your well being. Drivers take no bathes and you will sleep outside of Dollar Generals parking lot instead of a truck stops. Please look for something more professional.
bad,"after I got out of truck driving school. I had no experience and they make you train anywhere from 30 days to 6 months. After training, you go to work driving and after 30 days they want you to train other new drivers. Like the blind leading the blind."
bad,"Equipment is top of the line, but the dispatchers haven't a clue to what they are doing. When you want to be OTR, they send you regional depending on where you live.  Several times, requested OTR, and they stuck me in NJ and NY, sometimes to Chicago. And the Garages, have a tendency to drill holes on the frames where no extra holes are to be. Might place Peterbuilt parts on a Volvo, and if doesnt fit, will make it fit."
bad,"The operations aspect of the job is great, enjoyable, and rewarding. The management aspect of the job is challenging and probably the hardest part of the job but the I have learned a lot with managing several people."
bad,"I hated going to terminals, seems like they wanted to keep your stuck there for a day or two.  They always kept good running trucks, but the pay at Werner Enterprises isn't great."
bad,I disliked almost every place I ever was sent to by this job but they always found u some type of work  they have good morales
bad,"Great Co-workers,  Great experiences. I learned about leadership and initiatives. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are ahead of the traffic. The hardest part of the job is when management is not working with you for their mistakes."
bad,it was hard to be an over the road driver with few miles to cover during a week
bad,"After you speak to the recruiters and they promise you great pay and great equipment it is sort of the opposite.  I was issued a melon of a vehicle where none of the equipment worked. Everytime I mentioned getting it fixed to dispatch I kept getting the run around. My vehicle would breakdown on a weekly basis and absolutely no down time pay. I was making around 300 a week my last 2 months, and it was not worth being away from home and left"
bad,"This company have excellent training, and excellent benefits. But I wait in hotel for trainer more than 23 days. I don't have time for eat, I wait more than 24 hours for load information. The truck smell bad, smoke odor. I never smoke. Before I quit, my driver side mirror felt in the highway. I wait 5 days for the mirror. This company paid only 26 cents per mile in northeast account. Other company paid 35 cents in the same region. The true Werner don't care the employee. Werner care itself. That's it."
bad,I loved the job. I hated how I was treated by the company. I was not payed at the rate I agreed to upon hiring and I worked longer periods away from home than I was supposed to.
bad,"My experience with the company was pleasant while with my trainer. However, after I was in my own truck I was extremely disappointed. I spent a great deal of my service hours at shippers waiting for loads which were not ready yet. Often, they had to finish making the product to load my truck. This resulted in me making more money while I was training. I was only solo-driving for a couple months....but, being away from home was not worth less than $500/wk take-home"
bad,I was driving 3100 miles a week with Warner as a solo driver and I was getting paid $0.29 a mile I was getting my load there on time and everything and they told me they couldn't pay me no more cuz insurance wouldn't let them do that that's a bunch of bulshit plus they trucks was governed at 65 miles an hour
bad,"Unfortunately, my experience was not a good one with Werner.  Was on hold for long periods when I needed help.  Was sent to many small hole in the wall places.  No power inverters on the trucks.  Got kicked off of dedicated runs unexpectedly."
bad,"some account are sucks to works like family dollar and dollar general too much works for the driver for the money they pays  like unloading the all trailer ,  those account are more easy to get in at Werner ."
bad,Good company but management could be better.  Need to boost morale in the work place.  The manager of that terminal is not very interactive with staff.  Staff feels very unappreciated.
bad,"Great people honest hard working in this company, but htey are over shadowed by the executives who don't care about the drivers or they're safety. Dispatchers tow the line to run you ragged to make themselves look good."
bad,This company needs to crack down on their night and weekend dispatchers so that drivers can actually get stuff done. on many occasions i had to deal with these dispatchers that had no clue what was going on.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Werner or any other starter driver company.  You won't make a fair wage and if you go through their training school, you are on the hook for 1 to 2 years on contract.  As starter companies go, they are below average in my opinion.  Lots of long hours for little pay.  Dispatch have plenty of bullying and disrespect to go around.  Dispatchers will try to make you pull a trailer that is unsafe and threaten your job if you don't comply.  Lots of unpaid waiting time.  I recommend anyone wanting to get into Trucking to get trained through a private school of your choice.  If you can't afford a private school, look into the free state program offered by most state  employment offices.  Therefore upon completion of truck driving school, you can work for whomever you desire without being under contract with them.  That whole contract thing is used as leverage by companies to hold over your head.  They mistreat you knowing most drivers will not leave before their contract is completed; or they will have to pay back the money for training.  Any starter company that has a driving school generally don't treat drivers very well.  With so many students graduating weekly, they could care less if you quit."
bad,"I was on Net Ops account home every night. My route was from OKC OK to Clarksville AR I was told I would run that every time, nope they sent me to and aroud Dallas TX. My pay was never what I was told. I came in as a qualified with over 5 year of driving and my pay was the same as someone coming out of driving school. The recruiter will lie to you just to get you on. STAY AWAY !!!!"
bad,Werner Enterprises doesn't care about you receiving in any money my time at Warner my check was 3 weeks behind it wasn't a priority on the account management come and go they get their check regardless if your truck is moving or if you have a loan so why would they care
bad,It used to be a good place to start but I felt the dispatching was bad due to split loads and low pay from truck repairs downtime and bad weather.  I didn’t feel they know anything about trucking to help driver’s learn the ropes.
bad,At times this job was okay..... Just really decided that I wanted to come off the road to spend more time at home. Enjoyed driving the truck and meeting a lot of people from all up and down the east coast!!
bad,"They take advantage of rookies and don't even pay you enough for your time as a trainee. They pressure you a lot into making deliveries which I understand, but you feel like they don't care if you're safe or not."
bad,"I was on the Walmart account in Sterling, Illinois and Werner lost the contract for the account.  Poor management and poor dispatching.  Pay was halfway decent being on a dedicated route."
bad,A workplace that teaches the values of safety. A hard and rough job that involves in any weather. With low wages for first time drivers.  Effective training is random depending on which driver is training you.
bad,"I learned a lot from this company and they continue to train and make changes to improve the business. Management was capable and knowledgeable, would pitch in and get the job done when there was a need."
bad,I enjoyed my time with the company they are concerned about employees they make sure that all employees and their families are well informed about what is going on
bad,Standard OTR driving job. The only reason I joined this company was to train my wife after she obtained her CDL. Company is lax in it's view of allowing drivers to get appropriate rest in preparation for the next day's work.
bad,"Some of the guys driving are really good people, willing to help ease you into the every day work, which is mostly driving but depending on what contract you run it could include loading and unloading a truck. Besides the potential physicality and possible stress if you're not a fan of driving close to people on the freeway its a good way to basically travel the nation for free (sort of, the ""pay"" would be your labor lol) I've been to new states and seen land marks on the way to stops, its a fun job as long as you dont have to many home life commitments you need to keep with time based deadlines. Best for couples together or single people with no kids or grown kids. (no one depending on them)"
bad,"No one was ever sure if you even had a load, if it was running on time    or even where it was      stranded in freezing cold   when my truck broke down    took six hours to get assistance,     went to pick up a load   it was hazmat   with no papers  if refused it"
bad,Worked midnight to noon. Bad hours and bad pay. Boss was a good guy. Helped get me a new shift and better pay.
bad,This was a training school where I OTR training.  It taught me hands on and the basics of driving a semi truck.
bad,"I learned how to read and understand bills of lading. "
bad,"typical day cleaning offices, working in a fast pace environment... I worked well with other employees as well as management...."
bad,"I was recruited from a cdl training class at a college by Werner. They told me that there was a Wal Mart no touch account available in Indianapolis, In. So I went with them, after two weeks in training I find out that they lost this account to another company. The only job they had to offer me was no good so I quit."
bad,If you lease they over charge you and expect you to train people. If your a company driver you get low miles. It goes in this order company teams. Owner Op teams trainer student solo lease solo company that how the loads go.
bad,"I learned about the E-Log system with this company, which can prove to be extremely difficult when throwing drivers into driving patterns not consistent with their normal sleep patterns.  There were plenty of miles this company offered, which proved to be its worst downfall.  I was dispatched for almost 8 weeks straight, and would have continued another 4 to 6 weeks before seeing a day at home, had I not refused to take on a route that consisted of hand unloading entire trailers, plus driving, and driven the rig back to the yard and resigned."
bad,disorganized not prioritized great benefits for families and vets
bad,"A typical day at work is good"
bad,I like it don’t want to leave but if the pay stays this way and not being able to take care of my family and get me home I’m out...really don’t mine the job but they pay attention to nothing you ask for or what’s going on with you and your situations
bad,"Must be Fleet Mgrs. take orders from above."
bad,"Home depot account "
good,"no home time, they just want you to think about trucking and forget about your love ones, and the pay is not good, for being out home for so long"
good,employees are great management hard to deal with when they are in a different  state will promise everything to get what they need and revoke everything leaving you without had to train myself on several jobs example abs werner would not train I felt like I was just a number
good,Hostile work environment.  Immediate supervisor was spiteful and held a grudge against drivers he felt had gotten him in trouble.  Very difficult work experience.
good,was and otr driver then moved to a dedicated driver account glad to be home every night. do a though pre trip inspection receive my load deliver it safely and in a timely manner . communicate problems to management they may affect other drivers coming to the same destination.
good,Not enough money to constantly stay out. Half the time I barely brought any money home and my brand new 2020 truck was always in the shop for wiring issues and I just kept getting told nothing was wrong. Even though my heater didn’t work and the truck would just die on me.
good,"Werner was ok to work for at the beginning had a great dispatcher but after he left the company everything went down hill fast. It is not a good ,place to work."
good,My experience here has been great. It has provided me for the building blocks for my carreer as an Hvac mech. The pay is mediocre and there are no benefits
good,"They do not look out of there divers."
good,"The Dedicated run from abq to Amarillo was great. Decent pay great home time. Home everyday and weekends while driving nights. The second account with them was arduous and endured heat exhaustion while unloading 53"" trailer on my own in the heat of Oklahoma and texas. Serious lack of concern for health for drivers."
good,"not enough freight, hard to make contact with required personnel, no weekend contact."
good,werner does what they can to help you...not so great pay. great benefits though. decent terminals.
good,trucks need to be up to date. trainers are ok. typical day would be driving lots of miles. travel experience was great.
good,They were an alright company but they expected you to fit in some tight spots . But the management was very poor.
good,"My training was not enough as far as a rookie driving otr solo. 6 month's, 33 states driven, discretionary situations happened that will strike fear in a newly tractor trailer driver. I got towed out twice in two separate situations and got blacklisted out of future opportunities. I call 20 different trucking jobs in my area and all those jobs wont accept me because of Werner Enterprises."
good,It is an ok company for learning to drive. If you want to make money then it would be best to put 5 yrs in. Then find a better paying job. Most companies pay better than Werner.
good,Drove me to the ground.. First time driver OTR . Paychecks as low as $300 a week for a full 60-70 hr week. Load miles were given 100 miles to 400 miles for solo max.. many live load and unload at 150 miles ..
good,"This is a great starter company, however the management is very unorganized and the company as a whole is very  unsafe. They have great equipment and keep it newly updated, however they do not hold people accountable and therefore a brand new truck will quickly be ruined due to lack of care. All they care about is production, and thus cause an unsafe environment. You will often see their trucks broke down because they do not practice safety. Home/work life balance is very outweighed. Even home daily accounts will leave you being at work 18hrs a day and not very many days off and lack of compensation. It;s best to get your experience for the new drivers and move on."
good,"ok for acquiring cdl license, basic skills and experience"
good,This job was one of the worst jobs to have. Your constantly being bombarded by idiot drivers that don't care for you. You constantly under the gun to get the freight there on-time.
good,"I loved the fact that I could drive and operate this BIG machine, I loved seeing the country and meeting all the different people.  The thing I didn't like was living in a box for 365 days a year non-stop. One day your in one place in few hours you were in the next.  I would prefer the stability of staying in one place and enjoying where I go for vacation and not have to just come and go...."
good,Not enough to survive off of when you have a family at home. It's more of a single persons job. Too many hours out on the road. Sometimes you might even have to spend your 34 hour reset out on the road instead of at home.
good,Werner hides a lot of information from the drivers and you do not find out everything until its too late and you are in the truck and see your pay check.
good,Prefer not to comment. Daily customer service and driver retention practices. Typical day setting up appointments. I learned more mechanical workings of tractor trailer trucks
good,Its alright I was an Over the Road Truck driver. Good Dispatcher learned a lot with backing and driving. Made me the professional that I am.
good,Werner is where you can work for a year in order to get a better job. They are a training company. They make their money on employing new drivers. There is no reason to stay there after a year.
good,"First couple of weeks nice but when on the road, all went down hill. Must complete 300 hours of continuos driving, which is about 3 months without seeing family. Only $350 a week in training."
good,"I got to see the USA , and Canada . It was a good place to start and gave me the chance."
good,"Like every other truck company, this one has its problems and issues , best advice,  get on a dedicated account you don't wait for loads,  you always moving  and sometimes your eve even priority over others , breakdown pay overlay pay , I got paid a weeks pay and I didn't even move my truck , ( snowed in Montana ) still got paid .."
good,I would run over 700 miles a day not always getting paid for my runs. I would have to fight to get paid for breakdowns and for weather shut downs. And i only made 20000 this year and i cant even support my family
good,"Their good for getting XP. The pay is shotty. Dispatchers leave drivers sitting around a lot."
good,"Good starting company. Get your time and get out. The pay sucks, unless you're training and that depends on the acct. Home time also sucks. Only good for people who just got their license."
good,Werner is a good place to work but they don’t pay enough for what we had to do. They didn’t want to pay overtime and the hours were long. 14 hours a day
good,"I spent just shy of two years with Werner, the equipment was great(still a good amount of 10spd). Pay wasn’t great at all, the one huge upside with Werner is their pet policy. No breed restrictions and if you run solo, you will get bored rather quick. Plus an all black German Shepherd is one great late night knocker deterrent for those questionable truck stops. My issue was hometime, my first FM and I had a deal that I’d stay out for a month and run hard, I’d get 5days straight of hometime. I got assigned a different FM and he wouldn’t allow me to take 3days off after being out for a month. I complained through the proper channels and was told that he is one of the best FM’s Werner has and that I should be grateful he’s my FM. I quit the following day."
good,"No tolerance for new drivers.  Never get towed, they consider it an accident.  Dispatch cons you into taking a job with new drivers, hoping you won't dispute them.  You are allowed to take the 34-hour reset, but they push you through it even when your hours are very limited."
good,"Good to get started in the industry and get the experience under your belt. After that, if you're looking for bigger and better you'll have to look somewhere else."
good,hated them find a better place to drive for. much better places to drive for trainer suck time off sucks they can do better on pay and everything is your fault even if its truly not
good,Long work hours and high work volume for low to mid range pay.  Interesting work but should offer more compensation. Not much else to say.
good,"everyone got along. other shifts for other drivers, worked extra hours on shift to cover late drivers."
good,"I heard once that if you find a job you love you will never work again, well this is true for me. The important thing is having a company or in my case a driver manager who understands that. The only thing that I had a problem with is some equipment. Company Equipment is most important because of safety issues. They took care of it in a timely manor."
good,"14 hours a day home every night not enough time for family."
good,"Never home with this company, health and retirement benefits are good. Work isn't hard. No breaks though. Sleep and drive over and over. Wages seem too low for being gone so much. Wanting to leave only to be home more often. People seem nice and helpful when you have questions."
good,"Perform daily pre-trip inspection of equipment prior to driving shift. "
good,"A typical driving job with a truck tat can't even go past 60 mph with a heavy load lucky if i can go 25 mph. up a hill when the speed limit is 60. Struggle going through traffic getting cut off consistently. Delivered freight in major cities such as Philadelphia and New Jersey Is all bad. I started out with a great dispatcher working Dollar General account alot of work unloading heavy rolltainers off the truck into the store, easy on level ground pain in the *** on a hill. Most stores were not made for trucks backing in from main streets or blindsiding between parked cars. Worst part of my job was having a slow truck in fast traffic, truck had so many electrical problems they could not fix causing me to loose my turn signals and my lights wouldn't even turn off even when the truck was off. Truck broke down in fredericksburg, VA for three days had to pay for my own room or be on the streets. Best part of my job was leaving."
good,"Tell you one thing and does not care for employee , Dispatcher rude and do no care What is safe"
good,"Great experience but wasn't making enough to support family"
good,I have worked here since the first of the year and I'm glad it's now over. The initial training you get is horrendous. The first 2 weeks you are in Omaha being taught by someone who has to get up and leave every 5 minutes due to the tight schedule they are placed on. You really don't learn anything there except that at the hotel you stay at in Omaha has a complimentary happy hour in the lobby.
good,"Long weeks away from home, not much on communications."
good,Good overall place to work for starters and they do believe in safey first and they try to work with you but  you gotta put in sometime to get respected
good,"I am a Veteran and offer loyalty, commitment to excellence, the best work ethic, and intelligence."
good,"After 6 months I was told the definition of ""bi-weekly home time"" was going to change. After getting home every other weekend up until that point, all of a sudden it was changed by my fleet manager. He never would answer why it had to change. So at Werner, bi-weekly now means you must stay out 14 days. Staying out 14 days gets you  home once every two and a half weeks (approximately), which is not bi-weekly. Plus, staying out 14 days means you'll almost never be home on a weekend, so if you want to be home on a weekend, you must stay out almost 3 full weeks."
good,"When trucking companies have an ad online saying they do local in your state make sure they have a terminal in your state. If not, that company is not local."
good,"Drove for werner for six years. The schedule was terrible, usually 3am to 3pm. Didnt have much of a life outside of the truck. The pay was terrible. Alot of time sitting in docks and not getting paid for it"
good,"Inspect tractors. "
good,"they cram so much information on you in such a short period of time, its hard to obtain it all..  its a training company so as far as pay goes, your at the bottom of the barrel, cant expect much your first year of trucking"
good,"When you’re on a good acct it isn’t bad but if on a bad  acct it is not good . It could be ran as a good company with right management,  and better dispatchers"
good,"Pros"
good,"I learned the basic day to day life of an OTR truck driver."
good,Job is ok.   Low pay long hours. Extra shift every 6 weeks with a full ten hour day on Saturday.  Lots of coaching and counseling involved with drivers.
good,i wasnt there very long to enjoy benefits but from what i experienced alot of the trainers do not follow safety protocol and will try to get the students to work off duty.I cannot speak about the fleet manager because i never met mine or got his number.offers raises every ten months compared to the normal 12 months that other companies offer.
good,This trucking company does not care about your personal life. The management of drivers on the road is usually handled pretty poorly. A lot of things promised in orientation turned out to not be so true.
good,OTR driving consists of long hours. A short day is 12 hours. It takes a certain kind of person to stay away from home for weeks. Only good thing was seeing most of the country.
good,Not a bad company have some good accounts but during training I had made a mistake then came the probation my advice soon as you make a mistake look for a new job....cause at the end of the day your just a number
good,was told to stay on the road over the time was supposed to equipment kept breaking down and pay was plethically low becuase they kept me in motels rooms in strange cities.
good,"Let me be completely up front, Werner isn't the worst, but they are far from the best. I came in as a qualified driver, I have about 1 year. They treated me good in orientation and afterwards let me choose the truck I wanted. I chose a nice KW 680 and I love it. However the pay is very minimal if you're looking for a dedicated account, some pay decent but most do not. They tend to lie about the pay to get you to join accounts. I also can't ever seem to get a hold of dispatchers. They aren't very helpful either. If you're on regional they will not keep you in your region and will ignore every request to stay in your region. They seem to do a lot of things that don't make sense. I'm basically at the point I might buy my own truck from a dealer and lease onto someone else. They have mobile eye in the trucks which gets extremely irritating at times. I do a lot of load splitting at drop yards and terminals, they are VERY good about home time. I've never been late for home time once, they actually let me deadhead 450 miles home one time because there was no freight. I think it's all about who you deal with. No matter what company you go to their will be idiots and there will be helpful people. I do however feel like I will need to see a therapist after working here, I spend a lot of time screaming and wondering why they do half the things they do. It's frustrating to say the least, but I make enough money to support myself and my kid. I just wish they had better dedicated accounts."
good,"Over the road trucking is only for those who don't have families. Werner was a good company to work for when you get out of school, but any large trucking company is going to have its draw backs."
good,Like every other terminal you hear everyone talking about everyone. So you listen and learn so you can't make the mistakes that everyone talk about.
good,"I drove for Werner for eight months, five as a solo driver and three as a team. I did a lot of sitting around waiting for a load. Most of my paychecks were less than $400 for the week. Their mechanics break more than they fix. Lots of downtime."
good,"Very first boss was an amazing person.  Constantly put forth effort to further my development within the company and industry.  After she resigned I have not reported to a direct boss.  5 out of 14 employees have left in the past 2 months and no hires have been made."
good,"the co knows that they are a starter for someone getting into trucking, they are very lacking in there pay structure"
good,"Wait fo assignment, pick up load, drive for 10 hrs, sleep and continue process"
good,"drove OTR. never time off, always send you somewhere you didnt need to go to."
good,"Good company"
good,"lack of management assists for OTR drivers, varies with fleet manager (FM). Lack of miles with new FM had to sit for hours waiting on loads and as OTR driver we don't get paid except while we are moving. Lack of pay for down time for equipment failures."
good,Alright  company to get experience but I wouldn’t suggest staying more than two years. They always find a way to short the drivers pay with things such as household good miles and don’t pay you for things such as searching for empty trailers. Get your experience and look into food service or ltl you’ll be home much more and get paid way more.
good,You would wake up every morning and conduct a pretrip on your fluid levels your tires an make sure everything was good to go before you drove ten hours on the highway
good,"Driving with a 53 foot trailer could be nerve-wracking. Good for an individua l with little or no family commitments or needs for home time. The company had a decent reputation among the larger companies to gain experience and break into the industry. Confidence is key, and a lack of will lead one into trouble (being in a place where a tracker/trailer shouldn't be, backing problems, accidents)."
good,would prefer paid by hour or consistency in miles. spend 2+ hrs waiting for loads  without pay and was given only one day off.  sharing trucks when slip sheet driver plans are done incorrectly
good,"It was a good experience to learn how to drive a big truck, but the time away from home was not worth it. Didn't make enough money to stay gone that long."
good,"Doing my current job is very stressful, but I do think the job security is good. But I don’t think the pay for the work I have to do is completely fair for the cost of living and the insurance has changed and cost more and covers less."
good,as a driver I learned you work in all kinds of weather from rain to snow to 100 degrees and sunny  and you maneuver a semi in all kinds of places you would not even think was possible .going places you have never been before .
good,they lie to you about dedicated routes and have you on a waiting list for the route and if you don't stay on them about it youll never get it will mess up on a paycheck every now and the
good,Long hours and lots of driving for little pay.  Honest company in the sense that I received everything that was promised. Home time was 1 day for every 7 worked.
good,-Saving money is what is in the interest for the company rather the driver. 
good,Long story short dispatch played favoritism and was taking the high mileage jobs and giving them to other drives thus cutting your cost of living. Would of been okay if it didn't take money from underneath the drivers to give to other drivers.
good,"My job was very disorganized which made being productive a difficult task and made communicating with other departments challenging. Without proper help from management, it was too stressful to stay."
good,good start to drive trucks and gain experience. This company is good for the person who wants to spend more time outside the house. and learn more about directions.
good,Hardcore driving company. push OTR on every driver limited regional and dedicated opportunities. Only available opportunities to drive locally are dollar accounts which wear you out physically and does not compensate when injuries occur.
good,"Get your experience  and  get out. Once you get 6 months experience you can apply to better company. Werner Starts paying  at 0.35 per mile for otr drivers.i just move to crete  they are paying me "
good,"Werner has nice trucks, and their trailers are starting to get better. Less down time waiting on a trailer to get fixed because the last driver didn't fix it. No pay for setting. 50% of my loads were live loads and unloads. Averaged less than 2k miles aweek. Not enough pay for what the recruiters tell you that you are going to make. I made 24k my first year,at werner and then I got on with another company that paid detention, layover, and breakdown. Something I rarely saw at werner.  I met a lot of great people, but the vast part of the wheel at werner is broken. They just cater to the newbs, rookies coming out of school"
good,"I learned timing is everything and safety is everything, management is okay not to personal get straight to the point. Hardest part of the job is being away from home, also unloading to stores is a bit difficult sometimes due to the heat. Typical day at work is one day driving the next day unloading."
good,"The company is ok. The communication is very bad and they cannot provide you with clear information if you need it desperately. Good company to work with if you like big blue trucks, bad company of you dont mind a few things being fixed. My personal experience was good but after my things went missing from my truck after it got towed and nobody knows where any of it is. Long story short I had to chase my personal belongings around for a month and got nothing back nor reimbursements. So yeah enjoy."
good,"I left this working environment because I felt they did not care about me as an individual and felt as though I was only a number. They had a hard time with planning loads and never knew what was going on with me, where I was or who I was."
good,Great starting job. Sometimes good miles sometimes not so good. All depends on account you are on. ....................................................................................Hardest part of job is backing into locations. Especially when green. Sometimes waiting on loads
good,"Not a company I would recommend to anyone. Bad management, only top levels are compensated and treated well. There was no support in my current role. Went to apply for another job internally and was basically ridiculed for asking questions."
good,I was out all week and sometimes the dispatcher would keep me there until Saturday waiting for a load home when there were other ones done near my house
good,Just ok company nothing special alot of lack of communication. Most other drivers were decent when I was there. Started with a junk trashed truck and had to get another..
good,"With Werner, it just depends on your needs at the time. If you need training or are a new student, Werner is ok for you. They are ok as long as you are on a good account. They have a lot of dedicated jobs. Pay is very low,"
good,The daily work was fast passed and had to think out of the box to find solutions for vendors and follow guidelines of the position. I loved my job.
good,Working alongside my colleagues and learning from them through daily experiences. Some projects were challenging but exciting. Looked forward in finding new truck stops to eat at.
good,"You have to be part of the cliché to have a peaceful productiver day."
good,i would not work for them if i were you they transferred me against my will with no notice to a different position then they told me i was the manager and would get a .75 cent raise for being manager 5 months later i finally get my raise and it is .20 cents i quit right after
good,nice starting place for entry level mechanics and anyone who is looking for work. parts manager is really nice and makes work easier
good,when slow season came the would put wrong information on dac report so that other companies couldn't hire you and they would call you back to work for them
good,"Never home, bad pay, and bad dispatchers. I would sit in some random corner of some random state for a few days, then get denied home time."
good,"my trainer trained me to be a truck driver. I drove from south Carlina"
good,Matrix Chemical is a great place to work.  The sales part was a huge learning experience for me
good,Liked the drivers but the ability to move forward was not available to members outside of the family
good,"Werner will keep you busy, but they are dishonest and have no concern for any family issues or home time."
good,"It's fun because every day I have a new load destination. I discovered new places, areas, met new people, met other English dialects. Werner lets the driver practices more on truck driving to be a professional driver."
good,There wasn't a typical day at werner because the days varied according to weather I was driving at night or during the day and the weather and road conditions. I had a good driving instructor but not sure on the management. The hardest part of my job was months on the road and being away from my family and using the qualcom system. The easiest part of the job was driving.
good,"Werner is good place to work, but lacks advancement opportunities for employees outside of NE."
good,Very good training and follow up programs for their employees. 
good,"Lots of miles, in a regional delivery route. I learned that werner recruiters will bend the truth slightly to get you in the door. Management was typical of a large trucking company. The worst part about home time, was the irregularity. You can work nearly unsupervised but that at times has it's disadvantages."
good,Lots of miles but poor mangement. Dosent care about your home time.
good,Werner has one of the largest trucking fleets in the US. They have a multitude of runs from 48 states to dedicated runs.
good,"this job is not one of favorites, its long drawn out, too much alone time, yes you get to see new places and people, but you spend more time driving then anything else. the work is very hard in some aspects but not always, some people can be very rude to you and the money you make is just not enough to compensate for the things you deal with... I do however like driving a semi just not all states...."
good,"Training is the best 400.00 a week and you don't have to pay back like some trucking companies. Make sure when Werner says they hire local, make sure they have a terminal in your state."
good,My job at Werner was as a broker in the brokerage division so my review does not include the trucking company. It’s a decent company to work for if you live or are willing to live in Omaha NE and/or the management in Omaha likes you. If not you end up working like a dog for an average salary.
good,"Fun at first, then nope. Net ops does not get paid well. If you pay attention to detail and not mess up then good place to work. Avoid accidents at all cost."
good,Always getting stuck at terminals because of poor planning. Left at a truck stop for 2 to 3 days on more than 1 occasion. was not a fan of that at all
good,"I wasn't told that I would have to leave home for 3 months in class. It wasn't until got to Florida that I learned this. My trainer was a bigot, but didn't know it. Her views were disturbing, but tried her best to kind and show hospitality. This was in 2005.. so I can say if things have improved or changed."
good,"This is a good company to start with! After you experience it for yourself, you can determine whether you stay long term or not. Right off the bat, you figure out how the trucking industry is & why company’s like Werner have succeeded for so many years..investing in equipment rather than employees. Corporate companies know there are high turn over rates for employees that’s why they don’t invest in them, that’s what you’ll get here."
good,"Mucho problema con los dispacher,mala paga por mullas"
good,i could not work otr at the time due to family needs I spent 2 months straight on the road missed holidays. benefits were good. good starting point for someone getting into the industry and single
good,"GOOD COMMUNICATION SAFETY HIGH PRIORITY some managers excellent some need lots of improvement"
good,"Drive 4 1/2 hours one way, not guaranteed route. Most drop and hook trailers. Benefits and 401k. Dispatchers are only worried about how fast you get the load to the destination."
good,Many times I went head to toe with dispatch due to the fact that they will attempt to try and force you to drive in unsafe conditions to to move a load. You are a number in a long list of other numbers. Pay is horrible and well below the national average of what other companies will pay.
good,"From my experience, and stories from other drivers, Werner is one of the few good companies for new drivers. Their pay is fair, as is home time, and training was good."
good,I trained in the Regional program Dollar General.   Drive to three to five stores and unload the truck.  The carts were heavy and packed crazy.   Pick-up empty carts and cardboard carts and return load to warehouse.
good,"It's an Over The Road truck driving job. I'm away from home a lot of time. My meals are quick and on the go. It's a job for now. Not a next career. It's a company to get some OTR experience and then go somewhere else. The pay isn't worth the hours you put in. The miles aren't paid correctly as they still use an outdated pay system. In their defense, I've been told most truck driving companies still do the same."
good,Werner provided a great way to make good amount of money quickly if you were willing to work hard for it. They typically catered to personal needs when requiring home/down time. The equipment provided was rarely up to date and had to be repaired often unless you were one of the top 10 senior drivers in which case you received a new truck. Otherwise you were stuck with equipment that didn't work half the time.
good,"Depending on your position will also give you a difference of opinion of the company. Its a job, that you are able to maintain but, has no room for growth or advancement. The pay is low and has no room to make more."
good,"Drove many states, got to see the country but getting a hold of dispatch or office when a problem occurred was impossible."
good,This company is a great place to start off at and if you can do team driving you will get all the miles you can handle but as a solo driver you may not get miles and may be sitting for a while.
good,Werner is not a very balanced company to work for. I was never able to be home on time when i requested and the pay was not very competitive. the equipment was pretty new however.
good,"A typical day can be fun like most jobs. Sometimes, highly demanding and challenging; but proper planning, preparation and implementation can drastically reduce the stress level. At this job it is very difficult to manage the home while on the road thousands of miles away most especially when you have children."
good,they were the first company i've driven for. Looking for an interesting job experience? start there you'll meet all sorts of people
good,"As far as trucking companies go Werner wasn't terrible. However, they wanted you on the truck for as long as possible, didn't give you many off days, about 5 days home for 3 months out on the truck, and they pushed you to meet your deadline no matter what condition you were in or what condition the weather was in. Some of the fleet managers are very irate and pushy, some of them aren't so bad."
good,"When unloading merchandise you need to take breaks to reset yourself physically and mentally and to have patience...Sometimes pushing yourself to hard without breaks can lead to fatigue and carelessness... You should always be aware of your surroundings, if you are unsure of your situation, get out and look, at all times before moving your truck and always plan ahead, stay focus..."
good,"Werner is a strong fleet for years due to new hires from school and some drivers with poor performance. After certain amount of miles, they tend to slow you down (make you sit, run down your clock) sometimes you need to take a 34 hr reset away from home. Know from experiencing this. Company is 25/75, 25 for how they take care of employees (like numbers), 75 for being a starter for a graduate out of CDL school."
good,Would spend long hours on the road to deliever miscellanous items to and from a distribution center. Tedious hours for modest pay and constant pressure to keep moving.
good,"The rate you start in is the rate you finish,. Its a great company to start out as a new driver. The equipment is kept up good enough to run, but they are good about fixing their rundown trucks."
good,It a lot of driving but if you like driving it will be good for you.
good,"Spent long hours away from home, as per the industry standard. Pay was a little below average as were the miles provided weekly."
good,"Drivers are just a number, not a person. The hardest part of the job for me was being away from home so long."
good,ok company nothing to brag about dispatcher are not easily to get along with pay could be a ittle more
good,"Not enough home time."
good,the company is a decent starting company. Does not pay what folks are worth.
good,"Werner was a great company to get started in the trucking industry , still there great ,wonder,helpful ,out goin ,co-worker , ok dispatcher ."
good,"A typical day was driving over the road in the mid-west to pickup shipments and deliver to receivers.  Learned a great deal of living on the road and safe driving.  However management was not the best as they told me my family emergency revolved around them, and family is above all more important.  The hardest part was being away for two weeks at a time, and I would say the enjoyable part, the traveling."
good,"Typical truck driving, some long and varied hours. Some dispatchers were good and ensured that your wheels were turning so that you could make some money. The only way to make money, is to have the wheels rolling."
good,Many unpaid days are spent loading and unloading at warehouses.  Most of my dispatchers were helpful but outside of that I was passed from one department to the next while waiting on hold when trying to resolve a problem.
good,"It was a good experience for me to learn the ins and outs of trucking. Had to wait on customers to unload and load the trailer, so i had to learn how to be patient. The hardest thing was about the traffic when trying to get into tight spaces."
good,"This is a very stable company, it has been a very valuable to me as far as experience, management is pretty good with the exception of a few, co- workers are great, the hardest part of the job, is that it is a very big company which means you have several different departments to go through to get things done. the most enjoyable part of the job is that I love what I do."
good,"It was a good place to start a career in the trucking family. Co-workers are friendly, and hardest part is the trainers, some are not a clean people."
good,if you live in michigan stay away from this company and find another. getting hometime from this company for michigan is a pain in the *you know what* and not worth the hassle. they had to route me to canada EVERY TIME i wanted to go home and I would sometimes wind up with no load back home for 2 days...if you like hometime and have family here or important dates that you can't miss then stay away.
good,"New employees treated well"
good,Stressful. Work to home time ratio could be better. 1 day home for every week out. Upto 7 days. No paid holidays. You get 1 week paid vacation after a year
good,"This company is a good company to start out with if you want to drive trucks for a living. You will get extra training and newer trucks but pay isn't adequate once benefits, taxes and tuition reimbursement comes out of your paychecks, management is lackluster as well."
good,I was lucky to have a good dispacher. Kept me running. But they didn't want me to leave the road. Took a week to get me home for a few days off. Hi turn around but a good start for a new driver.
good,Werner is a place that was once full of opportunities that never came to fruition. Management does not seem to care or empower its employees and all decisions are made from the top with little room for feedback from employees.
good,"While it gave me some experience in the transportation industry, the ceiling was very low. You can promote in title there but the compensation will not reflect your advancement."
good,"I don't want to spend time submitting a review for a position I have no intention of maintaining long term. It will not benefit me one bit to continue to do what I currently do for a living as there isn't an open position within the department for me to progress into, nor is there a developmental plan to get me ready for anything with additional responsibility."
good,"Werner Trucking company has provided for me and my family, so I have no complaints. I became a truck driver and this company has taught me the ropes! I have seen the different ways to load and unload"
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for OTR. No significant other, no family, no need to be home. then this is perfect for you because you will really never be home unless you request it."
good,This company is just very unorganized and they don't have good communication between the employer and the drivers.  Not a lot of home time and wasn't always treated fairly.
good,"If you are not working in Omaha, NE you could suffer from advancement problems if you are unable to relocate. There are opportunities with this company just not in the areas I am able to relocate to."
good,"there is not a lot of home time even when requested it seems to be an issue when asking for some days off to be home,  but the pay was good especially for military personnel using gi bill"
good,Werner is ok but time to move on. Lack of pay and no advances . If you make a manager mad look out some hold grudges . Would rather be in a team and fun atmosphere.
good,They don't give the new guy the benefit of the doubt and the planners don't give you enough time. When you are extra early they change your delivery time. This will then make you late for time delivered.
good,"Productive and fun place to work at. Lots of cross training and relationship building. Room for growth and advancement, would recommend for anyone in the transportation field."
good,I enjoyed working with Werner for the diversity and generally fast paced days.  I felt like I was contributing something to a major company. Management pretty much let you run at your own pace without any micro managing.  Your are in a sense your own boss.  The job has gotten a little harder over the years as the driver market has changed making it more difficult to find quality candidates and make a decent living. Not much room for rapid advancement though.
good,"Long hours, often 12 hours shifts 7 days on 7 days off.  You will learn just about everything in management of drivers & customer service.  Management at mid level is friendly & often caring. Upper management on is concerned with the bottom line & cost cutting."
good,"Company is not the worst but not the best. Almost never home, pay after tax simply sucks. Plus they manipulate the tuition reimbursement to where they add it to your check then reimburse you all types of little tricks to save them money that do not benefit you. But compared to some other trucking companies it is a good fit. If you are single and okay with COMPLETELY sacrificing your life. Werner is your dream job. You are assigned a number and expected to operate the truck like you are a robot."
good,Not really any good communication when your fleet manger is good for the day or the weekend. The fleet management diluting the day is great. It's a great start off company. They tend to forget that you exist after working for them for about 8 months.
good,Top management at Atlanta terminal does not know how to manage effectively.  No consequences for lack of performance.  No recognition for exceeding expectations. Yearly performance reviews are generic with a standard raise usually under 3%.
good,Your just a number it's a big company not really a bad company just have a lot of employees and a lot of customers who are not really happy cause everything is usually already late when you get your load
good,"A decent company to start fresh out of school with, the otr training they have is fairly good if you get one of the few decent trainers. Would never work for more than a year."
good,"hands on place to work, you get a lot of experience on trucks and trailers, the manager is cool and will work with you, paid lunch is awesome, if they paid me more i would stay."
good,"driving and delivering to family dollar stores"
good,I enjoy the driving and the work. Didn't like being away from family and friends as much as was required of me. Driving around the country I delivered to a lot of different accounts. I learned a lot.
good,This job was slow pace and had a lot of down time. It did not offer you much. It was just a job to have until you found something better but if you were going to stay you could possible advance in some years.
good,It gave me the skills and the training on how to operate over 3 tons of equipment safely on the road. The hardest part of the job is being far from family.
good,"good equipment for the most part, not the best pay but benefit were good."
good,It was ok for the time being but I'm currently looking for something more local & better pay.
good,"ALWAYS Waiting for loads,"
good,"trying to get miles to a good spot sucks."
good,"Good company, but I did not like living in a truck. I liked the travel and the driving, but not staying in the truck 24/7 for weeks on end. I learned to handle a semi and follow routes."
good,Yes I'd drive for  Werner again I have no complaints.The trainers were polite and professional.
good,"no miles, spent more money than I made. lots of down time. They did give me a really nice tractor to drive"
good,This job is nice with the benefits and ability to see the country. The only draw back is the pay. at .21 cents per mile and barely 1000 miles a week you eat about every 3 days. Any said pay increases are broken promises.
good,"This employer was my first professional driving job. I came in straight from school, so I was as green as grass. The first 2-3 months is training and you will run as a team, although you will be paid a set rate as a student. One week we ran 8,000+miles, but the trainer reaped the benefits and bonuses. Other than that, there were many down periods with no runs or short railyard runs."
good,"Werner was a good place to start.  Great equipment, descent training (depends on who you get as a trainer) and fair compensation.  Typical of big companies, you are nothing more than a number.  You can succeed here, but you have to pay your dues and then get on a dedicated account"
good,"Prehire process, speaking to one of their recruiters mentioned $750- during training; so I followed up and been told she no longer works there."
good,Werner is a good starting company for new cdl holders but the top pay for drivers is only 42 cents per mile. The terminals are too big and takes too long to get your truck fixed.
good,"This company, you either love it or hate it! as a student driver I felt that they took advantage of me as far as time versus money. But at the same time no other company would touch me with no driving experience. So I literally had to work for pennies as I began a career in the driving industry."
good,"Werner is a good place to work, lots of room for movement. The people are nice, I spent a large part of my life there and advanced my knowledge and skills with the help of some great managers."
good,"Good for brand new drivers. Good school, training. Just not capable of paying what a seasoned veteran should be paid. Freight costs are on the rise but the drivers wages are still suffering"
good,Good company to get experience with until you find something else that is better and suits your needs better. Management is ok depending on who you have. Get your experience and find something closer to home.
good,"I was training to be a over the road driver while here at this company. Good training but lousy pay. Over the road was good training, had a good instructor, after one crashed into a gate and the other one I could not work with because he chained smoked and it made me sick."
good,"Pay could be way better bring home, that was my only issue. The dedicated account was east coast and most times everything was pretty cool including dispatcher."
good,"Learned to replace cab seat covers, mattress materials, chair components, radios, road sensor components, dash-cam components, windshields, bumpers, filters, tires, rims, brakes, compressed air components, drive-line components, hubs, shift clutch components, lighting, s-cam components, and airbag components. There's even a shop joke about no-one working as a mechanic, but as a parts replacer. Most difficult part of the job is asking for more hands-on training & some training is unannounced, & unorganized. They push everyone to do required safety training monthly. Learn as much as you can, record everything you work on in a notebook, & move on."
good,"majority of my days were from 6am-4pm, I was fortunate to choose my hours, but they train you for teams when I wanted strict solo, so we almost never stopped, and when I slept it was nothing but bouncing and shaking for my trainers shift. If you can handle the extremes of over the road then I recommend it, otherwise, stick with local..."
good,"Only thing I remember about this company was that it had a great main terminal. They had a driving simulator, a clothing store, and other amenities. It was a cool place"
good,"Training was exellent, the company was fast paced as you had to play ""Beat the clock"" with the hours of service. The pay was good and so were the people. The hardest part of the job was backing trailers into tough spots. The best was driving a "" Big Rig"" over the road."
good,There were opportunities for advancement once you employees learn their roles. They provided the option to travel around the country and learn about different customer accounts. This provides a great overview of the challenges and opportunities for the company.
good,"It's a good first driving job, but move on after 6 months to something that pays a little better and has you home more often. Easy to get comfortable at this company, but keep your priorities (money) in mind."
good,"If you don't mind being out for long periods of time and working hard, this may be for you. I've busted my a** day in and day out at this dollar general account and it seems like there's no appreciation. I do everything right and I'm not given any type of leniency to getting closer to home. Yeah there may be some reading this thinking I'm whining, but in reality, I haven't done any wrong. It's getting close to Father's day and they want us to work through it. I'm fed up with it and I'm done with this account and company with their lack of leadership and communication."
good,"Werner is a trucking company and focuses on their drivers, not on IT. "
good,This is a good starting place to become a professional driver. I've learned that they shorted me many days on miles and some of the dispatchers were barely competent for their position. Honestly overall it was a pretty good experience.
good,"Werner has changed a lot from the day I started till the end. My opinion is off then end since I hope thats the direction they are headed. For starters, typically they have nice trucks. they are all pretty new but basic. they do not come with anything fancy like a fridge or app none of it. truck and Qualcomm. my best suggestion is get on a dedicated account. almost guaranteed pay working with typically the same manager running typically the same routes. best way to go. I always recommend to use them as a stepping stone. most terminals are nice and have showers. just get in get experience and move on."
good,"Overall, good company to work for. Company needs to focus on improving home time frequency for drivers. Management was organized and structured. Workplace culture centered on reaching delivery destinations on time."
good,"i am treated with respect , and am reconized for accomplishments. has good benefits, and am able to drive new equipment, dispatchers are former drivers so they understand a drivers needs"
good,"Werner Enterprises is a productive place to work for apprentices (new drivers) in order to learn and gain enough experience in the Field of Trucking Industry,"
good,"Long days, long hours. If you don't love it, this job is not for you. I wish I could have gotten off to a better start. Learned the real meaning of OTR."
good,"It was a good start to gain experience."
good,"Started driving OTR east to west coast for many miles with good pay until the recession began, along with my truck having many mechanical issues leaving me sitting for days waiting for repairs to be completed."
good,"Great place to work, If you like being away from home weeks at a time. Doesn't offer local jobs that make it worth your time. Like any other job, Some great people, Some great things."
good,The company was great. except when it comes to communication. Very lacking . I also think they need to better screen the people have let train. My home time was a joke.
good,"- 24/7 Transportation Provider"
good,"Not a bad company but if you want to be owner operator you may think about an other company. Performed deliveries throughout the United States"
good,"Working for this company as a team driver always on the road on time with loads great relationship with fleet manager but 1 Accident was CANNED comminuted with fleet manager about road conditions how it wasnt safe but was told to get the load there after he left..... Needless to say I was only supposed to take a couple of E trainers per management in Ohama but some DICK in Henderson,Co felt the need to go on a power trip in ask for termination without regards of you or how you feed your family as long as it's not them or their family they don't care... They give you this speech about how it's one BIG family in WERNER CARES yeah right"
good,"Acting as a"
good,The environment and co-workers make the job a little more bearable but with more training and responsibility should come better pay and benefits. The advancement opportunities are too few to even talk about.
good,"Love driving truck, if you get a descent fleet manager you can make descent money.If you go partners that could be disastrous or awesome. Challenges every day, enjoy driving"
good,"nice new trucks trip planners left much to be desired"
good,"I recommend Werner Enterprises for anyone new to trucking, their training program is set up for new drivers to succeed. However this is not a company you want to stay with long term, they pay below industry averages and really seem to welcome their high turnover rate."
good,"worked as a mechanic. revieved no training, didnt go over all safety rules and regulations, short staff, poor leadership, overworked staff, and wouldnt use funds for employee benifits as proper equipment."
good,"Drove cross country with company trainer: Responsible for picking up and dropping customer loads and trailers, record arrival and departure time, quality of product upon arrival and hours on the road or breaks in Call Quam, responsible for pre & post maintenance of equipment"
good,"If you are just starting out as a CDL A driver, Werner can provide very good training."
good,My stint at Werner Enterprises was brief but I got an overview of what the company was about. Love driving truck but hate waiting lol. Driver dispatch was sometimes understanding sometimes not.
good,When you have to double check everything management does and still do what you need just wasn't for me
good,co has no sence as what the needs of the driver might be as in home time or appt for doctors or dentist
good,its an ok job if u like to travel alot and be away from home for a long period of time
good,a great place for someone to start in trucking but no good for long term.
good,"drove OTR and the hardest part was being gone so long, especially when money wasn't what I was told it would be prior to taking job"
good,"typical day was delvering product on a dedicated account for Dollar General. I would show up at the Dollar General Disabution center normally with an empty semi trailer and pick up a pre loaded trailer at the disibution center, pick up invoice's and sign for the load. then head to the Dollar General stores that they need to be at and off load product by hand, pick up and returns and secure them."
good,Warner seems like a good company and it has good benifits but it is also long hours and a lot of time on the road. You will rarely meet another employee on the road unless by luck you happen to be in the same spot.
good,"Werner is a big company and offered top of the line equipment, however as an individual it was easy to be lost in the shuffle."
good,"Do not be forced to team drive with the person they force on you. Speak up. Do not be lead into things, always speak out when you know something is wrong."
good,the time spend over the road was a killer. it is a tough job. being over the road with having family. it is not a very good thing. the hardest part is working to many days out of your home
good,"I worked for Werner Enterprises, but i mostly worked on a dedicated account for Home Depot.  Werner Enterprises may do a little more or less for the driver, but i was on an account very task oriented but a little disorganized. Its been a roller coaster ride working this account. Werner  Enterprises may be a great all around Company,  but the dedicated accounts are different."
good,good job. all depends on what account you are on. some accounts have good management and some have bad management. some managers treat you fairly and some do not. some accounts pay you good and some play favortism to other drivers allowing them to get paid a way larger salary difference than others.
good,Overall the employees were agreeable and but over time showed a different side concerning the workplace. It was a dedicated route which was an ideal location.
good,If you're looking for a company that supports learning and advancement this may be a place for you. Werner offers plenty of inner company education and job training.
good,"Werner is a great company. They work hard to show how much they appreciate their employees. Office employees are expected to work 10-hour days, and some of the ""normal"" holidays are not honored."
good,Good company to start up with m. They are patient with the drivers. Dispatchers lacked understanding but any good driver should be able to handle them situations
good,My experience working with Werner was good but could be stressful because it's all about trying to do loads to make money if you ain't moving you can't make money. Before you go on your delivery you should plan your route check your location around the store sometimes you get some tough entrances to these stores you coming off just learning how to drive and have to haworking a do
good,I enjoyed my job. Learning how to manage drive time was the hardest as no one explains how to manage time.  They just throw you out there and expect you to always deliver or p/u on time when no one shows you how to do it with the time allotted.
good,"Started on OTR then transferred to the Canada account. OTR claims to be non forced dispatch but will make you sit as punishment if you refuse to take a load at 3am. Mostly short runs. Joined the Canada account because they said the average load is 1100 miles but never got a load that went farther than 600 miles. Then would have me crossing the border all week, waiting for paperwork to go through would only let me get 1500 miles per week and that’s when I quit."
good,Bad situation with family dollar account. Dollar general better but not by much. Bad trainers and don't get you home for home time. Dispatch keeps you guessing.
good,"Great job as long as you're not on the Dollar General run. That route is hard with barely no time off. Or no real help, you would have to be a trainer to make good money on that route."
good,"Pros: Good company, good training pay, some upper management try to help. "
good,it decent place to start if you haven't driven before.the teachers and trainers will help you drive more effectively. they make sure you have the general knowledge needed to succeed.
good,you have to be a man to get anywhere in this company;...or know someone higher up in order to get a chance to grow. ………………………………………………………………………………………...
good,They don't treat the drivers that well. They just want you to just drive your load and get it there and go to the next stop. They pay wasn't the good at all either.
good,"only a part time job, was working there till I went to college but I worked the 2nd shift and only got paid as an intern even though I was working on big mechanical issues with trucks"
good,Did not have a great experience with Werner but have to admit that as a starter job it is ok I guess. Good benefits and when you work OTR you get to see a lot of the states. But very poor management.
good,they trained me on rules of the road. Got to know how to use log book and computer logs. Become more knowledgeable on on how to drive an eighteen wheeler
good,Company really took good care of their vehicles. Work wasn't hard. The lack of accounts near my home was a negative. Overall work was good. Just a lack of home time was my reason for leaving.
good,"Office setting. Days and weeks are long, easily doing 45+ hrs a week or more. The financial compensation for the work is a bit low but not horrible. Decent benefits overall."
good,fun and productive workplace driven many miles across different states dealing with different culture .Opportunity to  pick up and deliver good to different company for their various needs
good,The company has its ups and downs. I would like a home daily route and Werner does not have an available home daily route at this time.  Werner has been a great stepping stone in the trucking industry.
good,"This was my first Trucking job out of truck school. They kept you busy, they have electronic log books, I beleive they were the first to use paperless logs. I had a great trainer."
good,Problem with my pay every pay period needs to be improved.  There were alot of broken promises due to my fleet manager.  Also i applied for insurance for my daughter and she was refused.
good,"Work day starts anywhere from 10 pm to 8 am, pick up a load that will go to three to four stores. Each store takes anywhere from 3 to 8 hours to unload. Work days are typically 12 to 16 hour longs depending on loads and stores. The manager I had was great, very supportive, positive and took care of any work related issues on the spot to make sure the task was able to be completed as soon as possible. The hardest part of the job has to be the physical labor with the long hours. I did enjoy going to the stores to get to meet new people, we would have a good time even though we had a lot of work to do."
good,"I cannot give a fair review as I was there a short time.  It was over the holidays and I became ill and had to call in (after the 4 week assignment was complete).  Once I called in, they released me."
good,"After retiring from aerospace industry I entered into motor coach and truck transportation industry after receiving a Class A CDL.  Drove for several transportation companies and institutions.  I also contracted with multiple aerospace corporations when contacted."
good,"Many opportunities to grow within many departments.  Strong training and development classes.  High paced, high stress working environment that requires minimum 50-60 hour work weeks, holidays, and monthly Saturdays.   Driver retention is a crucial & primary focus in today's trucking industry.  Drivers are loyal to reliable fleet managers/supervisors.  The lack urgency to retain employees causes managers to seek opportunities with other companies. Professional drivers tend to follow."
good,It’s a starter job for cdl starter drivers if you are looking for a job fresh out of school it’s cool ......................................................
good,Had to sleep in the truck so I would wake up go into the terminal get my assignment and locations for all my stops for the day/night. I would take off knock out my assignments and have to sleep at a truck stop.
good,Ive had a gppd time woth werner. It was an Enjoyable place to work along with good people to work with as well. I'd say the only down side is hometime.
good,Very bad trainers with attitudes that forced me to cut short my training while OTR. Everyone is not made to be a trainer. No problem with the system but I think to be a trainer you should be evaluated extensively.
good,Long unpaid waits at shippers and receivers. Paid by mile but not for wait times. Restricted idling for the truck which leads to extreme temp  range in sleep. 104 degrees in the sleeper and 94 degrees outside and the truck wouldn't idle to run the ac. No power inverter to run cpap or microwave.
good,A place you can get your foot in the door and get introduced to the trucking industry.  There are several different divisions all in 1 location which serves as different paths to try and take to advance.
good,Good way to get experience as a truck driver. Over the road was not my thing but others love it. the company has more million mile drivers than any other.
good,Werner is a good company but wasn't right for me.  The equipment is newer and maintenance is kept up on it.  Plenty of loads to get the miles.  Again my only complaint is not enough home time.. I want to be home daily.
good,I enjoyed working for Werner Enterprises. I liked the traveling experiences. The hardest part about the job was some of the accounts that required an extreme amount of labor.
good,"Owned 3 trucks,trained students,did flatbeds,pulled dryboxes and refrigerated boxes.drove cross country,drove on the icy roads drove though the mountains"
good,I worked as an equipment control manager and was in charge of all equipment tracking in Mexico with all other transportation companies that were moving them on a daily basis.
good,I worked in the Maintenance shop and it was a physical demanding job. Very hot especially where they kept there part (inside freight train containers)
good,Picked up trailer and drove towards destination for 10 hours per day. Learned planning of routes and fuel stops. Hardest part of the job was being away from home for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and seeing different cities.
good,As a new truck driver the account managers would rather give the loads that have the more miles to other drivers with more driving experience. this creates a problem for new drivers who are attempting to earn a living driving for Werner.
good,"working at werner is fast-paced, fun, can be stressful at times.  Sometimes flexible, other times not.  Nothing really bad to say, just need to relocate."
good,If you want to work here please do great job great pay great people great environment they won't let you down I was looking out for you experienced knowledgeable and everything else you need to know what you looking for
good,"Great running vehicles, consistent miles with pretty good pay. Very good at responding to drivers with truck issues. Will bend over backwards to ensure their drivers are safe. Allows pets at a cost."
good,"Most days were busy and could be challenging with the amount of work we had."
good,"Nice nee trucks , good benefits. Down side low pay for people who have been driving over 10 years they only go back 5 years on your driving list of employers and  that hurts us people with lots of trucking exsperyens ."
good,"Traveling was a fun thing to do. sight-seeing and meeting new people. "
good,very stressful
good,Gained a wealth of experience. The work is competitive and days can be very long. Typical work week is 6 days.  The hardest part at times would be unloading of the trailers and communication with the dollar general accounts.
good,I worked here for only a short time. During my time here I have sat around sometimes for two weeks  waiting for a trainer and a truck. However they were really good at getting you home for a family event emergency or event if you don't mind greyhound.
good,"Working for Werner as a driver should be considered a stepping stone into the trucking industry. Whether 24 or 54 it is a good start for an inexperienced transfer truck driver. Because in this industry dues must be paid before you get paid so don't go to Werner looking to get financially comfortable out the gate. Just take what they give you and parlay that knowledge into a good payday somewhere else or move out of the truck and into the office as a next tier employee with Werner Enterprises. I rather write less then just fill up blank space with letters filled with hot air. So, if what is in my summary is not enough then I guess it doesn't meet your standards and that's fine."
good,unless your dedicated you kind of miss out on life. I enjoy a job to move up in a company. Its hard to do that if the company doesn't allow you to here.
good,it is OTR you will be away from home often and the pay has not increased with the times. It offers a start in the trucking industry but is in no way family friendly.
good,"I do not care to review this company regarding a typical day at work, what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, or even the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Over the road truck driving is not for the faint at heart.  This job is great for those just starting out as a CDL driver.  it's a great place to get some experience and meet other drivers.
good,Can be stressful for new driver. Great support but must be self motivated. New and well maintained equipment. Very nice people and management. Many dedicated options depending on where you live.
good,"Werner was not a bad job for a younger single person because of the amount of away from home time. All Meal time stops had to be approved by the company. No freedom. Only approved truck stops for meals and rest/showers. Benefits took a long time to start as a starting driver. As an older driver, it was difficult to be away from family for those extended periods."
good,"Training and safety management is productive and valuable to those involved. However, the time away from home is frustrating and difficult for families and friends,"
good,"A typical day involves working closely with drivers and the client at a distribution center.  It is a casual workplace, but includes long hours and stressful situations."
good,"Not a bad company to start out with the trainers they have are pretty decent and knowledgeable, they could work on getting their drivers home more but other than that its cool."
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind not being home much. It's a Hard working job that requires a lot of manual labor and long days. They do provide weekly home time, but is only for 1 day"
good,After one year I was forced to go back to Virginia and help with the family. My driver trainer was not very good and had personal hygiene issues. But once on my own they seamed average.
good,drive 48states assist on various dedicated accounts. follow dot regulations. follow company safety regulations.follow truck routes and obey city laws.
good,"Always Had Loads to Haul, Never Down, Excellent People to Work For. If Truck broke down, they'd pay for a Hotel. Grew tired of being away from home for extended periods of time."
good,"The company was good to work with. I just felt as if the workload was way too much for the amount we would get paid. We had to drive to different dollar general locations and unload trucks. Each palette varied between 700-2,000 pounds."
good,"clean and tidy work space, slow paced, laid back, helpful and reliable coworkers, pto, pay could be better but overall it is an alright place to be employeed"
good,"If you are looking for a big company that expects you to hit the ground running straight out of school this is it. Little training, lots of pressure, decent pay and benefits"
good,I drove a tractor trailer over the road through out the US. I delivered general goods. I had a major stroke working for them which caused my later trucking career to fall apart.
good,Just wanting to get off the road and every time I applied for a job they kept finding someone more qualified.  I have worked for them almost three years.  The team seems to be good to work for I really don't have to many bad things to say except when you have to wait almost three hours to get your load and there's no one else that can take the load and stuck having to take it.
good,Easy job making deliveries. Enjoy the customers Culture was easy and good. Left for better opportunity . The management was easy to get along with . Nice company
good,"was treated good, had couple of dispatchers that were pathetic. overall experience was acceptable. terminals were nice , was very pleased with most things."
good,I worked here straight out of truck school. They are over the road. i would not go back because the pay sucks and they tried to sheat me out of pay but i got experience so thats good
good,It's a starter company.  Dispatchers do not care about the drivers.  You are considered an easy replacement.  Terminals are in good condition. Shop time is slow.
good,"Looking forward for a great career. Being treated good"
good,"Be prepared to be on the road for 2 weeks at a time. Also, there is no guarantee you'll be home when you get your 2 days off, or 34 hour reset."
good,"Werner is a great company to start out in for anyone looking to make a career out of Trucking. Whether by way of trainer's instructions or on one's own intuition, one should grasp the necessities that revolve around this career. Being a respectful, courteous, and most importantly safe driver is key to this profession. Once one gains these skills, they could go far with just about any trucking company."
good,Werner provides several avenues for you to get training you need to be successful. You can always get the help you need from management.
good,Hardest part of the job is working with upper management to come to a common goal with the driver pool. In addition work with the customer to find ways for the load integrity on a trailer to be safe for our drivers.
good,"I had at least seven different fleet managers during the year, an four on the road with them. One of them was promoted, an fantastic. Forget the rest."
good,This review was completed earlier in this process.  Working for Werner sometimes left me confused & assigned less than desirable loads.  They sometimes changed my route at random
good,During my time there i never felt like anyone really cared to get you yo understand the job itself. Everyone does the same job and that can get confusing
good,great place to learn from the originator of the Electronic Log. Too many drivers passing the buck on repairs. They don't really care where you end up sleeping at the end of the day no matter how you plan.
good,"It was a good company to train with for my first trucking job. There were issues due to location, little room for advancement, and no home time."
good,Company is just to big for drivers to get the respect they deserve and need. Drivers are basically left to fend for themselves unless your in an area where a dispatcher needs a driver immediately which doesn't happen very often
good,"Drove team with my husband, it was wonderful seeing the country. We kept busy, we ran 5,000-6,000 miles a week. Drove brand new equipment. Had to quit to be with elderly parents."
good,This is a great place for beginner drivers but not much pay an room for success.The trainers are in it for the pay an some dnt really care about how you turn out after completing
good,"the job is ok , they make a lot of promises they do not keep,"
good,One of he lowest paying trucking companies. they do get you home on time. their truck or not the best the dispatchers are very disrespectful to their drivers
good,"Over all work environment is good. but the pay and benefits and driver dispatch relationship is not good. average, etc.."
good,if you like being away from home then this job is for you .traveled all 48 states. almost like being on vacation. saw a lot of the USA
good,"worked as a foreman for second shift then took over as shop manager, liked the company but the stress of the job made me leave"
good,"drive 10-11 hrs to various places in USA .learned interstate,US highway systems.Management wasdone by computer,and by Phone was adequate. coworkers not in their presence drove solo .Being away from home was hardest part of the job"
good,driving all day gone from home two weeks at a time not getting paid what u deserve for as much work as u out in I learned how to move freight from state to state the hardest would say going to places u never been not knowing what your getting urself into
good,"Traveling was fun. Salary system could use some help. Takes to long to make serious money."
good,"I enjoy being a truck driver, I received good training, management was fair and accommodating, and partners were friendly. Hardest part was long time away from family, enjoyable part was being able t drive across the US."
good,"Lots of work, lots of miles. Team drivers will make the most money, me and my son began 07/2014 driving 5000-6000 miles per week running a dedicated route for Con-Way. I averaged $900.00 - $1100.00 net with per diem pay and my son who is single averaged $875.00 - $990.00 net with per diem pay. You will quickly gain weight as all you do is drive 24/7 and expect to be gone most of the time with little home time"
good,Good company to start with but not a good stay with company. Low miles and pay. Very poor employee relations. Would not work for again
good,"While working for Werner I had the opportunity to see many new places throughout the entire US when I first started as a 48-State Driver, and hundreds of new places when I landed a Regional Driver position in the Upper Midwest where I am from."
good,I drove 48 states for Werner Enterprises.  I found that home time was very difficult to get and that the senior drivers got better loads.
good,"You want watch back.. to much of good guys click,, they lots times say one thing then do another/"
good,Worked on my own to make on time deliveries of product.I learned how to be a safe driver.The hardest part of the job was having home time.The most enjoyable part was traveling.
good,"A typical day at work consist of pushing carts about 300 to 500 pounds. Summertime can be very hard got to stay hydrated, and some stores are very hard to back in so u have to have good backing skills."
good,"I dont know what to say about this company. Ok freight "
good,This opened my eyes in knowing I didn't want to be away from home for months at a time.
good,see my summary that is all I have to share about this company.  It is a good place to get experience.
good,Ok another life long lesson was learned here. Over all person to person. Communication is very important here.
good,"I learned what a typical day is like as a over the road truck driver,the most enjoyable part of my job is all the places ive gotten to see but the hardest part is missing my family."
good,GOOD starting company for new drivers! After you pay your dues find a better or local company
good,driving for Werner Enterprise is a good experience if you want over the road travel you get to see different states and learn they living.
good,"It was fun traveling, but dangerous work driving under certain conditions, and solitary."
good,Typically drive long hours.  Learned about aggressive driving.  Long days and short nights.  Loved traveling the country.
good,fine starter company to work for if you need to get in a company
good,great company as far as employee interest but have really poor equipment
good,"My current position as a Load Planner deals with the managing, dispatching, and planning of freight for The Coca Cola Bottling Company.. Below are a few of my daily job requirements."
good,Typical day at work involves driving and unloading truck.  I learned to operate a 53' tractor trailer in tight areas such as city streets and high traffic parking lots due to unloading at retail stores.
good,"It was physically demanding, not mentally challenging.  It was very hot or cold.  It was loud, dirty.  The pay was average.  The benefits were very good."
good,"Learned how to Deal more with Customers on a daily basis"
good,"Long hours of sitting, and can be very isolating.  This would be a great job for a single person, but those with family especially with small children can find the separation a challenge."
good,"A good place to get experience coming out of truck driving school. Nice equipment with E-logs. Lots of miles paid MT and loaded. Chance to become a trainer after 6 months( too soon, in my opinion)."
good,"A typical day consisted of a proper pre-trip, fueling and driving an 10 to 11 hour shift to and from shipper and recievers. The hardest part of the job is constantly making sure you are following all of DOT rules and regulations. The most enjoyable was having independence, freedom, meeting new people daily and traveling seeing the world!!"
good,Company offers new equipment and alot of miles.  Pay could be mor competitive.  Great place to start
good,Professional Driver for Werner Enterprises. Long haul driving requires professionalism and flexible hours.
good,"Your average work day, lots of driving. learned quite a bit, too much to list here. Management was ok and relatively fair. Coworkers were fun with the occasional oddball. Being out all week!!!  Working by myself"
good,"your only a number,not personal at all.to many drivers.good people but too many bosses."
good,Great company for a new driver to start out and get some experience.
good,OTR driver
good,If you have no family and are willing to work while knowing you are working for one of the lowest paying companies in the industry this is the company for you. I would ask many questions and do plenty of extensive research before heading off to orientation.
good,Daily work schedule is 8-5pm. They are a leader in Domestic truckload freight.
good,They taught me how to drive and load a truck. This was my first job in my new trade of the trucking world. I learned many different things. Most enjoyable part was seeing our country.
good,-Needs better communication
good,you drive 11 hour a day and sleep 10 no life
good,11/15 hr shift
good,Learned to handle difficult road situations and hazards.
good,"all mangerial duties including bank drops, hiring, training, terminations, ect"
good,my job as a truck driver i have to drive to the location and drop and pull which means i drive to where i have to deliver and leave the trailer part and pick up a diferrent trailer.. sometime i had to wait for the unload to finish but after that hit the road again i had fun..
good,Learn how to drive in slow as well as drive safe...Learn how to really operate a 18 wheeler
good,"I am an over the road trucker. I travel all over the United States, including Canada."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as an over the road truck driver. The team and company is really goo, and they will work with you"
good,drove products to various companies to arrive at appointed times to insure on time delivery
good,"I do not make a habit of rating previous employers. I find this leaves a serious flag, as not every employer can fill every need of every person who works for them."
good,I am satisfied with the time I spent with Werner. They have many accounts that you can choose from. They have excellent equipment to work with and they provide you with assistance over the road when you need it.
good,Some company just have a bad very bad apple in the batch of good apples. Some time u can look over the bad apple and some times u can’t when it’s bad enough to get u sick and enough to run u off the job even tho u really wanna stay. But one I can say I gave my life and dedication and my all and gave up my apartment and car to be fully committed to this company. It hurts to see this come to the end Nd.
good,Werner is a good starter company but after about six months most people are looking do you have better options. Better options to make money and home time.
good,People in charge there. Don't know what is going on. But no overtime for certain people. If you are not in the click. You are out of luck. It's easy work.
good,"Overall a great company, facilities are wonderful and they're always making improvements.  They have some unique schedules that offer alot of free time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Werner.  The equipment was top of the line and well maintained.  The terminals, for the most part, were nice and comfortable with showers and laundry.  The pay wasn't great but a lot of investment went into the equipment and terminals to create first-class landing sites for the drivers and a culture where we were comfortable and felt valued.  Werner's biggest problem is dispatch and driver support on the road.  Once your relationship with dispatch goes sour, they'll screw you right out of the company."
good,"I always loved driving a big rig -- it was always fun handling 50,000lbs+ of tractor and trailer, and I got pretty good at backing the one I had.   It was a challenge for me to get it in the first time, every time.    I do, however have serious concerns about trucking in general.   The trucking industry itself needs some serious revamping, especially where driving hours are concerned.   I drove for Werner for 2 years.   In that time I had numerous close calls, which certainly was not unexpected.   But, for me, the major thing was driving from midnight to 8:00AM.   I am of the firm opinion that the human body needs ample sleep to function properly.   And a wise creator made the night for sleeping and the day for working.   Now I know there are people who like that shift.   I can count on one hand the ones I've personally known who genuinely love that shift.   I was NOT one of them.   I HATED that shift.   After enduring a number of runs at those hours and nearly crashing the truck in the process, I feel that NOone should do it ALONE!   I would like to see a law put in place that, if an overnight run just can't avoided, then there should ALWAYS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION be a TWO-DRIVER TEAM doing that run so they switch off every 2 hours or so.   I can't count how many accidents on TV news reports in long haul trucking have been a direct result of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.   It's JUST NOT SAFE, for a DRIVER ALONE to make those midnight runs.   End of story!"
good,"Better pay would be great, I loved my job but with the pay I can’t make ends meet. The money isn’t consistent and I thought after me investing years I’ll at least be making over 50,000 but I’m only pushing 40,000 a year.."
good,"Well, Werner was my first driving experience job Im fortunate for the experience. I been with them for about one year and one  month, and I most say I've learned a lot over the year. They really cares about their employees."
good,"I worked in the Phoenix branch and would start off by saying my manager's there were amazing, its an older company & corporate needs to change to compete with modern 3PL providers."
good,any fresh out of truck driving school driver can get his road wings here learning all about the transportation industry decent dispatchers with good miles
good,Werner Enterprises is a good company to work for. It is a solid job with good job security. Work there is stressful though. Long work hours in high traffic as a driver with very little home time
good,"It wasn't a happy working environment for years. They dont like to give raises. Couldn't  go anywhere to move up. Just go there and put in your hours, wait till it's time to get off.  Use to say come on Sunday for my weekend. Had to for years fight for my vacations."
good,A typical day at work involves diagnosing and repairing tractor trailers. This is a great place for mechanics fresh out of school to work on the newest equipment available and get their experience up. Management is decent. The hardest part of the job is acquiring all the necessary tools with the little compensation given. The most enjoyable part of working for werner enterprises is working with great coworkers and working on top of the line equipment. Werner has been a decent place for me to work.
good,"As stated 650$ is about my weekly net take home after health insurance and taxes. They keep me running and after I drop the load they pretty much give me another very soon after. Minimum layover. Terminals are hit or miss i personally loathe the Atlanta, GA (had a bad experience repairing my truck there plus it’s very disorganized.)  Lakeland, Fl is good well organized."
good,It’s a ok job to start from and you can grow with the company but it takes to much time to get where you wanna be in your career which requires a lot of patience but I don’t know anyone who wants to be underpaid for the work they put out
good,it is an ok job. could be better. They need to do better background checks to protect trainees and or drivers. They know you by numbers. Need to pay more attention to people and not their numbers.
good,Great equipment. Great trucks and trailers. Good benefits. Pay is horrible. You wasn't making no money OTR. HomeTime was horrible. Could've been better.
good,"Good management during the weekdays, well maintained equipment, descent pay.  The days and nights can be really long. The hardest part of the job is construction delays which cause you to be late delivering your trailer which are unavoidable, wrecks, and breakdowns.  I enjoy the solitude to a certain extent and have learned quite a bit about the people from east to west coast."
good,"Typical work days are good, you start of with your daily pre-trip. Also you get to be out on the road. Management is ok, they try helping you when a problem occurs. The hardest part of the job is, you  are away from family and friends for long periods of time."
good,I trip on qualcom and obtain directions. I then proceed and locate the company/container and complete the delivery to the assigned customer. I learned different people attitudes/requirements.Management always provide heads up information. There were a variety of workers with whom it was a pleasure to work. The hardest part of the job was when there is not sufficient information but the most enjoyable part is the completion and a well done smile on faces.
good,I was only there for 3 months these people live buy the law thats a good thing they will put you in a nice truck but it wont idle and you have no apu but it was a experience
good,Easy job just driving up and down the highways. No touch freight. hardest part was being far from home for a month or more. best part was seeing the country.
good,Good trucking job to get some experience from. Use the experience to move on to better jobs. Management can be good or bad depending who your dispatcher is.
good,"good over all place to work good pay weekly min paid by the hour if you are a hard worker could make over 50,000 a year Safty bouns monthly and yearly odd hours due to traffic in Atlanta start times from 1 to 5 am"
good,"My first trainer was in it for the money only."
good,"My terminal is one of 11 for Werner Enterprises throughout the country.  Great people, but the management is not able to come through on all of its growth opportunities as promised.  Overall is a very sound company to work for if you lack desire for upward mobility or moving to Omaha, NE."
good,"Overall has been a good experience with home time, constant change in management affects drivers average workload and pay. Doesn't seem to honor seniority as with most transportation jobs, and inconsistency of loads affects pay severely. Otherwise, everything would be ideal."
good,"Short on pay or not getting the right amount as promise is normal for the new guys, that's the reason i leave. A lot of work with a huge fluctuation of food money in your paycheck. Remark ; food is expensive on the open highway, i don't know why..., but if you don't mind working for food this is the best company to join. Perfect job for homeless. i am not putting this company down because i hate them NO ! it is one of the company made by driver... i like the company itself, it is one of the biggest in the US. if you know somebody in the management or you are a good communicator...k. a. you will get a better pay, better truck and a better life."
good,Pretty much my experience was just work. You travel a whole lot from one state to the next. I loved the opportunities to see differents states and cultures. Talked to management often ; yet hardly ever socialized with co-workers because i was always working. Being only able to be home twice a month is beyond the hardest thing about this line of work. Seeing nearly or should i say traveling within almost all 50 states is a  story i enjoy telling!
good,"Was great place to start after military. The dispatchers only care about you getting the load there, they could care less about your well being."
good,"There really isn't a typical day. Driving a semi tractor trailer presents different challenges such as weather, location of where you pick up or drop your load at & traffic. You have to watch what other drivers on the road are doing, watch for low overpasses, tight turns. You have to weigh your rig to make sure your not overweight. You also must be careful to not high center your trailer."
good,Everyday was different at Werner that was something to look forward to..Its a good experience.
good,company good not a bad company to work for just need pay drivers more
good,70 hrs/week of driving should result in better than $600/wk
good,A typical day would be to wait on an assigned load and getting it delivered on time. I learned a lot about time management. Management was okay. There were alot of times that loads were dispatched late and still required to make deliveries on time. Met many of different people from across the US. The hardest part of the job is being away from home so long. Most of the time they wanted you to be out 2-3 weeks before getting you home. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling throughout the US.
good,It was a ok job there isn't a lot i can tell you about this company
good,"They will hire most anyone who applies, The pay is low the hours are long but a good place to start your career knowing that it is only a stop not the final place to be"
good,"Drove 48 states for about 8 months "
good,Saw good portion of the U.S. Dispatchers were usually good to work with. Planners did not seem to be worried about getting drivers home for military duty. My main frustration
good,The money was great and it was a great life experience I got to see alot of things I also learned alot I seen alot of the world not as easy as people think
good,"Driving a truck was a lot of fun! It didn't take long to tire of it unfortunately. It is tough work to drive a truck and takes a lot of skill. I enjoyed the year I spent on the truck, but prefer a bed without wheels!"
good,Werner is really restrictive because they're a training company.  All rules and regs are based around trainees. Easy to lose safety bonuses. Easy dispatch. Uses Omnitracs..
good,"The job was very challenging and was fast paced. It was very demanding and overwhelming, but it gave me the opportunity to grow professionally. If the schedule would've been more flexible and less stressful, it would've been a good career."
good,I got 3 years experience driving class A . And  casino 3 years experience. Construction 1 year and electrician 3 year ./ Carwash  carpet cleaning and drywall
good,"average otr driving company. enjoyed the routes and the many different places I visited along the way. it wasn't aqll that difficult to complete each drop and load, before moving to the next dropoff."
good,Good company for beginners to gain experience throughout the years working for Werner. Includes excellent benefits average miles pay satisfying to most driver's Well condition trucks new 2016 2017 models.
good,"Werner Enterprise offers you the tools you need to secede in the trucking business. The training is second to none. 35-40 days on the road training. A typical day starts out with you picking up a load, planning route for the load then getting on the road. Top priority is to get the load to its destination in a safe and timely manner. that includes rest, eating and fueling."
good,"Warner Co. is a leader in the manufacturing  and distribution of ladders,equipment,access products, and fall protection."
good,good place to work good trucks nice terminals the only bad side is you are never home but other then that is a good place to work would advise anyone who dont care to be gone from home to apply here
good,Werner is a good company as far as if your just beginning your truck driving career. they don't pay you fairly but you get valuable experience but if you get on an account you can make a good living
good,Lowest paying job I've ever had. Possibly could have been because it was the first trucking job I ever had.
good,"driving 48 states was fun ,but then relized it wasn't what i needed to do to acheive my goal."
good,"Typical day at doing regular preventive maintenance, following DOT guidlines, presenting mself as such. Personel is differs in qualifications, overall a great team player. Hardpoint on the job time management, doing good business, performance, attitude. Mission accomplishment is essential to getting paid."
good,its an ok companie to start out on for new drivers that just got there CDL. and drivers that just want to live on the road and don't have a home life what so ever the pays ok and so are the mils just don't let the dispatchers give you any grief
good,Days typically start as soon as you have driving hours. I learned it's best to plan your trip out and do a proper inspection daily. Management is always there to help you. There is no problem getting an advance when you need it. Co-workers are like family always willing to offer a hand. The hardest part about the job is not being able to see your family unless you get on a dedicated account. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see the world.
good,"Weekday dispatch was excellent, weekends not so much. Trip planners are quite unprofessional. I had very little exposure to other drivers for the company, except for my original trainer, who was shall we say set in his way, and not the easiest person to deal with. Hardest part of the job was being away from my family and down time, as in waiting for loads. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and being places I had never been before."
good,Loved the people. Supportive co-workers. But no real advancements available.
good,"Werner is a good company to work for, they respect people and courage people and they always try their best to keep the safety first , i learned many different things there"
good,This was a good company to get my start. I know that at any time I call I would be able to get a position. My typical work day was like any other trucking position
good,"was a temporary job at that time. did not have a problem working extra hrs. was close to home. i knew the boss before getting the job, so was easy walking in the door."
good,"Werner has a really top-notch training program and advancement opportunities for those who stick around.  Their starting salary for managers is low for the industry and doesn't take into account other past experience.  It is a great place to start for a young new grad, but not as much for an experienced leader starting fresh in Transportation,"
good,It wasn't too bad depending on the account you ran but home time was sometimes an issue. Also since the account I ran prearranged your schedule a week ahead of time if you're truck broke down you'd be screwed on miles since you would have to wait 10+ hours just to get your truck into the local TA or Petro.
good,"This is a big trucking company to work for, and It was a blessing to travel the world while working. There are some ways to improve better productivity among company assets."
good,"Great to see the sights as you drive by. This is the best way to see America! If you want to succeed in this job, you're constantly on the road. Family/Holiday time is almost never guaranteed, you will not make it home in time. You can ask but remember to expect disappointment."
good,"Work was easy, and I learned what it is to work together. Working with good-hearted people. People who are committed to team work, and quality."
good,"This is a great company to drive for if you are single, and no kids to come home too. If you plan on going home, have to send numerous requests in order to get home on time."
good,Great job for someone who enjoys to travel and drive. Helpful staff and great facilities for drivers.
good,I had to come home for a family reason and they paid my way and I was on my way home
good,While Werner for the most part is a good company they do treat their trainers poorly. Trainers are held accountable for a students performance once they are off the trainers trk. That is fine but it is not done fairly. One division is not held accountable while others are not.No one can tell us why. To make matters worse a trainer is still held responsible even if he fails the student and Werner gives that student a trk anyway. Come guys make your trainer program as good as the overall company is. Even with this problem Werner is still a great company to work for just needs some minor tweaking
good,"Good company to work for if they would stop the way they run their freight, ""pony express"" style. You hardly ever get to deliver the load from Shipper to Receiver before dispatch makes you split or swap the load with another driver some place along the way. This cuts into your paid mileage and also causes you to loose valuable working hours by having to sit and wait on the swap. Too much sitting and not enough miles."
good,load info usually comes in hours before time if not a day ahead which gives plenty of time to make the load on time or early. the hardest part of the job is not being bored from the routine because it was a dedicated run. the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing where you were going and what time you had to be there because it was a dedicated run.
good,Enterprises so don't know if I could go back to work there. Yes I stayed on the road a lot. Did not always get along with the fleet manager. But I was also hard to get along with. But all jobs are hard at times. Werner does try to help with anything you need. Overall in every trucking company there is problems.
good,"Work from Tuesday to Saturday, according what account you on"
good,"Being a over the road truck driver is very different from a regular job. you have to work within legal DOT hour of operation regulations. if you have driving hours you would receive word from dispatch to pick up a load and drop it at a different destination in a timely manner. I've learned a stronger awareness for hazardous drivers on the road, to keep myself safe and accident free. Being a professional driver mean every ones safety is in your hands, so drive to prevent unsafe incidents. "
good,"Great manager, payed on time, benefits.  I really like the place. I was hired for a Ferguson Account running flatbeds up and down the west coast. Reset at home."
good,Had very bad trainers. Felt like i was just a number. Some fleet managers were always in a bad mood. Pay was the same as my old job. Lied about pay rises.
good,"My only problem with Werner Ent is the pay per mile. You get the miles, but it you have to work even harder with trucks that only go 65mph. .21 cpm is getting paid minimum wage at a fast food place. Fleet mgr are great at getting you home."
good,benefits are great but they want teams in all trucks so the trucks can keep moving they give preference to teams or trainers solo drivers will sit until all team trucks have loads
good,is an ok company for rookie drivers your alone alot and pay sucks for what you do
good,As a truck driver OTR is definitely a experience & dealt with all types of weather & also with other individuals on the road. It has it's up & down...
good,Great starting company for new drivers. Hard lifestyle for team driving OTR. My family and I cannot go OTR at this time. Liked the adventure but no down time to really relax or explore. Just the daily daily grind to get there. Good dispatch except at night and on weekends.
good,You go to the terminal.Get your job assignment which will be a family dollar some where along the northeast.Your trailer can have up to six different family dollar stores on it but normally its only 2 or 3 stores.You will unload all products in family dollar one store can take 4-5 hours.I thought I was gone be paid 100 per store but they only wanna pay 100 dollars per trailer & maybe 10 - 15 dollars per store which is ridiculous
good,"This is a good company to get experience as a driver in the trucking industry, and will give you the ability to learn the needed skills if you are a hard worker, and are a trainable individual."
good,"I liked working here , just me in my truck and my instructions sent to me on a Qualcom, not much interaction or anyone looking over my shoulder just gave directions and carried them out and went on to the next job"
good,"i worked with werner for 1 year and i loved it but i hated the limited amount of home time and how they seemed to always have to make you go out of your way to get home. The companys is a great company dont get me wrong , but was not for me. And i got injured on the job and i got tossed out without a second thought."
good,"The following Pros and Cons will speak for themselves. Its an excellent place to start a CDL career, but there are no opportunities to move up and out of a truck."
good,"DOT inspection of truck, pick up and have freight loaded. drive 10-2500 miles drop off freight. make bathroom/food/gas stops and hope every time you complete your 10-14hr day your at a location that has clean bathrooms and showers."
good,"the pay is less than the national average, the home time is non-exsistiant, but thier are worse places to drive for"
good,"my job was transporting anheuser busch products across the states. i learned to be a more safe driver from hauling these products, the management is ok could improve a little more to make drivers feel better about there job."
good,I didn't like the trucking life. Wasn't for me. My training lasted way longer than it was supposed to. I also had a hard time maintaining my bills with the minimum money i was being paid weekly.
good,Work 6 12 hour or more days per week for a compensation that works out to around $12 per hour.  Good equipment and management that cares about employees.  Their hands are tied by corporate to really pay what people are worth.
good,This is a good starter company. Mileage advancements are slow. A lot of North East runs during the winter months. Good equipment. Maintenance is slow.
good,Always ready for my next load. I rather know my next load ahead of time. Pre-trip once I find out my load. I would leave early before my dock out time due to traffic and road work.
good,"out of a yr I maybe spent 2wks home"
good,A good place to learn the skills to drive a tractor trailer. It was a place to learn the ropes and advance to a new job in this field. I had a good time working there  besides its a lifestyle not a job.
good,Good company to work for looking for something closer to home. More home time. I'm also looking for a job that is more drop and hook and not me unloading.
good,"i would come in and sort mail and fax the mail to the proper individual."
good,I found it very interesting driving over the road and a truck driver in training but I then found local work. I worked for a very short time due to finding another position.
good,I got to do a little travel and get paid in the progress.The hardest part was being away from my family for weeks at a time.
good,"11hr of driving, sleep then back to driving. every day.  u get bearly get any time off at home."
good,It was a large company which employs new out of school employees. It is a fairly decent starting job for new trucking employees
good,i spent most of my day driving
good,Not a bad place to work overall.  The work is demanding and away from home alot. Definitely recommend this for someone just starting out in the field.  Good experience overall.
good,"The dispatchers especially the over night and weekend have poor communication with the fleet managers. Company wants you to stay out 1 week to get one day off. The dispatchers don’t care about your life and only talk to you when they need you to pick up or drop off a load. The pay is low. Starting with .38 per mile for 48 state runs. OTR. Solo. The good is that, you get assigned a truck to yourself that you can take home on home time. They get you home one day after your request date. Saftey is a number one at this company so if you have anything bad on your truck or trailer, they’ll get it fixed ASAP. They also have you take computer based training through out the year to refresh your mind about the hazards on the roads durning seasons."
good,"Worked DG account, hardest driving job.  Better for home time if u live close to DGDC.  Better money to make in Northeast DC area.  Work close with your dispatch to coordinate most runs for the week."
good,"Great place to work as a starter company if looking to have a local job. Worked for a year to get ""Experience"" Then I took a local Job. Which is a common occurrence with new drivers. But on the flip side there are a lot of drivers that make a career at this company. Find what you like and go from there!"
good,"This company is a good company to work for. I found that most of the OTR dispatchers are kind of difficult to work with, but I had an excellent time working with a dedicated account and their fleet managers. Over all its a decent company to work for with good benefits and pay."
good,"Life on the road. It is the same company as any other trucking company. Just with a different name. The focus is on anything but the driver. But then that is trucking,."
good,Did like working here. Salary was ok. learned a lot about trucking industry. got hurt on the job and was laid off. company did have good medical and PTO
good,I don't enjoy being away from home but it pays the bills. I learned how to be more patient and driving more safely in highly populated areas. Management sometimes lacks distributing loads. The workplace culture is very dangerous but i navigate safely. The hardest part of the job is finding the time to get enough sleep. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to drive to new places meeting new people.
good,"I enjoyed working for Werner Enterprises, management left alot to be desired.  A lot of men working there to women ratio.  Comments made were not the most desirable.  Favorites played a big part of the culture within the company."
good,worked there for 3 years great pay they had poor communication skills with dispatch and break downs hard time getting home monthly they don't care about there drivers
good,There is alittle disconnect from day and night dispatch but overall i don't think it was a bad position at all. I worked hard and they treated me fairly. I didn't like the slip seating position i was in but i made good money.
good,"Companhia de grande porte, acredito ser uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar, porem dirigir por meses sem parar em casa por alguns dias não acredito ser muito saudável, conheci muitos lugares bonitos, aprendi a controlar mais meu tempo, salário decente, finalmente consegui liquidar meus débitos."
good,Every day at werner enterprises in an interesting one. I'm going to leave it at that. Overall its a great company to learn and train with. The managers at times are a bit confused.
good,"not a bad job just ready to come off the rd i travel all 48 states going to different shippers and consignees i put on about 10,000 miles a months the hardest part of the job is being gone all the time i have no life with family cuz im never there and im a solo driver so no co workers 11 to 14 hr work day depending on diff shippers and how fast i get loaded"
good,If you are a go getter you’re better off by keep looking.  I was told by fleet manager that they want you to be available after your 10 hour break.  Not so much a reality.  I’m told to take a 34 hour reset which turns into 60hours then pick up a broker load to drive 6hours and sit for 40 hours.  I request home time once a month and I get it (almost).  I’m usually sent the furthest away and only get 150 mile personal conveyance which makes me take a 10 hour break if 8 hour split won’t work.  Average weekly pay runs $1100-$1700.  Occasionally it drops to $700 week.  Every time you call you’re asked what’s your truck number or what’s your employee number.  Big business.
good,"Long hours,  fast pace no time to relax hardest part  of the job was trying to sleep while co-driver is driving.  A great way to see the country and to visit place on your time off"
good,Worked the  Dedicated Dollar General in Fulton Missouri main manager didnt like family  Oriented people working there he wanted people to do what he said to do instead of going home to their families
good,"However , they do have employee appreciation day where they do give away free food .. that the only nice thing I have seen others then the fact that they try to solve problems"
good,Tough job and the working conditions are horrible. Pay is pretty good. Management is pretty friendly. They did have picks and chooses as far as who made the most money.
good,Learned where the home office was located and drove the infamous Route 66. Saw the I-80 Truck Stop in Nebraska.  Hardest part was learning how to drive a standard transmission and being away from home so much.
good,This job is a decent start for entry level long haul trucker.  Miles decent if you stay out for at least 6 to 8 weeks at a time otherwise miles fall around 1800 per week.
good,Entered in this company through Suburban Truck Driving School and passed the test.  Then went to Indiana for training at their facility and paired up with a Trainer that went on the road for 2 months.
good,"I absolutely loved my job, however I was not being paid for what I should have been so I had to find employment else where. This is not something that I wanted to do as that was my favorite job ever"
good,"too much time on the road,.not enough home, time,trucks not fast enough,too much sitting,not enough pay,overall though decent equipment,and decent fleet managers,"
good,"There are those few who make a career of the company, and while that's well and good - I just wanted to get some experience. All in all I had a great time working there."
good,"Dispatchers were incentivized...they had no"
good,The vast majority of my day was driving a truck from one destination to another. Some days it was good some days it was long and trying between some other drivers and road construction
good,Fast pace logistics department. Learned a lot of business and technical skills. Enjoyable workplace. Enjoyed working with the developers and business to create applications
good,"Weekly pay, Direct Deposit, Decent benefits"
good,the pay is really competitive. The overall experience is very rewarding. They really work as a team on dedicated account I am on.
good,"A typical day at work is waking up doing pre-trip on truck and trailer. "
good,This company is great for individuals that like to be away from home all the time.  Not a company for individuals who want to be close to home because if there is not loads available you do not make any money.
good,"Pick up loads and make sure bill of ladins in order, plan route for safest and shortest route to deliver on time. Supervised student drivers and trouble shoot and teach correct way on driving truck and how to follow federal guide lines.        Hardest part of job was being away from family for 3 1/2 weeks at a time.  Best part of my job was teaching the students and seeing them accell at what I taught them."
good,Very good company to work for. Economy got this one though. Home time is not always when scheduled. But as long as your getting good mileage and on time you are okay. Great starter company for commercial drivers.
good,"OTR truck Driver, delivered to all US stated and Canada. Keep log books and have knowledge of state laws"
good,"They take care of their drivers and equipment but if something goes wrong and you are involved in any way, they cut you loose lightening fast and ruin your life by putting false information on your dac report. And refuse to remove it."
good,Its a great company to help you get into commercial truck driving.. there equipment is very well taken care of and the staff are very helpful.........
good,"As a driver, you find that your hours can be quite long indeed.  Oftentimes, you'll find yourself driving for 11 hours, almost non-stop, maybe a short break to grab a bite to eat while you're fueling your truck.  Other times, you might be sitting for hours on end, waiting on a load.  I've been to customers where I'm scheduled to pick up first thing of the morning and they wouldn't have my load ready until mid-day. Some loads, you pick up one morning and have to pretty much drive all day so you can be at the delivery early enough to get some sleep as you aren't to deliver until early the next morning.  There are some accounts where you pretty much do the same thing day after day, but the general driver will have a variety of loads to haul.  You are required to have a hazmat addition to your license and must pass a drug test.  The job can be stressful, but can also be quite fun.  I think my biggest joy/complaint was all of the alone time.  Unless you're a team driver, you have a lot of time by yourself, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing."
good,I think Werner was a very good company for me as a first time driver . All of te trainers and staff were very nice and knowledgeable. The trucks are new and in great condition.
good,Love working for them just didn't get to get home in time for my kids so over the road just didn't work for me at that time in my life. But it's a good company to work for
good,"I am not willing to participate in this review. But since i must enter something in this blank, then i have no choice, Okay let me continue to write gibberish in this space."
good,"Good company with great benefits. There is alot of advancement possibilities. If you like fast paced and challenging work, I would recommend looking into them."
good,"Werner trucking is well ran. There is a clear line of communication,  between the drivers and dispatchers.  Also there is a good accountability system, for driver manager relationships."
good,"My experience with Werner was a good one. It's a great place to start and get the experience you need to flourish in the trucking industry. They gave me a opportunity when no one else would because of my lack of experience. It's not the place where you're going to see a lot of money, but a good place to get your experience and then go somewhere else to see better returns monetarily for your time away from family. I will always be grateful to Werner family!!"
good,I was excited about beginning my career as a truck driver. This company offers many different opportunities for truck drivers both with and without driving experience.
good,I had just began my career with this company and if management could just really listen and heed to driver's concerns this would have been a great place to continue to advance .
good,Very decent people for the most part. You want get rich. Or you'll never be home. Trucking in General is a lot of time away. Werner has no paid time off. Does not pay Detention when stuck at shipper or receiver. Layover pay is only 50.00 every 24hrs. No Paid sick days. Runs their own workers comp dept do not want to pay any claim if your hurt on the job. Records all non dot incidents.
good,It was a good place of employment. Werner enterprises was very honest about pay and about miles per week as well as hometime.  I would recommend Werner.
good,"I had to pick up and drop loads. Travel through different States, and cities. Also, I had to go through bad weather. It was so hard at times but it was fun and unique."
good,Good company to work for. they don't treat you like a number and they keep you moving. Good time off request and dependable equipment. All around good.
good,I have nothing bad to say about werner. If youre just starting at truck driving i highly recommend starting here. Easy going knowledgeable Fleet managers. Great equipment.
good,"This is a good company to start your trucking career with, some people have even decided to stay with the company even after gaining experience. Pay is good even for training. Home time is okay. Good company if you don't mind being on the road all the time"
good,Pulling werner DG is okay if ur single but be prepared when u go home and all you want to dois  lay in bed haha. I lost weight doin the job but it does not pay to unload that truck by hand then drive mo
good,"Werner is a great place to start your career as a truck driver. If you're a dedicated, hard worker and don't mind staying in the truck for lengths of time then you can have a very successful career at Werner Enterprises."
good,The pay was not the best in the industry but not the worst. Miles were decent but home time and your health came secondary to company needs. Compensation for layovers and maintenance was poor.
good,I love the training program they offer. It was very thorough and I learned many helpful skills. It's a good place when graduating truck driving school.
good,"Pre trip. plan my route and take off to my destination and p/u or make my delivery on time, You need to be comfortable being away from home long periods of time."
good,I drove quite a few miles in a short amount of time. I didn’t mind it because it was my first CDL job. And it doesn’t hurt when you have a driving partner in the truck with you either.
good,OK place to work.   Started out small then grew very large.   Typical office politics are on display.
good,"They put me with a girl who didn't care and only wanted to meet other drivers.  It was not a good environment. I was then pushed to get us to our destination because she didn't drive enough in her time slot. "
good,Flexible Company but hrs involved away from home just doesn’t make it worth the sacrifice an income. Werner is a large company with lots of Frieght to be moved. Trucking is a good job but in my opinion a person can make equal but probably more money doing a much less stressful line of work. I’ve met many long time drivers that stay with it but I’m to high strung to deal with all the recklessness that goes on almost daily. No fault of Werner of course!
good,Company has a good maintenance program with good pay and benefits.  Would be a better place to work with better site Management and more professional work environment.
good,"My department lacked a lot of support from upper management. We were promised additional people to help with an increase in work load, but the additional hires never came."
good,I think I would have enjoyed working there. I regret a stupid one time poor decision in my private life. Would have a negative impact on my chance to shine.
good,It was a fun working environment. the company will keep you busy . the equipment is decent shape. You will get your home as promised and you can even have your significant other ride sometime provided that you purchased a side liability insurance for him or her.
good,"really dont have too much to say , otr driving with big companies is a gamble with economy workforce. just don't get suck in with buying a rig unless you have $$$$$$$ in the bank to fall back on."
good,This is a good place to start truck driving. The company is structured very well for  new drivers. The equipment given is in good shape and everyone I talked to was very nice.
good,"werner was good to work for. the company  they  pulled for didnt care how the trailers were loaded causing injury to some of the drivers,and would not change the way they were loaded"
good,"Werner was a great company to drive for, I left to make better money sooner and have more home time. I was on a dedicated account for dollar general, but Werner has many options for drivers based off how much you want to make and want to be home. Like most trucking jobs the more you make the less you'll be home."
good,"Safety team is great. Training department desires a bit. Trucks are newer and they are adding new trailers every year. "
good,"I feel that there are things within the company that needs to be fixed"
good,the pay was low and the terminals were old and out of date. but i had a great team and lots of room for advancement. they also have an awesome training program
good,Hard work but was able to complete it everyday. They held workshop to keep us safe. Held family events. Used company truck to travel to well sites. Used common hand tools
good,"It was a good job, hauled dry good product all over Uniited States, saw a lot of country, drove a 53"" tractor-trailer to towns and city's"
good,"Extremely hard work in a short amount of time, but I loved it. Wish I could have another job like this. Everyone was nice to me, since I was the only woman there."
good,"I had the opportunity to drive tractor trailer for Werner. I gained lots of skill that help me maneuver much better throughout my daily runs. ultimately I had to leave the company do to the lack of home time and staying local for family. what I like the most about this company, is you're always welcome back to come and drive for Werner Enterprises."
good,"was never home and was always a hassle to have home time. the pay did not make up for the lack of home time and always being gone. was a fun and memorable experience that tough me skills i will keep with me, but the lack of pay and home time was to harsh."
good,"Pre -trip, driving, traveling, making money, 10 hours breaks, driving for 10 hours. Seeing new places. Learning how to hold the truck in the road,"
good,"I drive through out the 48 states, i have learn the danger of the roads . i interact with fellow driver when i am on a terminal or gas station and we pass info on the road condition and weather. The hard part of this job is the time you spend without your family because to make money been a driver you need to be on the road for months. is when you interact with other drivers specially with the old ones because i feel I am talking to a Veteran they like to tell their stories."
good,I started driving for them. they did not pay well but were still good to work for. I had plenty of home time and good benifits
good,"Provided,and supervised individualized Training and Certification for every driver who is hired at Werner Enterprises Inc."
good,I came right out of truck driving school and got a job with these two companies to get my OTR experience.  You will never be home so don't ask.  I was in the Army Reserve and that was my 2 days home.
good,hauling tri axle and quad alxe trailers unlaoding and loading trailer and del produce the work places is very friendly. safety company to work for
good,Great experience and good team players. I was able to move from a driver to a Safety Specialist where I learned a lot about transportation.
good,Was a good company to work for.  Would be a great job if you are single or are ok with being away from family for unknown amounts of time.
good,"I drove a tractor-trailer to deliver goods from a distribution center to retail stores. I learned about shipping and receiving as well as the basics of logistics. Management was very professional and really seemed to care about their drivers. I would see my co-workers every now and then, and we would have a good time discussing our various work experiences. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and being away from home. The most enjoyable part was seeing different parts of the country."
good,"Operated a commercial motor vehicle to transport freight inter or intra relay                                     "
good,I learned a lot from Werner. The Do's and Don'ts of trucking. My trainer was very helpful. Werner also has plenty of opportunities for different peoples lifestyle. I would recommend Werner.
good,"If you're into traveling for an income, this job could be your ticket. I didn't like the time spent away from home. Trainee pay could use a boost, especially if trainee has a family to take care of while on the road, until training has been completed."
good,"This job was one of the most interesting jobs that I ever had. I used to start early in the morning and driving approximately between 450-580 miles per day. I always had a constantly load, so I never waited too much for a load. The clients always were kind and very helpful as well as my dispatchers. Here I learned how to maneuver a tractor trailer, track a route, read very well a map, freight, how to set up the tandem by the weight, how to used the electronic log system, ""Qualcomm"", how to fill the logbook manually, etc.  I crossed almost over the 48 states. The hardest part of the job deal with the weather conditions.  I really enjoyed this job.  I visited many beautiful places.  Traveling through the states was an amazing experience."
good,"It is a nice place to work if you are a student, They will work around your hours and you can do homework while you work"
good,"flexible hours, self managed. Learned the responsibility's of a truck driver. Hardest part was dealing with other drivers on the roads. Most enjoyable part was not being micromanaged."
good,"Lot of opening, good way to gain experience. Alot of turnover within the company leads to more advancement. Some issues with getting any help from upper management."
good,I had a very good working relationship with my fleet managers and they were very good at keeping me on the road instead of sitting for my next assignments.
good,I enjoyed this job because I got to see alot of this beautiful country
good,I have accomplished driving a semi truck. I was over the road driver and I was very safe. I had to leave this job and come home due to my wife health. Other than that I was never late with an order and work very well with others. I am the best team player you will ever see. Hardest part of a job for me is management keeping me busy for I actively look for stuff to do with out forsaken my other task.
good,la empresa es tiene un estabilidad normal y creo que a sido una de la mejores empresas que e trabajo.
good,"I think the experience ubiera been better if the driving instructor give greater attention to their work, new and late model trucks, very good team and driver managers always in a good mood,"
good,Driving is one of the best jobs you can have.  On your own with no one to look over your shoulders.  Traveling over the road seeing new places and faces is very relaxing.  You learn a lot about the road and people.  Became an Owner Operator which was outstanding.
good,I learned alot about Transportation and Distribution. I also learned alot about Geographies working with this company.
good,Enjoyed driving out on the open road. They kept me busy which meant is was making money.
good,"On a typical day on this job you wake up in your truck and drive or deliver to your drop area you reall have no time for spending time with family other then when your not on the road, you have a lot of thinking time will driving 9 to 10 hours out of the day"
good,get the load there is there Only concern which is OK but Very little Guidance or concern for a drivers long term goals or what to watch out 4 that may effect a drivers career Pro or Con...
good,The hardest part of my job was driving 11 hours shifts on a full stomach.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to deliver to different states and cities
good,driving truck 600 to 1000 miles a day depending on if u had student very reliable company on pay an benefits an miles ran
good,driving a tractor-trailer and picking up and delivering was a typical day at work.
good,I drove throughout the US. Everyday was somewhere different.
good,"Werner has new equipment, supports its drivers, has comfortable, well-equipped driver areas at its Terminals, decent benefits, and ok pay.. especially if you stay."
good,"Other than the lame training, once I got on my own as a solo driver, things smoothed our pretty well. Management on the Family Dollar Account In NY were always willing to help you out. Great place to start out with if it’s not totally for you being there “long term” speaking. I’m working for a local company now and I feel some type of way about leaving Werner."
good,Werner enterprises is a great place to start of in you driving career and a great company. The hardest part was the loneliness on the road . Management is good great terminals and newer trucks.
good,"Werner It's a best place for student to start working. They give you good treatment, Nice Hotel, top pay for student, and they ofer you a full benefits."
good,I wish I would never had to leave working for Werner.  I received a medical problem.  But it has been resolved. But I have not heard from Werner Enterprises so don't know if I could go back to work there. Yes I stayed on the road a lot. Did not always get along with the fleet manager.  But I was also hard to get along with.  But all jobs are hard at times.  Werner does try to help with anything you need. Overall in every trucking company there is problems.
good,Trucking on the road is not for everyone. You have to pay out of pocket for food and the food is not the healthiest. It can be pretty hard to eat healthy. They have a lot of new trucks though. very good equipment and benefits are good. Be prepared to never be home if choosing on the road. As a new driver you will be paid low cents per mile. You need 2 years of experience before you see any real money.
good,"Ist an amazing company to work for. Like every company it has ups and downs, usually you get a lot of miles, but sometimes in not like that. I couldn't figure it out if  is for bad planning or actually loads on the area you are working. In my personnal experience I'm kept in the same area and I would like to have the opportunity to travel the entire country all the time, not spending 2 weeks in the north east and when I'm almost heading home be sent to the west. Overall it's an amazing starter company with super good trucks and lot of resource for a safe travel without worried of breakdowns and uncountless down time. I wish the pay better though"
good,"The equipment at this company is one of the best of the industry, also how to maintain the paper work to be legal all the time over the road. excellent communication."
good,I would be willing to discuss this in more detail in person.  The company was fair to me and I gave them exceptional value in return.  The company is very strong financially and debt free.
good,"Werner Enterprises has a lot going for it and a strong history.  My time there was productive and I had great experiences with drivers and fellow employees.  Management makes all the difference as with many jobs, and there were some that ran their departments better than others."
good,I enjoy working at Werner it is not a bad job. They always helped me if I needed it. But I’m just looking for something with more of a set schedule and routine.
good,This company always making mistake with your money and want you to wait until the next week for your money.. If you decide to work make sure you double check everything.
good,Werner as a trucking company was great. Time management was a bit behind. I was mislead on when things were going to be done and home time was not promised in the account I entered. The training was wonderful and beneficial. At the time I needed to be home more often and they had nothing available then.
good,"Werner has been very good to me with annual raises and positive feedback on performance. They value people in positons located outside the headquarters in Omaha, NE."
good,on my self i like it because i did what i always dream become a truck driver and i learn from my instructor that which company will paid you to see and to know new states that's how i see it.
good,"following all hos regulations and all traffic laws. drop and hook, no touch freight. pre - and post-trip inspections. was in orientation one day and the next i was on the road."
good,Ok if you don't have a life. They tell you one thing and then change it. Don't do the Dollar General account. They want you to kill yourself with low pay.
good,"I have no complaints about Werner as a company. My loads were generally set back to back, I got to see 28 states and travel on company dime and get paid doing it. Only reason I left was because i got homesick. If I didn't have a life back home I'd still be on the road with them today."
good,"Got me right out of Roadmaster, they had a local home daily account that I was able to land. Paid pretty decent for a new green horn, and the hauls were pretty good. I was looking for a consistent daily time frame. They cover nothing on your health insurance, so its expenseive."
good,I got a really great work out everyday working for Werner Enterprise. If I could I would still be with them today but I have to wait a year before I can go back. If Yard Goat driving pays more or some what the same there's a chance I won't go back to Werner Enterprise...
good,"I was a student trainer and a ""pro-Trainer"", meaning I trained other trainers. I taught in a classroom for Smith System training, new employee orientation, Train the trainer, loggin system, and other topics as required."
good,"With Werner you get out what you put in, its not the worst company on the planet but its far from the best. the bottom line is get in keep your nose clean, doors closed, and wheels turning get your 2yrs OTR experience then find a company willing to properly compensate you."
good,"As a Dedicated Driver a typical work day would consist of picking up tractor/trailer of loaded items from the distribution center and drive to stores on my regional route usually 3 to 4 stores a day delivering 1500 2000 items. "
good,good company to work for and you get to see the better part of united states and both borders and get to meet a lot of different people the benifits are good
good,"Let me start off by saying I've been with this company a little over a year and made about 40k that's including training pay which is about 550 dollars a week , training is very long depending on your trainers route be it dedicated or otr. My trainer was otr so my training took about 4 1/2 weeks but I've heard some say upwards of 8 weeks to finish training . Anyway this company is a good company to start with and it all depends on your fleet manager how much you make for miles, I avg. 2500- 2800 a week but have done a few 3000+ mile weeks at .36 CPM BUT in the begining they want to make sure you wanna run before they give you steady miles but once you prove yourself you will get a good paycheck, let's get real you aren't going to get rich doing this but it's good enough to live off of for now . You will be challenged at times this is not a 9-5 job you will work 10-14 hr days with some unpaid time put in. Hometime is not bad 1.5 days off for every 7 days out and if you can run you can get home generally on time I've never went home after the date I requested . You will occasionally get a NYC run but I've only had one in the year I've been here. Trucks run 65mph governed and are both manual and automatic, primarily automatics now . All in all with any company a good manager can make you or break you"
good,The work environment is one that I have never experience before. There are enough activities on site to keep you occupied per. Had a chance to make some great friends. The early mornings become wearing after time.
good,"You ensure safe operation, and on time pick up and deliveries, in compliance with DOT regulations. You  assist workers in loading and unloading your trailer•	Perform effective Trip planning to safely and effectively complete your trips and always plan for the amount of time you can legally drive during your 11 hour period.  The hardest part of the job is the time you spend away from your family, the most enjoyable part is visiting different places all over the United States"
good,Good job  starting out in the business and you learn a lot about OTR driving. However the pay is low and there is quite a bit of lag time between runs.
good,was able to travel in safe good up to date equipment worked well with some uper supervisors  The length of time being with company allowed me to see and grow with the company  New federal laws on trucking took all the enjoyment out of working
good,"There are a lot a good people working here. Some upper management are really bad people (snobs, think they are better than EVERYONE and will make sure you know it) Senior management of the company seems to do a great job and I think they do a great job keeping employees informed. "
good,"They will give you plenty of miles. With 2 weeks out and 2 days home. If your one of the drivers that like plenty of home time this is not the company for you. It is a good company to work for, definitely for new drivers. Or someone who made a few honest mistakes and need to work a few years until the record cleans up a bit. They dont need anymore steering wheel holders they have enough of them. I would refer someone to them that is just starting out. But be prepared to catch an ear full on the CB just because you drive a Warner truck. I got into it with another driver because he liked to run his mouth off. The best thing to do is just reach up and turn it off and let them run the there mouth. And focus on you job. Oh and the pay isn't all that great unless your on dedicated accounts. Stay away from the regional runs. Good luck to all you drivers for what ever you decide. And as I do always I pray to the Lord for all you drivers to return safely home to your friend and family."
good,"I'm new to the driving world, only worked here one year, but you have to start somewhere and Werner has been very helpful to me in my career so far. I started out driving teams and I would not recommend it, they didn't give us enough miles, however since switching to solo OTR I have been getting good loads and better pay. My driving manager is knowledgeable and cares about how I'm doing."
good,I've been with this company or two years and some.  It's a really great place to start if your fresh out of training school. The fleet managers are very reasonable and I don't think I recall ever having any that weren't.
good,This was a very fast paced company.  The supervisors there make it as fun as they can while making sure that the customers are always taken care of.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Werner. The work was difficult at times but my supervisor was the best supervisor I have ever worked for."
good,"Typical day at work is to insure all appointments are set for the drivers you are responsible for, check all trucks for on time delivery, notify customers of any potential late loads. Answer phones and process messages while doing the above along with answering e-mails, driver assistance at the driver window. Multi-tasking is second nature. Responsible on a daily basis for about 50 trucks. On weekends 150."

good,"Aprendi com a empresa werner que ainda ha quem pegue no mercado de trabalho uma pessoa sem formaçao, e a qualifique, dando a esse profissional uma chance de se tornar capaz;qualificado. A parte mais agradavel do trabalho, e ver a satisfaçao do seu cliente no momento que voce conclui o trabalho, ver que voce conseguiu ajuda-lo nao so com o visual, mas principalmente, com o que ele foi realmente buscar; um momento de desabafo, desestresse, de poder lembra-lo que viver e uma arte que sempre vale a pena, e que na contabilidade final, sempre ah mais coisas boas do que ruins; ver que voce conseguiu acrescentar algo inimaginavel na vida de pessoas que voce julga nao necessitarem de nada.          "
good,A driving job is exactly that. Driving from state to state. All the people I had encounters with at this company were very pleasant. I'd say the most difficult part of the job is just being away from home.
good,"Usually have something dispatched once you've delivered. Trucks mostly consists of Cascadias; also have Peterbilt 386, Kenworth T660, International ProStar, and Volvo VNLs. Dispatchers treat you like the number assigned to your truck; impersonal. Will pay bi-weekly, not daily like Knight. Equipment usually in good shape, governed at 65 MPH. No APU's. If working regional, will avoid going to Cali or some of the western states. Will try to keep you from Denver to Oklahoma City and in-between. Unfortunately, company losing contracts with companies, which means losing running time."
good,"The skills of the trainers arn't in question. They're good drivers, but the trainer I was put under was rude, pushy, and working in an environment he shouldn't be in. Trucks get dirty and he was a germaphobe. He also admitted he was only doing it to pay child support and didn't care about how well I did and didn't do. Bless any poor soul that gets him in the future."
good,i had learned about different places and routes. I have meet a lot of people in my driving all the co workers are very friendly is nice to meet one of them out in the road. The management is alright but i think they can do better as we do. Hard time in job is the weather always random depends where you heading. I enjoy the driving i can see the country as i work
good,just not the job for me at this point in my life. with two young children and only being 25 and recently getting out of the military another job that keeps me away from home for extended periods of time is not sufficient.
good,"Worked for Werner 24 months and always felt like part"
good,Well at Werner Bros. we had to wait for our next load to pickup sometimes it can be within a couple of days. The management was average and understanding. I had a team driver and the person that drove with me he was also a hardworker and loved to drive just as much as myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving state to state and meeting other drivers.
good,This is A good place to work for the new truck driver and if you like living your life on the road. this is a good job for you.
good,"A typical day involves planning a route, and the time available on log."
good,Pick up a load trailer from a customer and deliver to other customer it will requir you to drive from state to state.
good,It was nice going alot of places i had never been.
good,"The typical day of work required me to drive a semi truck across the country delivering dry goods to various locations throughout the U.S. I learned how to navigate and plan my trips and deal with detours. The management communicated with me through a Qualcomm, a communications device that tracked my mileage. There were no coworkers involved. The hardest part of the job was being on the road was no having much free time and being stuck in the truck at a truck stop instead of in a bed. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing many different parts of the country as I drove through it. I would have liked to stay a see more of the sites after hours."
good,"I love going to state to state it eas was a beatification site place I’ve never been it was nice adventure ,I love it but the pay wasn’t great when I was out there"
good,Werner is a good starter job. You will make money as long as you bust your butt. I did pretty well just wanted a local job so i could be home with the family.
good,Great process but you must put in the effort if you want to learn. Trainers are either good or bad. Everything depends on your dispatch. Communication was great but it is what it is
good,This company is great I never had an issue with my fleet manager or anything it's just not made for a family man I will say though they need to update there fuel stops because sometimes they are hard to find and so few of them are around certain areas
good,It's a good company to start with. I just didn't like they dont do PTO or vacation time. Other then that it's a great place and good people there and they keep up on on all there trucks
good,"Managements is poor"
good,"A typical day as a truck driver was up and down. Had to take the bad with the good. Some days were uneventful and others with events. there were maintenance issues and some day no issues."
good,Always have something for you to do also they pay for your school tuition by reimbursement very nice people they do show their appreciation towards you I would definitely recommend working here just be prepared to work a few weeks out and not long enough home time but then again it's the industry
good,"Ok i guess, i was unfairly let go after 7 years, with zero write ups or bad reviews. They did pay for me to transfer to a different state. That was a plus."
good,It’s a alright company to work for decent pay and benefits but management could be better depending on what account you end up at. I would go back for the money but that’s it.
good,"Werner is a Great company to start out with, straight out of CDL School go to werner. Great training!!! Ok Pay but not good enough to stay especially after 1 year. Great Tractors!!!! Trailer are well maintained also. Nice Terminals too. I just hate OTR, its like I have no life!!! I need a local CDL job."
good,"Many equipment issues,  mainly caused by younger drivers that didn't care for the conditions of trucks and trailers.  Most problems went unreported.  Columbus Ohio office management good too work for and very willing to help with problems."
good,Werner is a overall great company but there are a lot of competition paying jobs out here. I love working for them but the pay doesn’t meet my means of living
good,"It’s a good company good pay "
good,"The company is good to work for the culture is not for me however. hardly ever a dull moment and can be stressful at times. Managing drivers is a good way to develop multiple skills sets including, Time management, and communication"
good,"The company treats employees very well and management pretty much leaves you alone to do your job. Pay increases are extremely rare, though. Very few opportunities to advance"
good,"Great company for single people. had to be out for multiple weeks at a time. good working equipment, took care of issues in a timely manor. I felt like they took care of me."
good,"Overall it's a good place to work if you're just starting out and looking for experience or something long-term "
good,The hours are long but benefits are good. Work day is fast paced and requires a lot of attention to detail. Some days can be very hectic but most a carry a fair work load.
good,Long hard runs. Not home much so hard on the family life. You did make fairly good money. There was days when loads didn't come in. So you did sit for a day maybe 2 at a truck stop or terminal
good,werner is a great company to work for. it is perfect for new drivers fresh out of cdl school. they provide new (or near as) equipment and the fleet managers put their drivers first
good,Very busy schedule. working in a dedicated account made sure to have the number of miles available be more predictable from week to week. The management if you had a good dispatcher would do their best to get you home when you needed to be home.
good,Everything was a ok until out of the blue I was told my job was being cut out and there was no work for me. They gave no warning so I was out of a job .
good,"The position in Werner taught me an extensive amount about logistics. The management seemed to be overtaxed, and in some cases in need of better training. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of the drivers and difficulty of the employee turnover. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the same drivers day after day and becoming a more relaxed atmosphere of family."
good,"Werner is a good company to work for because they have good benefits, but sometimes you work more than 70 hours a week and you are away from home most of the time."
good,"Werner gave me a chance to start my career. I got a good truck that never messed up. That comes down to some luck, but a lot of preventative maintenance. I maximized my income by using proper time management, not turning down loads, and always being on time. I got home on time almost every time."
good,"A typical day for me started any time of the day or evening depending when i completed 10 hrs of rest. As with any company i had to learn the procedures of the company as well as the computer in the truck. Work place culture was decent, its my home away from home. The hardest part of the job was getting up to work if i was tired the load has a delivery time. The most enjoyable having to walk 2-3 feet to work, rear sleeper to driver seat."
good,"Great Starting Company for new drivers, Training is long but worth it. My Training had its up and downs, I recently received a check that was short. That i believe should be more"
good,"Werner is a great place to work, especially just starting out in the field. You get an opportunity to apply what you've learned and expand upon it. The work can get difficult at times, that's just the nature of the field. Typically though, th work is routine and once you get familiar with it, i's a breeze. Great start place for mechanics."
good,Management is very good at working with drivers for home time and vacation time. The benefits are good and not expensive. Which account you are on will determine the amount of work.
good,driver managers are usually pretty nice and help you with what you need. But if you have to call cooperate they usually give you a hard time. Just be prepared to not go home for a while
good,"Good company to get started in the trucking industry. Good training or retraining. Trainers easy to work with. You are assigned to a ""Team"" of dispatchers, some are OK, some are not. What you get is what you get."
good,"Werner is a good company to learn the ropes on how to be a professional truck driver. They offer many resources for the new driver to hone their skills. They are also really good at keeping a driver moving with little down time between loads. The compensation per mile is well below industry standard, but since you're always on the go you can still earn a decent pay check."
good,"Over the road dedicated truck driver. Pick up load from shipper. Dispatched assigned load to customer. drove from 500- 2000 miles a week. I've learned In route trip planning record of logs and use of atlas map. Also, how to maintain patience driving through all types of weather and hills/ mountains."
good,"it's a good company to work for if otr is what you want, for me i just had a bad experience with them after my accident they never called me back to work or took my calls. but that's just me everyone's different i would recommend this to anyone"
good,It's a good place to work if you get a great manager that will run you for the miles you wanna run. Also don't back down from anything you don't wanna do.
good,Werner is a good company for newly licensed drivers. The work atmosphere is pleasant.  The clientele base is also pleasant in my case.
good,Werner keeps up to date with the D.O.T. guidelines and treats most of the drivers well.  They try to keep the loads going for you and get you home when you request it
good,"Can stay out on the road"
good,"On most days yr dispatcher would have u sitting and waitting on loads. I learn in this industry know matter what life throws at u do it with a good heart. I cant say management was good nor bad. Everybody is not the same. There were few of my co-workers would complain about the miles, there dispatcher, trucks and so on. To me the hardest part of my time is when u were given a load to pick up at said time. And u get there an hour or two b4 the appoint time and the load is not ready for 5 more hrs or so. Trying to get hold of yr dispatcher and he will not answer his phone because he know the information he submit to u was wrong. Lets say for example dispatcher give u a load and everything is according as plan. All that left for u do is thanks the lord. On days like that yes it was enjoyable."
good,"im assuming like every other trucking company, I didn't like the OTR part but its a part of ""paying your dues"". nice dispatcher and Werner does care about your safety"
good,Good company with plenty of work. They always have new and updated equipment.
good,I learned how to drive in all weather and how to read maps and the regulations of each sate I drive in. the best part of my job is being able to help  my family and feeling secure in where I work. the cons about my job would be the short breaks and not being as active as I would like and the long hours on the road.
good,"Werner was a very honest company! They paid you low and would run the ""Hell"" out of you. You were awarded monthly bonuses depending on your performance. If you got tired of an account-- you could easily move to another division. I would have stayed with Werner if they didn't have that notorious ""Training Program""!!! Werner is an undercover ""Training"" company. They ultimately want you to become a TRAINER. They want all drivers to become TRAINERS... That means anybody that comes through their doors. You don't know that initially, though. After 3 months of driving by yourself--- the recruiters constantly torment you with becoming a TRAINER. It was the worse mistake I ever made. I eventually did it and never got any sleep. Werners' training is really an Undercover Team(operation). They give you unrealistic appointments knowing the student can barely hold the wheel for 2 hours straight. So if i'm a trainer and i've just driven about 8 to 10 hours. I would normally drive another 8 hours on the students hours just to make it to the customer on time. Yes!!! I lost alot of sleep and eventually had to quit due to severe sleep deprivation. Thank God I didn't kill anyone. Other than that, Werner was a pretty good company. lol"
good,"drive all day move frieght from one retailor to another sleep in trailor overnite go home a weekend a month and start over on monday for another month, if you enjoy driving day in and day out its nice and fun job. work for yourself basically nothing hard about job just long hrs'"
good,"Start by performing pre trip inspection on truck, pick up and inspect trailer/load, review/plan trip, review avalible hours. If you have hours, begin your trip."
good,Good company but no advancement started out at $0.24 per mile after 2yrs of service went to $0.35 Per mile not good.
good,"I found their to be some racism within the company, through my experience."
good,"This is a good company to start a career as a commercial truck driver. Would have loved to stayed, but family life was a priority."
good,Dollar accounts pay the most. Home time is limited to your 34 hour reset. Fleet managers are always on you about delivery and your driving habits.  Average truck driver job.
good,I enjoy the job and the individual responsibilities I am given.  The company has several opportunities available for drivers and non-drivers alike.  The people I have met are very helpful and accepting to new employees.
good,I worked in the shop fixing trucks that drivers been on the road and getting them ready to be on the road again checked make sure they were safe out there..
good,"I loved every day even tho some were exhausting and aggravating,  I have been blessed with great fleet managers in every account I've been on.  They have been patient with me."
good,"Werner is a huge company, one of the biggest.  They have generally nice terminals and new equipment.  All the trucks are automatic.  They generally keep you moving, especially if you are a team driver."
good,Stable job good miles for someone looking to train it’s great opportunities they are about safety first and they got me home when I requested even if I deadheaded
good,"Not a bad place to work at pretty relax, definitely needs improvement in the shop like more training, parts to get the job done, seniority needs to play a role because it doesn't. Work and life balance is ok that's it no more or less. Newer equipment to work on which is good, benefits are good. Raises are not that great."
good,Werner is a good company to work for however the schedule can be very chaotic some days. your start time is set but you wont know what time you will finish for the day. this can make it difficult to balance your time between work and home life.
good,Werner has a really good training program for students coming out of school just receiving their CDL A you can learn almost anything about the job.  They have really nice terminals placed in really good locations . Overall good company. Just the pay situation can use some looking into
good,I like them. I just want more money that's pretty much it. they are a great company with great people. I had a good time and I learned many valuable skills that I will use the rest of my Driving Career.
good,Never a dull day at work because every day bought new exciting challenges.  I learned how to interact more and more on a professional level.  management did their best to accommodate all the employees needs. culture of inclusion and positive morale. hardest part was not being able to get home to family as often as i liked to. best part was being my own boss being in total control.
good,"They are a fair company. They keep you moving, always have loads. I've never sat around for more than a night waiting for a load. Solo company driver now but I've been owner op, a trainer and most weeks i get over 3k miles. Never missed a home time, as long as you get on the good side with your dispatch and give them at least 2 week notice for home time it's not a problem. You need to show your dispatcher you can make the loads on time and not be lazy taking 15 hour sleeper breaks."
good,My driver's trainer did a great job of sharing information about driving and showing me the ropes so to speak. I just wish he would have remembered sooner than later that he was supposed to pay for my shower when we were over the road!  It took him 10 days to smell me thinking! LOL
good,Made a lot of friends at Werner that are still my friends today. Good work environment with good management. Wish I would have been able to stay but sometimes pride gets in the way
good,I feel like they care more about the equipment than the employee.  Training is cut short all though you take a lot of safety classes on the computer. Nothing like hands on. To the trainers you are just a cash cow gaining them pay miles they are paid the miles you drive as well as their own. A lot of new drivers are still inexperienced when assigned their own truck.
good,Keep the wheel turning. You were given all the tools and data required to adequately complete your job.  Things were tense at times but you did get a positive sense of accomplishment on a regular basis.
good,"the job is not difficult, the difficult thing is to be out of your home and your family for long periods of time. Also the food that you have to eat and to clean yourself have to use public places that are not always clean. You also start working early in the morning and you are working for more than 14 hours a day"
good,"As a professional driver, Werner provided a great opportunity to get my foot in the door.  I deliver for Dollar General 6 days a week as a dedicated driver and am paid fairly.  The biggest pit fall is the extended amounts of time spent away from home."
good,"A typical work day  can be productive,learned to work in different departments.Management could use to training on how to be in a management roles, the workplace culture is good,the hardest part of any job is giving it 100%,and loosen the job."
good,"Driving truck means long hours on the road, can be stressful competing with other drivers. Little time for yourself or family."
good,Werner was a good place to work. Safety was their main priority. Which not only show their concern for their drivers but other cars and trucks on the road. I just wish they had more options for local work.
good,I was on a dedicated account which made it much easier to predict my weekly settlements and route. I had a good fleet manager which made the job much easier.
good,"I've learned a lot with this company. I drove across country, regional,and dedicated routes. i also became a trainer when i was on a dedicated account.My dispatchers cared about their drivers they made sure the driver had everything he or she needed before they took off on there journey.I was one of the first crew member that started on the dollar general account. I enjoy working with my fellow drivers. I had to move from florida to louisiana because of tragedy in my family or else i would probably still been driving for them."
good,"I believe Werner is a good company depending which terminal you are employed at.Great hrs. not great pay, good vacation time. Health insurance is offered ""Expensive ""."
good,"Like working for the company. Steady work with decent pay. Great to see the sites if you like to travel."
good,"working at bailey ladders was very good ,good people to work with at work or outside of work . a great day for me was getting the quota for the day done and everyone going home in the same condition that they were at the start of the day."
good,dispatched a 64+ fleet of trucks to deliver JIT freight. Communicate with the drivers VIA a QUALCOMM system to ensure loads were out bound and tracked thru the same system to ensure on time delivery. Updated files  on the drivers to make sure DOT Regs were up to date. Such as Physicals. tracked CSA scores on each driver to maintain a good CSA score. Kept a running schedule for home times. deal with any problems drivers were to encounter during their day.
good,"Driving at least ten hous a day, seven days a week, and over the road at least six weeks. Team driving was good, And learning all aspects of druck driving."
good,"They are alright if you are OTR but do not do a regional ""home every weekend"" route because you will hardly make enough to pay your bills. Blue cross green shield is great. and mostly enjoyable to work for just keep your nose clean and your fine but you will have to push and shove for time off..."
good,"	Worked closely with dispatch to ensure on time or early delivery, allowing Werner to reload quickly verses truck sitting and not making revenue."
good,"Overall a company that has a great staff and a great work environment. Management is lacking, the general consensus among the management is that everyone is replaceable. "
good,"*Drive trucks to specified destinations"
good,"Iffy communication between your Driver manager and yourself breeds frustration. The pay is okay for trucking, but the lack of home time and the constantly late arrivals is a bit off putting."
good,This company has given me the skills to move on to something I would like to do better.
good,Deliver to small box retail stores. Unloading is required. Having skill in backing is the most integral part of the job.
good,"The company was great. Offered quite a bit of load runs consistently, not often that I would have to wait long before hitting the road again. Home time was just like any over the road truck driving job but they did their best to get me home when home time was due. "
good,"DOT regulations limit the amount of time driving, so your day is spent watching the clock to verify you do not exceed those hours. rest periods are spent where every you can safley park your rig. I learned how to safley manuver my big rig in all cinds of traffic and to safley back the rig to unload."
good,"A typical day at Werner Enterprises involves a daily pre-trip inspection of the truck and trailer, keeping logs with the Qualcomm device, communicating with my dispatcher, completing paperwork with shippers and consignees, sending paperwork to customs brokers, crossing the US/Canadian border. The hardest parts of the job is being away from home for weeks at a time, getting lost, the truck breaking down, and all the down time. The enjoyable part of the job was going places and seeing things. I've been to states and cities I've never seen before."
good,"Business to Business collections, good training and management involvment. Low wages"
good,This job is great for meeting people and getting to know co-workers. Learning all aspects of the world. The hardest part was driving different hours of the day. The most enjoyable part was the driving.
good,"Drove with them 6 months, Kept me running most of the time. Great Dispatcher during the week. Weekends, so so. Very good training department. ."
good,"If you are a student driver coming out of school Werner Enterprises is a great company to start. They understand that new drivers need time to learn and they work with you in order for you to obtain experience in a safe manner. They have many outlines for drivers to reach out, they have top notch technology, newer equipment and on my account great fleet managers."
good,"I was only driving with them in the trainee program for a short time. The  life of a trucker on the road did not fit with my family situation at the time. I enjoyed my mentor and his excellent trucking equipment. It is a great machine and I learned plenty during the several thousand miles I drove for the contract. The classroom modules and personal instruction of the trainers at the Allentown, PA center were very good and all staff made the new truckers feel respected and appreciated. Hotel accommodations and pay from day one were good. I liked this company's work ethic."
good,"My Fleet manager was awesome i am going to miss them they did everything to help me anytime i needed time off. Good pay good miles Loved my job. Worst part would be the customers when they are in bad moods an if Delivery is late unknown of the reason to them such as traffic mostly, They can turn very rude an make the job more stressful as well as the crazy drivers.  Werner is a good company to work for."
good,People and the experiences in the help are great not too good of pay then again I just came out of trucking school when I started so you're going to start out at the bottom
good,Have loaded and unloaded trucks while driving trucks and before drove truck worked in warehouses drove different style forklifts driving for Werner was good for me I ran as hard as I wanted to or if I needed to take a week a little slower was no big deal communication was good
good,Pay could be alot better and a little more home time would be nice. But insurance is great and as u get experience things get better and money gets better.
good,"great place to work as a single person, great paychecks downside is your on the road all the time ...................................................."
good,Drivers are definitely given a priority over all over employees. Company-wide focus on training. Management staff overall very responsive. Long work hours; salaried employees work 10-12 hour days. Employees are generally friendly.
good,Good company for first time drivers. Not a bad place for experienced drivers either. I’m currently still with the company with a great team of fleet managers. Never heard any complaints about the time I needed off.
good,"Best part i enjoyed about working here is opportunity to experience other states across the country. Decent pay and benefits. "
good,"Soon after I got my CDL I was hired by Werner. Their training program overall was really good, and I recommend every new CDL-A holder to start here. Depending on fleet managers, you can or you can't get all 48-states, but that's not a big deal as long as you get good mileage."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Werner. Laid back work culture, busy at times but that's not a terrible thing. I left because the industry isn't for everything."
good,If management works with you and allows you to go at your own pace then it can a very stress free job and I would still be there had Werner not hired some new Fleet Manager that decided to try new things which upset several veteran drivers.
good,"Great job with benefits and decent pay but lost the account we were on so jobs were eliminated.  Day shift, data entry job with good co-workers but sucked that we lost our jobs with little notice"
good,As a company driver with Werner was about normal all of these major companies pretty much are geared the same way. I enjoyed my stay with Werner but it was time for me to depart.
good,I was a driver and the team was very helpful and diligent with the training and routing. I think a new guy will do well here and can pick their route in most cases.
good,Typical OTR 48 states schedule.  Fleet manager was fantastic.  Teaming Process was a bust.  Be careful not to team up with someone you don't know well.
good,"Good place to work "
good,"away from home 2 weeks at time. You dont work you dont get paid."
good,"Werner Enterprises is a really great company to work for. I drove for them for almost a year before some unexpected things happened and changed my life for the worst. But anyway, Werner Enterprises Terminals are very relaxed and some of them have hotels on there terminals or some place close by. Some terminals have pool tables, phooseball tables, air hockey etc. I would highly recommend driving here and I would honestly go back to driving for them."
good,Ok place I don’t know how it is now but when I was working there the pay was not good at all I was out all the time and made 300 to 400 a week I could not live off the money but they will get you some   Experience That you need
good,"great for starting out but not much after you get 1-2 years in, i apparently have to add more to this to make it meet the requirements of this website."
good,They were very helpful when I try to get some days off. They were able to get my last delivery to close to home as possible and to the start date of my time ofg.
good,"I had a wonderful experience.  The first two years of driving has barely livable pay but once you get experience in the truck driving field, the pay increases substantially."
good,I thought it was a good job but I decided that driving otr wasn't what I wanted to do. being away from home 3-4 weeks wasn't what I wanted to do at that ime
good,"Normally I spent a minimum of three or four weeks on the road. So to start I need to pick up the load at the Werner Enterprises office. They give the itinerary and the travel begin. I learned a lot with them, they very patient and efficient on teaching you all that you need to know about the job.The hardest part of the job is to be away from my family for a long time. The most enjoyable part is I travel to a lot of places all around the US. Places that I never been there before."
good,"Initially employed on a 6 month contract it was soon evident that longer would be required to resolve the issue on the numerous ledgers run by the Company. A backlog of Customer queries required attention as did the neglected ledgers. However, 18 months later and the accounts are in a much tidier state and a new Credit Manager has been found to oversee the on going work."
good,Werner was a very good company to Work for. Fleet managers were very helpful in getting me home on time. Routes were local and close to home and balanced based on my weekly pay goals.
good,"I had a great time while I  was there. Got to travel, see different  things while doing my job. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to get in trucking industry!"
good,"Much nepotism which is most places. Hard to get off third shift or get decent days off. Made great friends and the job wasn't too hard. The pay, incentives and discount programs were good."
good,"Great starter position for new students. My trainer was awesome. Be certain that you don't mind over the road training, local positions available based on locality to distribution centers."
good,"fleet management is great, high dispatcher turnover, doesnt care about your time and schedule... little to no interaction, a true contractor."
good,Very Great company with very experienced trainers I really enjoyed this company as well. Was a great opportunity for me and others to travel and see the world.
good,There is no perfect company. I can say Werner has been decent to me and has worked with me with the different accounts to accommodate me as well.
good,"Worked in a satellite office.  Dedicated operations.  Worked with several different domiciles of drivers.  Responsible for head hauls, back hauls and fitting as much revenue into their daily allotment of hours.  Really liked this job.  Job was relocated.  I couldn't move."
good,"Got prehired by Werner before I even went into CDL school. Werner reimbursed me for CDL school and gave me a $5000 sign on bonus for north SWAT (dollar stores+ Walmart). Do far I've found that once you're hooked to one of the dollar stores trailers you're stuck with it. Been doing Family Dollar since 05/16. Very good pay for someone starting out. You're constantly at risk for accidents and need to GOAL like 50 times per store. The stores (especially in the north east) are not designed to be truck friendly and even sometimes you end up unloading up a grade. Werner is extremely strict when it comes to accidents. As of right now  (that I know of) even a ripped off mudflap is counted as an accident. Overall a pretty good company to work for SO far, if you want to work your butt off. Some weeks I run out my clock in 6 days but I'm young and out to make money so it doesn't bother me."
good,"Great Place To get Experience and Grow"
good,"Safety focused, good pay, decent benefits. Drove for two years with them...never had a blowout on a trailer or my tractor. They are sticklers about vehicle maintenance. "
good,"I LOVE THE COMPANY, THEY WORK WELL WITH Family time and benefits."
good,I took this job to get me through school and ended up staying after graduation.  My coworkers are very helpful and supportive.
good,"Typical work day start at 5am end at 5pm."
good,"This job taught me how to organize, multi task and other things that I needed to learn for this job. Employees were good and so were the hours."
good,I learned work well with others in multiple work locations on all days of the work week. The co-workers here were awesome to work with along with what I learned. Most enjoying about this job was the travel and meeting new faces.
good,I drove a class A vehicle(semi-truck) 700 miles a day and delivered products to companies in a safe and timely manner. I learned new routes around different cities around the United States of America. management was fair and I worked independently. The hardest part of the job was being away from my children. Driving to new places and seeing new cities was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"great job for single person, I enjoyed the account I am on and the people I work with but I am currently looking for local opportunity to be home with my son."
good,"Working with Werner Enterprises, I learned a lot of things.  My driver managers were very helpful in my requests, concerns, and even frustrations."
good,My day would start around 11 o clock i would wake up do my pre-trip inspection and drive to my first stop if I did not make it the following night. When i make it to my stop i would then give the paper work to the Rep. and begin to unload the trailer. Then i will pick up the empty rolltainers from the week before. I would repeat that like 2 or 3 times a day
good,"WERNER Gave me my first chance to own my first truck,also gave me the first time to teach people how to drive trucks,by beening a trainer."
good,"Get up get information drive"
good,"I was a front end alignment mechanic and did steer tire balancing at the Omaha depot about 17 yrs ago. Decent hourly pay. I worked the second shift, was on my own. I did about 10 alignments a night which was double what other mechs did. They had brand new from the factory, freight liners. I know that some drivers would complain to me that they had to drive their truck from texas or arizona with alignments that pulled hard or had steer tires that wobbled and dispatch wouldn't help them till they made it to Omaha. All in all I enjoyed the work. I left to drive a garbage truck in papillion for a higher daily rate."
good,"Driver the surrounding states dropping loads"
good,Overall a good company.  Werner has lots of accounts to choose from and lots of benefits.  There trucks have lots of monitoring sensors and they do babysit the drives.
good,Werner is a great company to work for and to be a part of.  I love their flexible shift options such as their 7 on 7 off positions.  Everyone that I have worked with is pretty easy to work with and to get along with.  I have gained a lot of experience in customer service since I started working there.
good,Typical day at work is getting a message on Qualcom telling you where to go and when to be there to either pick up or deliver a load. I learned to budget my hours to make sure I had the time to get done what needed to be done for the week. Management would leave you alone as long as you showed you were doing your best to get the load done on time. Co-workers were the best part especially if you drove by one on  the highway. The hardest Part was when I became a dedicated driver having to unload the truck when it was basically thrown into the trailer.  The most enjoyable part for me was seeing new places and meeting new people.
good,Werner Enterprises is a very large company. They know the busines they take care of employees.
good,"Excellent company, with well trained personnel. Technology and product portfolio are great tools and differentiators. Learn to work between two different business cultures: US and Latin America."
good,"A typical day of a truck driver doesn't fit into anything ""typical,"" because although you're driving at sometime during the day, there are other things that can come up which can affect how and when you get behind the wheel to drive your load from Point A to Point B."
good,One air price is honest about their job duties they're honest about your pay the opera wide variety of jobs skills They are very secure company to work for
good,Werner has a very good training program for the newer driver allowing him or her to become more familiar with the equipment so that they gradually improve to become strong and stable company drivers
good,"Great equipment"
good,It's a pretty good company to work for. The supervisors are helpful when it comes to getting loads for you. They generally get you home on time when you put in for time off.
good,"I would still be driving for Werner, had I not had one too many little ‘fender benders’! Even still, they did contact me to see if I might be interested in coming back! If I could drive locally and be home every night and weekend, I would! Many of my ratings were 4 stars. Nobody’s perfect! But they often made the attempt to accommodate!"
good,"Obviously there are pros and cons, but I was excited to work for the company from day one - From the training to the pay, to the support for their employess to their commitment to their customers - They try to treat everybody fairly, and do their best to resolve issues when they come up -"
good,Its a good company  to start with if you ate looking  for experience. It allowed me to learn alot about working over the road by yourself. Also has good dispatchers
good,The company has a good management team.  I have learned various job functions as needed.  There are plenty of team building activities. The customer service area is high paced and the employees have an extensive knowledge of many products and procedures.
good,Werner is a great company to work for if you are a new driver or plan to be over the road. This was the first company I worked for directly out of trucking school. I received great training and good equipment.
good,Straight until the cut pay and then say if you deliver on tome you only get 20 dollars a day nah buddy my training pay was horrible  had to find something better
good,Good place to work just out to long then home only 34 hrs maybe every 2 weeks  would still be there if money and home time would have been good but then I would have had to leave in 2018 to take care of parents
good,"Hardest part of the job is being away from your family. Other than that, it's great. Your fellow employees are friendly and helpful, managers treat you like you matter."
good,"Good company to work for. Nice FM, and it is a big company, what ever you need with your work, they will help you to get it done. Nice people in general."
good,It was a very nice place to work but I would rather be home every day. It was on OTR job. Somewhat stressful. Not sure if I was going to get loads to get out. And we were paid by the miles that we drove
good,"Después del entrenamiento que es estresante un poco pero nada malo, porque son las bases de todo lo necesitas conocer sobre la compañia. Después de esto para todos los que somos nuevos es una muy buena compañia para empezar y paga bien para comenzar tu carrera"
good,"as good equipment... better than most"
good,"conduct a pre-trip inspection on vehicle, plan out your day and weekly deliveries, must be open minded to sleeping in truck and you must work efficiently to make deliver on time and stay safe on the road."
good,Good Company to start off with. They start you off with a trainer until you get enough experience on your own to get your own truck.Enjoy the long haul drives.
good,Werner is a good company to drive for. My only issues was constant mechanical issues with the trucks I was assigned even the brand new ones had some issues.
good,"Typical work day includes speaking with drivers. Scheduling the routing and load planning for product, and addressing maintenance needs for the equipment."
good,"Good starting company when coming into trucking."
good,there was alot of bad info about them before i started. however i soon learned that it was just bad rumors. i enjoyed working here and would have stayed had i felt  i was able to perform properly
good,"Excellent equipment, ok pay, great insurance.  Store discounts were a plus.  Medical time off was hard to get. Good rider policy.   Company was slow to respond to driver needs."
good,"Not gonna lie, Werner doesn’t pay all that great, but if you’re just getting started in the OTR industry, they are a great company to work for. I stayed with them for 3yrs just to learn what I could before moving on to bigger and WAY better paychecks!"
good,"Werner is a good place to make a living, new faces every day great benefits. It is the largest trucking firm in the nation with modern trucks you will drive in comfort."
good,"i was a driver new still but the pay was low for the amount of time you were away from home. otherwise the team is helpfill professional, and always treated me with respect."
good,"Werner is a good company to work for but on certain accounts you will work hard and the hours can be long, but all in all it is a good company to work for."
good,"Training was adequate"
good,Great company to work for once you get out of truck Driving school. I do feel that they should pay you more money coming into the company. Also they should make drivers aware of if job in jeaporday.
good,I drove team and our driver manager kept us on the road.  all the Terminals had shower and everyone was friendly. The Trucks were in good working order.
good,I enjoyed working here from working with my trainer to receiving my own truck.   Trainer was great and the time we spent together I learned alot from her.
good,I ran a Coca cola Account and when it was changed our pay was dropped and it went from home daily and off on weekends to home every two weeks 2 days off. Not fair to have a pay drop and just thrown back out on the road to have to pay for parking and the stress of dealing with Truck stops as a female.
good,"had a very good relationship with Werner Enterprises."
good,"A typical day at work would be delivering loads to customers."
good,There are many moving parts within the organization but all work well together in order to achieve the common goal of keeping customers happy and encouraging employees to do their best
good,tiene buen ambiente de trabajo y le falta capacitar a su personal
good,"Fairly standard freight carrier, I worked both dry van and temperature controlled units. Dedicated routes were nice though starting out in 48 state fleet wasn't as fun."
good,They work with you to make sure you are good and have as much hometime as you can. very good with family and benefits. Its only as hard as you make it.
good,"I loved working at Werner for my first experience as a OTR truck driver, but pay was quite low at the time. I heard they improved on their pay, but work-life balance was a concern for me...they didn't have it. If I went back to Werner, it will be as an O/O."
good,I started as a company driver and the company helped me to become a owner/operator and to purchase my truck through them. I also became a driver trainer and my dispatcher was great about making sure that my truck was rolling to ensure my students were well trained. Hardest part was being away from my family.
good,It is an ok job I just had a dispatcher that seemed to be done with me once I told him I wanted to do over the road so they stopped helping me get back to work
good,Good start out job and good fleet managers.. keep you moving plus they treat you well.. been here 5 years just need to be home more.. there always willing to help you out if your in a binf
good,"Good place to work , a little stressful at some of the locations,..some places very hard to work at pushing rolltainers up into the back storage room,.. heavy weight to push over 500 to 1100 pounds up an incline"
good,"Working with the Werner System. was a learning experience.  While driving s from East to West, North and South parts of the country I enjoyed many  interesting landscapes, and eye popping mountains."
good,The people i worked with were fantastic. I worked on the coca cola account out of atlanta and i loved the people i worked with. If i need anything it got done and if i had any questions i got the answer.
good,Hard challenging work. Great place to learn and develope career knowledge. Great training programs for new employees. Training is helpful and provides tone to learn before throwing you into the mix by yourself.
good,"Working at Werner Enterprises was fun even though i did not complete my time with them. However, it was a good experience and I met a lot of people.well I don't have much to say about the company  because I didn't say"
good,"all my life, I never thought I could be a truck driver, but I gave it a try and after trying very hard to master it I amazed myself at what I was able to do. one of the best jobs I ever had. but very stressful"
good,Typical day was never same as the previous and that's what I love most about the job. Sometimes it's in your favor and sometimes it's not but either way it kept you on your toes.
good,It gave me great experience and knowledge and a sence of the over the road experience they need more open positions the department areas need to be more nice and understanding and patient
good,"Great . Manager very respectful.  Flexible hrs,nice environment  to work in.. Great hrs. The place taught me a lot if responsibility and how to lead a crew of members."
good,Good starting company for new drivers and veteran drivers alike. Competitive pay and good mileage. Many different positions available from OTR TO DEDICATED.
good,"They say they're all about safety but, they were worried about you moving than if there were threats to your life. Training program was decent. Lots of drop and hook opportunities."
good,"I love the folks I work with and for, my main issue is the benefits are bad. You would think a major company wouldn't go so cheap on health insurance, but Werner does."
good,I learned everything I know about trucking with Werner. Was a nice experience because I like to drive. I knew the snow for first time in my life under a snow storm in Michigan; drove trough places I don't know if I will go again; I visited incredible places and even when I never had an accident I learned that the rout has scary situations too.
good,"Over the road driving was a great experience, the many states that I have driven thru and the sites that I have seen were wonderful.   Within 9 months of driving the United Stated I only missed 3 and one was Hawaii. that's how fast pace you could be."
good,I worked for Werner straight out of trucking school and am appreciative of the opportunity and experience that I gained in driving a tractor trailer. I had an awesome trainer who I got along with great during my 200hr training period. After that time I received my own truck and began doing solo runs across the United States. I recommend Werner Enterprises as a good startup company for new CDL drivers.
good,"Werner is a good company for beginning truckers to start out with.  You will be given an opportunity to build up your knowledge base in a safety focused way.  Basic aspects of the trucking job will be introduced in a supportive training environment and will carry over into the professional, solo setting.  Relationships forged in the training setting often become strong supports that last for a very long time.  Learn as much as you can, keep your safety record clean, form professional connections with productive and safe drivers, and set goals for advancement."
good,Werner allows drivers the opportunity to grow with the company. Be it by working at the dispatch level or at the corporate level in management.
good,"Everyday is a challenge due to having to unload our trailer without a pallet jack. Each day I learn how to work through adversity, fatigue, and bad weather. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family 6days out the week. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I don't have to sit around to wait on a load. I get to stay busy, which makes the day go by faster."
good,"I've been with Werner for a year, they started me off at 30 cents per mile, then after 6 months 35, a year 38, and about a year from now 40, I would say everything but the pay is great, health insurance, dental, vision, 401k etc, new trucks, some peterbilt and kenworth, mostly freightliner, no apu in my trucks I've driven 2 solo, no fridge, full size sleepers though, current year or 1 year old, both trucks I got had about 175,000 miles on them, for 2016 their 60th anniversary, they got a lot of brand new trailers, they're the white trailers that say ""we keep America moving"" on them, a lot of freight you hardly ever sit, they do have layover pay I believe after 24 hours not entirely sure because never sat like that, they get you home good, 1 day off per 6 days out, I take at least 12 days out OTR, but sometimes I get an extra day or so, if you have a nice dispatcher which I believe one of the most important things is how nice your fleet manager is because a micro manage one will make you think bad of the company, but I didn't I got a different one much nicer and it made me want to stay, gave me extra days off, anyways qualcomms, they pay for tolls, reimburse scales, lumper loads/unloads, antigel, tuition etc. drop and hook a vast majority of the time, dry van mainly, but some reefers, super rare flatbed, about 13 terminals, terminals and hotels near them are ok for some, awesome for others, free showers at the terminals, safety meetings once every season something like that, only takes about an hour, all and all a great place to get your foot in the door, can't think of anything"
good,"werner is a good place to start for new cdl drivers, its a great workplace envirment. people are so friendly and they do there job. but to be honest its not good paying per mile, I guess if they could raise their pay it would be better"
good,Ive been at my job for 13 years.  Like the people I work with. I know my job very well. Ive learned alot. I think about moving on and maybe trying something else
good,"I work in a dedicated account, come home often I got Saturday n Sunday off almost every single weekend at least I miss a day in the week I ask to work on Saturday and it's rarely the happen in been with this account for almost 5 month, I made decent money to be my first job, I don't touch the freight at least a pallet fall down we have to fix it but in almost 5 month happen only 2 times and it's not that bad. I love my Fleet manager he's a great person but like any body he got his date and they really doesn't home and personal lives but I learn how to deal with both and I enjoy my job n I enjoy my personal life. I will recommend working for WENER yes I do. I was the guy I was in will never work for this company and blah blah but I give them a chance and I don't regret it at all. If you like your miles and love making the green one they will know n make you runnnn"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Werner however, I thought the training could have been a bit better. Overall it was a good experience."
good,I had a good trainer and enjoy the work environment and had a good dispatcher.The hard part of the job is driving on the road for the first time by myself.
good,"I have only gone through the training program, which I am pretty comfortable with. I believe I received a good foundation in Commercial Driving. The only reason I don't work there anymore is because I need to be home more than once a week. Currently , there aren't any positions open home daily or multiple times a week."
good,"My first time representing a Truck company. Excellent company with great benefits, unfortunately for me, I got hired and shortly after the economy tanked so within 2 years 25 of us (mostly the new hired) were let go :("
good,Well a lot of people have bad things to say about werner when i finished training i went otr and my fleet manager was awesome she gave me great miles and i was going home 2 days every week sometimes not on weekends but hey some people barely get one after my fleet manager left i got on the target dedicated account in huntsville alabama it was a little different but it has to be one of the most easiest accounts werner has the problem is you only get one day off and sometimes its only half a day depending on your load but i live close to the dc so alot of times after running a load ill just go home the dispatch are the coolest they buy lunch from time to time they really care about safety and they work with you with any problems you have out on the road and their response time is almost immediate even with 26 other drivers on the fleet cant say the same about night dispatch they seem as they dont kno anything about the account and if you have any problems be prepared to wait a few hours but they do have flaws just like any compay they trying to encourage drivers to get their idle time under 15% which i think is bs thats almos impossible in the summertime my dle time has been the highest on the target account because i refuse to sweat in my truck and they dont allow inverters in their trucks which i think is another policy they should revoke i got a 500 watt that plugs in the cigarette lighter which they allow but it wont pull but 120 watts unless its wired to the battery i think they should allow drivers to have atleast a 1000 watt installed in their trucks i have a tv and xbox
good,"As a team with Hazmat endorsements we got on a dedicated account after the first month. Our dispatcher was fantastic,he was a little cranky on Mondays. As a starter company this was a pretty good one. The trick is to get a good dispatcher. If you are a good employee then get on a dedicated account. This made all the difference in the world as we made more consistent money and didn't have to drive all over God's green earth."
good,Werner Enterprises is a safety conscience work environment. If you are new to truck driving this is good company to start with because they really preach about safety. If you pay attention to what you do each day you will be successful.
good,great management. pay is fair. great co workers. clean and safe work environment.  overtime availability.  overall a great place to work.
good,they kept me rolling best they could got me home best they could        lower pay than most  but not so bad to work for  kept me up laws and safty issues
good,It's a good company to start with and the important part is the management will answer or pick up the phone when you need them
good,"truck driver, making on time deliveries, keeping up a log book and pre trip inspections daily. As my first job as a CDL holder I learned the importance of safe driving with a semi, DOT regulations and time management."
good,"Great organization to work for,  friendly knows how to treat employees and variety opportunity of optimum career growth."
good,"As part of Team Werner, you'll drive the best and newest equipment, utilizing the most advanced technological systems on the market today. These systems are designed to enhance production, eliminate delays and help you get up to 1,000 miles per day. Plus, you'll be eligible to receive bonus pay for all miles you run."
good,"Starting each day and ending each day with pre-trip and post-trip inspections. Learned different roads, understanding DOT regulations. Learning to time manage my driving and paper work in order."
good,"Long hauls, Day or night driving, great trainers,"
good,I enjoyed working there and have only good things to say about this company and the management personnel
good,"Werner is a good and stable company to be a part of the income, and advancements are there. the atmosphere although strong is for the most part friendly and stable.."
good,Overall training was good. I enjoyed driving.   I did nor like being away from home foe that long at a time ( 3+ weeks).
good,Long hours OTR throughout the united states. Time management is key. Out on the road for at least a couple of weeks at a time.
good,The pay could have been a little better. There truck were well maintain. The dispactchers were pretty nice.
good,"good starter company, good mileage, not enough pay, good benefits"
good,"new trucks "
good,i drove all over the country i been to canada plus mexico an all the 48 states. i have leard how to drive big trucks and my dispacter was great. the hardset part of the job was the late night driving and most enjoyable i have seen the country
good,"Typical day: Wake up, stretch, perform a complete ""Pre-Trip Inspection"", get moving on down the road! With Werner, and with the use of their ""Electronic Logging"" system, I've learned how to better refine the skill of ""Time Management"", which can be quite challenging at times. I have acquired several good friendships with co-workers/drivers specifically in the Flatbed devision of Werner. I still communicate on a fairly regular basis with the drivers I've come to know whom no longer even work for Werner as well. I would have to say that the hardest part of this job is dealing with the occasional frustration of knowing that other company's DO & will pay more for the same level of work that I'm currently performing with Werner. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the feeling of having achieved yet another complete, accident free load assignment with on-time delivery!"
good,Nothing but good things so far. They seem to find more ways to pay you then other companies that look for ways not to pay you.. I am a driver here so I work with the Stores mostly I deliver to. I would have to say the hardest thing to deal with about my job is just traffic .
good,I enjoyed Werner it was a great place to work. Everyone is nice and helpful
good,"Good company to work for. Keeps you busy most of the time. Wouldn't mind working for them again, if I had a chance..."
good,good company to work for.I liked working for this company because i was able to see the states.
good,"very good company to work for, but not much of a home life and had to constantly beg to get a better truck"
good,"Great job, the pay is as well the only issue is the home time is too short."
good,"Im used to working long hours. Enjoy working with others, while learning new things. I also make people feel at ease when working with them. I can work in any climate, considering I lived in Alaska 3 yrs. and also toured in Cuba in hot climates."
good,"The company cares about their drivers and how the job is working out for them as much as they care about relations with customers. Working for Werner, you feel appreciated and respected."
good,It’s all about the accounts that you choose to run the intermodal account is great if you live in the Chicagoland area resets through the week and on the weekends
good,"I wasn't at the company for very long, but while I was there I felt like part of a member of the team. Unfortunately I had to step away from driving for a bit, but I if I had to choose a company to go back to, it would be Werner."
good,"My experience at Werner, overall was good.  Tough accounts but they pay good.  If you want, more home time, I would suggest dollar general account.  OTR you'll be out 2-3 weeks at a time."
good,"Good work culture, friendly environment , average Infrastructure.flexible at adapt ung new technology.excellent people around giving all kind of support."
good,"working with Warner was good experience and unfortunately I got a back injury when the loaders of Dollar General free stacked dog food on top of liquid  detergent and it exploded and I slipped on it and landed on my back and hurt it.   working with Warner was a good experience, until I got injured and I had to take them to court to get medical and lost wages.  did not get any compensation from them.  great to work for as long as you don't get injured.  They do take great care of there equipment."
good,Good place too start your over the road experience you need at list 200 hr to get your truck and be on your on . I in a net op and I regret not staying in the dollar act.
good,"Overall was Best Company I worked for. Great Benefits n ECT! Can create your own future long as you keep it in YOUR HANDS / DIRECTION! ...,....,......"
good,"Werner always has my back, but pay could be better. I was recruited out of Trucking school. Training is ongoing. Qualcomm technology is very dated, in my opinion."
good,"Up at 5:30 am start unload trailer at 6:00am1st store   between 3 and 5 stores per day. Unload 2 to 3 trailers week.                           Dispatcher vary responsive and quick to act on needs.                Hardest  part of the job was unloading  40,000 pounds per trailer.   The people  were great to work with"
good,Not a bad company to work for. Need more home time and less hard work. You drive a lot and unload at every store mostly 53 ft. Working dollar general is alot of mental and physical work
good,Working at Werner is a good beginning job to gain experience. You do get paid well if you work well with your fleet manager and you show interest in working.
good,I enjoyed working for Werner Enterprises till I started being treated badly because I was a female driver. The harrasment I got from my fleet manager was unbearable. and I asked for a different fleet manager and that was rejected.
good,"good company to work for. face paced, plenty of advancement opportunities. would recommend to someone starting out or a seasoned veteran looking for a new home to settle into."
good,Werner Enterprises is a nice place and healthy atmosphere and it is place where you will get chance to learn new software technologies and can improve our developing knowledge.I got a chance learn new technologies like websevricses and angular Js and also implement it in our project.
good,Company would go out of their way when possible to make sure every driver was treated with respect and allowed the proper time to take care of any personal needs.
good,"Fun place to work. If you like being over the road, love reliable equipment, love to run, Werner is the place for you, there always have training classes and are concerned about the employees."
good,"But you'll never be home. You can always request time off, 2 weeks out minimum. if you request more than 7 days off, you have to turn your truck back in, bit of a pain in the butt if you dont have a terminal in your city."
good,Monday thru Friday job with fun people. Busy day to day . Met new people every day. Laid back environment with answering phones and doing book conversions.
good,"I didn't work for them long because of personal problem and could no longer work for them Did enjoy working for them, but time off program kinda sucks because unless your having major life problem like major illness or death you earn 1 day off a week you work but the time it take you to get to your house from the terminal is counted against your time off as well as going back to the terminal."
good,Company really cares about their drivers. Really good company to work for. I enjoyed working with fleet managers they all ways put my needs first and kept them in consideration.
good,"OTR for this company is a great opportunity for first time truck drivers. I visited 48 states including the states I went to with my trainer. Fleet managers were always communicating, making sure I had the right information. I could always call them when I had a problem. The hardest part was staying out for 6 or more weeks without returning home."
good,"The Trucking Industry presents many challenges. Werner Enterprises is a large company that is trying to get back to the basics with the Drivers. As a driver, I've learned how to manage time more effectively, understanding that diplomacy is essential to be successful in the industry. The hardest part of the job was the home time sacrifice I made for three years having my address in Montana. It was more difficult to get me home often. As a driver, I understood that, so my goal was to get my experience and get home to the local market, Would I drive long haul again? Yes. Would I drive for Werner? Yes. Patience is key in this industry. Changing the color of your truck isn't going to make things better. If you change, then let the change be specific to your true needs. My needs just happen to be towards the local market to be by my children, grandchildren and family."
good,Very nice place to work only one day off. Learned was very good to take with to care on with you. Management was very good people and had good co-workers. the Hardest part of the job unload every day. the most enjoyable is being off.
good,A typical day at Werner was founded on safety principles and application of ones professional initiative to complete a task. I learned that I will want to do something other than drive a truck as a career because I am capable of more. Most of the co-workers are the  same in the safety aspects and cooperation. The hardest part of the job is when management does not wish to fairly compensate the drivers. The most enjoyable part of the job is I was home nearly every night.
good,"I had a wonderful dispatcher! I'm sure most drivers wouldn't believe that, but he did everything he could to get us where we wanted to be. Whether it was hometime, or just somewhere that we wanted to see. Of course there are bad aspects of the job, but they are generalized industry issues. You can't control shippers and receivers, or road conditions."
good,"The pay, not so good but you get paid for training and other things. The only thing I don't like is the home time for OTR and teams. There are dedicated routes that can get you home with home time."
good,"making a scheduled time to get to dollar tree then unload frieght by hand."
good,"Being a tractor trailer driver requires a lot of thinking and pre planning not just ""sitting behind a steering wheel"" all day. The work is to a point easy as long as you stay ahead of schedule and obey DOT laws. The most demanding aspect of this position is a combination of driving and trip planning so that you know when to ""shut down"" for you DOT 30 and DOT 10 hour breaks. Werner provides all the needed tools for you to succeed, using these tools are up to you. Werner dispatch if they know what you are doing will let you work and be as independent as possible. Werner assigns a driver liasian to you to check up on your progress every two months or so. Getting your CDL A is challenging especially today (I got mine in 1992) there weren't as many regulations as there are today."
good,"I love working here. They take care of me and they all know me. I'm not just a number. I just call my fm and say my name and he knows my truck number and looks me up. I love it here. I have made tons of friends and connections and love it. I have a brand new truck and I get to work and run hard. If i dont feel safe about weather, they do not want me to run and are fine with a load being late if need be. They send me messages that my life is more important and to be safe. That I am irreplaceable. This company is great!"
good,Orientation was grewling a week almost 3 days of computer training and orientation. Go in to that company with patience. But I once you get rolling you'll get miles and stay rolling
good,"Drivers are assign top of the line equipment. Generally in good condition. Hardest part of the job was receiving home-time. Most enjoyable part was friendly dispatchers, friendly co-workers and not a cut-throat operation."
good,"They have some awesome trainers which teach you how to couple and uncouple your trailer, grease fifth wheel, go over the inspection of the tractor and trailer as well as help you with paper logs ."
good,"great starting company, company offers both regional or local jobs, both solo and teams, the fleet managers are well knowledge in the role and are very friendly"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is, you can chat, talk to the management about everything of your life. They even set special counseling for marriage and single, drug etc. A section of the company website is set up for over weight to keeping in shape for better health and quarterly training for better driving and customer courtesy."
good,"Nothing was wrong, had a good job with them. Management was understanding. Just had a set back that made me pull out and go somewhere else."
good,"In the beginning It was perfect. I made tons of money. My life, my family, my security, was all wrapped in one moment. It could not get any better. I was my own boss. Personal problems at home interfered with that moment. THE COMPANY IS FABULOUS..It opens so many options. Just remember one thing. If you wanna be a driver  ""have your priorities straight at home."" It's a single mans dream and a married mans nightmare"" It takes a really special person at home to support you.Truck driving isn't for everyone."
good,Driving from state to state. Ilearned how to log books an read maps. Management was ok. I didnt have a team driver. Staying awake and not getting the load there on time. Getting the load there on time was my greastest joy.
good,I worked for about  13 years at Werner Enterprises and I became trainer and Owner operator . It was a great privilege to be part at the Werner family.
good,"Werner walks their talk regarding work-life balance, diversity, and friendliness. A typical day at work involves working with various teams on deliverables, grooming user stories, and updating PO input on issues. Unfulfilling part of the job is an unclear vision, reluctance to invest in latest technology, and lack of cohesion among teams."
good,"Honestly the best account at Werner is the dedicated account and if you can find the flatbed account you can make at least $0.54 a mile. I'm currently in a 2019 Peterbilt, when I got the Peterbilt it had 53,000 miles on it they keep their trucks neat."
good,I'm on a dedicated account so I'm home every day  it's perfect but being a trainer on the account is the only way to advance it also has great bonuses... They also have numerous accounts to fit your pay and lifestyle  just wish the dedicated account payed more .
good,Werner is great at giving new drivers a chance to gain invaluable experience. The management is exceptional. The pay is ok and increasing but could be better.
good,It is a over the road trucking company. Life gets hard out here. But they take good care of me and let me go home when ever I want. And let me run as much as I want.
good,"As new driver I had the chance to meet a whole lot of helpful people every step of the way to guide me when I needed help, I thank them very much.thanks"
good,Werner is very stable and steady with work. Takes students and is always willing to work with it's drivers
good,Had a s.E. Route that had me home everyday was nice spend time with the family home time is very imporetant to me.
good,I have been through Werner's extensive training program. From the start I was dedicated to Dollar General. I spent 71 days on my trainers truck. He was excellent we never had a cross word. I got on my own truck and stuck with Dollar General. I love to work. Overall I am pleased with Werner. The only reason I am searching for a new job is I want to be home more.
good,"a regular way to start off the day would be with the boss sending a message and location and give a trailer number other job is to make it to that location before he sends another trailer this job taught me a lot about being responsibly and helped me a lot on my remembering skills because there are a lot of things you have to remember while unloading and loading a trailer that you have to repeat in the same order every time the company managed us very well when it came to shelter,food,etc i really was not around to many co workers while on the road but when ever we came to a stop or spend the night at the lounge there were really a lot of respectful employees except the employees that were tired and had just gotten off the highway the hardest part of the job was unloading a truck in the rain and sleeping in the truck bunk beds when ever we were not close to a lounge but the most enjoyable part of the job was eating out at different restaurants exploring and seeing a lot of different cities and cultures!"
good,"Long and peaceful days. I Learned how to be a professional driver ,management was fare,I worked very good with others.Waiting along time for a load. Delivering a load on time and in good quality."
good,i never had a issue with this company they got my full respect i would definitely recommend people to them especially to start their career off its a great company
good,Came to Werner straight out of truck school. Being brand new to trucking I went through Werner’s training program and was released early. I now drive on the Anheuser-Busch account I’m home daily working evening which is 100% drop and hook and 100% no touch freight. The best account in the area. I’ve been treated well and with respect. My fleet manager is for the driver he has your back 99% of the time 1% if you’re on his bad side.
good,Good to place to work .If you just received your cdl license and you straight out cdl school. They will give you chance were many other companies will not
good,A great company to start a trucking career. Excellent benefits. Average pay. A lot of miles if your willing to drive them. Not a lot of down time. Excellent hometime options
good,I had no complaints about my supervisors or coworkers. I would go back if I had the desire to drive over the road again. It's a good place to start truck driving in my opinion.
good,"worked at a Home Depot distribution center worked by my self 90% of the time , supervisor worked in Omaha NB kept in touch by telephone , faxed daily work orders to him , worked on box and flat bed trailers , did minor repairs that could be made on trailers trucks on site or  road side or parking lot's, most drivers were easy to work with , got any tools and supplies needed to do the job either shipped , mailed, or transported by company trucks to job site , great pay , wish I could work for them again"
good,"48 States time management  following rules and regulations d.O.T enforce, driving cross country learn how to operate fitfh wheel and tractor trailer ."
good,"Do a pre-trip on the truck to make sure that everything is at it's right level and not broken. I learned that in a semi-truck that you need a lot of patience. My dispatcher at night was very good because I talked to him more then my main one on my shift. All my co-workers I knew were very helpful. The hardest part about was dealing with everyday stress but I learned how to manage it. The most enjoyable part was seeing a new town everyday and the change of the seasons,"
good,"It's a great job, long hours little home thime. I have a family and wanted something close to home. I traveled all over the USA . Great experience driving learning to deal with time management and other drivers."
good,"I choose Werner because they advertise Safety as a #1 Goal. I pride myself in safe driving and being a professional driver. I drove all over the country and had the best and worst ( break downs) experience in the trucking industry. I love driving and I would like to continue in this Industry locally. As a professional driver I will work for any company who has the same values I have. Safety is #1. "
good,The day to day job was great hard work. I lost 30lb. in a short period of time and enjoyed the environment with the drivers. The hardest part of job was dealing with a manager whom was prone to true mood swings and very emotional. Since I am a very patient person this was very funny to me. This is a good company overall.
good,Stressful account. Worth the money. Risky due to customers employee not being able to honor their duties when it comes to unloading you within the aloted time.
good,"Werner Enterprise has been good to me.  I don't have anything bad to say about the company itself,  some of the staff need more training.  As a whole if you run your time right you can make money."
good,I enjoyed my time at Werner running from PHX-LA. I made it home every other day. No Touch Freight. Plenty of work all year round.
good,"Responsibilities included freight management solutions for shipping Nationwide. Inspections and Maintenance of Company owned Tractor Trailer. Provide service to multiple chain suppliers, and Vendors."
good,i was taught all my backing skills it was not a great job if you have a family
good,"never home, trainers are always trying to get you to sleep with them. not the place to get your training if you are a girl would not recommend trhem them to women."
good,They were a good company to work for. Just did not know how to keep a customer happy.
good,"Everybody was helpfully of what i was trying to do, and the really nice to you especially in backing up the truck they teach you how to backup the right way."
good,"i hauled refrigerated trailers, dry vans, and low boys for tracker marine i had the best time when i was training brand new drivers that just got out of truck driving school and i would recommend them to anybody"
good,"Werner is old school but efficient.  There is minimal investment in technology. Learned time management, problem solving, and how to manage a fleet. Would recommend."
good,great job to start a great career in the otr business. your learn the ins and outs from an outstanding performer in the nation. if you want a great job call werner
good,"Awesome!! Great Experience, great people, if you're interested going on the road this is the truck company for you. Training is spot on and most people actually care for your success. Pay is over $1000 weekly so not bad for a recent graduate."
good,"This position added experience to my resume, and was a good start up job in driving. it has competitive pay and benefits . You  work long hours here driving cross country transporting dry goods."
good,"Loved the training, and the traveling.  The money was good, but was hard to work in teams as over the road drivers with my significant other.  Had to make a choice over ending my relationship and continue to truck by myself, or resign and look into other endeavors.  If i was single i would go back into trucking."
good,"nice company, i belive its the best company for new driver without expirience, but they should have better incentive for experience drivers so they dont loss them."
good,"Not for everyone but a good place to start learning to driver over the road. Paid starts low but can grow based on safety standards. "
good,werner interprises is a great company i like work for them because they work together they like to share anything with the driver. they treat all as no racism.
good,Great company with great co-workers.  Enjoyed time working there.  Demands were high but environment was encouraging and fun.  Great people and opportunities.
good,Love driving on the open road and visiting new places. Fresh on hot sunny days and warm on cold winter days. Only bad thing is sometimes it gets lonely.
good,They give good training and they are nice people to work with it had blessed working over there. I mainly worked in dedicated lines from Ohio to pa to in to nj.
good,Company does not give very good raises if any at all. Drivers are treated like dirt and so are the office people. This company doesnt appreciate any of it talented and hard working employees and it is blatantly obvious.
good,"fast paced, have to have patience,management hands on,co workers expeirenced,finding good rates during holidays, satisfying a customer"
good,"assist drivers for assignments,  great HR dept,   company shouldn't promise something then not even give time of day to help."
good,"Very nice people to work with, smart and fun. They will always help and push you to become better and better. A little difficult to commute to, but it is still a nice open-space office."
good,"werner enterprises is good company ,it is number one on the world wide. they give urs the good benefits.401 k, stork, for me it is the best place to be work."
good,"Day to day tranfer of general products,tarining others was extreamly enjoyable,managment very supportive,adverse weather was hardest part of job,independance was must enjoyable"
good,Very professional company and fair to drivers.Dispatchers I dealt with were all were good to work for. I'd gladley work again for this company.
good,"werner is a place where u can make a descent living,but u wont be home much"
good,"When you wake up, already at work, life must be good. I loved having the freedom to make my own schedule, yet still work 72 hours a week! Driving for Werner Enterprises has been one of my most memorable, and favorite jobs. "
good,I enjoyed making customers happy and knowing i could make someones day better.
good,I loved this job. It was fast paced and great people to work with and for.
good,"A day at work consist of traveling, communicating with management and other workers within the industry. Learning was limitless. I learn how to be better at leading, problem solving. I learned more about my self-reliant ability. I learned supervisory and training techniques. Management is very professional, knowledgeable, and they are the leaders in the industry. Co-workers a very friendly, helpful in every situation, and are leaders. The physical part (requirement of truck-driving) is, respectfully, the hardest part. One of the best parts is traveling within the 48 contiguous-states and Canada."
good,long hours. not much overtime. broken trucks. no home time. proofread your contract because there are a lot of lies within this company.
good,Traveled 48 States transporting goods in a safe and effective manner.
good,great for a single person or a husbun and wife team you get to see the world and get paid to do it
good,"performed pre/post trip inspections, ensured security of cargo, reported any issues, transported freight, and maintained driver log."
good,"My day would start at about ,with first trainer at 6 am making runs from Joliet to Indianapolis, In 5 day a week."
good,"a typical day consists of receiving a drop from any where from 400- 1500 miles round trip going around delivering product to dollar generals depending on your regional area, your management are as good as you treat them as well"
good,Werner was a pleasure to work for and the support people were great. They were always helpful. I was always given JIT and high profile loads.
good,it was an ok job i liked the job i was ok to get  my bills payed and also able to take care of my familyand the benifits were wonderful i encorage other to work there
good,typical day is driving from shipper to cons.have learned how to operate truck and drive it safely
good,"Not enough money, or miles when I was there in 1995. Things could be 100% different now, but I don't know. I believe I quit there sometime around 1999"
good,"Back when I was there I was making only 25 cents per mile , the equipment wasn't very good, my management staff wasn't the greatest cause some weren't willing to listen to what I had to say and they wanted to drive my truck from there desk also I was on the western region fleet and they would send me to Jersey and Pittsburgh which is not on the western region  but since it was forced dispatch no one seemed to care who was on what fleet"
good,"Werner is a great company to work for, they offer great benefits and they take care of there employees. The orientation process was easy and not complicated."
good,"Great Company and benefits, great pay "
good,"I really do enjoy a fast paced work environment.  I have grown accustomed to working 14 hours a day, working from home on the weekends, to some it may sound horrible but I thoroughly enjoy the high pressure work environment.  It keeps me sharp."
good,I enjoyed working for the company.  There was room for lateral  movement within the company.  I enjoyed communicating with the drivers and clients
good,"Me and my wife decided to do the otr team driving. The work is very strenuous in team driving being that the truck always moved, but we understood that freight had to be delivered on time. Werner ent kept the loads coming. We traveled all around the countryside, we've been to about 52 states while making enough money to keep us motivated. Trust I couldn't have kept her out there if it wasn't for the motivation. Werner was very good with keeping the documents updated, if you needed to talk to someone, no matter the time someone was always available. And the paychecks were always on time."
good,The Company is concerned about the drivers safety.  Pretrip on company equipment to ensure safety.  The hardest part of the job is being away from family for extended time.
good,"I enjoy working, the people are nice the work is steady I have good and bad days just like everyone else  but I don't take anything that happens at work personal  I listen and I learn I take the good from every conversation I have with customers co-workers and other staff and I apply it to my life  I'd say the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am blessed no matter what happens in life I know I am blessed and God is in the center of life"
good,"Great place to work never had a problem. Health Insurance one of the best,"
good,"I was treated in a professionall manor when I stood up for myself. They qualified me as a leader/Trainer for other drivers as I was good at what I did. Co-workers that knew me, knew I was dedicated & good at what I did for the company & myself & the safety of others. Most enjoyable part of the job is the recognition after a job well done."
good,"Great job well maintained equipment  never had problems getting anything fixed. If you live in Fl not many opportunities, and getting home for home time is hard. Overall a good company, they will slave you tho, 34 not mandatory they will try to run you for every minute on your clock."
good,"It is a great atmosphere to work, the training is excellent along with the management that you will work with.  It has awesome benefits and pay above all others, but the only problem is the lack of positions for local jobs, making it hard for me to stay with the company due to it affect my family life to much."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time driving for Werner's dedicated Dollar Tree/Family Dollar account. If I thought I could get more home time and more pay, I would go back in a heartbeat. I really took advantage of the driver unload structure to stay healthy and earn more pay, but the physical toll became too much coupled with frustration on the load quality coming out of the DT/FD Distribution Centers."
good,Never had a problem with fleet managers. Just need a local job close to home. Werner Enterprises is a good company to start out with and get the experience of driving OTR.
good,Wish I still worked there but wanted to be closer to home/family  and more during the week. Would highly recommend company  to anyone and would go back if closer to home
good,bastante trabajo lo cual es muy bueno pero poco tiempo en casa
good,"I learned a lot with Werner. Was able to travel different places,learn new cultures and make money. Advanced to being a trainer, taught new drivers ,met new people."
good,Haul your loads to and from your destinations.  Make sure you take care of your truck and any trailer you haul.  communicate well with terminal personnel.  Home time isnt the greatest when you have a family but it isnt terrible either.
good,"Werner Enterprises was my first job as a truck driver, and it was a fun experience. Anybody that enjoys to travel will enjoy this job, since it covers the lower 48 states, along with Canada. Since it was my first job it was also a learning experience. Werner offers different fleet options for those that want to look at doing things like flatbed, refrigerated or regular van."
good,"Check with dispatch to confirm load assignment, inspect the vehicles truck and trailer, load trail, check load and confirm it matches the load manifest, deliver the load in a safe, legal time and manor."
good,A great company to work for they have really nice truck and they keep them in good working condition  and they keep you moving unless they are low on freight
good,It okay if you have no life back at home n kids wanna sleep In at good bed with out it moving around while someone is driving and your sleep worry if they may crash or not
good,"I really enjoyed working for Werner, the only issue for me was my children was growing up with out me. truck driving is hard on a relationship and family the most"
good,"I enjoyed working at Werner for the past 11 years.  Of course, Safety was the main concern every day.  After doing complete pretrip inspections on both tractor and trailer, I then proceeded to pick up preassigned load, delivering of the load and post pretrip inspection, then picking up a back haul and repeating the process the next day."
good,"Great company, i have been with Werner off and on for 15 years, Dollar general account currently. Hard work but make great pay,Average $2000/week  gross. Iknow some will tell you stay away from these accounts but if you are not afraid of hard work and like to be home every weekend this account is perfect. Awsome dispatch as well. Currently driving 2020 International. Werner does take care of drivers...."
good,"You are treated like family. Headquarters is in Omaha, NE. I have seen the company go out of their way to help drivers and office staff where other companies I worked for wouldn't of."
good,Werner is a good company both for new drivers and also for more experienced ones. Equipment is fairly new and there are over 200 different accounts available; if you figure out the account you are on is not for you it is very easy to transfer to a new one. Starting pay ranges from 38000 your first year to over 60k. It depends on what account you choose. Pay increases are every 10 months as long as you are doing your job correctly and not getting in trouble. Home time varies depending on what account you are on from home daily to home every 2 weeks. Overall I am very happy with Werner and plan to retire from here.
good,"This is a good company to work for. They are very large so you wont feel like a family, but they work with you on time off, home time and any issues you have."
good,I was a contractor here and NOT an employee. The questions here relate more to employees than contractors. This should NOT be a required entry in my humble opinion.
good,"return to truck 10 a.m Monday morning"
good,"Plenty of work. New equipment. Room for advancement. Great management. To much time away from home. No regional work in Panama city area,unless you want to want to unload freight by hand (Dollar General, Family Dollar)."
good,"I enjoyed driving, but didn't like being away from home for so long. My wife was allowed to ride along but she didn't like living out of a truck stop."
good,Werner is a good company to start out with and if you can get a dedicated account you can make good money and have decent home time and they have good equipment
good,Hardest part of the job was managing time.  most enjoyable part was meeting new people and the different states and cities. typical work day pre trip the truck and tractor getting load to customer on time.
good,"it is your basic trucking company. 70 hours work week 36-hour reset "
good,"Low pay and horrible working conditions. Work in an open parking lot in extreme temperatures both summer, winter plus rain snow ice. No advancement within this company as they prefer to hire outside instead of promoting from within Work out of a service truck on the property of the account they have and there is no shelter except for in the cab of the service truck."
good,I got to travel the country while working. I learned how to drive a semi effectively and through every weather condition and landscape imaginable. This was an enjoyable job.
good,"i would wake up, get on my computer and find a load, once i get a load i will put it in my gps and go to either a shipper to get a load or if i am already loaded to the receiver to drop a load"
good,"A typical day. I manage 65 drivers. 40% of the time I am on the phone convincing drivers to come to work. The other 60% of the time is spent dispatching work orders to drivers, managing their pay and routing needs as well as the maintenance of the vehicles and trailers."
good,"Great Benefits with outstanding leadership, well maintained semi-tractors. I would drive around 8-10 hours a day and they have no problem sending you back home on a bus to see your family. Trucks are up to date with standard technology and I am currently on a local waiting list for a Dollar General account."
good,"Werner Industries is a solid, Honest company that puts there employees first, If I wanted to work, they always had work for me, quick responsive company support."
good,"You get paid to travel the USA. I inspected my equipment to assure it was properly maintained and if it was in need of repairs I requested for the repairs to be completed. I would be assigned a location to take the equipment to to get it repaired and when it was complete would get underway loaded or empty. I would get to my destination walk into the shipping or receiving office and either drop my trailer and hook up to another or back into a designated dock to be loaded or unloaded. When finished at the dock I would then return to the office and retrieve the required paperwork. I would then inspect the equipment if hooking up to a new trailer or reinspect the one I was under to ensure there were no issues. Before I left my location I would then send the bills to the office via my phone to complete the process. I would then put in the co-ordinance of the next location into the Quallcom (the company communications device, to keep in touch with each driver) and begin the process over again."
good,werner is a great company to work for if you can get on NETOPS were you can be home every night and pay is pretty good once you have been on account for a year or two.
good,they were very caring and understanding company..  only down fall at times away from family too long
good,"driving a truck is like a dream the travel the freedom & the commitment is a great service nationally I learned the highways ,the mapping process safety the truck stops the benifits & all the friendly people there to meet ,weather has its lows & highs overall its a great job opportunity"
good,It was a great place.to work. Easy work no rushing you and if you felt it was unsafe to drive they understood. Truck's were awesome and very spacious inside. I was happy there.
good,"I,,, enjoy working at Werner Enterprise, it gives me that freedom I want,  when I want it,, (days off, location of travel), plus the ability to change fleets if my current job is not a fit, also never losing my seniority,, which makes my pay as great as I'm willing to make it,, (right fleet,, run the miles,, get paid). Like I said, its what you make it,,, #STAYSAFE.."
good,"I love my job! No ones on your a** or micromanaging. Get your loads on time and drive safe. This company take great care of me. Truck broke down? They pay breakdown pay and get you in a hotel, they've rented me two cars to get to different terminal when needed. They pay me layover pay. Great communication! Unlike cr england where I've waited a whole day for a response"
good,As working for any other companies there are some good and some bad. There are some things that should be changed but overall it's a great place to work.
good,"I enjoy working for Werner. They work with you in whatever you need. You get to choose what tractor you want. To me it's just a good starter company to work for. The money is there, you just have have to go get it."
good,"Werner is a great company for hard workers and if I could work for them again I would in a heartbeat, unfortunately I got hurt and had problems with their insurance group and ultimately had to resign but the people there were great and I would always recommend a good honest worker to apply with them."
good,"I enjoyed driving for Werner buy I really wanted to get my education"
good,I started over two years ago.  I left for 3 months to go local and came back.  Grass isn't always greener on the other side.  Werner took me back and put me back on my same dedicated account.  Now I'm a trainer and I'm not going anywhere!
good,they have good equipment and staff to help you out. they will keep you moving as much as possible. the fleet managers will keep you moving as much as possible.
good,"As a new driver, the dispatchers worked with you on time delivery until you got the hang of time management and were able to make your own decisions of planning your schedule for on-time delivery."
good,"I'd like to point out that I didn't leave Werner, I left trucking.  That said, Werner is an incredible place to work if trucking is what you're interested in.  A lot of Werner's problems aren't so much ""Werner's"" problems but moreover are problems with the industry as a whole.  Crazy hours, uncertainty, risk, danger, impolite shippers/consignees; these are problems that are indicative of absolutely every trucking company.  But, if big trucks and high excitement are something you're looking to get paid for, Werner will help you every single step of the way, as long as you pass a drug screen and psyche eval."
good,"Sixteen years provided me many great experiences and opportunities. If going into the field, Werner is a great place to start and END a career in driving."
good,I ran on the 3M account just getting started my fleet manager was nice if I had to do anything extra I was paid for it it was a great company to work for
good,"great place to begin a trucking career, was able to obtain a lot of over the road experience in all types of weather conditions and traffic situations."
good,Werner is a great company to work for the best part of the day is getting there earlier than everyone else and being able to book the good high margin loads and get the day rolling right. The worst part of the job is when you have to pay a carrier out of your margin because someone in scheduling messed up on a pickup or delivery time. They do have a lot of new management and have a few growing pains but overall a great place to work.
good,Fun environment with high expectations. Manager works with you to help you move past obstacles. It's a large company so things do move at corporate speed sometimes.
good,"The company has changed since i worked there, owner ship has gone back to the original owner and i have heard good things as of recent.  As always they have good looking late model trucks."
good,worked both mechanical and electrical trouble shooting along with software and OIT dealing with Allen Bradley equipment and Wonderware through a Industrial computer via a Ethernet link or serial port. Traveled world wide with no issues getting in any country or destination.
good,I have Drove for werner for a little over 3 years they have been great until my truck broke several times in one month they refuse to give me a different truck and i refuse to live in a hotel
good,is good for a single person with no children and you're out of the house all the time when you get to the home time is supposedly for two days but the day you get playing you arrive after dark that day you lose it completely pays no is what they promise
good,"typical day, was getting dispatched to 48 out of 50 states. I didn't stay long enoug to have much to report. I was hired as soon as I finished a 6 week truck driving school and stayed wit Werner for six months with a trainer. I was lucky that while I was taking a break t visit my family I went to the DMV to get my endorsements. Immediatley after I was hired with CTL."
good,"learn aspects of this field, meeting people different states"
good,I work with inmates coming out of prison who are re-entering society.
good,Werner Enterprises always believed in educating their driver's future in mind. They were a good company to learn how live a good trucking lifestyle. They were very professional and always treated their employees with respect and care. Their number one priority was always the safety and comfort of the driver.
good,"Werner is very easy to get started with and the pay is good for beginner and experienced drivers. Everyone within Werner is positive, helpful and supportive (for the most part). The only exception to this are the nighttime and weekend dispatchers; you’re best to figure things out yourself. However, all main-dispatchers I’ve ever been assigned to have always made sure I’m loaded with miles, and are very responsive and helpful."
good,Love Werner would work there again if they let me had the freedom to travel the USA and get paid was not under pressure to deliver loads in really bad weather conditions fleet managers work with me to get me home when I wanted to
good,"Good company"
good,It great company if you need to work with team and solo . Hey try to take care they people. Helps you need in your job to the point you successful comes in your ways
good,"Been with Werner almost 2 years and am happy. Overall I have little to complain about. They're paying $250 a month on my driver school tuition. Plus I make about 1100 to 1300 a week for driving 60 hours.  "
good,"Company is good to work for to start out driving career. "
good,"I was there for 6 months in training. They didn't treat everybody the same some people they knew by there name. Some only by a number. I didn't like being treated by a number. I was the only person my age at this job, I was only 21 years of age. They treated me like a kid and I didn't like it."
good,"Typically drivers are kept busy.  When available, there are dedicated routes available:  cross-country, regional, or local.  Comprehensive training is provided.  When desired and available, opportunities exist for the aforementioned dedicated routes and even for increased pay as a driver trainer (encouraged)."
good,"long days on the road, was cool to go into different states   but the down fall  was your away from home a lot.but over all was a cool job ,didnt like the part about driving in bad weather though  but is part of the job. dispatchers  where nice but they did run you hard  also they try to force you to drive or take a run  when your almost out of hours to drive  and its hard to get a run to your home or close to your home.the most enjoyable part is when you do get to go home   ."
good,"Had a heavy workload, but it was manageable. The supervisors and managers were fairly helpful when I needed help or had questions. I hated leaving this job, but I had a medical condition that temporarily made me unable to work."
good,Werner was a great company to drive for. They were not that great at getting you home when it was time. I would go back and work for this company at anytime.
good,I didn't have much problems with this job. they just run you hard. they were very understanding with asking time off. the only complaint I have is they consider things like a piece of rebar that scratches a bumper. a chargeable accident.
good,Working with werner. I enjoyed meeting new people i enjoyed being on the road delivering to different family dollar stores. The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck you had to touch every ppiece on the truck.
good,"Werner is great place to work  and alot of team players  .they have great benefit ,always  having  special  events  for the worker. Always help coworkers  when they  in trouble."
good,going down the highway when my stiering arm broke on my truck and I had know way of stiering the truck are no control of which way it was going but with RED shirt and my quick thinking I made it happen with out an accident and without anyone getting hurt scary but I made by the grace of GOD AMEN...........
good,"The pay is low getting started but if you stick with them it pays off.  My experience has been with a dedicated account where I hand unload.  You earn your money, but they pay well if you work and take the loads they give you.  The fleet managers I work for are awesome and do everything they can for you."
good,"The work environment and personnel made it a fun place to work, which encouraged me to work harder and cover more than my share of freight and help out and work more as a team. Direct report was a little to micro managing at most times, which was a distraction to productivity and the entire office atmosphere. "
good,I knew when I could or couldn't make the deliveries on time. I learned that it takes an army of people to get loads set up and delivered. My coworkers and I hardly saw eachother. hardest part was driving in the harsh weather in winter up in Wisconson. That also was my most enjoyable part watching the other car drivers having problems.
good,If you are able to secure a location in the dedicated division you are in a great spot.  Don't get me wrong...the work is hard.  But the leadership and technology that helps you do what you need to do is good and getting great.  Bring your lunch pale and you will have an opportunity to advance and make a career here.
good,Werner Enterprises is a great place to work. There are great opportunities especially if you are a beginner in truck driving. The short time I worked with them I learned a lot as a beginning truck driver.
good,"Typical day would start by doing a 15 minute pre-trip inspection on the truck to make sure everything was looking good, nothing cracked, bent, or broken. Nothing leaking or hissing. Weather matters and checking it is important. Summer is a little more trusting than the winter, but heavy rain and blustering winds are not conditions safe to drive in. The great thing about this company is they are very safe oriented and will always be on your side if you don't feel safe. The hard part was being away from home for so long, but being able to drive and see the states was nice. It's all just passing by when you're with a teammate. Definitely have to be good with time management when driving solo."
good,It was my first experience driving a big rig. As a lady driver I enjoyed the experience. Many accounts to choose from. They give you new equipment eventually! A great learner company. I met and loved Mr Werner! (Very humble)
good,I have just started with Werner and I will tell you from experience this has been the best experience I've had in trucking and I've been doing it 8years. Very friendly and professional.They have good pay for orientation. And if you're willing to bust your butt you can make good weekly pay.I would highly recommend giving Werner a chance you'll be glad you did.
good,They treat their drivers good  and they’re always with you for any inconvenience . Drivers go on home time anytime they want to no one pressures the drivers abt their home time.
good,"Good company to start your trucking carrer, or also is a very good company to just stay working for. They have new equipment and if anything goes wrong with your truck they take care of it rigjt away."
good,"I loved the company. My fleet managers addressed me by name, they we're communicative and truly gave me EVERYTHING I asked for. When I wanted to switch from OTR to REGIONAL to Local, they switched me almost immediately."
good,"really take  care of their employees,strong management,positive culture,fast paced well organized,well maintained equipment,I would highly recommend Werner."
good,"Management was always nice to me. I have had about 4 or 5 and they were all awesome. Helped me with any issues that comes up. for example, I needed to go home to help my family and they made it happen. Got into an accident and it went almost seamlessly."
good,Truck driving has its perks and benefits when you have full support of family. Not good for married life unless local. Following DOT regulations is also a challenge. Proper management of time is paramount. Service to customers is most important when tasked to deliver on time.
good,"Pretty much kept you running, sometime dispatch would push me when roads were closed due to blizzard conditions. Have to request a new dispatcher. They were good in keeping trucks clean. Able to have my dog with me. The pay wasn't the best, spent much of your money living out on the road in many states."
good,The company values all their employees.  A great place to work with opportunity.  They have great training and career opportunity's.  Management is respectful and helpful.
good,"It was a good learning experience for me. They paid great and I realize that looking back. I made $66,000 my first year running teams with multiple bonuses."
good,"I have a great fleet manager and he gives me miles when I want them, time off when I want it. We drive long days, sometimes making deliveries to two stores each day. Some of the Target trailers could use some maintenance but overall it is a great job. I just want a job in which I get to go home every night. I don't live close enough to the distribution center to allow me to do that."
good,"Much experience in a short time, great trainer. Overall they are a good company. I just am relocating to a place where there is no werner contract, if so I would stay and do dedicated routes."
good,Only problem I had was getting enough home time. Other than that it was a great company. Always had jobs and never sat for more than 10 hours. I would recommend to anyone not concerned with home time.
good,Drive through the country making stops at different states. I learned to be a better and aware driver. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the country.
good,"Good company to work for great equipment and good acoounts"
good,"I loved the Experience the co gave me.  If I was single I would still be there. Safety is at the top of the list at Werner , that I love. never was there a question about equipment ."
good,"I worked on a dedicated account pulling Dollar General freight. I would still be working there if they still floor loaded. They started using roll-tainers to load freight, in which they loaded weighing 1500 pounds or more."
good,They're smart but fair. They do take care of their drivers. They know thats where the money comes from. Overall good people.
good,Great trust and independence with Werner. Dedicated accounts allow for professional relationships to develop with distribution centers.
good,"Being my first "
good,The company and supervisors were supportive and helpful. They listened to the issues and did what was necessary to fix them.
good,"Definitely enjoyed working for Werner Enterprises. Definitely learned and obtained new skills, as well expanded my current skills. Company is nice to drive for, just wish it wasn't so into the number game."
good,"Long day's, a lot of travel, good pay, great benefits. Missed being home, and didn't like driving for so long."
good,Great company to train. The long hours and low pay make one look for higher paying opportunities.
good,I loved working for Werner. I became a traine after a year of employee and learned the ins and out of the trucking industry.
good,"A reasonable place to work, with reasonable expectations, Training available, positive experience--start to finish, headquarters communicates well with satellite terminals."
good,"You get back what you put in!"
good,"The most fun I can say I've ever had as far as jobs go. I would still be driving yet I had to go home and take care of family. The open road, getting to explore the US by truck. The training is fun, but the real fun comes from driving solo."
good,Really enjoying the job. i love traveling the country. I've been given some great job opportunities. The work is fulfilling. My dispatcher is great. Love it.
good,"It was a good company, with a yard in most of the country. An impressive headquarters. The only bad thing was that I wasted a lot of time waiting to deliver two charges for two consecutive weekends."
good,"Driving, logging your time working everyday, meeting people, hardest part of job you don't see your family every day , long hours of driving into traffic. You have to be aware of your surroundings of traffic and people.I mostly like the freedom of the road. And sometimes being to myself."
good,"New equipments, luxury terminals but i think fleet management problem ,most managers  discriminate when it comes to load assignment.but my first manager was super awesome. Werner got the best training allowance for new students. They need effective driver retention programs. It's sad to train drivers but after you don't retain the drivers."
good,"Werner had/ has great people to work with, a true team effort.  This is trucking, so home life is a challenge, but schedulers always tried to get you home on time for off days.  This was helpful for family life and Dentist appointments.  An inverter is available to truckers for your fridge, just ask for one.  Good luck!!!"
good,"Excellent company to start your career as a professional driver, I in particular had a very good experience from the beginning, especially in the Phoenix terminal, where the staff is very professional, I felt very good, nothing will be easy, but patiently and with effort you can achieve it, I had never touched a truck in my more than 40 years and I thought I would never learn, but with a team like Phoenix, everything is possible, thanks to all for the knowledge provided."
good,"I always wanted to drive a truck; just something that was on my bucket list. Werner gave me that opportunity. I drove for 15 months and left on good terms. I may go back when the stress of my desk job gets to me again. Werner treated me very well. I was well compensated; I made over $1,300 a week average, and I was a new driver right out of CDL school. I drove OTR and temped on a few regional accounts when asked. Never really had any issues. I would not recommend any of the Dollar store accounts, but other than that, I enjoyed my time at Werner."
good,I enjoyed my time with Werner. They are a very good company. I would continue to work here but did not like the area I worked. The management can very depending on your fleet manager but I met more good ones than bad.
good,"They are a great place to work, or I wouldn't have been there for 43 years.Talked on phone all day to customers.Learned computer helped alot of workers since I had been there so long."
good,"The company trusted me to be a trainer, so they gave me a new truck to do the job."
good,Great company to drive for they treat there drivers with respect and politeness you are apart of a family it great work great pay always opportunity for advancement you are always working yes but you will always have a chance to spend time with your family and you are never screwed over just work hard get the job done never complain and you get great pay
good,"I usually wake up in my truck and i get back to driving to my destination where ever it will be. I had appointment time but gave you time to do what you need to do, I learned alot as a truck driver different obstacles and terrains but i loved it. The fleet manager was great to me and got me home when I needed to be home. The culture is nice as all truck drivers know and help each other out. The hardest part of my job is losing service and the gps takes you somewhere where you have to figure out how to get out of like back country roads. The most enjoyable part of my job is making money just driving and seeing the U.S. and all its beauty."
good,"we make delivery around the northeast region,, the job great,, love the trucks,,very good pace stable work, management is OK and good,,communication is perfect"
good,I learned many things at IBM that included the repair of computers and their peripherals. The company was great about letting you learn anything that assisted with your ability to do a job.
good,Good company to work for. I learned a lot about the trucking business. I think the hardest part of the job was staying awake behind the wheel. The most enjoyable part of the job was going to different parts of the United States.
good,"A typical day at work includes delivering merchandise to consumer, and communication to personnel or consumers if necessary.

Being a driver was really good and I liked the work conditions and the professional backing I received from the company was very much like how the military is. They really took care of their drivers and my fleet manager was very good and very professional. I will never have anything bad to say about the company. It was really good and safety was part of the job. They pay was good and the job was always there. There was  work all the time and always coming. I did love doing the job, However I also missed my home, and family, and I also missed working with other people. I am a minister of a small church in Arizona and I missed performing my job and performing my job for the church and the people. With these things it is basically impossible to merge these two.

If I could reteam back up with him and have the same great quality of life I had when I worked there, it is by far the PERFECT job for someone like me."

good,"A typical day at Werner Enterprise Inc. was me driving to different states dropping off product in a 53"" trailer. In the beginning I was just drop and hook, which means I would drop off a loaded trailer at it's location then either pick up another trailer to take to it's destination, or drive to another location to pick up a loaded trailer to take to it's destination. After that I started to work for Dollar General but with the same trucking company. I learned from this job that, even though traveling is fun and sometimes beautiful. There are a lot of things that you have to look for being on the road. I learned how to read a map, a little about the tractor engine, and how to inspect a trailer. I also learned that being on the road is mentally tiring. The hardest part about being a truck driver is that if you have a family, you can miss a lot of family time together. The most enjoyable part about truck driving is that you visit a lot of states, meet new people, and see a lot of the beautiful things while being over the road."

good,"Good with home times, good money & miles. Hands on traning on everything."
