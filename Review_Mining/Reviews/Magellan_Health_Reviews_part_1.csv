good,"Recommends"
bad,"Low pay fighting against the union . They are threatening employees not have any thing about union formation . Some of leadership only care about looking good, afraid of leadership and do not care about  the welfare of the employees"
bad,"People that should not have been hired hire more unqualified people. Management specifically. If you can't do the job of the people you are supervising, you shouldn't be managing them. Life work balance is nonexistent."
bad,I had a manager that was a puppet to her director.  My manager never reported on time and loved visitors.  She always stated she had to work late but had nothing to do
bad,"This company was hard to work for, favoritism was ramped. The supervisor poorly managed the team.  Training was poor made doing a good job hard. I have no kind words for this company."
bad,"Magellan is guilty of age and sex discrimination.  If one is hired over 40 years old, they are dead ended the minute they accept employment.  Magellan is often run by inexperienced people in their early 20's.  Ability does not decide who is promoted.  The company is no better than any ""high school"" clique.  The worker bees are often not reward.  These issue have lead to a decline in Magellan's stock prices and market shares."
bad,There are too many issues for you to even enjoy a days work. Training is horrible and compensation for what they force on you is not up to par. System problems and management is not top notch. If you wanna be over worked and under paid this is the place for you.
bad,"I was excited to work for Magellan when I applied and got an interview. However, I was very disappointed when I never heard back from the interviewer about the status of the position. I just think it very unprofessional especially when someone spent their time to attend an interview and doesn’t get any response and ignored about the status of the position. After this experience, it’s very unlikely for me to apply to a job, or advise someone to apply to your company. I hope there is some professionalism shown to people who are not working for your organization because they waste a lot of time, effort and resources during an interview process and it is very disrespectful when interviewers decide to ignore them and not follow up."
bad,This place is racist and descrimates against anywho who isnt blonde hair blue eyes! They hire alot of people becuase they enjoy walking around and firing people to embarrass the person. Ive seen it multiple times if you are not kissing a higher ups butt you will be bullied NONSTOP. The recruiter people espescially
bad,"Supervisor had limited experience.  I gave 3 months written notice for resignation from position prior to summer vacation so that gave 5 months advance notice for them to hire and train another MFLC."
bad,"Management is terrible and everybody is already cliqued up. People talk about you behind your back, but they don't care what anyone is going through as long as the business needs are taken care of. We went thru 4 managers when I was there within 2 years!! The office stinks and everyone was always getting sick..  if you work there, go to work and then go straight home! Seriously, watch your back.. I have never seen so much fakeness in my life."
bad,"Magellan does not care about the employees. Only 6 month contracts.  Management has problems with the ability to make decisions and respect employees. Large turn over. After the other Organization obtain DOD Contractor, the two merge back together and are Magellan."
bad,"If you like being micro managed, your performance being determined by impossible metrics, Yearly benefit reductions, virtually no HR department, constant employee turnover,  less than 3% yearly merit raises, and  managers who are allowed to violate wage and hour laws. This would be the job for you."
bad,"This work environment was horrible, HR is horrible the leadership was horrible. I had MULTIPLE issues with the supervisor. Went to the director, HR and CEO a few days later my work would get pulled for “review” or a “new” issue would arise. The direct supervisor knew nothing and slowly started bringing in her friends from her small hometown. Who are not to mention completely under qualified. We were told at one point we need to prove why our work positions are needed"
bad,Little support from administration or supervisors. Passes the buck for training and communication with colleagues. On your own most of the time.  Poor role models for supervisors.
good,"Recommends"
bad,"Imagine being a violinist on the Titanic, forced to perform perfectly, despite the obvious fact that the ship is sinking beneath your feet, and  while everyone around you is running for the life rafts. "
bad,please be advised this place do not train you for the mental headache you receive as a by product of poor training. no one on one improvement structures. no leadership.positional authority is driven and no one thrives to be there everyone hate the job no sign of true passion and forfillment. no honesty in the position to help you improve. a lot of living in the gray area but they teach black or white structures. a lot of people quit. this not a long term position.
bad,Magellan is a horrible place to work. They don't care about their employees at all. It was easy to get in but once I got there after a couple of years u will see what kind of company you are really working for. They tell you that you can advance there but NO you can not. I should have left them a long time ago. They just make it hard for anyone who works for them.
bad,"I was hired for the call center. I was not given enough training plus given more responsibilities as time went on, again, with no training. Management knew that there was little training given, but just didn't care. They cared more about you answering the phones and giving their customers false information than wanting to sit down with you and teach you what you should say/do. Other contractors hired on with me were given ""special treatment"" and more training, while some were not given any training at all. It was always, ""Did you check the documents/QuikCheck?"" when the information was clearly not there. The trainers were not familiar at all with the particular client so they were worthless when it came to asking questions."
bad,"Training is poor.  Management does not know how to mange time or people.  Great job if you like working in a cube and never see another human being.  Disorganization is the cultural norm.  No pre-planning whatsoever.  If you like the ""Fire-Ready-Aim"" mentality, this place is for you."
bad,Did not like very cold and unfriendly.   you never got to meet any of you team even after working with them for over a year.  no one say good morning you are on the phone all the time it was very stressful and the pay was terrible
bad,"People were nice there, but the management were very, very poor. I definitely would not recommend this job to a friend. I wouldn't even mention the name to anyone I know."
bad,"I like Magellan- we are being laid off..."
bad,"I got very little training before co-worker left for 3 months. Not only was the trainer condascending but very impatient. Managent had no clue what was going on or able to answer questions. I was the only left to do the job of 3 people working 10+ hours my last few days. Called manager one day due to stress and I was let go. Expect to be worked to the max, no proper training and micromanaging!"
bad,I don't work there anymore. I cant say much about it. I don't know if the same people are still there. I don't know how the company operates anymore or if they are still in business.
bad,"Call center poorly managed, upper management only concerned about the bonuses they get for the work employees do, terrible communication, horrible benefits, supervisors and upper management shows favoritism with job advancement not on qualifications and work history,"
bad,"Magellan is not a great employer. All they care about are numbers, they could care less about their employees. I would highly recommend not working for them."
bad,I was not happy working for Magellan.  It was difficult to get the more experienced co-workers to assist and the fear of losing your job was always present.
bad,"I've been an MFLC for over 18 months and with 2 different contractors. This one openly admits they pay less and pay just decreased again. Insurance has also gone up and there's no PTO. If there's a govt. holiday you don't get pay."
bad,"The entire experience was weird from the application to training.  I never made it to the Call Center floor.   Neither did most of my classmates from training class.  They were intrusive and abrasive...management and ZeroChaos.  This was a bad experience in Columbia MD. "
bad,"This company closed and is no longer doing mental health authorizations for Blue Cross and Blue Shield."
bad,"managers have an attitude that reflects their personal feelings toward  others,and demonstrate very little respect for those not in a leadership position."
bad,Supervisors are unprofessional. They do not tell the truth in many cases. Communication to staff is extremely poor. Stressful work environment. You can never do anything right there. Would not work there.
good,"Recommends"
bad,"At first, you are a god (they are so shorthanded) you get in there and understand why they are so short-handed.  Rules on top of rules, One mention and you are to have the total process down.  No mistakes at all allowed (even minor spelling on brand name products, the pressure to work faster.  If you can't meet the increased time demands you are put on a write up just before your raise making you ineligible for a raise for another year, 4 different ways to account for your time and they must all be done perfectly."
bad,"Been an employee of this organization for over 10 years.  The original company was bought out twice and now ended with Magellan HS.  Such a worst management who knows only to micromanage.  Thinks all those loud mouths are doers and silent folks are non-performers.   Glad I got out on my own, keeping my head high while the parasites still sucking the blood of the organization and as well as their colleagues."
bad,"Micromanaged, very poor planning creates constant crisis mode, few processes, very political, accountabilty applies only to foot soldiers, CYA mentality, very poor health care for a health care company."
bad,"Applied and interviewed by three separate individuals for a specific job role. However, upon day of orientation, discovered that I was placed in a different department. Manager is very racial and HR did nothing to assist me. Poor job specific orientation. Many confused employees, as disorganization was abound."
bad,The claim they promote advancement within the company. They only pick people who are their friends or who kiss up to them. I would never come to the claims department. Most of the people are sneaky and backstabbers. They will step on whoever to get what they want. Trust no one they aren't your friends. I would go any place but claims at the Maryland Heights location.
bad,"Politics would be a description of Magellan-Alpharetta. Senior management is ancient, in their 70's'! Move on, and give other employees a chance to grow!  Same management has nultiple favorites, who happened to work for her when she was a supervisor. If you are not in the group she likes, you might as well start looking for another job. To say that the clinical manager is a nasty, bitter, & rude would be putting it lightly. "
bad,The worst Job I've ever had.  Entitled and spoiled Sales team - like working for the Kardashians every day.  Morally bankrupt culture.
bad,"Poor management, limited possibilities, not recommended for professional employment. More of a starter for new graduates."
bad,"For a healthcare/managed care company, Magellan clearly has zero interest in treating employees well, inquiring about their wellbeing, or attempting to retain them. They offer EAP to members and employees though when an employee is struggling, do nothing to attempt to help them. The pay is the lowest in the industry and training is mediocre. Too many nuances to keep track of with subpar tools offered. HR is 100% unapproachable - you literally have to submit a ticket on the intranet to reach anyone, and 75% of the time they don't answer the question, telling you to consult the handbook instead, or only partially respond to the request. Unconscionable ethics."
bad,"This is a very disorganized place.  Things changed constantly, including  upper management either quitting or being fired. If you aren't in management, they don't speak to you or act like you exist.  The work load is enough for 3 people and they expect you to be able to keep up."
bad,This was the most stressful place to work. They switch your job title up on you without warning. Offer minimal help when you need it. Barely train you. They expect you to look up answers to your questions while on a call instead of assonait you with the answers. Then they get mad when your call handling time is too high.
bad,"The job was fairly easy and I was well trained. However, the management was pitiful, especially my immediate supervisor. She couldn't think for her self, she was a micromanager and was a slave of her manager. The turnover is so high it's like a revolving door: people come in and they go out!  NO job security at all. The management is new and they have no idea what they are doing. The overall culture is: if you have a question about something,  don't ask, I was not allowed to ask questions if something went wrong or about the system. If I just had to ask a question, I got so much attitude that I just gave up and winged it."
bad,UAS nurse stay away from this company. Required productivity is now 17 with goals to go to 20 per week.  4 UAS per day. Uploading is very time consuming. You the nurse have to order all services for members and write case review for every single member before manager can approve hours. Very poor leadership. STAY AWAY.
good,"Recommends"
bad,"Do NOT do it point blank. Sure it beats being unemployed but if you need a stable, fair, stressless environment this isn't the place for you."
bad,"Workplace culture is ""pass the buck"" mentality, lack of resources and expected to recreate the wheel at each turn. Leadership takes all the glory and acts as if the team does nothing."
bad,get ready to be micro managed! Get ready to be asked to do jobs you were not trained to do. But people get angry if you ask questions. Management is a mess.
bad,"This position is primarily responsible for recruitment accepting and rejecting coding recommendation according to provider information. "
bad,"This company offered literally no training, very unprofessional, everyday there something new that they expect you to know even though they never trained you on it. Poor communication from upper management. Honestly I could go on for ever this was a terrible work experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Magellan could be a great place to work but the pay and benefits are subpar and no one here has a clue how to run the place.  They  increased the pay to make it comparable to other places in the area (they're still one of the lowest) but didn't give existing employees a raise, so in some cases you have new employees earning more than existing employees.  You are pretty much left alone to do your job which can be a good thing but if you need assistance with an issue be prepared to try and figure it out yourself or receive different answers from just about everyone you ask.  Payroll is terrible and constantly making errors and you can NEVER speak to anyone in HR."
bad,"Company Only cares about making money so less staff and more work, constantly restructuring making it confusing to understand company vision. More concerned about avoiding lawsuits from employees (which there are lots of suits against this conpany) than getting rid of very poor performers."
bad,"get ready to be watched all the time!"
bad,The companies moral just went bottoms up as of this year. In the past two years they just decided to stop having customer service appreciation. They dont give raises and they have a high turnover. Not recommended in my eyes unless you are desperate.
bad,The job consisted of processing faxes from the doctors office such as prescriptions and Prior authorizations. To process these faxes in a timley fashion.
bad,"This company espically in Baton Rouge location it is horrible, the upper management lacks ability they hired unexperienced supposedly profeesionals to do nothing!!!. Too much favoritism no room for advancement. As an employee you are overworked they do not care about their employees. Upper management talks about employees like dogs!!!! they do not care about you. Not sure if this company will last please beware before you apply read other reviews to get an idea. They overturn rate is high people are quitting from left to right!!!!!!!   RUN  FAR"
bad,company lacks direction. changes course frequently. expects you to be on-call 24/7. Impossible to take time off without serious repercussions. Talks the talk about valuing employees - but doesn't walk the walk. Good for a first or interim job solution -but don't plan to make this company a long-term experience. Keep your resume ready and watch your back.
bad,"No supervisor so team members bossed each other around by pecking order, old and broken office furniture, moody and highly-gossiping employees, refrigerators not cleaned for a year and a half and probably still haven't been, no room for advancement and low hourly wages.  Typical in-office staff ranged from 4 to 10 employees."
bad,Started as an awesome employment opportunity but quickly changed once promoted to management. Upper management doesn't care about individual opinions.
bad,"The management team at Magellan does not care about their employees. Wasteful spending on yesterday's technology, poor product development, and a bi-polar management structure."
bad,"I couldn't be happier to be out of this job. Coworkers refer to the company as ""majailen"". Everything you do is monitored but not for quality. All that matters is quantity and profits. Members and their needs are irrelevant.  It's impossible to get good treatment for people with carefirst/Magellan insurance as very few providers accept their low rates. You will be frustrated by the constant demands of management that make no sense and change almost daily. You will get emails from management telling you to stop talking and laughing in the office. You will never feel appreciated by management and they publicly shame everyone. Turnover has been among the worst I've experienced, management continues to justify the high turnover as ""growing pains"" of a start up. Watching 30+ clinicians leave in less than a year is a problem but nobody at Magellan seems to care. They just continue to hire new clinicians through temp agencies. The worst part about this company is that they review their own employees mental health claims. Your coworkers, boss, etc could know exactly what type of treatment you've had and your diagnosis. Magellan could care less about this and likely continues this practice to intimidate their employees. I could go on and on about this company and my experience. It has truly been traumatizing. The money is good but it's not worth the poor treatment not to mention the many ethical dilemmas you will find yourself in."
bad,"MHPG - Magellan Healthcare Provider Group - awful place to work for.  The management is very unorganized, reactive and morale is low.  They are mainly focused on money and not the clinical services the program is supposed to offer its members.  They lack the resources needed to do the job appropriately.  No opportunity for growth and management does not value their employees."
bad,"The company is not very understanding or caring of its employees. "
good,"Recommends"
bad,"Worst work environment ever."
bad,Magellan really sucks do not employ any folks that you like. The entire company sucks and are very rude crule and totally sucks. If you are not in the click you will fail. If you happen to be liked you are lucky if not you will fail
bad,"I worked for this company for a little over 6 years. In that time, I witnessed so many vet employees quit left and right and couldn’t understand it until I was somewhat a vet myself. Worked from home for almost 5 years of that time. Once I went home there was no help or room for advancement. The management will take certain people under their wing to take the work load off themselves and THOSE are the people the people that actually get more pay and have help advancing into other positions. I was let go because of internet and phone issues with the new company I had to switch over to in another state. I filed unemployment only for this company to fight it and win. Over 6 years of employment just for them to kick me to the curb like that and on top of it take away the only source of income while I search for a job with two kids. They don’t care. Also, I started at $12.50 as a temp, was hired on at 6months making $13, each yeah only being given a raise of .30¢. I ended at $15.97 while others barely being hired on were already making $15 an hour. This company is a revolving door and they truly do not care for their employees or seeing anyone advance."
bad,"don't have a lot of minorities in upper management, don't have a lot of opportunities to grow. many departments are unorganized and some of your supervisors are not on location."
bad,"While my coworkers and immediate supervisor were awesome and really trying to address the many problems, and the location was very nice, overall I hated it and left much worse off than I started, due to their poor management of staffing and plan membership."
bad,"The trainers are awful and there is a high turnover. Lots of temp workers. I asked questions during training and was approached with a negative attitude as a result of that by management. They expect you to learn a lot of information in as little time as possible and then trainers throw you under the bus in front of your supervisor when you need help. The team leads are awful and do not help the call center employees at all. They are trained not to take any customer calls. Manager used intimidation tactics to get new employees to fear getting fired. Completely closed off management, do not take any feedback. Felt totally isolated and alone here at this company. I would not recommend this work environment to anyone."
bad,Highly stressful place to work with very difficult customers and questionable higher level leadership. Feels like you have to walk on eggshells in the office and certain people in management were unapproachable and distant. The work expectations were to work till you drop and the compensation was not high enough for the stress and long hours involved.
bad,"I worked for Magellan Health Services for 7 years. I was laid off with about 250 other employees. The severance contract was written so that most employees who were laid off were not eligible.  I should have been compensated more than $10,000 over a 3 month period. Don't trust Magellan to treat you fairly."
bad,"Worked as a Military and Family Life Counselor (MFLC ) for this company for 4 years.  At the time of their renegotiating and setting up for the new OSD contract they initially state my position was safe and I would be furlough and then fire me.  Everyone (management and support staff) stopped answering their phones and ignored emails.  Management's nonchalant lackluster approach to the OSD contract change is appalling and disgusting."
bad,"No place do grow. Dead wood weeding the place. No talent, no ambition managers running the company into the ground one day at a time."
bad,"Logging into phone and systems to make outbound phone calls"
bad,"The management in the claims department are horrible and they do racial profiling during hiring process. Many temps are told they will have an opportunity to advance permanent however the manger is a liar she informs regular employees the temps are just to help and won’t be hired on full time. Also Lots of favoritism meaning, you have to ride management coat tells just to stay under the radar to keep your job. If you’re into gossiping this would be a great job for you but if you stay to yourself and want to focus on getting the job done this really isn’t the place for you. HR doesn’t help resolve issues you may have with your manager and neither does higher management."
bad,"Self-centered, chauvinist, foul-mouthed, physically abusive supervisor.  Office hours set were ignored by supervisor, then expected employee to stay all hours of the night.  worked until 1am at times."
bad,"Local management were some of the worst people I have ever encountered or worked with.  Have never had the displeasure to work with.  If I encountered them when applying for a position somewhere, I would immediately withdraw my application."
bad,"High expectations of employees and a very micro-management company."
bad,Just a dead in job no room for growth or advancement. If you are the pay raise is awful. The benefits are bad an no one talks they sit in a cube all day with ear buds in and there is no team moral or socializiation. It’s like working in a funeral parlor no one talks
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Terrible management, favoritism, high school environment. This job made me want out of the pharmacy merry go round. No open door policy so you can’t talk to anyone."
good,"Recommends"
bad,"The office i worked for is in Doral, Fl. The supervisor are lazy they don't like to assist the reps. They make you feel like you work in a hostel environment. They fire more than they hire. The call volume is out of control and they will not hire more reps."
bad,"Poor training of staff, impulsive when it comes to reorganization of department structure, supervisors are not very knowlegeable regarding nuances. Supervisors need to be more supportive of staff. CEO needs to halt the Yearly layoffs."
bad,hours are great meaning the earliest you can come in after training is 5:30 or you have up to 10 am to come in and not a minute pass or your consider late.
bad,The management at Magellan is not fair at rating their employees. Turn over of employees is very high. Work environment is cold and sometimes childish. Too much like high school.
bad,"Great for a starter job, but not long term. CEO just fired, firing managers, and employees all the time... Unorganized training classes, & bad managers. Hope they fix it before the company goes under again!"
bad,"Abel Staffing is the subcontractor for PACE PA state RX programs which Magellan Rx holds. Abel does what they can but they are in a very tough spot with doing as their customer ""Magellan"" asks of them and trying to help the workers at the same time. Barb with Abel is very good to us given the tough role she has as our ""HR/Account contact"". I have witnessed inappropriate and unprofessional behavior toward coworkers from the Supervisor and leads. Consistently threatening ""room 325"",where they fire you, or Bully you to show their lack of dignity and respect. Benefits, PTO, holiday pay after 6 months. 3 months with Abel temp staffing. 3 months with Abel perm side. "
bad,"I would not recommend coming here."
bad,Training was long and offered good basic skills but once released to the floor you are given and unattainable quota to meet every month and no help with questions.  Management does not have time to be bothered with you and is very condesending.
bad,Love working with people in need of help but at Magellan when you needed help with something you had to go through loop holes to get it. The workplace morale was low due to management inexperience and desire to help.
bad,"No room for advancement for hard workers, they don't give raise. High turn over with employees and management. Workers with no education and experience move to management. Too much favoritism."
bad,Stupid Call Center with ridiculous metric's. Great job if you want to be a monkey trapped in a cage. Can't have a personality and everything is monitored. NOT FUN !! Pass this place up. Also very high turn over rates for ALL positions.
bad,When I first started it was okay but after working there for a while I noticed management would favor certain people. There was absolutely no work-life balance. You got an occurrence for everything you did. The pay was low as well.
bad,"In the technology area of MagellanRx, Scottsdale, AZ there was no work/life balance.  Projects and deliverables were often last minute, urgent, and competing for resources.  Team was understaffed. One horrible manager (VP of Client Services) treated staff horribly, sometimes making life miserable for members of other teams, as well as her own.  Technology management allowed her to constantly do this to the developers."
bad,"This is a startup. The executive team is rarely in the office and leadership changes frequently."
bad,"Cons: 700,000,000,000 million rules and quotas. This place doesn't even allow employes to go to the bathroom if calls are waiting. They say they care about their ""members"" mental health, yeah right. No matter if someone is on the ledge about to commit suicide or just can't remember the name of their Therapist on Main St, all calls must be completed in 8 minutes or less. Don't forget to mention the callers name twice, even if you can't pronounce it. No job security, plus the company is quick to deny or mess up your unemployment-trust me you will end up on employment. Trainer is a complete narcissist who can do anything and keep his job."
bad,"I worked for Magellan 7 years managing the State Wide Child Welfare Contract with the Agency for Health Care Administration.  I have worked 16 years and devoted my life the well being of the clientele we serve . However, you have to find a balance between managed care bottom lines and servicing our enrollees.  At Magellan I did not find that balance."
bad,"I worked as an MFLC - there have been a lot of changes recently which severely limit the flexibility and pay I thought I would get - when I was hired, I was told I was getting a particular salary - It was not pointed out that holidays are unpaid leave, school holidays, teacher work days, etc were also unpaid (I worked in the school system) - by the time it was all said and done, there was 5 weeks per year of unpaid leave and that was IF you were able to get a summer assignment.  Magellan has gone through a lot of changes and has become overly focused on quantity vs quality of services - as long as you are doing a lot of ""contacts"" they don't care if they are quality - its all about the numbers.  They provide you with little or no support - we were thrown into environments without reliable office space or even a clear sense of what we were supposed to be doing - often the full time staff at the children's centers, schools, etc looked at us as intruders - we were not permitted ANY time off during our contracts, so if you signed on for a 9 month assignment, you were not supposed to take any time off during that nine month period, even though we accrued 2 hr of leave per pay period (2 weeks), which is ridiculous.  If you take an assignment in country, there is no longer per diem or rental car or housing - so unless you live in the area, you will lose money taking an assignment.  Really too bad because it used to be a fun job... not any more!!"
good,"Recommends"
bad,Corporate culture and organizational changes in the last 5-7 years have negatively impacted the company and the morale of employees.  Lack of focus on existing customers has impacted business and retention has become a serious concern.
bad,"The paid time off and work at home opportunities offered by Magellan Health Care are fine bonuses.  Unfortunately, many departments are understaffed, so the work-life balance is not commendable.  Promotion potential is not high.  More employees make lateral moves to other departments, rather than receive promotions."
bad,"chronic poor decision-making by leaders.  lack of trust and respect for staff.  good, strong co-workers, but overall culture has continued to degrade."
bad,"its a good job for someone who just wants to stay in the same position, its a middle type of company. not to big not to small never grows. no real high standards."
bad,"I was at Magellan for over 5 years and it was very stressful. They so not take work/life balance into consideration at all.  They only care that the business needs of the company are being met, which is somewhat understandable, but I feel they should also work harder to build morale amongst their employees to ensure they are happy. that is a more productive way to ensure the business is ran the way they want it to. They also are constantly restructuring management like a chess game. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"This was a salaried position and I always worked at least 12 hours per day with a constant emphasis placed on more productivity by upper management.  While my immediate manager was understanding of the limitations and expectations, upper management did not seem to care about these issues."
bad,"Before Magellan got into the govdrnment contracts business at differing military bases, clinicians were able to travel, providing living accomodations to avoid moving permanent residence. We used to make $50 an hour for 7 days a week, on call and full time. When Magellan came in, the pay dropped in half. They ruined the culture of veteran clinicians who provided services. "
bad,New CIO has redefined the web development of the using a form of Agile that is not conducive for the company. He has brought on his lackies from his past. Over all he pushing for outsourcing.
bad,"When you start to see all of your higher level managers drop with no notice, you should be worried. Little support at this position. They will tell you helping is your number one job, but in truth they really want you to answer as many calls in as little time possible, and, with any luck, you MAY just help the person on the other line. Good money, but not worth the stress or low morale."
bad,"If you're ready to have a leisure job without a lot of clients, you already have a support system in the area and don't need friends... you're retired- this may be the job for you. If you aren't in one of those categories I'd really caution the job. The selling point is the low workload and the salary but the salary is truly the only benefit you get. They fail to mention during the interview many on base hate the program and that future potential employers who know the program may automatically view you as lazy and/or unethical. You're on call from 7am-7pm or 8am-8pm and honestly it's whatever the base determines they need. I've had days where I've been surprised to learn I need to come in at 10-11pm at night, days where I need to work starting at 7am and then  leave for a few hours and come back... it makes it really hard to have a personal life. Then you add in the fact that you sign something stating you won't have dual relationships with anyone affiliated with the base- so no service member friends, no spouses, no colleagues... it makes it really lonely and isolating. If you work with other MFLC then you may gain a friend of two but a lot of them jump from place to place and really aren't interested in getting to know you. They're solely there for the money."
bad,"Skills not utilized in the appropriate areas needed and typically a given requirement of an executive assistant."
bad,"I have worked as a military contractor for over 4 years, traveling to different locations, mostly working at Ft Campbell. It is a great job for newly licensed counselors but the travel will ""get to you"" if you choose to be an independent contractor. Also, there are so many policies and procedures that keep you from doing your job (which is helping military families) Don't step outside the box! It's the kind of job where you are safer ""doing nothing than something."""
bad,"Basically this is a stressful environment with no support from supervisors or upper management.  Employees are NEVER given an opportunity to provide any feedback.  Management is disconnected from staff.  No supervision or training, unrealistic expectations of employees.  Many employees are looking for other employment. Some employees just quit without finding other employment.  The benefits are great."
bad,"The company has downsizing for several years, low moral and lack of excitement from employees, no career advancement and health benefits are horrible."
bad,Rush through training and then place you out there to take calls when you don't exactly have all the information needed.  Some people are helpful but most are not because they may be irritated themselves on whatever they are experiencing.
bad,Really sad how upper management mismanaged this company.  The fix is easy. Get rid of the current director of claims. She's a bully and dislikes those who have opinions. The worst part about is that I was warned about.het when I started so this was a problem many years prior to my employment t so it's not like no one knew about her history.
good,"Recommends"
bad,you're not appreciated for the work you do. its all about numbers and meeting a quota. management is not supportive at all and there is clear favoritism.
bad,The company is disjointed.  Senior leadership have several ideas that do not come together in a manner that is solidified.  It is very little opportunity for advancement
bad,"Take the time to develop a positive engaging and dynamic culture where people can go to work because they want to not because the have to ."
bad,"a typical day would be the call volume,i learned to have more patience , hardest part would have to be seeing how fast people come and go. The most enjoying part would be leaving after a long hard work day"
bad,"Different teams worked in silo for different computer systems. There was little effort made to integrate the teams, breeding a culture of separation. There was always tension in the office"
bad,Collecting on past due balances and helping customers resolve their delinquent accounts... Multi task in a fast pace environment.
bad,A typical day at work was to process and resolve claim edits on suspended claims.  I also provided support to my team members and processed claims with a high level of quality in accordance with the claim payment policies.  I learned to improve my productivity.  Management was available and working with my co-workers created a great support system. The hardest part of the job was high production rate with inconsistent resources.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working side by side with my-coworkers.
bad,The employees do all the work. Management is not involved in any type of career development plan for employees. Management for customer service call center are unprofessional. Mangement sit around and talk about their employees in the negetive. The management team tell lies. Management team only promote people they like on a personal basis not on their performance. 
bad,"A typical day is spent answering phones from doctor's offices, hospitals, and members requesting information on radiology authorizations. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get up when you want too. You have to spend your whole shift sitting in the chair and taking calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to leave!"
bad,"Poor management, they never encourage employees to voice their concerns. the organization had a revolving door policy, constantly losing employees due to management."
bad,"Work is very easy, office life is extremely cliquish and hard to get along in. Management is often absent, and when help is required it is extremely hard to find."
bad,"i worked for this company for two years. they'll train you but not thoroughly, sometimes the leaders who trained you didn't now half of what they were teaching. constant open communication was a plus when we had changes in our role which was very often. "
bad,"Too much work, insane expectations, and very, very little pay for the stress and aggravation. And that's all due to upper management and administration...not the clients."
bad,This call center had a high turnover and you always feel like you are being miro managed. There no room for advancement. PTO was good you get 4 weeks of PTO a year.
bad,I spent most of my day typing request for update on patients that were in treatment.  I workd a lot on the skills for work.  The management was sub par at best. Could not answer basic questions.  I like most of my team and still talk to them almost weekly.  The job was not hard but busy.
bad,"it is a work at home job, so it beats having to fight traffic, some managers expect unrealistic numbers, alot of micro-management happens at this place and management have a tendency to listen to staff ideals of how to increase numbers"
good,"Recommends"
bad,"Magellan was know for their flexibility, now it known for Micro managing.  The environment is like a sweat shop, all work and no activity.   They are not rewarding of your long hours and hard work.  The salary is terrible, you need a part-time job to go along with your full time job."
bad,First off where do I begin at this place. You can have plus years of Customer Service or Call Center experience and still get paid peanuts coming in. I worked also with a lot of Customer Care Specialist. What they don't tell you is that Customer Care Specialist take all Supervisor calls. I have never worked anywhere that right off the Team Leader does not take Supervisory calls. No room for advancement. They overlook you when you want to learn new things and there is favoritism. Some team leaders did nothing but socialized and barely knew there jobs. My manager was very knowledgeable and did her job but at times I felt she also overlooked things.  Complaints against Supervisors are overlooked. On the floor it is totally different from training. Training leaves out some aspects that you don't learn until your on the floor.  No training on new accounts. You just read a memo and familiarize yourself with the new company information. I could go on and on. All I'm saying is beware If you work for this department that has these positions at this company. You may do a 360 right out the door to another job and that's the truth!
bad,I was under utilized as far as my potential. Upper management acted like they owned the company. There was some tones racial discrimination. A stepping-stone place to work.
bad,"Decent pay, low morale, understaffed, management is a bit hostile, benefits are good, you can work at home if you like. Plenty of autonomy, little upward mobility."
bad,"Typical day is mostly speaking to recipients of Medicaid Benefits who are seeking counseling and or medication and also liaising with local hospitals taking details of patients who are being admitted for care.. "
bad,"I liked my job, human resources is absolutely the worst. When asking question employees are directed to the computer, there are no answers, even supervisors don't know the answers to questions."
bad,"A typical day at work is answering the phone for 8 hours, with two 15 minute breaks and 30 mins. for lunch. "
bad,"Magellan is a behavioral health company that is managing the Medicaid for the State of Louisiana. A typical day at work consists of me taking incoming mental and behavioral health calls and providing customer service. I am constantly learning about behavioral and mental health. magellana of Louisiana started here in Baton Rouge on February 1, 2012 and the management team (who started the same day) is learning everyday just as we are. I enjoy my co-workers. The hardest paret of the day is listening to some of the stories that health proffessionals tell me about the problems some members are having. The most enjoyable part of the job is talkin gwith different people who call into us for help."
bad,"Decent company for early in your career.  Fast-paced every day but with an upbeat, team culture.  Management is interested in making it a great place to work."
bad,Trying to work with too few staff members. Learn on the go and teach yourself.  Reliability is a must.  Must be willing to go with the flow.  Learn something new every day.
bad,Working at Magellan had the benefit of providing insight to how medical claims are processed and approved based on medical necessity. Management however was very poor and the micromanagement of every minute could be pretty stressful.
bad,"The company has expectations that are not in the best interest of the employees health overall. Long term complications develop from lack of hourly break and stretch when you are continuously typing or even every two hours. It is hard on the spine, hands, fingers, wrists."
bad,"Training seemed thorough, but when out of training, assistance was minimal.  Only allowed to ask your lead or supervisor for assistance and chastised by asking other team members if one of those two were not available.  Frowning seems to be part of management training.  The culture is expected to not take breaks(lunch or bathroom) and simply eat at desk.  Their mission for members involving emotional and physical wellbeing is totally opposite of what the mission is for employees.  Flexibility with work schedule is limited.  They will do surveys with staff input of what staff would change, what they like about their job, what they dislike about their job, and then never use the information. Turnover is very high partially due to the lack of concern for employee morale. Within a six month time period, 5 people in my department left for better jobs and/or more flexibility, while three people were going to leave and they were offered work from home positions.  Good experience to learn about this side of the business."
bad,This job is all about money and dont really care to much for their employees. Over worked and under paid. The first year working there was amazing and then new management came in and changed everything.
bad,"I worked for Magellan for about 17 years and had a variety of positions over the years-from case manager for inpatient and outpatient facilities to Intensive care manager and health coaching towards the end of my tenure with Magellan. I did enjoy interacting with clients but did not like the politics with some parts of Magellan."
bad,..... Very good to balance home life and work. Easy work. Relaxed days.. flexible schedule. Pretty laid back. Decent food.
bad,Staff are treated poorly by senior leaders and directors. When staff complain they are forced out through poor treatment until they give up and move on. There is no one to go to with concerns without retaliation.
good,"Supervisor's give miss information, and treat contingent works very bad. Information is not given to everyone in a timely matter to make adjustments for business needs"
good,"Recommends"
good,"The training that you get is cookie cutter, by that I mean that they try to train you on something when they don't even really know what they're doing themselves especially when they take on new assignments. There is a lot of people talking behind other people's backs and acting like you're in high school and necessary drama."
good,Overall there were too many management that changed so the direction was lost in changes of management. Without a leader with a vision the ship doesn't get to the right destination.
good,The company is overall good. Some managers are horrible and get ride of the best employees they have. They change things to make the employee look like they are wrong. Just be very careful especially if you go to HR with an issue the go straight to your manager and you are in the wrong. Hr does nothing for you.
good,"I worked for Magellan almost 5 yrs. I exceled at my position of Care Coordinator. "
good,Hard to work here because clients are behavioral health and can become very rude and irate. Providers aren't knowledgable about benefits for members and were often mean
good,I worked 50 hour work weeks and then worked weekend conferences to promote our product. I truly believed in the programs that I was promoting I did not have the support from Magellan as a for profit company.
good,At the beginning it was nice but I slowly has gone down hill. Management has not worked on the phones in years and do not realize that things have changed.  My supervisor knows very little about how to do the job.
good,Worked for 3.5 yrs and at the same position. Did receive recognition from superior and incentives $$ however no major advances just more work. Company restructures all the time and has been laying off workers. Very few leadership available and you are expected to work independently by self teaching yourself through documentation online. They try to organize but still the nature of business is chaotic. Overall good place to start if your beginning of career or looking to do something that is stagnant. No real motivation to return to work each day. You will definitely learn a lot about mental health though.
good,Great work environment at Shoemaker High School in Killeen.  Constantly in contact with youth with problems of various kinds. Freedom on the job was fantastic.
good,"Often times the management has expectations that are out of reach. Just recently took on a new client, and there were too many technical difficulties that should have been tested and solved before setting expectations of performance."
good,"Management is not up to the  standards of a healthcare insurance. A day at work is like any other day nothing new is being learned. There is no room for grow. Care workers are treated as slaves, instead of an office it feels like a factory.  There is favoritism at every corner."
good,"I enjoy my work, I enjoy my co-workers. I learn so much in regards to Credentialing, before working here I had not experience in this field, and now I feel I'm an expert."
good,"Magellan is a decent place to work.The workload is more than enough to keep busy.The benefits are pretty good, and overall the people are great to work with."
good,"Okay, if you like being stuck at your desk all day and on the phone all day. Very picky work flow. My supervisor is awesome but doesn't seem to be able to do what he would like. Training is awful and has nothing to do with the position!!"
good,Great company - awful AM leadership.  High rate of turnover.  Inconsistent messaging and role requirements.
good,"Good entry-level company with an above average benefit package. However, currently an unstable work environment, challenges related to management, and pay (below standard of competitors). Management often appeared out of touch with specific account policy/procedures. A family-like atmosphere with co-workers was primarily the most enjoyable part of the job. Learned details related to the mental health insurance process."
good,Great Place to work if you want to start in the medical field . Don't expect any significant raises unless you are promoted. There is upward mobility if you work hard for it and have excellent attendance.Try to avoid working with certain managers if you want longevity. Try to avoid staying in the same position for more than a couple of years.
good,MHS is a company that will allow a great start in many different areas in health insurance.
good,"Reps may begin in their stations and work through a process that maximizes their chances of being successful on each interaction, escalating urgent issues."
good,"Recommends"
good,I enjoyed working there but pay was not competitive for long term people. I liked my supervisors but the upper management team was not very friendly or compassionate people.
good,"Overall work enviornment was hard to depict as supervisor is virtual, and offsite.  Corporation is virtual and offsight.  PTO is limited to 7 days per year.  Good immediate supervisor"
good,I do not wish to discuss my experiences with Magellan as I really do not have much to say about my time with them. I can say that it has been interesting but not satisfying.
good,"No communication with management and team members. Daily team meetings held, which is to many in my opinion. There is a lot of micro management. This has been the hardest place to work. Manager is very cut throat and not enjoyable. The manager will never thank you for your hard work and effort."
good,Working with the military family and their support staff has been amazing. My assignments have been stress free as far as my job duties. Meeting new people is very rewarding. The least likable part is the money.
good,Worked for Magellan for 5 years as a military family life counselor and never felt like a real employee. There was no work - life balance. Never got a raise in 5 years in fact they kept taking things from you. You got 8 PTO days a year but you weren’t allowed to use them except for holidays because you didn’t get holiday pay. Never again
good,The job is close to home and building is clean except for the restrooms which are utterly disgusting. Management is just okay they're really not into promoting people they want you to stay at the level in which you entered. They expect you to do six jobs in one and expect you to stay under a certain time limit which is very impossible when their system is totally outdated they are truly do for a serious upgrade to their system.
good,"Working at Magellan, I learned some detailed information about medicare part D claim benefits, and how they apply at the pharmacy and the part d provider."
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time at this company.  I left only because I moved out of state.  Compensation was poor, however. Co-workers and management were very kind."
good,"When you first start the training is about 3 days, More than likely you wont be trained on the actual tasks you'll be working on day to day. The management team is very unorganized. The environment in a whole is unproductive and there is no job security. If the call volume goes down (Usually after open enrollment) you could be out of work for weeks."
good,"The company, Magellan, overall is a great company and it is also great at compensating employees. It offers health benefits, paid time off.  There are some State holidays that this company does not recognize and you will be mandated to report to work.  On the downside, this particular location does not complement the company as a whole. The work environment is biased and based off of favoritism as opposed to work ethic.  Hard work and honesty come second to friendships and deceptive work behavior and it becomes apparent that one can get ahead by shamming and creating office relationships as opposed to honestly getting the job done.  So if you are a hard worker who values integrity you will soon find this environment hard to deal with.  It is a call center so it is expected that you will be consumed with calls your entire workday, which is perfectly fine, but when the work is unevenly distributed between the call center reps, you will find yourself completely drained by the end of your shift and definitely by the end of the week.  The management   is often times difficult to deal with. Asking a job related question (trust me, you will have many of these) is often met by attitude and sometimes rude behavior. You may not get a valid answer from them and you will leave feeling like an annoying child as opposed to a Pharmacy Technician who is PTCB certified.  There seems to always be a ""gray"" area between most answers that they provide, leaving you confused and left to decipher it on your own. The Supervisor is biased and if you are not the individual to ""brown nose"" then you will"
good,"Making sure the patients that are scheduled prior to or the day of service has authorization for radiology studies ordered by their healthcare provider. Reaching out to the physicians office obtaining as musch information as possible if there's not enough available in the patients chart. Accessing online as well as over the phone approvals for the radiology services, which can take anywhere between 10 minutes up until 1 hour. Faxing several documents to the health insurance companies to receive authorization. I learned a great amount of patients because you may have to hold for long periods of time, listening with your undevited attention, accuracy, and how to muti task. Management was less attentative to the workers, less inneractive, and less concerned with complaints. Co-workers were very helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job at times would be to get through to the insurance companies or trying to get the information needed to get approval on the radiology studies. When you meet your goal for the day by obtaining the authorizations for the patients that are really enduring pain, which makes them happy and kind of eases the pain since they will be getting treated."
good,Typical work day is is typing and taking calls all day. day in and day out.
good,Magellan is a great company to work for to get a good understanding about Mental Health and the practices of it.
good,Management was unfair. Promoted and hired their friends. Company lost big account so I decided to leave company. Unsure of stability of company. Great hours and people though.
good,"Magellan was a nice place to work, but they have a huge lay-off rate. No job security or appreciation/loyalty to the employees. Too many chiefs and never enough Indians. Supervisors were great, but ppr management doesn't seem to have a clue of what really goes on on the front lines and what exactly is involved in each position where the actual work is being done."
good,"This is like all organizations--complex and ever changing.  Healthcare is a complex field with a great deal of regulatory pressures.  Magellan is not for wimps--you need to know who you are and what your boundaries will be when you join.    "
good,"It’s a job, the pay is decent n hours are ok! Management doesn’t really communicate with you a lot just via email unless it’s time for your annual review. The people are ok not clicks or drama like other call centers!!!"
good,"Magellan is very fast pace, it can be extremely stressful. You definitely learn patience and empathy. The hardest part of my job is trying to make sure a caller is at ease by the end of the call"
good,"Recommends"
good,"Everything was enjoyable, fun training and atmosphere, then the ""weeding out"" started, older employees were being nit-picked to death until they quit."
good,Its a great job if you like that sort of work.  Being tied to the phone 8 hours a day is very stressful and not what I'm looking for.  I feel they need to train better as well.  You are given the basics and that's all good but there are a lot of other things you learn on your own that would be very helpful if you knew right off the bat.
good,I have worked at the company for over 10 years and have grown from a processor to in management.  I have been allowed to participate in several implementations/configurations of benefits/project management/Director mentorship program/travel/several work groups/and on the board of appeals.  All of these things were outside of my normal duties.  Magellan gave me this extra experiences to help me round out my skill set.
good,Great place to work unless your work with SWallace she's an sub par human being with poor management style that only was given the job by default because the previous director was being let go and only interviewed 2 people 1 of which was offered the job but not offered enough money so he declined and they needed a manager so C bag got the job now it's a black hole.
good,"I only worked as a Military & Family Life Counselor (MFLC)....wouldn't recommend it. Doesn't pay enough for the required amount of work, supervisors hound you for ""numbers"". Can't give it 2.5 stars, so I rounded up to 3."
good,"Magellan was a different experience from normal customer service. I have acquired a lot of knowledge from calculating and adjuicating claims, reviewing appeals both administrative and clinical, and having a better understanding of the healthcare industry."
good,"The company is currently going through a buy out and many cuts have been occurring. I did not feel that I had job security. Higher tier management is never on the same page and there are no advancements in the technology the company uses; therefore, we were stuck with programs that were no longer supported. There was also very little upward mobility and the environment was composed of cliques. With that being said, my immediate manager and supervisor were great and did their best to keep morale high. The schedule was relatively flexible so I could leave early for doctors appointments and such; the work life balance was a positive thing. The job itself was extremely independent. Most of the day you were at your desk working on solo jobs and would have to reach out for more work once these were completed. This is neither good nor bad. Each person will have a different take on this type of position but, for myself, it was a nice change of pace."
good,"This company is very organized in terms of operations, and  gives you a lot of good work experience if you want to further your career in the heath insurance field. Unfortunately management is very clickish and it’s very sad as this company could be a great place to work. Work life balance is ok. You do get PTO if the time is available to take. Also the pay is not great in comparison to other  companies in the same industry, but it’s not terrible."
good,"There are many jobs,different cultures w/in Magellan.With my particular position I have been disappointed in lack of team focus,very isolating.But not a bad job, good potential and positive supervisors."
good,Working as a Military Family Life Counselor was one of the most rewarding jobs of my life BUT- so many of the people that I worked with were so unprofessional and unethical... it finally cost the company a huge part of their contract. They would not respond to employee concerns.
good,"Once you learn the duties of the job and are comfortable with the system and relaying the proper information, the job is actually very easy.  It also depends on what team you are assigned to due to each supervisor being completely different and handling their team in a different manner. When I stated I did not have a manager on our team due to the previous manager being promoted to over see all four teams which worked within the same job responsibilities.  Im not sure if it is why my experience was what it was or if it was like this on all four teams but with my team, they had a few associates who were with the company in charge of the team and the way they handled helping us when we were placed on the phones for the first time was great on the first day but after that day they would not help out with our questions.  They would tell us to use our resources to answer our questions.  However, without knowing where to look in our resources for our answers, we were caught like a deer in head lights and the caller which we were working with would get irate due to the time on hold they would be placed on while we searched for the information.  The Team I was on was very helpful however, they would instant message you answers if asked or personally walk to your desk to help out,  Human resource is very hard to contact,  Everything is handled on a Vern system which makes it impossible to personally speak to a live person."
good,"liked the people i worked with, has a cafeteria on site, benefits were good, was able to work from home which is nice, workplace culture was bad, management played favorites"
good,"took 80 plus in bound calls. Processed 50 emails daily, Hardest part of the job is people, management is ok, work place culture is ok at times but can be negative."
good,"This job was hard to learn because of little supervision or teaching the computer system."
good,"My typical day as an MFLC is to rotate between the Child Development Center and Youth Center on the military bases I am assigned.  I rotate between all the classes at the CDC and provide non-medical counseling to the identified children in need either by the  Director, Trainer, or the Teachers.  I would work with the parents when appropriate.  Issues I dealt with would include but not limited to school adjustment, deployment and separation, sibling and parent-child communication, behavioral concerns, fear, grief and loss. I would use modeling in the classroom to help the teachers see how to defuse a situation."
good,"Recommends"
good,The direct supervisors were great but too many glitches in their system.  They screwed up my pay multiple times and would always say we'll fix it next pay period.  You get minimal support from the headquarters. It was great working with the military families though.
good,"•	Provide customers with excellent customer services"
good,"The area I work in has a lot of demands and you are expected to work a lot of hours to meet them, and there never seems to be a break from the load.  The pace is very fast and demanding.  "
good,"	Coordinated/managed proposal formatting and production of bid projects"
good,"Magellan Healthcare has changed significantly in past 3-5 years.   Rapid growth has challenged issues with platforms and technology."
good,"culture has shifted but new leadership is giving hope for improvement.  Its not a bad place to work, but don't expect to feel supported.  Like any company there are good managers and bad ones."
good,"I worked for Magellan for several years. I enjoyed working here, but near the end of my tenure things became strained."
good,"although they give you a lot of PTO, there is not much room for advancement and it is a job where productivity is a key. Not to comfortable with that."
good,"The job was fast pace.  We mostly worked with the homeless and at times, things got out of order. You never knew what may come thru the doors.  We had Doctors there to take care of the patients."
good,I enjoyed my time at Magellan until a few years ago.  Senior leadership is too top heavy.  Not sure which direction the company is going. Communication is not what it once was.  They've gone back to being in silos.  Each department doesn't know what the other is doing.
good,"Lack of focus on mission in health care."
good,"Provides ongoing, community-based support for an assigned caseload of health plan enrollees to improve access to care and care coordination. Establishes a relationship with the enrollee, the care coordination team, and providers. Conducts new enrollee outreach and orientation, arranges appointments and transportation as needed. Assists the enrollee in learning to navigate the health care delivery system, community resources, transportation, and effectively use health plan benefits."
good,Overall good company but with a HR department that seemed to emphasis more friendship promotions than merit based. Many over qualified people stuck in lower positions while less qualified were promoted.
good,I loved working for Magellan until the department management changed. I felt like I wasn't being appreciated for the work that I was doing or had done. And the new management of my department was horrible.
good,Workflow is usually the same daily. Not too much excitement. Then plan is still new & working out the kinks. Unfortunately it's the CSRs/Techs that get the most abuse from it. A good place to start out  but I wouldn't recommend long term work here as a call center agent. Promotion seems based on favoritism.
good,"When on phones in beginning, high stress do to call volume and learning to type and talk at same time.  High expectations on number of calls taken.  Worked all shifts.  When after-hours supervisor, it had it stresses, because of the 24-7/365 day coverage by phone.  No one else to take phone for over 5 1/2 years.  Loved the staff, especially after-hours.  Many were working a 2nd shift to provide coverage for the phones.  Had 2 great day-time supervisors.  Director was, let's say interesting.  Psychiatrist at the time, was lazy and had others do his work, while he was putting in his office.  Big bucks, not much work kind of a guy.  High expectations for work, with little recognition.  Management was biggest challenge, as they didn't seem to really understand their staff and their needs.  Just had lot's of high expectations.  Most weren't very friendly, rather just distant most of time.  Much of that was because of expectations on them as well.  Most enjoyable part of job was the other therapists and customer service reps.  Some of the best I have ever worked with.  Let, because of my health and well being."
good,"Magellan Health is a progressive company where anyone can succeed if prepared to work diligently.  Depending on the department you work for, a typical work day consists of extreme work which can be overwhelming at times."
good,Magellan is an exciting innovative company and I have enjoyed working there for the past 10 years. Magellan fosters a great atmosphere to enables its employees to feel competent and confident in the various roles for superior job performance.
good,"Great people, but too much turnover.  High turnover for the VP of certain departments which results in reorganizations of that department, which results in layoffs every 2 to 3 years."
good,"Recommends"
good,Dynamic fast paced office focusing on the the state medicaid membership and how to better assist those members with their mental health and substance abuse needs.
good,It was a great experience for me. I learned a great deal about team dynamics & corporate culture. The work days were often chaotic and   stressful.The pay was good and the benefits were excellent.
good,"Highly-matrixed work groups and processes which is typical in a large organization. Typical level of paperwork, procedures and high level of compliance for healthcare industry."
good,"Decent company to work for, pay depending on department good also god benefits. Down side tend to lay off a lot."
good,This was a nice and relaxing job environment. I was looking for something more fast-pace and challenging so it was not a good fit for me.
good,Busy
good,"This company has grown from a series of mergers and acquisitions, all with different processes and client profiles who are used to doing things 'their way'.  This organization has adopted a concierge approach to meeting needs which delights the client but does put strain on the employees who have to meet those needs using various methods instead of being able to standardize.  The company is moving towards the future by developing flexible systems that allow for the varying needs without extra efforts.  It is an exciting time to be part of that effort even if all the systems to support these needs are not all in place yet."
good,Company was good and helpful and the training was really good to prepare you for the position. The position has good benefits and the workplance culture was good
good,"Magellan's teams are ALWAYS being restructured and positions eliminated. Unless you are high up in the management, you will be on your toes about job security."
good,it wasn't  a bad place to work just management. i liked the diverse atmosphere. The job setting was a little relaxed but could be demanding at times. Some people was friendly
good,I was overqualified for the position and spent much of my time doing “make-work tasks. The salary is adequate for a teacher’s aide which is how I was used. Kids were great   I was bored and left after three months after three
good,"fast pace job very straight foward on time , on a very close out on the emloyees, very fair and open with the different cultures, very good with the hoildays,"
good,"Provided an opportunity to use my analytical and SQL skills to understand claims data in a healthcare environment. "
good,i need a job and magellan hired me. I started in claims processing department and promoted to the business analyst role where i learned alot of stuff.
good,"The company grew through acquisition.  Therefore the company was a bunch of companies put together with which felt like duct tape.  Many duplicate systems with lots of disparate data to go along with it.  On the plus side, good potential in its product offerings if operations could get things together.  Great people for sure."
good,"Magellan has good benefits, but when the new contract came up in August 2018, all of us MFLCs got a cut in pay, which was AFTER we were promised a pay raise with the new contract. I went from $33 an hour to $29 an hour. We are micromanaged for almost every hour of our work day, even though all of us are professional counselors and have at least a Master's degree in social work or counseling."
good,"Recommends"
good,I initially started as a temporary employee and became full-time within 6 months employment was offered full-time during the 6 months once I started I familiarized myself with the company before becoming full-time it has since been 4 years total with the company and after 1 year of employment I became a work at home employee.
good,Administer walk around counseling services to military members and their families.  Very rewarding job working with our military.  I learned what a wonderful resource this is for our military members and their families to assist them into transition into their military life.
good,"It has been too long since I worked there to judge the current situation for other workers. At the time, I found that the goal was not to take care of the members but to make money for the company."
good,"Magellan has strong vision and mission statements; however, in some cases, there too much work for the number of employees. All employees are not held accountable."
good,Management is poor and job is chaotic. Staff is micromanaged and held accountable for things they have no control over. Very difficult to attend trainings or other meetings due to call volume.
good,"Researched other client competition for sales team using Lexus Nexus"
good,this is ridiculous to have to do this just find a job posting on here. I don't want to give any information relating to this position. why are you making me do this. are you aware that when people et severance pay they are not permitted to do these kinds of things
good,"The section I supported was very professional and not laid back at all.  I was responsible for the team morale while being pregnant, so this was a challenge."
good,The job culture at Magellan was professional. Customer service and provider relations were a key element to ensuring financial and professional success.
good,they need to integrate care in more of their contracts.  there is a disconnect at times between corporate and the market but overall Magellan is a good place to work
good,"The atmosphere is great due to the fun and generous coworkers. Everyone is pretty much all team players and won't leave you hanging to dry. Supervisors are there if you need them, either by chat, IM or simply walling to their cubicle."
good,"This company is great for beginners and they provide training as well, the company is great, management is not so great, pay is well, enjoy day working here."
good,"As a Customer Care Associate there is a lot of pressure to meet unrealistic goals. You are constantly on the phone while multi tasking, such as attaching faxes to cases that didn't attach automatically. To do this job be sure you are ready for a fast paced environment. Unfortunately management changes to often to give a review of said management since every manager has a different managerial style."
good,It's a good place for entry level work. Very little room for advancement. Management has lead to issues with a high turnover rate. Co-workers are very helpful.
good,"It's not the best. Med D dept is disorganized and the supervisors always seem overwhelmed. Yes, it's a rather new addition to the Magellan Health network but the higher ups keep underestimating the amount of time and money that needs to be put in to have a efficient PDP. I'm not confident that the Med D dept will last due to CMS audits and such..."
good,Company provides pretty good benefits. Co- workers are supportive. But expect to be micromanaged by your superior. Possible to be working in a hostile work environment due to union vs mgmt vs employee.
good,"Magellan Behavioral Health company serves members with a Behavioral issue in Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, Northampton and Lehigh Valley.  Loved coming to work daily."
good,"Recommends"
good,"It was a while ago, so its hard to remember. It seemed to be good, but at the time I was new at case management, still learning how to do the job. Then the PNO roll out happened and Choices took over the clinic I worked at."
good,Average day making sure the customer has the correct policies. I learned a lot about health insurance. Great team. There were no hard parts of the job. Great work place. the co workers.
good,Great Company to work for.  Management is friendly and helpful. Vacation time is better than most companies with 4 weeks vacation your 1st year.  Training could be revamped a bit.
good,Our company has nice programs in place to help employees who have an urgent need due to uncontrollable life circumstances such as serious medical issues or catastrophe.
good,"Great management."
good,Growing company has growing pains. Great entry level positions that allow for growth and movement within the company. Poor recruiting and hiring practices. All and all I would recommend as long as you do not mind self teaching as very little support is offered.
good,"Everything moves slowly and is way too laid back. There doesn't seem to be good infrastructure; finding answers to questions is really difficult and there isn't one central knowledge repository. All jobs and job functions are really segregated; as a result it can be very frustrating. On the plus side, work-life balance and PTO are very generous. The most stressful part of the job is actually getting people to get their work done."
good,"Good Company No complaints, Most people are friendly,  a little clickish,  if you are not in the right group getting promoted is futile."
good,"Implemented managed care pilot program, networking claims for the state of Florida medical facilities with the proper rendering physician providers."
good,"As an ICCM with Magellan I work with member's that have a mental health diagnosis. My job duties include contacting the member's via telephone biweekly to monthly depending on risk level. I may set up appointments for members, transportation, housing assistance, food assistance or health care assistance. The job itself is very rewarding with a good work home life balance. The workload is comparable to the compensation, as I have worked for less money with a high work demand.  However the payroll department SUCKS BIG TIME! I think they should fire everyone in the payroll department and use a payroll company like ADP or something. Any overtime, on call or holiday pay is usually not paid when it should be and good luck trying to get it resolved you'll be waiting months and months. However if Magellan feels they have overpaid you they start deducting your pay immediately! They claim to have an open door policy which is bologna, when you reach out directly to upper management they revert you back to your immediate supervisor or ignore your calls/emails. There is a high turn over especially in the upper management. Each week receive emails that someone in upper management is leaving. The only reason I'm still working for this company is because the job is not stressful, I love working with my members and the pay is very good! Everything above the immediate supervisor is awful!"
good,In lieu of winning a contract with the state of Iowa for their Medicaid/Medicare Behavioral Health claims I was hired to be a technical writer and trainer.  I wasn't really there long enough to get a good feel for how things operated.
good,Enjoy the work environment. Claims Processing and Adjusting. Responsibility includes training and processing claims. Working on projects and creating new workflows
good,Working for Magellan Health Services was an excellent experience. It allowed me to grow in my career as well as in my personal life. It was a joy to work for such a pleasant company.
good,"review and authorized mental health service request from mental health providers. Time management was very important to process request in timely manner. Management was very good extensive training, got along well with co-workers. The hardest part was some of the training classes when we had to take tests. Most enjoyable was that there was always fun events in the office to boost morale."
good,"magellan complete care is a new company of its kind designed to give benefits to those specifically with  SMI. I work as a care coordination health guide, field based. I initiate contact with new enrolled members, gather health information and complete assessments to determine the level of care they need, and assist with case management services. I recently transitioned into a new region and relocated, and the management and staff were very friendly and had great communication skills. The hardest part of this job is getting the program established. There were/are always changes every week to make the company more efficient, and most recently the company decided to change their operating structure and have eliminated several positions, mine included. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with the members/clients. I enjoy working with people and building a rapport with those I work with and those I help, it makes a having a positive attitude at work easy."
good,"Greeting new students, answering phone calls, general administrative duties. Data entry, time management and general education administrative duties were some of the things that I learned while in this position. The co-workers were great and very helpful. Management was good and fair. There was really nothing too hard about this job."
good,"The company itself is a pretty good place to work for. The work environment is good when you are not constant being hassle, or picked on. The company I would give a great rating for its the pharmacy technician supervisor that makes it hard to work there. Constant finding something to pick on you for, shows favoritism, never owns up to his mistakes but will quickly throw you under the bus(hypothetically speaking). He doesn't know how to talk to employees, poor management skills. The list can go on and on about this work environment there. Magellan is a good company to work for if it was under better management."
good,"Co-worker were great to work with!"
good,"The background check process leaves no room for errors.  I only worked there for 3 months, I don't a lot to say."
good,Magellan is a growing company with national scale.The company has a strong history in Behavioral Health services. The company has employees with strong knowledge base and skill sets.
good,"Recommends"

good,it wasa great place to work when going to school. learning about the health field.
good,Typical day begins with hitting the floor and working. Friendly and professional co-workers. Very goal oriented.
good,"Working here at Magellan has taught me a lot and helped me establish the direction I would like to go in my career. It is a great place for entry-level positions, however the growth opportunities are limited."
good,Facilitating the needs of United States Postal Employees and their families by authorizing counseling services for immediate telephone consultation or setting up appointments with local network providers.
good,"Work alone out of your home most of time.  Constantly living with changes being made with computer programming, which is like living in constant stress.  I enjoyed working for this company for the most part, but am so relieved to now live without the constant deadlines and stress."
good,"Processing mental and behavioral health claims for payment. "
good,I really don’t have anything bad to say about this company... except you have to work with a lot of different attitudes and different personalities. The hours were good
good,"Very stressful work environment.  Worked many hours overtime for which I was not paid.  Audited monthly on many aspects of job.  Managers in the Michigan location for the most part were supportive.  Supervisors/managers externally (in Texas and Cincinnati offices) were not supportive, very critical, and did not completely understand differences between expectations of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan, State of Michigan contracts and those of other Blue Cross/Anthem contracts.  Hardest part of the job was managing 2 phone lines per Care Manager and couple layers of managers micromanaging employees.  Union was very ineffective other than possibly negotiating for decent benefits."
good,"Efficiently managed incoming calls from providers and members as they relate to eligibility, benefits, EAP services, claim status, and authorization inquiries in a manner that ensures customer satisfaction."
good,Enjoy working under a dynamic Director in a productive team environment. It's great when you have leadership that cares for their employees.  Work life balance is great!
good,"organization going through change was taken over by another MLTC."
good,"- Daily Account Management engagement"

good,"This organization is a good place to grow in, if you are looking to start a career. There is job stability with this company, however, the compensation could be better."
good,"I've learned a lot from Magellan, and have gained lots of healthcare experience."
good,"I improved a lot as an entry level programer analyst with Magellan. It was a great opportunity for me to work with a great team and great management. "
good,"Recommends"
good,Many opportunities to help improve the quality of peoples lives in their darkest times.
good,"nice environment , good management, having nice culture. having innovative projects."
good,"Ability to treat patients without interference and great support nurses, psychologists and psych techs."
good,I answered phone calls all day and I was able to talk with people medical problems and it was rewarding.
good,"The position for this review is MFLC. This job is one of a kind and was one of the best positions I have worked based on the dynamics. However, the pay provided for a licensed person is well below expectations. The salary before the new contract was decent but barely appropriate. Many of the positions were based in the schools which posed a problem because if the school was closed for any reason ,including holidays, you did not get paid unless you used your PTO. There was no guarantee that you would have a position over the summer. This can be a GOOD or BAD situation depending on your need to work. The program was truly amazing but the constant concerns of a inconsistent pay check is very stressful. They have a new contract and the salary was reduced by 5k but you now get paid for holidays. That wasn't much of a trade off when you are REQUIRED to be licensed for this job"
good,"80% of the day was spent on the telephone speaking with consumers that had to check in with me monthly involving their participation in a treatment program involving the medication Suboxone/Subutex. I also spent part of this time speaking with the patient's doctors and counselors regarding their level of participation and if they were following up on appointments as scheduled. The consumers had to do this in order for their BCBST insurance to continue covering their medication that helped them with their opiate addictions. The other 20% of my day was spent working on data entry into the Magellan and BCBST computer systems from the case notes I had taken throughout the day. I was also responsible for filling out then faxing and/or mailing all required HIPPA and ROI forms for the consumers to sign and return to me, so they could be scanned into the BCBST systems."
good,Magellan was a good company that once went through bankruptcy and strung the employees along.  Some decided to waited it out while others jumped ship when a opportunity presented itself.
good,Working for Magellan has been a great experience. I have been with the company close to 10 years and in those 10 years I have experienced some ups and downs but was able to manage and get the job done not just on my own but with my teammates. My motto: Teamwork makes the Dream Work. The company offers great benefits and really supports continued education.
good,Connecting Clients to Providers in their network. Telephonic work assisting Clients with various insurance coverage to providers in their designated Networks of Care
good,For a call center environment a 1 hour lunch is necessary to recharge adequately.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping Medicaid clients. I learned about a call center environment. I learned about Medicaid rules for different states.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of proper training with consistent answers to the same question.  Management not all on the same page.
good,"Fair place to work, worked in the claims department.  The offer a flex work schedule.  This yields them a high score in work life balance.  Convenient location"
good,"A typical day was to start off and pay and process claims according to the insurance contract with the providers "
good,"The clients are great, but there is a lot to be desired when it comes to feeling secure in your position with the company."
good,"No comment at this time. I am a Magellan employee but, I work offsite in support of a customer at another location."
good,"It's been two years since working for Magellan, but when I did, I found their mission statement stayed on course with our purpose to provide quality services to military families. They also gave us ability to utilize our own professional judgement when working independently with military."
good,"I mean Magellan is a great company to work for but management that's a different story they have favorites you can only move up only if someone quits the company and that position is available its not like you get promoted for the good work you do so they kinda use you to fill that spot up really fast , they always add new studies and expect you to learn it in two hrs which is crazy , the pto was great I really liked working there when I first started there ,then the third year there they always changed something or made you verify something extra that wasn't even apart of hippa , the nurses and doctors you spoke with were ethier nice or mean or tried to rush you off the phone or kept cutting you off , you take about 80 to 100 calls a day another dislike was no overtime or if it was ot they didn't tell you , you'll have to find out from someone else smh but whatever it was nice getting the authorization experience for 3 years and the work employees were nice"
good,I gained knowledge  through my job position in working in the EHR database. Helping patients with setting up therapy sessions per allotment and interactively with the physicians. Doing brief assessments of what the patients were needing and allowed in order to schedule them appropriately.
good,Great company to work for I work in the customer service department I enjoy helping the memebers who call in and to help them with there concerns
good,"Recommends"
good,"Although I am currently working from home, I have had good times when I worked in the office. They try to make things better for its employees but I believe other things can be done. All in all...the people are good people to work with."
good,Magellan is a professional environment with employees that care about their company. Everyone is friendly and likes to include whomever in activities.
good,Overall the company is ok to work for. You get a lot of vacation; I mean a ton. But the pay isn't that great. It's hard to advance.Most people have better success leaving the company. A lot of the business practices and systems are outdated making it very difficult to do your job and be competitive in the ever changing market.
good,"No growth opportunity,  supervisors are awesome not much communication. Would rather work for a company that can communicate a little bit better and it’s a little bit more fair when it comes on giving any type of raises. People that start after you do make more money they start at a higher rate. Don’t consider it fair if you’re sitting there training those people and you’re making less. Once you become a CSR on the second level that’s as far as you can really go."
good,Hardest part of the job is telling the Patient that the MD didn't send in the right info and that's why the request wasn't approved. The other part is explaining to the MD office that there are certain guidelines that need to be met or that it is past time-frame for additional review and that they need to start over.
good,"I loved the time I worked at Magellan. The scheduling is very flexible, my manager had open and honest communication. However they eliminated my position, they did give a severance but it was so unexpected. From what I hear it is very common for Magellan."
good,A great opportunity for dealing with people and their mental health and substance abuse behavor
good,Magellan is a good place to work but it is hard to move up in the company and they do not appreicate those who have a strong aptitude to learn more or a strong will to want to advance.
good,"Magellan Health is a great company to work for. Magellan have great benefits, such as PTO and health insurance. My average work day is long and busy."
good,"A typical day would be handling inbound calls, authorizing MRI and CT's for doctor offices. Being an employe at Magellan I have better myself at Mirco-Soft Word and Excell, my communication skills have grown, I am able to handle calls in a timly manager. I have a wonderful manager and lead who assit me with any request I may have. My co-workers are very outgoing, friendly, and open. I do not believe there is a hard part about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing daily after each call I have succesfully helped the caller with their request or concerns."
good,"No raises in 4 years, no incentives for employees.  Management isn't concerned about the employees welfare, working on shoestring in order to keep the contract."
good,Being an MFLC is rewarding in a sense because we see the resilience in children.  The most enjoyable at this time is being able to work with children.
good,"working at Magellan is interesting i enjoyed it I'm just sad that they are closing. The people are friendly, and the work environment is pleasurable, very laid back I really like it a lot"
good,Everything one has to figure out all by themselves its all a guessing game until you figure it out. Dress code is ridiculous. Management is all but absent.
good,"The executive management was reactive and not proactive nor consistent with directions. Staff resignations were high and my onboarding for the position I held was poor. My VP was holding 2 VP positions in the company and was unable to provide support.  The new VP requested I remain in my position and extend employment for another 8 weeks. The staff and directors were great to work with, however the executives were not aligned in the direction of my area."
good,"The employer and placements were all very well managed.  Workplace culture was ""spit and polish.""  Two levels of management:  One very distant with only occasional interaction; the other on base with little direction about work guidelines.  The company did provide good support materials about the military culture and programs, objectives."
good,"Good place to work.  There is alot of work for everyone to complete, most of the time it can be overwhelming for new personnel.  For the seasoned person this workload is the norm."
good,"Management was not good at all, people were nice and caring."
good,"Recommends"
good,Horrible manager only applied the rules and regulations to some and not all I did not trust that management had my best interest . My performance was above and beyond yet I was never hired in with the company while others who under performed and received complaints about their poor service were hired on with the company when asking the manager about this I was advised that performance alone is not what will get you hired in
good,I enjoyed my time with Magellan. Yes my job was hard and challenging but that is what I thrive on. Yes it changes rapidly but in any business you need to learn to adapt and flex.
good,"leadership can be immature and clicky like high school,   if you are not friends with the supervisor do not expect a promotion. other than that work at home is a plus"
good,"THe job its self was good but the supervisiors really dont care about their team, no motivation, no pep talks, they only talk to you when you have done something wrong."
good,The climate and culture of the organization was great. Management could have been “better” but my experience there was in no way stressful. The staff were a joy to work with. Team work was a plus!
good,"You will learn a lot here because that is literally the only way you will learn how to do your job.  Training is non-existent.  You either sink or swim.  In most departments you get your annual raise every year, some are performance based, but no self-reviews are done.  Not fairly compensated when you move up internally.  Or if they do compensate you, you will not get a raise the next time around.  Quarterly bonuses, or once a year depending on your job title.  High deductibles, but manage their on pharmacy benefits, so pharmacy prices are lower than most.  Be prepared to juggle a lot of different things at once."
good,"I liked working at Magellan and thought I would stay there til I retired, but then they started firing one of us after another and then also the department manager so I'm not certain why they decimated the department and do not know what is going on there now."
good,great place to work. typical day of work is great. I did not learn much. Management is awesome. Workplace culture is great. the hardest part of the job is work.
good,"This is a good company to work for as a contractor for the Dept of Defense. However, the personal time off (PTO) is lacking and hard to get. You will be working most of the time except for holidays and bereavement."
good,"Compared to other vendors of government contracts, Magellan Health offered many benefits, a competitive salary, and a degree of autonomy. The company did require last minute alterations in one's schedule to attend meetings remotely. Communications from top down was often delayed."
good,"Best in case clinical programs for managing Medical Pharmacy products on Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and other lines of business. "
good,"A review cannot and will not be provided at this time, regardless if it meets your quality guidelines or not. This is my final adjustment and submission."
good,Great company to work for. I would definitely say it's a good place to be. The hardest part of the job I would have to say maybe finding resources. You need to know people.
good,Magellan is a good place to work but they don't give yearly raises.  The hours can vary.  It is good working with the employees at the USPS.  Many good people at USPS
good,"The establishment was a pharmacy with a small convenience store located within a downtown mall area. We opened early in the morning which was busy with the local workers. I enjoyed this because it caused me to have many regular customers with whom I was able to build a relationship. The hours were not always consistent, but I was always home in time for dinner."
good,"Being an MFLC is a great opportunity to serve those who serve this country. I have been able to work with kids, go on field trips, and engage youth at summer camps. It is, at time, not the most stable employer but the population and what you do is great."
good,"During my tenure in the early days of the company, it had a visionary leadership team that successfully reinvented the company by transforming it from a provider of facility based medical services to a diversified managed care organization."
good,On that kind of position basically employees are working and entering data all the time without stopping good ambiance.
good,"Staff were great. "
good,"Recommends"
good,"Worked in contracting, very busy workload which i enjoyed.  Company was downsizing after almost 10 years of employment,Opportunity for advancement was great, but the pay scale was very low compared to other companies."
good,"The hardest part of my position was finding employees who wanted to work and grow."
good,Job was fairly easy.  Only issue was when we would run out of work.  Working from home was an option here too. Schedules were flexible and that helped people who had to get their children off to school a lot.
good,"At times chaos; but I never minded that."
good,I work a fast paced production oriented position. where focus and attention to detail is a must. I work all Medicare and Medicaid claim accounts and find it rewarding to know the person's I service a counting on me to be diligent to meet all dead lines. One of the hardest things about my job is the high pace focus of what we do to strive for mastery in our day to day production goals.  The most enjoyable are my co-workers and for which some have become close friends.
good,"The staff and workers at Magellan are great. It is a very productive, busy, efficient call center."
good,good compant just unstable due to contracts overall a great place to work for me.
good,I have been with my current employment for 6 years and I have development different technique to appropriately assist my clients.
good,"Worked 7am-3:30pm, excellent hours. Learned a lot about the mental health/radiology insurance."
good,"Low turn around makes it difficult to advance, the result of a good job.  Co-workes are very helpful and there are no clicks between upper management and the low man."
good,"I liked the job opportunity "
good,"Magellan was a great company to work for, but the salary was low, no holiday pay, and no pay raises. Fortunately I had a fantastic manager. The reason for leaving was that the company lost the contract at the site I wanted to work at."
good,Friendly place to work. Most people interact with you even though they're not in your dept. I've learned how to stick with the company branding through the years. I enjoy the comradery in most departments.
good,"No comment I enjoyed working there a good company to work for... Good management, excellent co-workers I would reccoment this company to anyone whho is seeking employment"
good,Each day is a new day at Magellan. The organization is growing by leaps and bounds and bring exciting challenges each and ever day. There is a lot of self directed work with allows you to accomplish significant amounts of work in a very short period of time.
good,"Magellan is overall a very good company to work for.  They do value advancing from within and offer many opportunities for advancement and new experiences.  They are very flexible in terms of ability to work from home and understanding when issues come up with young kids.  They do value increasing skills and will provide or send you for training.  Downsides are work/life balance and the cost of medical insurance.  Even with the downsides (which every company has), I would definitely recommend Magellan to prospective employees."
good,"I was a temporary employee with Magellan, but was treated as if I were a fulltime employee. I would go back and work for the company if there were an opportunity to work there again."
good,"Magellan was a good company to work for but was a lot of one on one computer work.  If your a people person, this is not for you.  There was also weekend, overtime, and travel on  most projects."
good,"Recommends"
good,Working in schools to support the children of the military service members. The job is very independent and you can mold the program to fit your own personal strengths and what the school/children need.
good,"Magellan was A Health Benefits Management corporation. Their business was directly related to RFP awards and state contracts."
good,"good job, decent pay, team leads and some supervisors  have no communication. its a decent place to work, flex hours and ok benefits. pay  could be better"
good,Productive workplace.  Not enough band width at times to support new business.  Management does take advice from all levels within the organization.
good,"Magellan Health Services is a company working for and administering health insurance mental health plans and these plan benefits in a tumultuous market environment.  I enjoy working for this company at this time as in spite of various healthcare and health system changes. In spite of these changes Magellan manages to ultimately maintain solid, well-defined policies, workflows and protocols.  "
good,"The company has a nice work flow. Every day was a new chance to help some one new. Working with the company allowed me to learn new way to solve problems , and open the door to learning more about mental health. Magellan also help me to understand claims, authorizations member benefits, data entry, and much more with in the medical/ mental health field."
good,"Good place to work for an individual looking for a fast-paced environment who is able to work well with others but especially independently. If you are able to adapt to an ever-changing environment, Magellan may be a good fit for you."
good,"Great, knowledgeable team. Lots of changes as a company that comes with a big company in a growth phase. Corporate resources and support for local service center."
good,"It was on OK company to work for, it just wasn't in my field of criminal justice. I would however recommend the employer to someone else"
good,"My job has given me flexible hours, with a management that cares about personal development.  I have learned a lot about the Corporate world and how to conduct myself in a professional manner.  My co-workers helped me develop my leadership skills."
good,Training was provided to adjudicate medical claims.  We received reports each day to complete.  We each had our own cubicles and worked individually.  It was a pleasant environment.
good,"I begin my work day at 7 am and ending at 3:30 pm. I input authorizations that I have issued to psychiatrists, registered nurses, therapists in order for them to see their patients. We manage mental health and substances abuses cases. We also have a call center which handles all the calls from the providers as well as the patients."
good,"A typical day includes a variety of tasks (transcribing minutes, handling equipment servicing difficulties, assisting customers and treatment providers in investigating claims payment and processing issues, responding to clinician requests for updates and corrections to the client database etc.) - requiring a variety of skills. I learned to multi-task, prioritize due to multiple requests for time and assistance and service the needs of vendors, employees and clients alike in a timely and efficient manner."
good,Unfortunately  MCC doors closed in Miami FL.  typical day extremely business.  Open to learn different departments.  Most enjoyably part of the day serving the customers.  Enjoyed working with team.
good,"love the company, good benefits, great work- life balance, PTO is good. Lots of layoffs, pay could be better. Managers are down to earth. Some like to micromanage."
good,"Magellan is a great place to work as a Military and Family Life Counselor. The pay is good, the benefits are good but the lack of paid vacation time is a major con."
good,Enjoyed the people and work environment. Learned a lot about mental illness and verifying licenses. Liked when our pods would have pot lucks or if it was someone's birthday we would decorate the cubical.
good,I worked there for 4 years and enjoyed my work overall. There was an uneven standard of behavior with self-directed staff. Relationships depended on the therapist ability to develop them. Support for the therapist was fair; weekly meetings helped with isolation.
good,"Nice place to work..People are friendly and outgoing...Restrooms can be cleaner. Great  cafeteria, friendly staff.. Great atmosphere, Managers are understanding."

good,"I worked for magellan approximately three years.  It was a great place to work, friendly people, good training, great communication. The problem I have with Magellan is that they left our team without a manager for over six months.  This caused a huge mess and a lot of miscommunication.  I still have friends at magellan and they state that the new management is amazing! I am no longer at magellan because I do not want to work in a cubicle on the phones all day. I believed I am more qualified than that."
good,"Magellan has a contract with the Department of Defense to provide licensed counselors for as Military Family Life Counselors. The job, itself, is a wonderful and fulfilling opportunity. The frustration comes in working with Magellan, the corporation. We are listed as employees of Magellan, but with an * beside our title. Other Magellan employees get a full compliment of benefits, such as paid time off for federal holidays, salary increase opportunities, as well as opportunities of advancement, yet MFLCs do not. Magellan's competitors provide these benefits, and actually pay more per hour. Magellan as a whole continues to grow within the medical profession, acquiring many facets of industry. I do find it ironic that Magellan, which is an insurance management company, can not afford to provide better health insurance for their employees. "

The company lost several high dollar accounts causing massive layoffs, but my view of the company is this...it's a great place to work, amazing people, tremendous work/life balance.  They didn't lose the accounts due to any fault of their own, but contracts ran out and the accounts chose to try other providers.  My Supervisor and Director were straight shooters.  Nothing was ever hidden from my department or the associates working under me.  Very close knit company that tries to go out of their way to make sure employees are taken care of."

I also supported the direct supervisor with claim inquiries by checking communication logs, payment history reports, and corresponded with the Claims Resolution Department."
good,During my employment with Magellan I advanced through hard work that did not go unnoticed. The last position as Network Manager my team was one of the best in the company.

Actually when I was offered this job this is when employers gave job seekers first time opportunities, now they want you to have experience and a degree! The hardest part of the job was keeping your employee morale high because the job is very repetitive and can become dull. However you do get a yearly raise, and they do have employee events which allows you to get away from your for some time. I didn't like that fact that we switched managers almost every month to a year while I was there. There's several opportunities to relocate if you want and move up in the company."

good,Fair and balanced workplace.  Great management in EAP department where I worked.  Nice people and nice accommodations.  Good environment and friendly people in building.
good,"Lots of really great people working together to try to help those in need. Management a bit of a joke; IT leadership change in 2016 was much needed - (unfortunately, he viewed all existing employees as idiots). Management in general doesn’t seem to learn from mistakes, consistently keeping same boneheads in positions of authority despite past failures."
good,This position allows you to be creative with the freedom of an independent contractor and offers the support and collaborative effort from your colleges. I highly recommend this position. The position supports the job work/life balance.
good,"Recommends"
good,"I worked at Magellan for 6 years and it was a great place. My teammates were excellent and go out of their way to help you. People were very professional and about their work. Management went through a lot of changes during my time there so there was some volatility, but that is expected in most corporate environments. In IT we faces new challenges and problems to solve daily and worked as much as required to get the job done. The goal was always about improving and being proactive instead of reactive. Magellan compensates fairly and is overall good to their employees."
good,"Opportunity to advance was available at Magellan.  Benefits were great and overall a good places to work.  My job required you to be flexible with the numerous activities that went on any given day.  I learned how to manage time efficiently, how to be a productive manager, how to budget, learned purchasing skills and never missed a day of work in the 23 plus years I worked there."
good,high volume of incoming calls relating to eligibility claims and authorization of services member of employee activity committee maintaining high averages. keeping customers happy
good,WOrked at magellan for about 6 years with 5 different positions. Enjoyed the flexibility to change jobs and advance. Work life balance is what you make it. Management was a revolving door unfortunately. The hardest part of the job is trying to piece things together with limited resources. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job was being able to contribute more than just within your duties.
good,"I was an Authorization Representative who answered a high volume of inbound calls into the call center.  I had to look up ICD9 and CPT codes along with knowing the Medical terminology for the Cancer or Behavioral Health procedures needed. I also spoke with Doctors office's and Hospital for clearance on specific tests needed.  Incoming calls of 85 or more per day.  I also faxed, scanned,  copy,  and typed information into Microsoft Word while on a call with the patient."
good,It was a contract assignment that was temporary.  I really enjoyed the opportunity in being on staff during the week. I would highly recommend the opportunity in doing this assignment if give the chance.
good,"My title was a Clinical Pharmacy Technician. It was a call center setting where I would answer inbound calls. The calls ranged from prior authorizations, troubleshooting for pharmacies, and answering Medicaid patients questions. I worked on various accounts at once where each had its own directions.

good,"Friendly and educated colleagues at Magellan in Phoenix, AZ. Good experience working there."
good,"The environment is very professional and most of the management is very knowledgeable of their department.  My co-workers are all new, so haven't had much time to really get a good feel for them; however, most of them seem very social and skilled to do their job.  I love working for magellan, I just wished they had better management and leadership in the department I work for because it seems as if the reps have more insight and knowledge than the supervisors."
good,"Ive learned a lot as far as being able to display excellent customer service skils for example disquising my tone, staying engaged with customer...etc"
good,"Diverse work environment, teams supported. Great management except for the CEO - he was a loony tune.  Great opportunity while it lasted.   Healthcare insurance management always changing."
good,"Each case and day was somewhat different due to the nature of the case itself whether a provider, facility and/or employee case. That would determine the research, documentation request, interview and reporting. "
good,The work structure was different with MagelIan Health because I learned a little more about working directly with Behavioral health providers.  I work remotely and able to manage my 8 + hour a day schedule with my providers and Magellan team.
good,Absolutely love this company. Great work life balance; as you were allowed to bring your children to the office. Magellan offers great opportunities for advancement. Comparable salaries and benefits.

good,A typical day at Magellan I come in the office check my voicemails and emails to see what task I will have to full filled I will work on my claims via Nasco system or Q-Blue system as well. I also work on appeals as well. Provide accurate information to providers and members as well.
good,Excellent company with positive and thorough recruitment.  The position as MFLC is very unique and requires excellent interpersonal skills and reporting capacity.  The manager in my situation really supported me yet was often so distracted he made no sense and dropped the ball.  4.5 Stars out of 5!
good,"Management is very consistent and open to assist counselors when questions arise. Unfortunately, no monitory incentives are given for new employee referrals. Magellan has a standard of practice that they adhere to and provide helpful trainings to assist staff with their jobs."
good,"Excellent company in many areas. Tremendous opportunity for growth of personal skill sets. You will be challenged but find that many employees are more than willing to guide you,"
good,"Fun place to work, interactive with staff and management. Friendly environment and definitely learn as you go within your position to move up the ladder."

good,"Magellan Health was a good company to work.  I liked my supervisor and coworkers.  My job was a MFLC. The job was fulfilling and rewarding, the only drawback was when the children were not in school, you did not get paid, which was Christmas Break, Spring and Fall Break and all other school holidays."

good,"I truly love working at Magellan Health. My only cons would be the training wasn't adequate, also as an employee who works at home full time I am forced to lose hours if we run out of work. I feel that as long as I am online I should be paid as I cannot conrol the work we receive however feel penalized when work is low."

I believe my supervisor is sometimes crabby only because he has to be.... Great company! I would definitely recommend!"
good,"I loved working at Magellan, I had a work from home position. The only reason I left was contract ended.

good,"Performed inquiries into various systems to determine provider eligibility and contract updates."
good,It all depends on the dept you work for in the company. I hated working in the claims team not because of the workload but because the managers suck. I knew more them and I couldn't respect my boss knowing they went to the strip clubs with their employees. I just cant.

The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that at end of day you've helped someone."
good,"Really enjoyed the job I did as a nurse liaison for all of Maricopa County (22,000 clients).

Many days, they call me to consult about extremely difficult children and I assist them by brainstorming with them to find ways to handle these children or to help them to be more successful. The hardest part of my job is when there are no answers. I love kids and want them to be successful, but sometimes nothing works and we have to start over or just do the best we can.

good,I spent most of my time in the field servicing and assisting and modeling recovery for WellCare Members under a contract with Magellan Health. I worked from my home and had a desk top computer in my home office. I drove long distances and spent time encouraging and mentoring and assisting Members with daily life activities and accompanied on appointments and did Peer Support Mentoring and counseling and empathetic listening and gave appropriate feedback. I maintained internal and external reports and completed notes for each telephonic or in person visit and attempt and maintained and reported expenses and keep in touch with distance supervisor via telephone and emails and faxes. I spent ata least 2 to 3 hours a week in a weekly meeting of a small team consisting of the other Peer Specialist and the company liaison and with my supervisor and other interested parties telephonically. I dealt with possible crisis and unusual events and contacted agencies on behalf of the members. To me the hardest part of the job was the constant travel and not finding Members at home when a meeting was scheduled and getting phone calls from Members after hours in near and actual crisis. The frustration of not being able to actually assist Members with food and housing and transportation for the most part made the job very difficult. I enjoyed talking to the Members about their lives and opportunities and modeling recovery and assisting them with exercises to help them cope better with their illnesses and situations and supporting them in the community. I enjoyed the online trainings as this helped
