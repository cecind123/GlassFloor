rating,review
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They offer no raises or explanation to raises. District managers move corrupt general managers around instead of firing them and holding them accountable. Work load is ridiculous to pay scale. Bottom line It's a part time type of work and should be treated as such
bad,Took all the black people out of position and replaced them with white people. Also Hispanic was demoted. Will not compensate you for temporary replacement
bad,"No one can manage this store for more than two days, it's only here to compete with the other automotive retail stores, not to actually make a profit."
bad,Dont waste your time.  Management is a joke and if you want to be a stockperson then just run.  I have another full time job and dont have time for the bs
bad,"Close coworkers are great people everyone else seems to have something against you and are not willing to be team players. Management only cares about numbers and only complains when they talk to you, never give even a compliment when you do good work."
bad,"No valoran a los trabajadores, despue de 15 año de trabajo en esa compañía y de ser una buena trabajadora en mi puesto de trabajo no se tocaron el pecho para despedirme, para mo seguir pagando los beneficio y no fue solo a mi"
bad,"Advance is terrible.  I was brought in as a General manager.  They offered me half what I made managing a store with another company.  I accepted, hoping that my love for cars and customers would outweigh the low pay.  It did, but the job was awful.  Long hours and impossible goals mixed with pay secrecy and deceptive practices in profit and inventory.  "
bad,"Not a good place to work management poor lack of ethics no empathy no working equipment at times poor lighting dusty cold "
bad,"While working at World-Pac I discovered, this company is a felony friendly place to work for,  Like many companies out this own get incentives for hiring convicts.  If you are undocumented they would use fear and intimidation tactics. I don't trust middle to upper management,  very incompetent there's no leadership this company would hiring just about anybody.  There's a lot of favoritism, nepotism, and cronyism that goes in this company"
bad,The company's focus is on profit over all instead of customer service or welfare and fair pay of employees. The upper management has no idea what the customers want or what employees need. And none of the upper management recognizes talented car people who are the ones customers need.
bad,"This company is not stable. I am surprised it is still in business. The pay is low and there is no room for advancement. They preach ""speak up"" if you do you are putting a target on your back."
bad,They move you up but never raise ur rate always putting you down and are always afraid of some one else trying to take there job make you do why to much for such lil pay
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful."
bad,they promised me everything never came though with nothing kept saying a raise will happen never did tried to change stores the manager wouldn't let anyone try to advance
bad,"Worst place to work. They treat you awful. Mangers and the company as a whole don't care about you. To them you are replaceable. Your supposed to get off at 530. But they don't tell you what time your getting off. You never know what time your getting off. After 13hrs of work and they tell you, you can't leve. If u do it's a write up."
bad,One of the most greedy companies I have ever worked for they only care about high-pressure sales to customers that are trying to just fix their car with badgering them about buying additional useless items constantly threaten employees with job performance issues if they forget to punch in or out for can’t make their daily sales goal even if the weather is bad and there aren’t any customers.  Constantly restructure bonus plans so that it favors them and it is unattainable for managers and constantly change speed perks program to benefit themselves and hurt the customer
bad,Just not good it was a very un attractive job and it payed nothing for the hours and amount of work you would do......................................
bad,Lots of favoritism when managers do something wrong it's swept under the rug like it never happened very poor management no room for advancement and dont bother to report anything to HR they don't care either
bad,Wow is all I can say. They are a joke. They do not want people to move up in the company. Asking off of work is like pull g teeth. Everyone judges you no matter what. They rather judge someone instead of helping them. Management sucks but time..
bad,They are a bad company and recuse their employees medical help when they are hurt and allow people to try and hurt others  while others try to do the right thing
bad,"This is a sad state of affairs....they make promises that are not kept....you get virtually no support in your endeavors "
bad,"The customers bite, everyone that works here bites the district manager bites and we went through 3 store managers in my three months at this location. The store is half thefted out until the shelves are almost empty..store and everything and everyone in it is complete garbage"
bad,"Horrible company they don't appreciate dedicated workers and you have to fit in to there click, when you start you're treated as an outsider until you kiss up to upper manage ment"
bad,"Worst job I ever had. No matter how long or hard you worked, upper management was never content . Store management micromanaged through all the computer reports. Too many unreachable goals to meet ."
bad,Absolutely no work life balance!!!!!!! You are not compensated for work or improving all sales numbers!!!! District manager is completely ignorant to any business aspects!!!!
bad,"Managers treat their employees like garbage "
bad,"Was lied to about the job, garages will not deal with the store manager, he’s very disliked, he him self lies at will, he has his favorite employees, no one is happy in the store"
bad,There was no help from district manager when needed. Benefits were very poor considering what I paid per month for them. Well under paid for the job I was doing. The contract you sign at the beginning of the job vs what is expected of you. Example working 60+hrs for 2years because your Rpp position wouldn't be replaced due to sales volume of the location. This is just a few of the many things I could say
bad,They screwed me. I worked there 5 years and got hurt and never missed a day. Even worked for 2 1/2 years with torn rotator cuff. We was getting ready to  go to court and they offered me a settlement so I took it and was made to quit. I just wanted my shoulder fixed and keep working but that didn't happen.
bad,This company is a joke. The higher ups and the gm at the store was dumb as a box of rocks. She was clueless. The new district manager is an idiot too.
bad,Management is a joke. Pay sucks. They will pressure you till you quit. Nothing you do is good enough. No training. Their training is you learn as you go sort of thing. Definitely not worth your time. Many other jobs that will pay more out there and  appreciate your role with proper training. Beware of this job. First hand experience given this advice.
bad,"On indeed they advertised a full time driving position so I took the job, I rarely got the fulltime hours, some weeks I would only get 19 hours. I told them I could only work certain hours on the weekends and they would schedule me for those hours almost like it was done on purpose, I upsold alot of parts thinking it would help me and it didnt. Bad place to work for. When I left 2 others left after me"
bad,"Poor management, everything was wayyyy over priced causing angry customers nonstop, with the Walmart merger came a ton of arbitrary policies, other locations wouldn't handle issues well causing angry customers to come to my location, unrealistic sales expectations, and most of all TERRIBLE management."
bad,The manager takes naps and is unfair to employed. When I work in Tennessee it was a great company to work for. But the Watertown store the manager will not work with you on your ability to work times.
bad,"That is all they worry about they hire sales people not Autopart people"
bad,"Very unappreciative. They work you to the Bone. Pay is poor. Broken promises. They send you all over town store to store. No compromising, it is their way or the highway."
bad,I worked for this company for a yr. They want you to be quiet and have no voice. Promoting from within is a joke and they dont acknowledge the hard work and dedication. High expectations but its like working for nothing. I was fired because i had a voice and at the most crucial time in my life. Being dependable and reliable to only have wasted my time.  Worked for the ones who didnt want to for them to still have a job
bad,"No management there, inexperienced, horrible work environment not welcoming at all. Leaving there, corporate is even worse  they put up with bullying and that alone is a pending lawsuit"
bad,"You will be worked to death for no reason. They will provide a skeleton crew in their store and then look the employees and GM like it's their problem the upper management doesn't know what they're doing. "
bad,"The computer softwares and hardware are not compatible,  they are also extremely outdated. It's embarrassing, and the computers not only crash and freeze daily,  but the catalog is not entered with descriptions for much of it,  and inconsistent description that makes it hard to offer comparisons to customers. Pictures are not available quire iften a also.  The management is a joke.  Corporate companies don't care about you."
bad,"Get away as fast as you can. They don't care about you. They tell you what you want to hear, they make promises and then they ""forget"" what they said. This company is there to take advantage of people wanting to work hard and yet they won't pay what you are worth."
bad,Should have been 4 day work week turned into 5-6. 12 hour plus days. Too much appeasing associates. Most could not speak English. No working together between departments.
bad,"This is one of those deals where who you know trumps fairness, and even though helping people fix their problems is very rewarding the treatment and biased nature of the management in MULTIPLE advances makes it hard after a few years of dealing with and even trying to fix/reporting matters."
bad,Cant really say what I want too but it's more stress then working pleasure. If ur a good employee then managment will have the good employees doing junk work while other employees just stand around twiddling there thumbs and managment dont say anything to them
bad,Working inside a warehouse for the first time is one of the worst experiences of my life December will be 4 years for me honestly it feels like 10 !!!
bad,There's no comunication they only think about  them self  they don't  care about the employe and the customer. And the worse part they are raises  and that's wrong
bad,Would never work there again no matter what the pay would be management or the lack of is good at moving numbers to make themselves look good and that's about it
bad,"Kicked to the curb , like I was never truly valued to begin with. Had to to BEG for a raise , only to be let go . Huge turn over, which means EVERYONE has to go and be replaced."
bad,Doing track and deliveries was the best position ever given I mean at times when it was slow for the delivery you will have to go up in the front or you’re in the back doing truck only downside and con When other employees just play around Or if you ask for help it’s like management or other employees expect you don’t know where everything is or what to do in certain situations we don’t get paid enough to yell or argue at customers that the management job we were basically just get fired on the spot written up And installing batteries when other people are just lazy specially management Also there’s favoritism
bad,All I can say is that management doesn’t listen and shows favoritism over other employees that have been there longer. I personally felt very unappreciated and unheard as an employee.
bad,I guess indeed wants me to leave a feedback for advance auto parts we went through 3 store managers in a year it was wild Ok I hope you have a great day
bad,"The management is terrible. Everyone tries to be the boss..when there is only supposed to be ONE! You don’t get recognized for hard work, dedication, or passion for the job. I advise you to stay away."
bad,"pull orders, deliver them, put up stock, maintain company inspection at beginning of shift, fuel vehicle at end of shift, collecting payment and signature for delivery of products, handling questions and complaint and forwarding them to management"
bad,I didn't like some or most people because they would talk behind you're back very immature place!the managers didn't have a clue. Everyday sucked big.
bad,"It's a shame that you can NOT give a zero to the worst treatment by a manager in my life "
bad,I hated it..i worked there 8/14/2019-8/20/2019 it was extremely hot..the first 2 days are ok because its safety then orientation..i was not paid for the first 5hours of orientation..they sent me an email with the wrong hours..i left a vm to hr lori she never got back to me and friday my check was wrong..
bad,"I was hired to get the commercial sales business off the ground and had way more experience than the manager . I was training him in the process and how it makes money. But , him and his boss had other ideas that didn’t make any sense so I left"
bad,Very high turnover in associates none of the managers are skin color friendly. Everyone is suspected of stealing. Not family oriented at all there is no maternity leave. Women just fight there way back into there position if available. Very high school with rumors starting with young managers
bad,I had drug addicted coworkers who got high on the job.  One of them stole the bank deposit while i was on unpaid vacation.  Every day involved personality conflicts with people who would not do their job. Management was terrible. Area managers would routinely hire friends for more money than experienced employees who were better qualified made. Raises were tiny if at all.
bad,It was so hard to be a woman and work there. They where sexiest and rude to most of the woman to come into the store. You knew what the men there wanted.
bad,Terrible place to work...  they blame their employees for something they didn’t do and don’t care about the facts. Their entire system I stupid. They don’t care about anything they have to say. He believe what they say is right when it’s wrong.
bad,This is a very busy and mentally straining job depending on the location and/or district you work in. I was given the ultimatum to transfer or quit multiple times regardless of the distance I lived from the job. They offer too little pay for the responsibility given. Low quality remanufactured parts. I would stay away if you are looking for true success in the automotive parts field.
bad,"I like the job, and the district manager. The hours were OK There was no manager witch made things confusing . 3 people acted as boss and yelled at the 2 older drivers."
bad,"The manager and assistant manager are best friends at the 124 W Rodney French Blvd, New Bedford, MA 02744 location."
bad,"Was a manager for years in good standing. On the day of my brother's funeral, I forgot to clock out. Was fired over two days later for ""falsifying time record"".  Asked them to give me a write-up because of the circumstances it happened under. They said sorry about your brother, but your fired...company policy!"
bad,This was a temp to hire position. A typical day at work would start with our safety meeting. We would also go over our performance from the previous shift. Most of the time we did not have enough manpower for the workload resulting in extremely long hours. Management was typical warehouse management. I'm just doing my job.
bad,"Screwed over, and empty promotional promise! The general management was unappreciated and overworked and needed more help! Management was also not allowed to put trust into other employees to make other decisions"
bad,"The whole company sucks, all the way up the latter. Under paid employees. Dont stand behind their own policies. Take away things you have earned and deserve to keep. I will never recommend anyone working for them."
bad,I only made $8.88 a hour and was there 8 months done my job the managers job and everyone else job and got no raises or benefits. Worked off the clock to get my manager training in just for it to be giving to a kid that was the GM stepson and it was his first job. This company could careless about there employees or customers. I don't recommend this company to anyone for anything. They promise you the world and lying the whole time.
bad,This company has fallen bad over the years. When I first started it was a great company to work for but after 10 1/2 yrs it had changed for the worst. I do not recommend working for this company for a long period of time. For a starter job or just cause you wanna work... sure but not a career. You as a person dont matter to them.
bad,Don't waste your time working for this place. They're a complete waste of time. They don't pay worth anything and they expect you to break your back for them.
bad,Advance Auto parts your hours is based on the store's performance. You have employees who are very lazy and down right just don't care. Employees constantly call out
bad,Would definitely not recommend this place to work at. There is alot of favoritism and it's a joke. I am mistreated and it's not fair to me to have to deal with that.
bad,"I had a bad experience working here. I was doing all of my GM's duties, working 60 hours a week at a part time status and got no recognition for it. So please don't base you're opinions on Advance based off my experiences only."
bad,"They dont train or develop. No understanding of who in charge. Able to do as you please, No opportunity to advance. They have no since of urgency. They di t have a open door policy."
bad,"As a single mom, I was attracted to growing in the company. This doesn’t happen. They hire from outside for upper level positions. I had four years before I was given a tiny raise. I mean tiny. Forty cents tiny. Harassment is unbearable."
bad,Its cool working with auto-parts but the company sucks. Unless you make it to upper management by some miracle you make below average pay and its not a job that will provide for yourself let alone a family. Stay away unless you know you are going to be the gm or higher.
bad,The only thing you can count on with Advance Auto is to be used as a place holder until Management is done using you. Employee performance and devotion means nothing here. Each location is constantly needing people because job security simply doesn't exist.
bad,"This company needs to get its priority's straight. They focus on the customers solely, not its employees. Hours being cut, employees being underpaid, understaffed. Etc."
bad,I've been lied too by management don't get the hours I need to pay bills  hours are scheduled unfairly and at last minute. Absolutely the worse job I've ever had
bad,"They pick and choose who they give promotions too, and over see employee that are hard worker. And they are good to hire friends instead of inside promotions."
bad,"Not a bad part time job, but don't try anything new with the old timers dispatching deliveries. They also don't care how you are treated at certain run down auto repair dumps. The bottom line is always right."
bad,Has a lot of favoritism going on in the work place the GM likes to show he's private parts and call's it his tumer.the other employees are sceared to say anything or address any issues .
bad,U have no life..boring in the am ..pm busy after 5 pm..u must know about cars and trucks pass ur test. Management not good..make this temp.job and find better job..2019 this company just want there numbers up..u will be stress out..they all about a sales.. N u have to sell the promte product u only benefits more hours n manager get the bounus ..
bad,Upper management is entitled to monthly bonus checks that other employees are not eligible for.  Kinda works like a pyramid scheme.  Everyone works 3 people benefit.
bad,this corporation treats its employees like garbage. all they care about is money. corporate wants its people to work for very little money. the people i worked with & my customers were great.
bad,Advanced is a liberal driven company with a attack anyone with opposing views .no promotions unless you are in favor of upper level management .hard to earn a good life sustaining wage with raises are nearly nonexistent..
bad,The hardest part of the job was the inability I had to actually perform my job. between the management and other employees I had a very poor work team. I do not like working for companies that don't care to actually help yet categorize themselves as customer service. If you aren't willing to care for you customers as you would a family member you should not be in the customer service business.
bad,While working there management was Self centered and lazy they would up make me the Part time guy do allot of the management Work Like taking inventory while they smoked cigarettes ! The Management Scheduled all there Vacations on the Holidays and made the Lesser Employees Deal with the Aftermath!
bad,"as far as store level goes, if you question management you are labeled as a problem employee. They don't care about employees or customers. If out on sick leave, when doctors release you to return to work they drag their feet on scheduling you back."
bad,Would not recommend this to a friend ever you get paid bottom dollar for $100 and hour worth of work and god forbid if you want to advance in the company they just plain lie to you to string you alone about it
bad,Terrible place to work for no one knew what was going on. Everyone is on the same drawer so when money started going missing they started pointing fingers at everyone. Definitely wouldn't recommend this job to ANYONE
bad,24 years of loyalty and get knocked down to part time because ALL parts management control freaks.. If you don’t kiss butt they treat you very badly.. At the store I work at we haven’t had a raise in 10 years always a bs excuse.. DO NOT recommend anyone working for this company..
bad,"Don't waste your time a Adavance auto parts in brent alabama, you can do better somewhere else. Way better. Way better. You will be way under paid for the work you do.."
bad,"The boss at the time when I was employed with Advance Auto parts was an unprofessional pig! He was extremely inappropriate with the female employees and used his status as general manager to take advantage of the rules just because he felt like he could. Working the counters was fairly enjoyable as well as driving the company vehicles to deliver parts to the mechanical auto shops that had  commercial accounts through our company, however the day that he broke the last straw, it was a terrible and horrific day for quiet a few of the employees in the MANY years that we had all worked for Advance Auto Parts. My boss decided that he wanted to belittle and disrespect one of our employees as well as used very vulgar and explicit language to cuss the coworker out in front of several customers in the store at that specific time. He was incredibly rude and he humiliated that person so badly that they decided to end their career with the company. No one of higher status ever had anything helpful or empathetic to say when Human Resources was contacted and our boss at the time was NEVER reprimanded. The company in general has no morals or compassion and as long as they can cover up or cloud an HR mess, they will continue making their workers miserable by mistreating them with no consequences. Advance Auto Parts is truly a disappointing establishment and I would not recommend even my worst enemy to fill out a job application for that place."
bad,"They do not pay. They do not care about management. They do not care about their employees. people can get away with anything, even if it hurts those around them or the company"
bad,"I did not like the job.  I would not go back there to work... I will not say anything negative.  To much stress, not enough training.  Never knew from day to day what to do"
bad,this was just a fill in job untill another came along it was never meant to be a career position like i said just a fill in never intended to stay there just a fill in
bad,it was not good the plant close down a lot of people without jobs and they been had knew before they told anyone i would not tell nobody about this place ever
bad,"They don’t care about nothing terrible company "
bad,The warehouse is an old building that lacks proper ventilation.As a result the temp reaches 100 degrees in the summer. its also not very clean. Dust everywhere.
bad,"Advance has been going downhill for some time. My manager there was great, and he helped me jump ship to a competitor. Other than that, I hated being there. The district manager was uptight and demanded everything to be done a certain way, yet he had zero experience working in a store. They love to hire ex military and put them in lead roles. I have nothing against that, but that doesn’t necessarily make someone fit for their role."
bad,"Most positions are very low pay and part time.Some of the coworkers are very unprofessional,rude and make the job site very unpleasant for the rest of the workers."
bad,Local Denver culture is a boys club. They don’t respect women or people trying to learn their business. Zero training or mentoring. They send you out there unprepared.
bad,"I do not recommend this company to anyone that cares about people or assisting others.  The management does whatever it wants. It was not a place I recommend to anyone who is trying to learn, there is no one that wants to teach. and if you tried to show and teach someone the management came down on you saying it not your job to teach them."
bad,Being female really worked against me.  They treated me different and used me to get the current manager fired so that another guy could take over. They called me a liability to my face since I have a hip replacement.
bad,"To many chiefs not enough Indians."
bad,"Obvious favoritism at the store scale, it gets neglected by upper management. All the company cares about is hitting weekly numbers. You constantly get nagged about not selling monthly items although you are constantly offering. There really isnt alot if room to move up."
bad,"Management staff never knew what end was up went thur about 4 different leaders and they would talk about firing someone and the person they were firing would be the last to know days later ridiculous what kind of leader tells team members that are not in management before the management staff knows. I put my 2 weeks notice in after they fired a leader of management that was one of the nice and hardest working employee with the company. I guess hard work,dependable and reliable team members were not what they were looks for. I found out later that the reason why they fired this individual was because they didn’t meet there sales quota for 1 month. You get assigned a certain number of dollars that you have to meet in a month if you work there 40 hours a week your sales goal is usually somewhere around $1000-1400 a day and if at the end of the month you don’t reach it you could be fired. Even if you gave 15 years to the company."
bad,The manager was the most stupid person i ever worked with in my life.Friendship was more important than be honest. Had to leave because the female manager and a male worker had a great friendship. She only took his word for the truth.
bad,A typical work day starts out stressful having to clean up after night crew which kinda makes whole day bad.  I have learned many things about car parts and how they work and am thankful for the experience but without a good team and good management retail stores suffer big time. Id say hardest part of my day is dealing with everyone else's mess.
bad,"Don't work here if you want any form of family life, CANNOT start a family on the wages they provide. Refuse to raise wages to cost of living. horrible company that could care less if you get sick"
bad,Parts pros only have to know how to look up parts on the computer. Not a parts pro just looking up parts. They hire people off the street and have them answering the commercial phones.NOT PARTS PROS
bad,They treat you with no respect.  It’s all about them and their business. And don’t care about your feelings or opinions.  They can come off disrespectful and vindictive.
bad,Company cut me due to me apparently stealing parts that I had returned due to not needing them and then tried sticking me with over 2500 in charges of coupons that my whole store was doing for a ac promo advance ran but it wouldn’t promote within the system
bad,"Aap cares little to nothing about there employees. They honestly just chew them up and spit them out. I made them millions annually but was ""over paid"" at 18 dollars an hour."
bad,"Not enough hours, No promting with in the company, a lot of great customer, Fast pace, love working with parts and customer, a very easy going job, no raises."
bad,Constantly changing the General Manager of people that have no idea what they are doing. They pulled a guy from a furniture store to become 3 bosses from the bottom that had no idea what he was doing with cars
bad,not a good environment. Poor management. at the store I worked for. THe building was falling apart. It was an old building. Parts were always missing from the warehouse deliveries
bad,"If you are part time, you will get nothing ever. There is no room for advancement and you get paid slave wage. I've worked here 4 years and haven't even got a dollar raise. They cut my hours and then call me in to cover a shift."
bad,This was a job I would not put up with the manager will talk your business. The hours suck it's never a set schedule she always asking if someone can stay
bad,Dont work at Advance most of employees can't speak English.   The company helps people get fake social security cards and work employees like slaves because they most who work there are illegal and wont say anything.
bad,"Working here is like working in mordor itself. The amount of disrespect in this company is enormous. I have multiple years of automotive experience but yet I am paid minimum wage. This is absolutely disgusting, management shows you no respect. I am almost 30 years old but yet I am treated like some high school kid which infuriates me. I would never work for this company ever again."
bad,"I took this job as a delivery driver due to a urging of a friend that worked there. The pay was a joke($9.00 per hr). I was making that in 1977. Being that I own a business, I felt this would be a good fill in for my ""downtime""."
bad,"Company had unrealistic goals."
bad,"I really don't have a comment for this company, it's up to the individual to choose rather or not that's the place they want to work. Maybe good for someone who is still living at home with parents."
bad,would rather not say .but my job is to deliver parts and help people in what they need for there car .go to bussinesses and when i deliver and help them with there needs
bad,"Nothing to say, terrible workplace, poor management, awful training program, zero to none benefits, room for promtion but no room for people with out serious automotive background."
bad,the staff was very nice to me the days I was doing security there I wish Advance auto parts warehouse will let me come back to do security there I want my job back
bad,"The only thing a person can say that applies to all of the Advance Auto Parts stores is that the hourly wage is extremely low for the vast majority of store employees. It is a documented fact that a person can typically earn more money working at a fast food restaurant, Wal-Mart, a gas station, etc."
bad,I will not advise anybody to work for advance for multiple reasons besides ice the way people get treated inside of the company mostly all lies plus the district manager will turn around try to accuse people of stuff. Plus you can work there as many as for 5 years and you will never get a raise when you try to actually ask for something like that they just give you the runaround. After you've been there for so long they will try to find a way to eliminate the person from employment. So suggestion don't even waste of time or do you have for applying for this company everything went downhill as soon as Carquest merge with advance.
bad,"This company cuts payroll so badly that it creates a stressful and hostile work environment and they expect each person to do the physical work of 3 men, all the while not getting paid any overtime. They don't care about the employees one bit and do not even entertain reports and/or feedback from team members or even customers."
bad,The management is very poor. They only hire minimum wage part time employees so they don't have to pay for employee benefits. Getting a raise is Not something they do because minimum wage is going up every year and they wont pay more then that.
bad,It’s an okay job just bit gettin paid for work we do ..working long hours then have to turn around and do the same over again with no sleep I jus want better in life
bad,This company will promise you everything then turn around and fire you ! I wouldn't work for them again for no amount of money etc. So if I was you I would stay away from this company.
bad,"this is not the job for me, slow paced environment and not enough hours of work, and you cant survive by working here. not enough room to stock inventory and every order gets misplaced"
bad,was worst job was never able to be home to see my family. had to work every weekend so could not take trips. and always had to work nights was never given opportunity to work mornings.
bad,place was not fun management was poor and rude. Hours are horrible no flexibility at all. Cant take vacations nothing place is a joke. Don’t apply at advance.
bad,upper management tells managers to over work employees and replace them. they know that they under pay associates and expect you to have open availability to earn a sub standard living wage.  false hopes are told about promotions only to have been told the position no long exist.
bad,"Don't bother applying. Poor pay, toxic work place, no team help. Better off working for Autozone or any other Auto parts store. Team members don't like helping each other."
bad,I worked for Advance Auto Parts for 3 years as a part-time employee they work me on average 33 hours a week and occasionally gave me a 25 or 24 hour week to keep me at part-time I was a key holder and one of the lowest paid individuals in the store there is no room for advancement the store I was working in there was three full-time employees none of which had a raise in The Last 5 Years or any promotion to move forward and they hadn't had the floors waxed in 8 years due to budget concerns company-wide.  The last manager I worked for was great but once you get to District manager and up you have some of the most uncaring individuals you can imagine and the turnover rate at corporate level is astonishing in the three years I've worked there I have had 3 district managers two regional managers and 3 store managers( at one point we went 6 months without a manager or district manager) by contrast when I worked at O'Reilly's I was there for on and off for 6 years and had the same Regional District and store manager every time..
bad,"Very little room for professional growth, Zero culture. If you are looking for a dead end job where people do not care about professionalism or desire to be better this is your calling."
bad,Getting to deal with which ever manager they could come up with to run the place. This company is a cartoon!! If your looking for no-brainer counter work this is the place for you.
bad,"absolutely terrible place to work, i tried everything to advance in the company. every time there was an excuse, i never once received a raise or more than 30 hours a week. i was trying to raise my son 7.52/hour REALLY!!!"
bad,Avoid this place like the plague. The worst senior/regional leadership I have ever experienced. They have no idea what they are doing. All of the higher leadership turnover reflects this. Do not work here.
bad,"I struggled here, manegment was no help. I woked 3 long hard years and was never noticed for my work ethics. I used to love my job here until I was treated horribly and tooken advantage of."
bad,"Advancement is poor and next to nothing, pay is poor your work is not appreciated and nepotism is the way for advancement if any."
bad,"very stress, management not the best,"
bad,Only one survey should be allowed on profile. Especially if the category is retail sales or if the time from the last place of employment is more than one year.
bad,it just bad. people every day get hurt and the ambulance is there every day. people take your stuff and management don't care. it is hot as heck and they treat you like you are in a prison. from the minute you get there all fenced in and metal detectors every where u go. pretty soon they will have someone walk with you to the bathroom and time u and watch you take a poo.
bad,The management that is suppose to run the day to day ops in non existant due to the district manger lack of work ethic and personal responsibility to take care of his employees.
bad,they don't give enough hours to properly run a store. they don't have any organization in anything they do.. they make you  work on your days off and if you dont they basically  tell you you dont have an option.
bad,"Hours are horrible, pays horrible, chances of advancing slim to none, promises to get a raise there’s a lot of those. Scheduling is almost non existent."
bad,"Found out very quickly that I would have rather been a customer than an employee. With everything that I was good at, was only getting one day a week there and only in the truck days, so the day that no one else wamted to do anything. Was only working like 4 hours every week which isn’t even enough money to put towards anything at all. Was hired as a part time person and that was working great until I was dropped down to one day a week..."
bad,"To work here you must be a yes man. Advance is looking for people to give their lives at any low cost and use them until closing time. Don't count on seeing family and count on applying for food stamps. "
bad,a greedy company with low pay and high stress would not recommend to anyone they treat people badly and do not care about there employees. very poor place to work.
bad,Stay away from this company bad bad bad all bad if your disabled or of age this place will not allow you to advance within the company they will ly to you promised the moon got the shaft everyone that has worked there
bad,"very unprofessional  , shrinkage was outstanding. inside thefts etc. do not recommended . management and corporate insufficient intellect English vocabulary"
bad,this is NOT a good place to work. Most management could care less about their employees. this is reflected by the pay rate and consideration of scheduling.
bad,"As with most companies now a days they pay you very little and expect you to do everything that a assistant manager does, a typical day at work is customers first, put up truck, keep and correct inventory, among many other tasks. What I learned is that an individual is not important, they can be replaced. Management is abused worse than the part time employee, they lie about everything. the workplace culture is diversified. The hardest part of the job is the customers come in with attitudes and almost always blame the person assisting them that their car is broke down, and management lying about everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to go home."
bad,Job started out really good.  After about a year we noticed a change in the direction AAP wanted to go.  They wanted cheap labor causing poor customer service.  Turn commercial into a retail world. Company force feeds you their values but practices none of them.  Don't waste your time unless you enjoy being a number and not a person.  They are failing as a company.
bad,Started out full time then new manager was hired and he cut us all down to 12 hours to bring in his friends. So i had no other choice but to find another job.
bad,"No support from district manager, agm created hostile environment. I tried to overcome these challenges. I did have two employees that tried to support me."
bad,"Had the management at the store I was working been better, my experience with Advance Auto probably would have been better. However due to the poor management my experience was very short lived and I regret even stepping foot inside that building. For instance I couldn't call out sick because I was not getting paid enough to afford a doctors visit. I asked the manager repeatedly to give me more hours as he claimed they were short handed but his only response was I didn't work hard enough. My advice for anyone interested in a career at Advance Auto parts is to check out your local O'Reillys auto parts as my experience with them was much better."
bad,"This is a company all about money and sales . Employees are disposable at any moment. If you are looking for a job to slack off and deal with lazy bosses who complain this is the place for you. If you want a future with good pay and benefits this is not the place for you. You will be promised hours with advancement .... it’s a lie they use you cut your hours and don’t want to raise your pay. CPP and GM positions with make 45,000 plus a year and do a quarter of the work. Will never work here or buy here again."
bad,"- A typical day at work is wearing many hats. You quickly learn your job title means nothing, be prepared to do everything in the store with no raise or advancement. "
bad,I love working on cars and being a mechanic but I hated this job there was severe favoritism and cut throat attitudes among employees and a severe lack of management or care for customers
bad,I was with Advance for 4 years and it was 4 years too many. Every day is chaos because someone is always calling in sick or not showing up for their shift. Forget about ever taking a lunch break or leaving when you're actually scheduled to leave. 4 out of the 5 general mangers that I had were terrible and completely unorganized. I would not recommend working for Advance Auto Parts in any position!
bad,my boss was very mean and rude to everyone it was not a good place at all to work. i left because i was relocating to colorado but this job is a job i would not reccomend
bad,No opportunity for advancement no matter how good of a worker you are.  The only people to get the positions they wanted slept with the managers.  Management and even GMs of the building get fired every month and still nothing improves.  It's a failing company and it will continue to fail.  Stock price already dropped by more than 50%.  The warehouse will shut down eventually.  Especially when certain employees are allowed to talk for half the day and not get in trouble.  The worst part is getting a .23 cent raise after a year of work once you hit $15.00 an hour.  It would take 5 years just to get to $16.00.
bad,i was never trained. I had to learn on my own or by watching previous management. poor management and a lot of favoritism. really regret working there.
bad,If you dont like to deal with people want to make real money or have a reasonable life dont work here.  The pay is so low the stress is not worth the little amount of money you make nor does it equate to the amount of time and work you put in
bad,"Just have nothing to say about this place, and wouldn't tell anyone to go there for a job. It's just something I wish to not talk about. Let's move on."
bad,"LET ME SEE..my work day is long...learned nothing..managment needs help..hardest is locating parts...enjoyable part is leaving..i worked for advance auto parts is elma ny...great to work for,untill i moved to florida.."
bad,"The good old boy system. It's all in who you know."
bad,"no advancement, no job security, bad management, unreachable goals, Company wants you to work your but off with little rewards for your efforts.cut your hours increase your workload. standard operating procure"
bad,"No room for advancement. "
bad,I stated as just dropping off parts to commercial customers and learned how to work the front counter to help everyone. My manager didn't care about his workers and could of cared less that I left.
bad,"Management tries to play team members against each other to create a toxic environment. There is no room for growth within the company, and management does not care about the employees. The wages are low, with no hope for raises."
bad,"high-turnover in District management.  disconnected, total lack of communication & support, lowballed on salary, lied to about hours and scope of work, all while providing iexcellent physical inventory accuracy for several years.  Not sure if this company can survive in the new online paradigm- they can't seem to get out of their own way."
bad,"they are notorious for eliminating positions, and leaving people high & dry that have been with the company for years. I was able to get out before the AAP/CQ merger, however a lot of people did not."
bad,In the last 12 years they have gone through 68 managers. Their is no accountability for the team members  if they complain enough about management  they can get them fired for enforcement of policies and procedures.
bad,"2 full time and 2 part-time employees were called thieves and all have left that store location. store manager and district manager have no intention of being there long term.  I was given an increase in wages equal to about 2%, sales goal increased by approximately 13%.. they had no plan to make 13% more customers into the store. I feel I was set-up to fail.. large turnover at this store ( not known if the same is company wide)."
bad,Company is more concerned about profits than with paying people and offering benefits in relation to the value the employees bring. Company overworks and under pays the general managers and pays minimum wage yet expects knowledgeable staff.
bad,"not a good place to work a lot of favoritism"
bad,Very unorganized work environment. Changed managers 3 times while I was employed there. We went a few months with no management. Other employees are favored more than others. I was fired over a company vehicle accident that I was not at fault for.
bad,Leadership sucks and there the benefits are very expensive you get two fifteen minutes breaks and an hour lunch over the course of an eight hour day maybe longer they expect for you to get a certain amount of pick that are pretty much out of reach even for a good worker
bad,"They just don't pay enough to clean toilette, sweep, mop and basically be a company slave for under 9.00 an hour. They expect alot but pay a very little."
bad,they cut off to much hours and ive seen 8 district managers in the past two years if you want to move up then this is not the job  for you and they promises too much but dont keep does promises
bad,"They will over work you and completely under pay you. Commercial parts pro barely makes 11 an hr. Management is horrible you can never get the right answers or a answer at all. They take full advantage of people who work hard and do more than required, they will then take all that extra work that you go out of your way to do, and make that your new requirement."
bad,Management had their picks! You could come to work all the time but the team members who would go home early all the time are the ones they cared about!
bad,long hours just a employee number subject to lay offs 8 dm in 3 years 4 vp 2 ceos no future get out before there sold again if employee calls in14 hour shift for you no hours to work
bad,The pay is horrible.  They will not do promotions.  Employees have a bad attitude.  The company does not care about employees.  If you work 2nd shift you have to work 10x harder than 1st shift and you get paid less.
bad,"This company will let you go for no reason: budget cuts, while managers and chiefs get top $$$$$$ only if you are friends with the top dog.  They layed off so many off.  Every since they purchased Car Quest several years, they have not recovered!"
bad,"worst job I ever had, by far the worst and most unfair manager/ boss I ever had in 50+years of working. hiurs were given out unfairly, the boss got personal if you said or did something he didn't like always with if you do that again you're fired. not enough to go around. he would have 2 drivers and one counter person and the commercial work barely needed one driver and the retail or counter work was backed up out door."
bad,"was a very slow paced place to work, you need to know about cars if you want to be successful.  You had a lot of down time, and had to stand all day. Was perfect for a retired person looking to make a little money."
bad,"As a delivery driver I answered the phone waited on customers worked holidays with no extra pay. Counter sales people make more than drivers but drivers were to do sales jobs. Management would take deliveries leaving drivers to do their job at a reduced rate of pay. Fowl language, dirty store, poor leadership"
bad,"It's was a fun work place and it was so much activities in the  retail also dealing with customer is new learing skill "
bad,Workers  complain.   Can't blame them since things are not done fair. Pay low.  No air condition on  floor go to the restroom you will get it there and  managers office. Fair NOT  !
bad,Mans world only. Sales quotas that were never attainable. Never enough payroll to do any job. Upper management could do or say anything to a female employee with out fear of repercussion.
bad,"was promised a full time position and then when it came time to give promote me to full time, 3 more employees where hired on at part time.  After that my hours were cut to 17.5 a week."
bad,"From experience, the pay is not worth it,  if your looking to pay bills. This job is only for some part-time person.  Unless you are certified,  you really don't stand a chance at good pay."
bad,"Bad management, bad work environment,and bad pay. Employees are asked to do a lot of work and maintain a certain ""rate"" while completing it. A lot of sketchy people are hired there, so dont get your hopes up of a lot of friendly interactions."
bad,"loved going to work everyday for 4 years, until one day in November  my life changed ...left me think about why I cared for the company, till this day I will never understand"
bad,they wanted employees to work on customers cars instead of being sales associates.  the manager had no consideration of his employees.  Manager would create rules but he himself would not follow through.
bad,"Very poor communication between shifts and management in general, inexperienced management, very unorganized and un-safe workplace, and very difficult to manage life balance with this company"
bad,This corporation has made it a policy to employ low pay low experience (if any at all) workforce. Mid-level management is endless revolving door of career hopefuls who resign from the position and company due to its relentless practice​ of giving little and expecting more and more and more. I would not recommend this job to anyone looking for longevity in a career and company.
bad,I am seeking to obtain a great entry level position with a stable company where I have the possibility for advancement and learning new skills. new place.
bad,Nothing good at all to say about the company. There was absolutely no work/life balance and upper management as well as HR ignores complaints from employees.
bad,This is one of the worst places to work. employees are treated like trash. Everything works against employees especially junior staffs and no benefits at all.
bad,"worked at a southside location in milwaukee, was treated disrespectfullly by employees as well as the clients several times. oi9i woukldnt recommend this workplace to anyone"
bad,They treat there employees like second class citizens act like your just lucky to have a job. Got promoted 3 time didn't get a single raise doesn't pay and wants the world from you worst upper management I have ever experienced pays junk
bad,"I would not ever go back to this company. I worked there for a few months and was sexually harassed by an asst manager, and when i reported it to my manager, he said there was nothing he could do. "
bad,"Hard work for little pay. the managers are hard to communicate with. They have their favorite picks. a lot of drama in the work environment"
bad,Stock is falling for a reason.  Low company morale across the ranks combined with terrible management equals disaster.  Needs a complete overhaul to produce meaningful change.  Expect the stock price to continue to go down because of the internal issues at this place.
bad,"I learned about cars and enjoyed the mix of cashiering, stocking and inventorying.  I met a lot of people that I still see and greet whenever I am out."
bad,"No professionalism found with Advance Auto parts management team, staff members were few and hardly trained or keep for a good period of time. "
bad,management sucks no movement in company managers are like children district and store ones yelled at for everything even things others do wrong would never work there again for nothing
bad,"words cant describe my experience, rather do as i was taught, if you dont have something nice to say dont say anything at all."
bad,"The overall company is a great company to work for. They care about their customers and employees, except for one location that i have experienced. Management abuses power and rewards friends, while taking away from the locations dedicated employees."
bad,"I worked at advance for 14years continually giving them a chance and always failed me. they don't care about the people. They want to make a dollar off every penny. Stressful, poor pay, and they don't fire people (managers) that harass, and abuse there employees"
bad,"Good place to work. Hours were weird but i did work 35 "
bad,"good people bad management , unstable working hours , never knowing when your going to go home , increased work load due to constant employee turn over , no compensation"
bad,I only worked 3 days a week  threw a temp agency and i couldn't pay my bills so i left and found another job i love to work with the public and hands on
bad,Assist customers with purchases and delivery need. No good management. No discipline of any other employees when something harmful happens. Learn about things with engines.
bad,This place can never get fully staffed because of a 67% turn over rate. They expect you to work 12-13 hours a day in a hot dirty environment. You are expected to pull the work load for the employees that are out. Constantly running reports and demanding that you work harder and faster. No family time due to long hours and the pay sucks. Management sucks. Avoid like the plague!!
bad,"Too strict on attendance  policy,  I was using sto  time and still getting bitched at because my son was in and out of Indy hospital and they complained that I was using them too fast.  My opinion is who cares,  as long as their getting an excusable use then it should be fine.  Management was horrible communication was worse and the gossip  between everyone made the environment not worth working for anymore.  I'm a lot less stressed now!"
bad,"I have applied to this company NUMEROUS times in the past 3 months this add was up ! Along with other friends of mine ! Despite numerous calls left for the so called District Manager about the status of my application, NO CALLS WERE RETURNED ! When I finally talked to somone who was to be the manager, they said they haven't made a decision yet. WHAT ? After 3 months you don't know what you're doing ??"
bad,"Advance auto parts was at one time many years back, a great place to work. Over the last 8yrs this company has gone down hill by treating the employees like garbage, making many leave or getting fired for not meeting sales goals. This company does not want to pay a competitive wage, expects you to do the work of three people and with constant schedule changes. The stores have no hours making being short staffed a common problem. Sales are the only thing this company cares about, make the shareholders happy? really? Look at your stock prices. The old adage of hire good people and good things happen does not apply to Advance Auto Parts. They want cheap people to sell their cheap parts, to cheap customers. Wow, what progress. Take the millions of dollars your CEO makes in bonus and stock options every year and put some into your employees, good people do not stick around when treated like trash."
bad,"I would deliver parts, check parts in, answer front counter phones, and help front counter customers.  I did not like working for this company, as the co-workers were always talking about people behind their backs.  The hardest part about this job was the heavy lifting"
bad,Employees are over worked and underpaid especially if you are a female. I worked and more then earned my due and was passed up for full time which I had already been promised and the position was given  to a new hire who had no experience with the company simply because he was a man. General manager and district manager showed no loyalty to their employees or customers
bad,Middle management has yet to explain my current or any future position in over 9 months at my current site.  Makes multiple promises and never comes through.  People with any special skill sets are ignored for those that drone along and follow blindly.
bad,I liked working at advance but the manager was horrible. She was rude to the employees and the customers. She made the job the absolute worst!
bad,"I've worked for this company for a number of years. Since the take over it has gone down hill and fast. The manager should not be a Manager he is lacking people skills. This company is for money money money. If you want to go to school do not apply!!! Favoritism is horrible. We have people who work their rears off while the tattle tales and non union people stand around talking to supervision. The management will yell at each other because they are not doing their own work, they also talk about and put down fellow co-workers. Most people that I work with (WORK) are awesome people. This company is a one-sided company and only listen to management everyone else will just be blowing hot air. I DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE."
bad,"Stressful place to work, store manager has no people skills, and  lacks communication. Some co-workers are back 2 faced and back stabbers. It's a hostel work place, tension is felt from other delivery drives coming to pick up parts.  Best part was to get my parts and leave and be gone must of the day."
bad,If you enjoy customer service and are knowledgeable about cars and pay isnt a big issue this is the job for you. enjoyable team members
bad,"Its extremely simple work for the most part, replacing batteries, selling parts, and suggesting products."
bad,"I worked at Auto Zone for over 6 years and was approached to come work for Advance Auto Parts as a Asst. Store Manager at a 30% higher pay rate than I was making at AZ. I took the job and was told I'd have to work for $10.00 per hour for the first 30 days, then the raise would kick in. First check I received at the ""30%"" turned out to be only 20%!! When the store manager and I contacted the DM and asked him what was going on, he denied approving a 30% raise and said he only agreed to 20%!!! Grrrrrr! I made the mistake of leaving a good company (Auto Zone) to come work for Advance. Avoid this company at all costs!!"
bad,"This place was awesome for about a month then it went totally downhill.  I understand that retail jobs have different hours based on need, but this was out of hand.  Not only did they require you to work set schedules with no room for change regardless of your personal life, there was absolulty no help from upper management. I requested time off, it was approved, then the day before it was revoked so that my manager could have it off. No district and regional manager cared that this occured. I was basically at the whim of my manager. Schedule hours were changed without notice. Procedures were violated constantly to appease the managers mood that day. It was a complete joke."
bad,"I worked at the Hobart , Indiana store as a manager, and they will lie about everything just to make you happy but not me I told this company to take this job and stick it up your butt"
bad,"Very Low Pay, Store Management very inconsistent. One Store Manager could be excellent to work for and the other had to be reported for embezzlement. What benefits company does make available are terrible and not worth the exorbitant amount you are required to pay for them.  Very little corporate support."
bad,A lot of tension between operations and human resources.  There is no clear vision or goals.   Senior leadership has a shoot from the hip mentality.  Training is virtually non-existent and what training there is in done by poorly trained team members.  Senior leadership does not value their team managers or department level managers.  There is also a lack of respect for middle and lower management by the senior leadership.
bad,"While working with this company, I didn't feel welcomed, coworkers,supv. management wouldn't even say good morning.layoff without any notice."
bad,"The Finance Organization is in complete disarray. There is absolutely ZERO leadership or strategic vision. People are used as trading chips. They will hire you knowing they are going to fire you in the same month or within the same year solely for the benefit of the ""long-time"" employees - to avoid laying them off."
bad,The management staff at this location was one of the worst that I have ever seen. Managers didnt care about their jobs or their subordinates either.
bad,"a typical day is to work your but off maintain sales goal and busy work for low pay. ive been in the parts business for 30 years, worked at NAPA, PEP BOYS, BIG A, AND ADVANCE AUTO. I learned that ADVANCE WAS BY FAR THE WORSE PLACE I EVER WORKED.I enjoyed the parts business until advance. they made me dread every day. management are nothing but brown nosing pencil pushing yes men. the higher up the ladder you go the worse it gets. co workers were over worked, under paid and usually uneducated about cars. the hardest part of the job was corporate b s and the fact that adv would rather hire from Lowes or Walmart for management than promote from with in. the most enjoyable part of the job was quitting"
bad,Not a very good company to work for. Over worked and under paid. nothing good about this place. beaware and work here at ow risk
bad,"Advance Auto Parts has a long way to go.  They need to cut their executives and focus more on their employees.  They do not help their employees to grow or succeed. They only focus on their shareholders and they do not provide any leadership or direction.  Most of the executives do not know the jobs they are in charge of and can't help their direct reports with simple request.  Direct reports are forced to go to other departments to get the information needed in order to complete the tasks they are given.  Advance Auto Parts could be a great company, however, until they change the way they perceive their employees they will not get sales back on track. ""People buy from people, if they see the staff is unhappy, they will not purchase from you, they will go elsewhere!"""
bad,"I was a good worker and was promised 40 hrs. A week, and got 8 hrs. A month. You have to pass a 85 questions text before they hire you. Everone plays boss with you. It's easier getting a job at nasa. No free lunch here. So they fired me.."
bad,Poor Upper Management and they really don't value customers or employees.  Each day starts and ends with poor organization and lack of real Management.
bad,"no leadership ,no comunication , management ,they just put any body in. no training,ect: RM useless DM useless most of all HR dont think they  have one !"
bad,"Not the best places to work, unless you like being treated like you are replaceable. Their values on their team members have gone down significantly. They are trying to be something they are not. Decent if you are just a part time driver, anything management and you can not have a life and you get treated like they own you because you are salary."
bad,"Run away from this company, No Job security . Long term employees are mistreated . Constant mistakes in benefits . Typical workday is no breaks unless you love your cell phone , Management needs to be terminated , Co workers were ok to work with . Most enjoyable was helping people get what they need ."
bad,"Not being recognized for knowledge of the industry"
bad,"I have worked for this company TWICE, my first time which was at the store on Pantops, was amazing I worked for them for 2 years and made 10.50/hr as a cashier. The other store I worked for actually put this particular job posting up (Store 2370; Shoppers World Shopping Center). The post stated it was the option of part time and full time but when I went in for the interview it was ONLY part time. Also when I was hired I was asked to do things that were out of my responsibilities as a driver and I was NOT getting paid the correct wage(8.25/per hr) to do these side jobs, even when I requested a pay raise because of the Extra work I was turned down. On top of it ALL I was dealing with harassment from at least three of the men that work there, one being a manager and I AM A LADY."
bad,"IT was not Good and i only dealt with it due to the pay. It was not good. It was not good. It was not good. It was not good, but it inspired me to want more."
bad,It was crazy there. I got written up my first week out of training for something I wasn't taught in training. It seems as though the company cares more for its stockholders than employees.
bad,"Lack of training for new employees."
bad,"Advance is all about more work for less cost to the company - impressing the shareholders. No positive feedback, infrequent and very small pay raises (altho, I have gotten some), low pay scale. Most new hires are only there until they find a better job and turn-over is very high."
bad,"Every day I went too work there it honestly felt like I was the only one working. Horrible management, terrible work environment, terrible co-workers, the only positive thing I can say about is assisting the commercial customers."
bad,Have already wrote a review on advance auto parts. Stop worrying about how much money the top needs to make and focus on the employees a little more. You pay for what you get in the automotive industry.
bad,"Poor upper management, does not give opportunity for growth, Region Vice Presidents think using a hammer on your head is a strong form of leadership even when you are leading in metrics it is an extremely negative environment. Do not ever join this organization they ""talk"" about having values, but do not actually ""live"" or have them especially in the Midwest."
bad,"everyone in work place was friendly and everything but when come to hours they keep cut down each time, i only had a max of 20 hours or less a week which it was bad pay."
bad,"No advancement opportunities and even when you are supposedly offered advancement, it is in ""title"" only. No pay increases. This company does not like to give any increases in pay, but they expect you to make lots of money for them. It's all about the ""bottom line"" as they say."
bad,"This job involves a lot of micromanagement as well as low pay and dead end outcome. everyone is a manager and assistant manager, but you. the only way you move up in position and in chump change raise is if you are liked by the GM or Asst Mng.                                    you have to work like a slave for a lousy 8$ Hr and once you have years of working then only then maybe you might advance to a higher position and a poor raise.  I am pretty sure there is a lot of 8$ hrs paying jobs out there, but do yourself a favor a find something better in pay and respect yourself.                                                    No one here will and lets not forget everyone is chewing each others head off just to make sales in which you do don't even get anything at the end, its just a way to put pressure on you and make constant Threats  for you to meet their quota if not u get fired. Its all about money here and not the customer. just out to get e'm"
bad,"I worked for this company for about 7 months, the management was very irresponsible in teaching the workers on what to do work on during down time. I was told upon hire the only thing I had to work on was delivering parts to shops in town on time. Other workers caused borderline harrassment behaviors."
bad,"I worked there only 6 months, management was awful, they say theyll take care of your but they dont. I wouldnt advise no one to work there"
bad,"Poor Management, unorganized management, staff did not work as a team"
bad,Worst job I've ever had. I worked with a district leader who was a corporate bully.  Although I did not work directly for the district leader he found ways to make my life miserable for no particular reason. He did have a history of burning through commercial account managers of spanish speaking descent. I was recruited to position. Accepting this job was by far the worst mistake I ever made.
bad,Very unprofessional and a hostile work environment and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. Management doesn't know how to be managers.
bad,Expect to much from employees for very little pay. No set schedule. Can't make plan for anything.
bad,Would not even recommend working for this company to my enemies.  The only consistencies were job threats.
bad,Too much of my peronsal business was going around the store.
bad,"dont ever work there, terrible compensation as well as advancement opportunities"
bad,This company runs by silly little rules that make sense to absolutely no one.  If you just want a tiny paycheck go ahead and work here but treat every day as your last.
bad,"if you are a pregnant female they give you 30 days unpaid leave and then terminate you if you cant return to work at the 30 day mark regardless when/if the baby was born, and  then deny your unemployment stating you resigned/quit willingly even if doctor order states different. At least 3 women were treated this way in a matter of months."
bad,this company did not appreciate it employees it was the worst company I worked for but we are also talking bout 20 years ago
bad,boring place to work did not have an action plan so not people friendly
bad,"no team work, togetherness and bad management from General Manager."
bad,"I quit ...this place is unstructured, unorganized, theft is a huge problem that Advanced Auto employees get blamed for, and the managers are completely unorganized, and the costumers are always so rude. They treat you like you are lower than low.... "
bad,Not a good location to work for 18hr a day went threw 3gm within a year
bad,I worked for this company for 3 yrs and most of the time i had to do my job and the job of others. Another thing is when the company wants to cut hours they cut everyones hours and dosnt wanna explain why.
bad,"Way under paid!!! I was there 3 yrs and made it to $11. You work very long hours on Monday and they cut your hours the rest of the week so you do not get any overtime. Management is very poor. No leadership skill, must be a requirement to be a supervisor here. No respect either."
bad,after 2003 the company only sees a number and not a person.  They just gave up on taking care of the employee to make them feel comfortable and want to stay.
bad,your average minimum wage job. its a job thats all i can really say.
bad,We sold auto parts and assist customers with all other accessories associated with vehicles. Management is hectic and reflects negatively on employees.
bad,"This company is motivated by one thing, money. It is not a family friendly place to work, and the hours, shifts, and flex time offered my family and I prior to being hired have not been kept. Last week they failed to provide the minimum amount of hours required to maintain my position. This has been a huge let down as I have both a wife and son with disabilities but am prevented from being home after my son returns from school more than any other manager on payroll at our location. I would not recommend this company to anyone as my managers as well as my district manager refuse to address their policy and reserve the right to change said policy at will, for the sake of the business of course."
bad,"I worked there for two years, and every day my job was threatened by management. No matter what I did, no matter how I tried to improve, nothing was good enough to earn praise from my General Manager. Everything was done incorrectly and was ridiculed."
bad,working with other was fine. salary wasn't well but met new people.
bad,"deliver parts, stock shelves, answer phones communicate with commercial customers as to service, parts accuracy, delivery times, any possible future shop stock  they may need, return any core, defective or unneeded parts, ensure all returns are documented and returned to store for customer credit"
bad,"Its an okay place to work. Very hard to get a job advancement placedment with this job. Minimum wage pay and very few hours if you come on as a part timer. Typically you spend your day driving around some parts form one place to another, and if the jobs have a problem with one another you havde a hard time doing your job."
bad,"Positive, fun place to work at but hours are limited.Everyone work hard, i interact with customer deliver parts and collect cash."
bad,i enjoyed the clients here. Due to medical reason I had to resign.
bad,"A lot of talk. Don't live up to their core value statements, everyone is expendable. Employees get a 20% discounts on parts which at first seems like a pro; then one quickly realizes walk-ins and commercial accounts get far deeper discounts just by knowing the managers name or making a small complaint."
bad,Slow pace job with minimal pay and room for advancement if no prior automotive experience on the management side.
bad,"Never enough staff to let you as a GM do your job spend most of time being a cashier not a manager.  Regional leadership is sub par to say the least, with no direction other then hit you numbers with less then yui had to work with last year.  Company is very unstable at this time."
bad,A very busy and steady day at work.
bad,good place to workvery frendliy and good for advancement
bad,• Direct report of all part-time employees
bad,"I had just had my daughter, and my husband was deployed. When I returned from maternity leave I was told I was going to have to work every other Saturday 4 hour shifts each. With my husband being deployed and no daycare open I asked if it could start in 6 months when my husband returned, the district manager told me to find some friends and figure it out. way to be compassionate for a new Mother with a deployed husband. 56 hours that would have been what I missed."
bad,A typical day at work includes spending most of the day dusting shelves and sweeping floors because of the low customer flow through the store.
bad,"Learned office and clerical duties, was in charge of special receiving project. Had a good team work environment."
bad,"My daily routine was to help customers, assign daily tasks and ensure that they were completed."
bad,"First off I just started and there is no training what so ever. I am a mechanic and was suppose to work in the commercial department. Never happened. I had a chance to move closer to my house, better money, and working in commercial. I was all excited but the the DM said no. I wish I had something good to say about them but I don't. I did gain some good friends. My sales were great, customers new me by name, and have everything to prove it. After all that they laid me off. Now I will have to collect unemployment."
bad,"I liked Advance at first, but after being there a while it seems like you can never do anything good enough for the company. There really wasn't a part of the job that was hard, it was just making the company happy. I was management, and I loved it, I loved the customer service aspect of the job. I learned a lot about cars while working there and I learned a lot of customer service there as well."
bad,"I have never managed in this type of environment before and its quite challenging. Most of my previous management I assumed the role of ""coach"" and deligated tasks to associates etc. My success or failure was determined by how the store performed. At Advance your success or failure is determine by your personal sales goal. Thus in low volume stores..in order for the manaager to reach his/her goal..they must either heavily deligate all tasks or knock other associates out of the way. Now this causes the other store associates to flash red on their goal objectives...leading to heavy turnover. Now the kicker is..the personal goals are not based on previous store revenues...but on a universial sales figure for everyone holding a particular position."
bad,"not much care about their employees,very expendable to them.lots of talking dreams but none coming true."
bad,Help Customers
bad,Under payed employees and no benefits for part timers. Had a payroll dispute that was never resolved.
bad,Very hectic workplace with little chance of advancement or job security.
bad,They are slave driver u go in to work and u never know when you was going to get off .THEY PLAY FAVORISM WITH THERE EMPLOYEE LIvEs I work there 6 yrs and got bypass on a promotion everytime. but i train almost the hold shipping department
bad,I worked at Advance for almost 2 years. The benefits were too expensive and they do not value their employees.There is alot of mistrust with the management.There is no job security and it is very hard to advance your career.
bad,"I went in to this company with 25 years experience in the automotive industry. Started as a GM, paid a fair wage, and promised the world. After three months payroll gets cut for winter business, everyone is just a number and I am asked to cut hours of those who already struggle from paycheck to paycheck. Guess who covers those hours which makes 50 hr work week sometimes 60 plus and close to 70 at times? I have never worked for a company who cares so little about their own employees."
bad,"Company is a typical corporation where the only focus is sales, sales, sales. Miss your numbers and your job becomes in jeopardy. Management plays favorites. No room for advancement if you don't play ""the game."""
bad,"I worked as an AGM then GM of 2 different Advance Auto Parts. I understand protocol and procedures, but also try to make the workplace a place that is safe and enjoyed by my employees while still getting things done with a sense of urgency- prompting my employees to work quickly and efficiently while also enjoying the time spent at work and providing the best customer service possible."
bad,Used to be a good place to work other than the pay and forget about benefits you can't afford them on what they pay. The employee discount used to be decent but they eliminated that to improve sale numbers.
bad,Sit around and put parts on a shelf then talk to a customer try to figure out what they need and get them the proper part. Most of the time you are looking for windshield wiper blades and lights.
bad,I worked here for four years and was doing the work of a store manager and getting paid as an associate was promised I would be a store manager if I traveled to other stores to help and then ended up in a store with a new manager that had no autopart knowledge or any experience in the industry my district manager Troy turcotte lied about pay increases and promotions to make me go to other stores to fix stores that were disgraceful I was also expected to train store manager that had no experience but basically did his job do to lack of support from district manager
bad,It was great but in the last 10 years it has went down hill. Lost ethics and have terrible upper management. They keep adding tasks and cutting hours and pay and not updated the technology.
bad,Not only did they hire everyone and their mother for a position before me and promote them instead of moving me up but this happened at all stores. Management is horrible. We didn't keep a GM for more than a few months and I was there for almost 3 years. I finally had enough when I was pregnant and they refused to work with me on anything. They even went as far as to (when I was 36 weeks along. Move me to a store that was over an hour away for no reason and cut my hours down to  maybe a 3 hours shift 3 times a week if I was lucky. At the time I was full time and supposed to have a minimum of 32 a week.
bad,Dirty stores. Poor work life balance. Atrocious staffing. Internal theft gets ignored. Zero support from clueless district manager. 50 hour minimum salaried position realistically 60 +.
bad,"Worked for over a year. Promised one thing, received the opposite. General manager doesnt know how to treat customers and or employees. Doesn't understand that people have a life outside of work."
bad,General manager and manager are both very messy. They started problems with team members. General manager will take you off the schedule for weeks at a time if she was mad with you or in her feelings about something. You could be dying and the general manager will still try to get you to leave your hospital bed 2 come to work because she didnt want 2 stay a minute longer then she had to. If management was better working there wouldnt be so depressing.
bad,"As a employee at advance auto parts and high school student. At first I was supper exited to join the team. It would be my first real job, I was only 18 and full of energy and I realized there was true room for advancement within the company. I got offered a promotion within 3 months of working but as time went on. I soon realized I was the only person aside from the management team truly working and truly passionate on growing the team. I also realized the amount of drama that there was on the job. If you are a people person don’t get this job because you will soon realize how harsh people are and how rude customers are and with the extremely low wages and absurd policies you will realize it is not even worth the time.  Please do your self a favor and not work for advance."
bad,"mediocre place to work, they hire anybody even those with emotional issues making it a hard place to function. Management just needs to be able to breath not function."
bad,"Use to be a great company. Those with seniority are cast aside. No longer are ""people our best part"". They transfer or rehire just to fill a spot. No longer a company with integrity!!!"
bad,"There was no training for me coming in as a GM coming from 23 years in the restaurant business. Been with the company for 7 months now and i can't catch up because the company failed me from the start. Had i known there was no form of GM training, i would have never left my prior job. It's just a mess here and i'm so very unhappy"
bad,"Not a job that I would recommend, horrible management and horrible HR."
bad,"This multimillion dollar corporation is everything that is wrong with America. They pay poverty wages forcing their employees to apply for welfare to pay rent. I asked for a raise to a livable wage, and the district manager told me that “paying a living wage is not something we do here.” They don’t care about their customers, and they care even less for their employees. It’s a profit over people corporation... See ya."
bad,Management is a joke.  Lack of true leadership.  O'Reilly Auto parts is a much better ran company and advancement opportunities are better there also.  I have worked for both companies.  In my area I would not work for Advance.
bad,The hire mangers from the outside. I wouldn’t recommend working for this company unless your wanting to be a teacher to a manger they hired from the outside.
bad,Had a third key level tell customers to f off and the store manager didn't do anything but give my my third and final write up for attempting to write up said employee.
bad,A typical day at work would be to handle the material on the forklift. I learned how to use different kind of forklift machines at advance auto parts.
bad,"10 years ago was a great company to work for. In the last 3 years it went down hill. Upper management is the worst part. No communication or very poor communication. Hours used to be great, then new management thought would be better to stay later stood around for hours doing nothing, very boring"
bad,"Advance Auto parts was an ok place to work, the customers kept me entertained, more insightful than the workers. They train you on the computer and neg"
bad,Totally not worth working there you get paid minimal pay of 9/hour and usually not given days and the general managers are always looking for ways to cut hours so that the parts pros get more hours
bad,"Starts off short staffed and unable to hire, comminictions with upper management are not open and truthful. Learning is mostly computer oriented with no follow up from next level mangement. Long work hours for management 12 plus hours daily sometimes 7 days per week. Salary for position is not competiive."
bad,"speed perks, get customer email or we will fire you, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that."
bad,My last supervisor was just a joke. I never got any time off that I had requested. I was always there if some one called in but all the new people got their time off approved. I was in a supervisor role making 9.34 an hour while new hires were making a dollar more than me.
bad,It's retail. You deal with grumpy customers all day long. You are not selling wants you are selling needs. It's not very often that you get someone coming in that is happy to be there. If they are there then they have a problem with their car.
bad,"On a typical day as a General manager you open the store and are alone from 6:30 to 3:30 on the retail side and still required to complete more than an hour of paperwrok. Even when you accomplish your sales goals, its not uncommon for you district leader to call you and ask why you didnt get more even though you hit your sales goal. Advance just recently changed their culture but didnt follow through with it. The hardest part of this job is being paid salary and working 80 plus hours a week because advance doesnt give the stores enough hours to barely function. The best part of the experience was the team meambers I hired and the customers, selling parts and helping with their problems."
bad,"Worked for 2 years and was passed up on promotion twice, an then the last six months I was forced to deliver parts to commercial accounts resulting in my sales and sign ups lowering. Then forced to me to switch to a full time driver and lowered my hours to 4 hours a week, working in 30 min increments.  The corporate only cares about sign ups for programs, and the management are incompetent enough not to stand up for there employs."
bad,Only sees employees as numbers not people. they tend to only care about money and not their employees lives or anything to that effect. moving up in this company is a joke.
bad,"Too many hours are demanded for minimal pay. On line competition is growing daily. Difficult to attract new employees. Bad reputation of senior leadership."
bad,"You will be lied to consistently. You will be blamed for things you didn’t do. You will have no support from management. If you’re full time, you’ll practically live there for a small check. If you’re part time...you would make more money at McDonald’s. You’ll be expected to be a salesman. Not a cashier, not a driver/delivery person, a salesman. I was told “the people in this business that get the pay and the hours hustle on their off time to bring business to the company”. If that’s what you’re looking for, it’s the job for you! But I personally can “hustle” for MYSELF and make a lot more income."
bad,"I don't advise anyone to work there. Advance should be a job for high schoolers. They are no benefits unless you are a full time manager, and they always hired outside people the whole time I worked there."
bad,"The average day at Advanced Auto Parts is to have customers question your answers, even after you have researched their needs in Advanced computer system, after you have given them the answer? Dealing with unequal, unfair and biased management. If you are to use their open door policy, your hours the next week get cut in half? The prices of the product that they sale, are high, (in the top ten in auto retailers), yet the management is constantly pushing for more sales to the customers? The employees are under paid for their experience, yet the company wants extremely qualified employees to answer all the customers questions?The one and only perk for working at Advanced Auto is the discount on parts; but in most cases the on-line offers are better than employee discounts. If you are a high school kid who needs an after school job, I would recommend McDonald's and for get auto parts retail."
bad,"Worked part time for just over 2 years and have only one raise ($.25) Pay is horrible. Would not consider this entry level since you need computer skills and parts knowledge to work here. Upper management sucks. Completely useless. Have seen people turned in for misconduct and no action taken against them. Driver job is apparently part OR full time, which I was not informed of when I was hired in. I have had numerous other drivers hired underneath me who have less experience and been given full time hours, whereas, I have never one time been offered full time. You can also work 10 hr days and be given 30 minute lunch, which can be cut short if an commercial acct calls and demands their parts now and you have to deliver due to short staffing that day(which short staffing happens often) If any other store is like this, dont bother applying. Unhappiness is guaranteed."
bad,"Would not recommend this job, the company only thinks of you as a number and not a person. What they will reward other employees for doing they will quickly tell you to help but then just as quickly terminate your employment."
bad,"This position was the first time I had been written up.  When I gave my notice a week later, you would have thought I shot the manager.  I had been in auto parts for years, this place killed it for me.  This place is only 25 miles from my home.  I have never been back to that town and told my co-workers to never find me on social media."
bad,When I was working here the district manager demoted me with out telling me and I was taken advantage of my hard work. I was skipped over for advancement in the company and even had the manager tell me my education and experience did not matter to him. So I wasted 4 years of my life in a company that does not care about their employees. look at the employee next time you go in they are very unhappy.
bad,"I have learned over the years I worked with this company, that management/ employees do not get the job done the right way. Very disappointed with the management that is working for that company. The benefits for discount parts is the worse. Not that great! It was mainly not that great of a company to work for. Every disappointed with the company and other people I know feel the same way. I would not recommend this company to anyone that is looking for a job."
bad,"Operations manager literally asked me to hide over picks and strays because a VP was coming, he asked me to hide them on a trailer and put it in the yard."
bad,The work environment is fun but the managers only look out for themselves and don't help employees advance when they ask. I've wasted 3 years with this company and they won't do anything to help their employees.
bad,"Advance Auto Part Distribution(Gastonia) is a awful place to work for! I am one of those people who will give a job a chance and give my best. This place does even care about your best. All they see is a number. They DO NOT care about their employees. The management from the GM to the warehouse managers are a joke. they run that place like a high school. If you are looking for job security, you will not find it at the AAPD in Gastonia NC."
bad,Company is poorly managed. With little pay and next to no advancement. The location I work for does not respect company policies and procedures or personal off the clock time and days off.
bad,Huge turn over rate !! Beware ! Too many chiefs and very few Indians . Micro managed is an over statement . This place is definitely a member of the good d ol boys club .Hosile environment if you disagree with the higher ups . Job descriptions change on a whim .
bad,I have worked for auto zone and advance and definitely would recommend working and shopping with auto zone. schedule was never done properly managers were lazy and uninterested.
bad,"Racist, back stabbing, bad management, etc.!  You never knew when you were getting off. You would finish your job and they would send you somewhere else to finish somebody else's job.  No teamwork."
bad,I started as an assistant GM at advance auto and I did not enjoy my time.  It was frustrating work both dealing with the angry garages and angry home mechanics.
bad,"They don't care about the people that work there, enforce rules for some but not all and lecture you when you use your days off they give you"
bad,"Terrible unstable management all about themselves and out for themselves, does not care one bit about employees and is a horrible work environment with overtime called all the time with no warning as if people had no lives or other obligations."
bad,"Very political not a good place for a woman to work.Woman are subjected to harassment daily from customers and employees/employers. No chance for advancement if you are not part of the ""the click"". Upper Management does not follow their owns Standard Operational Procedures."
bad,"The commercial parts ""pro"" uses a personal cell phone throughout the day for personal calls on company time. Drivers are belittled and a cover your butt attitude and the numbers is all mid level management cares about. They provide practically no training and write up and fire employees at leisure to cover there own shortcomings. I hope Advance crashes and burns. Its the very worst place to work in the auto parts industry, period. There are countless returns for cheap defective parts daily. The list goes on."
bad,"No support from management. You can be a superstar one day, the next day your dead to them. They never have a consistent process on how to conduct business. They are constantly chasing tails and making changes on their game plan because nothing seems to work and it affects the employees moral and interest in thier jobs. They went through a massive job layoff and the deciding factors on which they based the affected team members was unfair and only in their best interest. They let go of team members who dedicated 12 years of service so this comes to show how low job security is. I would never refer anyone to this type of work environment, and chances of moving up in the ladder is ALL political."
bad,As a GM my days were 10-12 hours.  Stores are very limited in their hours. Management team is not given enough time to manage stores and do work required. I do not know one GM that does not put in 20 hours of his own personal time each week to keep their store running. Company says it want 50 hours for a store manager and expects minimum of 70 hours for the store manager to be there. Company has a intended turn over rate of 40 % for its store managers and if they can't drive you out after 5 years they will send a audit team in and find a reason to fire you... then black list you so you can't get another job as a store manager. proven when I personally did a employment check on myself.
bad,"I was not there long, but working here will burn you out. Not only does this place NOT pay a livable wage, but for what they pay you they expect you to do 8 different things at once. And the rude people that come expecting a ""now"" attitude."
bad,Worse job ever. 15 hours a week winter months write you off schedule
bad,To many hours worked and not enough people to cover the shift wich is the reason for all of the on called for overtime
bad,There was to much change and not enough people know what they are doing.
bad,I worked for advance for three years. It took me three years to get a $.50 raise. They don't listen to their employees at all. There is way too many chiefs and not enough Indians. The only part that was good about this job was the connections I made in the auto world. 
bad,I would not recommend anyone with parts knowledge working here. The only way to get promoted is to work at Lowes before hand. They have not promoted a single store manager out of a store in 7 years. It makes since that they are failing because the district manager came from a store manager spot at Starbucks and her husband works at Lowes. Best pay cut I have ever taken!!
bad,"THIS IS THE MOST TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!! Not one person cares about you there, you cannot advance at all, the bosses do not represent themselves at all, work tons of overtime for no appreciation!!! Cannot point out a policy guideline if you did wrong!!! They do not care about there people!!!"
bad,one of the worst places to work.They hire bodies who will work for cheap wage hardest part of job is trying to wait on customers answer phone install bateries in the rain with no cover or in the cold with 3 employees in the store.
bad,"y work day consist of being versatile, you have to be a people person and good with customer a mulititasker because you will be doing a ot of different things. My co workers are ok, management could do alot better, my job is not hard at all"
bad,"The company offered good benefits and decent pay, but managers and supervisors did not follow all safety practices and procedures to keep employees safe."
bad,A typical day at work may consist of e-mails and business review as early as 6 Am and completion of field notes and pre-plan for following day at 10 PM or later.
bad,To me the company only cares about one thing and that is making a dollar. They do not value their employees. The management was the worst I have ever worked for.
bad,Very poorly ran company. Too much top heavy with too many leaders all having ideas to follow. restricts you from leading your orginization. As best said by a peer of mine...determine what the leaders are expectating today work on them forget the others. Will change daily.
bad,"The company itself has no plan on beating the competition, but rather try to match O'Reilly's and Autozone's philosophies, but fail there as well. In the end, employees suffer for it with lack of hours, lack of man power. Stripping away resources like actual parts and delivery vehicles to make profits. The company that used to believe in ""service is our best part"" decided to ditch the motto for ""shareholders are more important""."
bad,Just racially motivated unfair standards for certain people. The same rules dont apply to everyone just the ones they like. I wasnt in with the crew so I was treated poorly
bad,"Would have appreciated consideration for working hard, trying to get along with bipolar coworkers, and actually getting full time (or close to it) like I was told I would in the beginning."
bad,One of the companies beliefs is to champion inclusion. This actually doesn’t happen and employees or their input aren’t really valued. There’s a logjam within the warehouse. Once you hit the bottom of management there’s nowhere else from there.
bad,"I worked at advance auto for over 5 months the whole business is a joke. As soon as you get the job they give you these promises of raises and growth that in my time there I saw none of. There was no real store management I was brought on by a manager from a different store as a driver/ retail sales associate. It turned more into custodial/ grunt work, with the occasional delivery. My coworkers were great but the two acting managers that were brought in took complete and vantage"
bad,"Seriously the most underwhelming,  unrewarding job I've ever had. 5 years with the company and over time seen it just decline in every aspect . Best time to work at ad advance was 3 or more years ago."
bad,"Hard work,  low pay. Training is a joke . A fellow employee stole parts by using my log in number. Manager had favorites. Work hours were different every week."
bad,"Hired as store manager.. horrible experience... not worth the stress or money ... "
bad,"Poor management."
bad,Started training as  a comercial parts pro the person who was to train me quit the Friday before I was to begin training due to a dispute with management.  I was never trained as a CPP instead I worked the fro t counter. Then I was transferred to another store where I filled in for those on vacation on the front counter. After 4 months I had received no training as a CPP and was required to work on days that I had told them I was unavailable those days. The regional mgr said repeatedly i was in training for the position i had applied for but i received no such training and found employment elsewhere.
bad,"I was a Hub Manager and I did everyone's job there, because no one wanted to show up for work or do their work. I was very unhappy with the work there."
bad,Its ok but don't expect much a lot of back stabbing and the store manager will pull sneaky stuff and blame it on employees will use your sign on number to pull stuff. Not the best place to work. Low pay not respectful of female employees. Don't expect to advance or make enough money without a 2nd job
bad,"Middle management stinks. They offer NO support or resources to their store managers. UNLESS you are their favorite, chosen one...poor work schedules are consant. Understaffed and won't let us hire who we need. Poorly run overall. If the CEO would see how it is in the local stores, he'd be appalled."
bad,"Well there was a couple of things that was ok about the job, they didn't mind hiring scenery, if you was an ok looking gal you was on the fast tract to management, district and regional managers are borderline slow."
bad,"Overall I didn’t fell wanted there or  appreciated for the work I was able to complete with the “training” I should have gotten. Once I asked for the correct training in the field I was promoted to, I was never given a clear answer. Management wasn’t right at all nor supervision. My time there I had 3 supervisors start and then abruptly leave, They just Quit."
bad,Management poor from District to store. Treated unfairly given proof to all higher ups some employees were stealing basically whistle blew a help single out the theives and gave proof and they just turned the other way. What honesty  got me was the unemployment line.
bad,"After working in the parts industry for awhile, and managing across different stores and competitors, I can assure you Advance Auto Parts will stress your life out, especially if you're running a busy / high selling store. "
bad,Worst management. No training lack of advancement. No overtime short staffed no positive reinforcement not appreciated. And basically told you are disposable
bad,"Very sorry company to work for. Management knows nothing when asked about anything. Store was in disarray. "
bad,"I like many others, was systematically “gotten rid off”, as I came from the bought out brand. Many lost their jobs, so Advance could attempt to be the “Big Box” autoparts player. Sadly they eliminated great lines, great people and one of a kind locations. I see my supervisor was rewarded for his hatchet job, with a big vp job back east. They have a very liberal point of view, and if you don’t tow the line, you’re gotten rid off. They gave performance bonuses, that were not paid, when leaving the co. I was a BIG  producer, that didn’t match the New York, Denver, Austin,east coast  frame of mind. IMHO I would recommend you seek employment elsewhere"
bad,The manager doesn't like to give total direction just vague responses.  The company is not good to work for they treat you like you are a slave!they are horrible.
bad,"Working at Advance auto parts was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my career. I could never be sure of the hours i would be working because if sales were slow they would send me home and then i never knew when they would call me back in to work."
bad,"From my experience working with Advance Auto Parts if there’s one word to describe it as a workplace it would be unprofessional. From management, down to scheduling, lack of tools for installations, untrained and unqualified employees. this company is tough to work for."
bad,Current leaders have ruined this once great company to work for.  Very reactive to market conditions and the field does fire drills all the time.  Resources are designed for corporate not the ones in the field who drive sales and touch the customer.
bad,Dont go there if there is a newer white chevy Malibu there. Do go during the day only at night when people working there no what there talking about unless you talk to randy
bad,"Have to be a Team player or a Leader .Job is a very fast paced environment and throat cutter heavy lifting Not only drive equipment but lift car batteries ,oil on boxes,rotors on pallets .Besides it being unsafe job and extremely heavy the pay is very low and their is No Appreciation"
bad,"Got to see and work in a new and different environment, with new people. Learned a lot from the general manager that was there at the time of employment."
bad,"Hated working there. No raise, horrible hours, always asked to come in earlier than scheduled and stay later with no break. No career advancement opportunities."
bad,"The store manager where I worked was walked out immediately after he turned in his two weeks notice, which left the store with no one to do the employee schedule, or deal with any other potential employee issues. Things got out of control quickly. It was unthinkable to me that they would have done this and left the place with literally no leadership. I`ve seen other employees treated very, very poorly by management there, and therefore, I have no respect for them. They left the employees at that store confused, stressed, and frustrated. Horrible, horrible place to work. And the pay is ridiculously awful. Many of the employees are shallow and angry, are backstabbing, and passive/aggressive."
bad,I worked for the company for 14 years and held every position in the store as I worked my way to general manager. The upper management have no respect for the general managers and store team. The general managers are expected to pick up all the slack in the store and when severely understaffed and up working to fill the staffing gaps because overtime is frowned upon. The store team is severely under paid and that reflects in the performance. Their inventory management processes are a complete mess from the distribution center to the stores. The stores have to spend way to much time maintaining inventory from the DC.
bad,"The only thing i like, is that you can order from World Pac. i would of preferred to work in World Pac.everything else sucks, management sucks, district manager sucks."
bad,This is a company that does not care about there employers no matter how hard you try and work it not good enough because you’ll never be recognized for it they tell you they support you going back to school but there a twist to it they single certain people out mangers are not on there jobs doing what they are suppose to do they do not try and work with you when it comes to family emergencies they do not care all they can tell you is to pick up the work even if your above your percentage so that they can get there product out to the stores they make you lift incredible heavy parts the pieces are so heavy that some of the men have trouble doing this job alone there’s no air circulating in that building they dock you about everything not conserdiate about things you may have going on at home and the reason your not being there they do not pay good the pay is horrible for all the work you have to do and this mostly this place is unprofessional
bad,cut throat and alot of back stabbing by the ladies one if she dont want to do any thing she would look to see what needs done then go get a pop and wait til everyone else took the pick orders 2nd we could never keep help due to long hours  you have to stay until all work is done some times 16 hour deals and vary stress full . then when you up and give them your notice they try to say you did a no call no show deal after a bunch of walk outs they management got the picture and cleaned up the supervisors and managers and got all new staff its a shame we lost alot of help due to poor management beacuse they refused to listen to the people down at deleware ohio
bad,There is so much micro management and favoritism going on that even your days off were stressful. Would not recommend this place for even a part time worker.
bad,Overall advance Auto is a big business company that pays little to no attention to whats happening at the store level. the communication between upper management and the stores is appalling and there is no consideration given to what happen inside the store at an interpersonal level resulting in poor moral and production. Compensation for the erratic scheduling in minimal.
bad,Not a good place to work. Management has a lot to be desired. Stressful conditions to work in. Management normally changes their minds on production at least once a week.
bad,"This company is very sneaky. Information is not readily available and senior management is very manipulative. Unless District Managers like you, your job will be difficult.."
bad,"The worst job I have ever had in my entire 40 year career. The customers are rude, management is a joke and if you like to hustle you will be bored out of your mind."
bad,"If you can live off $600 a month you can get by with an easy stressless job, you'll have customers that think you're an idiot no matter how much you know, but you have to deal with getting 5 hour shifts that take up 8-9 hours of your day since you'll be put on 3 hour long lunch breaks that you'll get written up for it you don't take."
bad,"Hours dragged by. Manager was unprofessional, treated employees horribly, talked dirty about women and how cool he was in high school. Treated employees like trash. Threatened to fire team members if they didn't answer their phones on their days off and if they couldn't cover someone else's shift."
bad,"If you hire in as a part time worker, don't expect to go any further if you stand up for what you believe in or need any set amount of hours. It is a customer service job, so it has advantages and disadvantages."
bad,"Work 10 hours a day standing, and watch as people horse around on equipment and slack off and no one holds them accountable. There is no order or SOP in this company and management plays favoritism on who moves up."
bad,"Easily the worst job I've ever had. "
bad,not for everyone. can be a lot of heavy lifting. very busy fast pace environment to work at. ships auto parts around the world to other advance auto part stores
bad,"Plan on working lots of nights weekends, holidays, have employees complaining about hours, (too many, not enough, not enough time off, to many nights, too many mornings, ..........)  Management is expected to work min, 50 hours per week but with the new understaffing plan, expect to be working a min of 60 to 70 hours per week,  10 hours per day is required, 1 Saturday off per month is allowed, but someone will usually call in sick so you don't get that day either,  I've missed football season for the last 5 years.    You can be transferred at the drop of a hat."
bad,The jobs is a great job I love my customers & being helpful. I personally would love the store if they'll run better & they would pay & appreciate their employees as well as customers better than they do
bad,Not very competitive pricing like oyher autoparts company. More focus on buying other companys. Not very open door company. Will hire anyone without automotive knowledge.
bad,Management didn't care about their employees only making production. The employees have no home life is very long hours and benifits are not great. Safety is not a big concern to management and often take short cuts..
bad,"Chaotic environment, waste of financial resource, lack of true direction.  First 6 weeks I was there I had to determine task and work for a project that was 12 months old."
bad,"A computer program runs the company and people are in the roles to make sure the program doesn't fail. The work culture is not the job you want if you want a family life. Schedules change week to week making in impossible to plan anything. Days off change week to week and split schedules per day are not uncommon. Holidays, weekends, and closing shifts are mandatory. Management allows rules to be bent and broken for the favorites. Too many inexperienced managers. Too much work load for one person. Sales goals are unrealistic for market. Most of the people they hire for authority roles are brainless.They just expect too much for the little pay they offer. Advancement is as high as store GM as the levels above contain long term employees and are almost impossible to attain unless you have the best sales consistently for months even years in succession. Miss a  goal and you start over. There are better places to work and the glam and glitter of the outside is not what the inner workings are like on the inside. Choose your path wisely. There are many other paths that are worth your important time and effort."
bad,"Advance is not a good place to work at the retail level. The money and hours are terrible. Most of your ""team members"" are only out for themselves, and management is usually incompetent."
bad,Not a good company to work for.  High turn over with little or no training.  Pay compensation is fair and is average for the industry.
bad,"Did everything from driving parts to and from commercial deliveries,"
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone work here ever. Horrible pay. Horrible hours. They are not willing to work with you over anything. And god help you if you have to call off for a legitimate reason.
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. You are a puppet not an employee, HIGH turn over rate. You are expected to work 60 plus hours a week doing everything when they cut your employee hours. poor upper managements. Have to kiss up to fit in or fail."
bad,"If you expect to make a wage you can live on forget it!  Advanced Auto Parts pay is barely above minimum wage or right at minimum wage so you can work two full weeks and take home about $450 Advance Auto Parts pays barely above minimum wage or right at minimum wage so you can work to full weeks, 80 hours, and take home about $450 after deductions."
bad,"Management doesn't know what there doing. Employees are under paid, company auto parts are too high in cost. Need more parts poeple that really knows about parts."
bad,"One bad apple may not ruin the company, but it is ruining this particular store in Clinton Ma. It's sad that it's allowed to continue."
bad,"Every day is all about stats & padding personal sales numbers."
bad,"It is not about actual sales but about completing busy work that has no direct correlation to your success or income."
bad,"The best part of working for this company is helping customers, and that where the good stuff ends. "
bad,"The coworkers are sometimes hard to get along with, you are forced to sell things even if they are not needed."
bad,"make out bound sales calls"
bad,"As a general manager most of your day will be spent doing busy work. If you enjoy the mediocre and mundane task of ""fetching"" auto parts and calming down undeserving customers; you're in the right place. District Manager was the icing on the molded cake. The company was tolerable, but the DM was the worst boss ever."
bad,"As a General manager, you have no time for anything other than work. An average day has a GM in store 12+ hours. For me, in the store I managed, 60 to 80 hours weekly was common. Upper management does not allow for the hiring of additional full time personnel. The company sets the days that management are to schedule their days off. On those days upper management would set up conference calls or other activities for managers to participate in. I learned many things about managing a high volume store and staff. Inventory control, customer satisfaction issues etc. Lots of turn over so it was difficult to build a team that would be able to work as a unit. The most difficult part of my position was being able to keep up with the task that needed to be performed on a daily basis when turn over was so high. The most enjoyable part of working for Advance Auto Parts was when I was able to have a day or two off without having to be interrupted. To be honest that was a rare occurrence. If a person wants to break into the Auto parts business, Advance would be a good place to start. But not to make a career of."
bad,My typical day is satisfying the customers and making sure they get the best service necessary. We work together as a team and have each others back when necessary.
bad,You never get a sense of having job security. Seems like your always looking over your back. The lower management is good but above that leaves alot to be desired.
bad,"Typical day begins as early as 4 am to be at airport by 6 am. 1-2 hr flight, rental car, drive as much as 5 hours to reach site. 4 hours on site, Drive 4 or more hours to hotel. Spend 4 or more hours on computer filing out forms, up-loading information about the day's meeting, dealing with issues from other projects. Repeat each day for 5 or more days."
bad,"If you are not an employee who has been at the store since it opened you will get nothing, even if like me you worked over 40 hours per week as a part time employee filling in for a sick full time employee."
bad,"I worked at distribution center PA the company was committing insurance fraud I reported it I was fired for a safety "
bad,"Working at this place sucks....high turnover, high pressure, non supportive leadership....it's a blame driven culture,  Their focus is continuously coming up with new performance ""monitoring"" programs to brow beat you with."
bad,Upper management will tell you one thing then stab you in the back. I would not work for this company if the pay was doubled. Not a good company to work for.
bad,If you have a family or want to be valued by a company don't work here. Pay is terrible schedule is worse and they don't value your knowledge they will hire anybody with a pulse
bad,"Management make rules to benefit them.  management date each other and bully employee to do what they want. Poor communication, do as I say and don't want to hear anything from anyone. Call employees out in front of other employees, disrespectful"
bad,"When they find good and great workers, they work them so hard until they suck the happiness from their soul. While the slackers fly under the radar collecting a check making easy money, hard workers are stressed with even more jobs added to their current job and looked at funny when it takes a minute. Once the new management showed up it got even worse. Can't wait to find another job now. It's hard to smile now."
bad,"It is a a great place to work if you have no experience.  You can learn a lot of about cars and car parts.  It is great for young people. It is not a professional environment and it is male dominated, which can be intimidating.  The pay is incredibly low."
bad,"Not a fun place to work when management, delegate almost all responsibilities towards you."
bad,They tell you you're going to work 4 / 10-hour days then as soon as you come in you realize you're working 5 day at 12 hour days and the turnover rate is phenomenal it's like 85% because they don't pay their employees
bad,"Not a good place to work  if your looking for a company to advance in, they expect more out of you and doesn’t pay nothing, no pay raise if the store manager doesn’t meet their quota at the end of the year. No matter how hard you work"
bad,"Company needs a complete overhaul.  They won't last the evolution of this business.  They are out of touch with their employees and customers.  computer systems are antiquated,  company doesn't reinvest in buildings or employees., and their reward system is terrible."
bad,"Managers have their favorites and that's who gets promoted and recognized publicly. Doesn't matter how smart you are, how good your ideas are. Office politics are at play and they won't listen to line managers to solve problems. "
bad,That place was a complete mess. The general manager was stealing from the company and I caught onto it. As soon as he knew what I knew he pulled every trick in the book to get me fired.
bad,"Culture is very corrosive and negative.  Leadership has successfully turned an easy business, very competitive company into a bottom performer in our industry.  It is embarrassing to come to work, see customers with our brand on as it is not received well by the public."
bad,"Just a bad atmosphere all the way around. Everybody that worked there before I was hired ""clicked"" together. They seemed to not ever welcome the new guy to the team. Kept treating the new guys terrible and not giving them a good place to come to work. Management acted as a small child and treated employees and customers with the upmost disrespect."
bad,"I was promoted quickly from a counterperson to a GM within a year.  At the time it was a great place to work where everyone had fun helping customers.  Corporate took the company in a different direction where we were held accountable for each persons individual sales numbers.  It was to the point that team members were stealing other team members customers at the register and other sneaky tactics.  We had a great district manager at the time and after 20+ years, he was transferred.  They brought in multiple people afterwards and ruined the entire culture."
bad,"no one is held accountable for their actions"
bad,"Lack of advancement and professionalism, higher ups frequently fired and replaced, managers moving around. Schedules are very inconsistent and not workable"
bad,No real leadership.  No sense of direction and who they are.  Priorities change with the wind as they chase Amazon and the other after mark parts distributors.
bad,"Not a great place to work - used to be an outstanding company, however the culture has changed significantly and a new cut-throat culture has been ushered in. There is a high level of insecurity and lack of direction of the company."
bad,I have been with Advance since they've opened and things are getting better. However there is a serious lack of consistency and caring toward the team .
bad,"Managers were never satisfied with anything, pay was terrible for the amount of work given as a key holder. they would always call you to cover for a slacker who doesn't want to work but if you need a day off they make it seem like the end of the world."
bad,"This goes for store 1825 in Fort Wayne Indiana. "
bad,This company is greedy and self centered and does not truly and HONESTLY care for its employees it buys another company then forced all those employees from that bought company out of a job by cutting hours to starve them out or mess with the schedule to force them out. Its a real cut throat company not worth making a career out of.
bad,Advanced is a company more money oriented than employee oriented they excessively work people overtime that is not beneficial to them or the employee. Managers lack the ability to delegate efficiently.
bad,Advance is the cheapest company. They say service is their best part is their promise to employees and customers when they hire people from starbucks and burger king to manage their stores with no car background. Wont pay or hire anyone in commercial stores. Horrible money hungry company. Shorted me three dollars for a jacket in the uniform allowance. Multi billion dollar company.
bad,"horrible place to work, micromanage every little thing you could think of.  Don't care about their people anymore just profit. No job security at management positions."
bad,"If you want to keep one position with slight pay increases to a maximum pay of only $15 in most positions then this is the place for you. There is absolutely no leniency in time off with sickness, hospitalization, family deaths, or even snow days when it is literally impossible to get to work."
bad,"Great team of peers, unrealistic goals, IE time allotted to complete tasks VS quality of customer experience.  I, and many other managers, cared enough about their store that they came in on their day off to complete said tasks since they were the only salaried position in the store.  Companies like this one bank on that sort of thing, and when the store managers burn out or fail, turn over city. That is how you are viewed there.  you are an expendable number, and numbers are the only care in the world for them."
bad,No team work at this work place. Management did not care or hand these team membrs accoutable.
bad,"Very busy workload ,poor pay for work you do, not a enjoyable place to work ,company only cares about profits not the people who put in the work"
bad,If you want a job where you will be nothing to everyone then you should take this job. if you want something more then i suggest you find something a bit more fun and enjoyable for your self. of course it could have been that it was just the advance auto parts that i worked at but in all honesty it left such a bad taste in my mouth i wouldn't work at another advance auto unless it was the last means of employment to support me and my family
bad,"my experience at Advance Auto Parts was very unenjoyable.They make promises of pay raises and promotions and don't fulfill them. I was promoted to assistant manager and when the manager quit,I was told that I was never the assistant.I had the title revoked and my pay decreased."
bad,"Integrity level is to the bare minimum."
bad,Company cares more about money than morals or employees. Its all about the dollars. I would not work here again even for the highest pay! Dysfunctional to say the least
bad,"Stressful, overwhelming corporate expectations, you have to basically force custumers to sign up for speedperks , constantly have to make sales in order to make your weekly numbers and basically cut throat your coworkers any way posible in order to succeed and get ahead in advance auto parts, the DISTRICT and CORPORATE  ceo or managers only see numbers, they don't see human beings they see you as mark cattles or better say they see their employees as numbers not man/woman who work hard giving their precious time of life to a company who doesnt even acknowledge you unless you making the numbers weekly that they expect, you are threated daily as disposable replaceable numerical employees"
bad,The managers dont respect employees as people. There is discrimination against certain people. The managers engage in the workers drama instead of correcting it.
bad,Good job and customers Manger constantly has excuses for his lack of work self control and capabilities not to mention addictions. He constantly tries to put employees against each other lies without any care for what it could lead to. The position you apply for will never be the position you have Don’t plan any vacations let alone family time always be prepared to work even on your day off Manger will sacrifice any employee so he doesn’t have to be sober
bad,They do not care about their employees. management is a joke and constantly changing. You are required to meet a daily quota which is impossible at some locations. I would not recomend this company unless it is dire need and you are just passing through. I was hurt on the job and the doctor I was sent to told me there was nothing  wrong with me and I needed to go back to work. ppaiout of pocket for my own doctor that said I would do further damage if I returned and
bad,This was absolutely the worst job I ever had but I don’t know if it is the company as a whole or just the location. Only job I ever just stopped showing up to.
bad,Been working their for almost a year offered a full time position. They ended up hiring a new worked gave to them. When i confronted the management they blew me off well maybe in a couple months i may have another position open up for full time. I do 100% more than my job title requires me to do and i get nothing in return.
bad,"Its just a job, Its not much more than that no advancement no support They throw people out and hope they swim. No raises lots of stress no support from higher management."
bad,"The overall plan and desire for how the company wants to move forward is inspiring, but the follow-through is lacking. Some teams are very much aligned. While others are really good at playing the game but behind the scenes nothing moves. If you are on one of the ""dead"" teams, it can be a hostile place to work if you want to be part of the movement."
bad,If you're looking for a place to earn some extra bucks part time then go for it. Stay away if you're looking for a career. I have no bad words about my store manager at all nor about any of my co workers but the upper management were the most nit picky people I've ever met. I was one of the top dollar salesmen in my store but it wasn't good enough for upper management because I refused to push the unnecessary $1.00 add ons to people. My store was also one of the top selling stores in our district as well the cleanest but we got a bad review from the regional manager for a piece of paper in the back office that was sticking out of the place it was filed. I'm not kidding about that. They do not pay their full time employees or managers anywhere near what is deserved and earned. The constant stress is not worth it at all and the company does not care.
bad,"They do not care about your family life only their own. Don’t even think about planning anything for the holidays because you don’t get them off. Don’t ever get sick because you’ll get written up for missing work, yes even with a doctor note. This place is a joke and I look forward to finding a new job."
bad,"If you aren't upper management, then you don't matter! The disrespect from the district manager is unreal..why would ANYONE compare employees who work hard daily to monkeys..! If you get overtime you could potentially be written up or fired! No real advancement unless you do a lot of butt kissing. Would NOT recommend ANYONE to work here.."
bad,"They'll fire you for offering to help customers on your own time, the only parts store I've ever heard do this. This might be acceptable if it weren't for the fact that their wages are embarrassingly bad. $9 USD/hr even though I've been a technician my entire adult life and know cars better than nearly anyone else working there which isn't even a high bar. The prices are also the worst in the business. $12 for a bottle of Sea Foam despite it being $8 at AutoZone and $7 at Home Depot. Common alternators are in the $300 range compared to $220 everywhere else. Don't bother shopping here and certainly don't work here!"
bad,"No structure , employees way to comfortable. Food and drinks at the work stations when they a designated work station. Lack of communication. Too demanding and inconsiderate"
bad,"Refuse to pay adequately and will not get the proper equipment needed to do the job correctly, or refuses to replace faulty equipment. Employee discounts are the same discounts someone can get by ordering online."
bad,"AAP is slowly beginning to grab back it's hold on the market from competitors. As a whole it is a relatively strong company that has suffered in recent years. Culture wise, it is lacking a lot. Employees tend to not be valued until they threaten to leave, and even then are treated as expendable."
bad,"Management is a follow and see what happens culture.  Lack of experienced leadership hurts this company more than anything else.  This company needs to take a market leadership position, but lacks the experience to do so."
bad,Lower management was constantly changing so creating a well functioning work environment was almost impossible. Bad managers seemed to last much longer.
bad,"The average pay for a GM was approximately 55k/ year. Not nearly enough to have your own place in new jersey. In a declining industry, the sales goals( which drove bonus incentives) were constantly being raised."
bad,"Advance Auto Parts, management expects its employee's to work very minimum hours, as low as 8 hours per week, and only making $8.00 dollars an hour. What an insult and and waist of resources."
bad,When your manger makes you feel and tells you that your position is not important that's what makes work stressful or when rules are changed by the Manger the rules are not being utilize because of manager is not following the rules they palace so that's confusing or when management sees online orders for commercial they take those orders but they don't get the parts so that leaves are commercial customers and Commercial blind because we don't know what's going on until the customer calls upset wondering where their stuff is at.
bad,Every body at the store level is replace able. Company dumps on most talented employees and favors incompetent management. Stay away! Company has no direction. They keep trying different things hoping something will work. Hire management from other industries that have nothing to do with automotive and don't require automotive training to perform the job.
bad,I would not tell anyone to work for this company! They don't value their employees nor do they care about them. This company only cares about numbers.
bad,General manager is a drug addicted pathological liar who does noting to help in the store. He hides out back and spends his day in the bathroom.  Hard working employees are fired due too his lies.  He Sexually harassed female employees on several occassions.
bad,poor leadership from district mgr which effects store general mgr all the way to employees . open all days even thanks giving sad . if you don't have a life this is the place for you
bad,"i learned how this company has no morals, or even dignity in the work place. Not only were some employees doing very dangerous illegal things while being at work they clearly did not care how their actions could possibly put others employees in harms way."
bad,Complete corporate hogwash. Do not try to be an individual. Absolute joke. Be ready to learn everything on your own and do not complain about it.
bad,This company required a decent amount of knowledge to be considered for the job. Constant testing and quotas had to  be made without commission and while working barely above minimum wage. I found out after six months that I made more than any manager that had been there for two years or more. They rate your performance on signing people up for online rewards programs that mean nothing.
bad,I worked there for a few years. Management changed and it wasn't the same so I quit. All kinds of pro's)and cons. I wish it would have stayed the same.
bad,"Poor upper & middle management.  Company stock performs poorly.  Very little support from District Leaders.  Average product quality, poor inventory mix and depth distribution & store levels. Local part availability is poor.  Corporate policy/direction is vague.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with a information system that was NOT dependable by any stretch of the imagination and dealing with unethical\dishonest fellow General Managers."
bad,"i am delivery driver at Advance Auto, Im required to get different types of parts from Paint to Starters to different shops in the metro area."
bad,"Awful place to work!! This company does not care about their employees at all. Benefits bad  20% off everything in the store but everything is marked up so high its not worth it. You get a better discount using promo codes online and selecting pick up in store. Work place is full of not so smart people because they pay worse than ANY retail store or any other parts store. The management hardly does any managing. The DRAMA is so ridiculous daily."
bad,I worked here as a Commercial Account Manager for 6 months and it was all about micro managing. Experience means nothing they will tell you how to do your job and expect you to work all hours of the day and night. Computer work is a lot and will interfere with your personal life. Lots of conference calls and having to report everything you do. Bonus is almost impossible to get when the stores you are given are broken. The Commercial Account Manager is the highest turnover job in this company. Stay away from this position if unless you want to be controlled by everyone else but you. During your interview they don't tell you what you are going to be doing at all. Stay away.
bad,As a manager you best realize that your job is not going to be a nine to five. You are expected to be available to your store twenty four hours a day. Do not make plans on your day off because more then likely you will have to work or attended a meeting that you will not be paid for. You are just a number to this company they will not help you if you are struggling or need help.
bad,Your basic retail job for those who are uneducated and unskilled at anything else.
bad,"All I can say is was not for me. My values and morals did not coincide with theirs. If you have no family and a really flexible schedule, it may be for you."
bad,"The Walmart of car parts.The largest car parts company in the world is also the cheapest.Managers that don:t appreciate their employees and takes a minimum of 1 year to get a raise.Job security is great because they can't find employees.If you are looking to be underpaid,unappreciated and work holidays,weekends and nights this is the place for you."
bad,good job but no upward movement. typical day there is no upward mobility
bad,Under payed staff that works their butt off for pennies. The general managers will try their hardest for a raise but district managers and HR have the final say. It’s all a joke and you will be replaced if not loyal to the company.
bad,Was there 3 years and didn't get promoted till the end after promised promotions and doing the job before the promotion will never work for them again
bad,"If you enjoy being talked down to and ridiculed by your OM who has a god complex, If you want impossible goals, If you want to work weekends and holidays, If you want a job where the customer can say and do WHATEVER they want and receive no support, if you want a job that demands constant hard work and doesn't pay accordingly. This is the Job for you."
bad,During a typical week the work schedule is inconsistent.  Vehicles are filthy and stink.  Some of the employees are very immature despite being in their 50s.
bad,"not a great place to work at. if you just looking for something to pay your bills then it's ok. but other then that, I would advise you not to take the time to fill out an application."
bad,"Working at store level was great, good people to work with and had fun but corporate could care less about you. Your just a number and they let you know it. All the dm cares about is sales numbers growth performance over goals but never take into account the lack of infrastructure and sub par computer systems we have to work with. You can grow sales if the parts your ordering never show up or they get sent to the wrong store or even gemming the wrong parts all together."
bad,"I was employed with AAP in Greenville, NC. While training as a Team Member, the assistant manager, my trainer got caught with theft and terminated. I had a lapse of training for a few months. Due to the lack of training, I was not up to par on skills in customer service (returns, processing on-sale items. Just felt like I was not doing the best I could do given the minimal training (Indadequate). If that wasn't enough, my GM disrespected me as an employee and his senior. I felt insecure in asking questions and concerns. His demeanor was that of someone that was above the rest in intelligence and skills. He had an ego problem characterizing his self above the other salespersons. Instead of getting the proper training, I had to resort to other experienced salesman. Just a bad job opportunity. In the end, I don't believe all the AAP stores are this bad. I'm sure I could have done somethings that would have helped my situation as well. Not just a one way street."
bad,In my experience my manager is inadequate stressful work enviroment and very low pay the management is a joke and the main manager always opens never closes and is very childish.
bad,Very disorganized and doesn't allow for me to advance or make any positive structural moves for the better of the store. Needs better communication among the management.
bad,AAP has had such an influx of non aftermarket auto folks who really don't understand the business that they are at a breaking point. It's hard to achieve anything with constantly changing priorities.
bad,"Managment went behind my back and illegally put PTO hours on check without my knowledge because he was upset. Completely Unprofessional and when I contacted Human Resources , I never got a response."
bad,Hours scheduled to work per week vary wildly.  Management is inconsistent.  Pay is at the lowest level.  Few benefits.  Typical big box retailer with all its problems.
bad,went i star this jod was very good later the no aminitracion no one care about the jod every body star doing warever they want the supervisor don't care nothing end i star doc wit there supervisor about what happens end no one do nothing end i star looking for another jod went the people care about the jod.
bad,treated me wrong always had an attitude and the pay was not enough for all the hours they had us working 7am-2am i was mad about the situation and the only thing about the job that i did enjoy was u was off friday-sunday
bad,"pay is bad for what the job is. benifits arent good, management doesnt know much about cars nore do salesman that are hired to the company. people are hired for their race"
bad,"I worked one month as delivery driver. The first week I filled in for an employee taking vacation, that's okay. I applied for PART-TIME,monday thru friday 9am to 1pm .I was hired and got 12 noon to 5pm ( give or take a half an hour ) or what managers decided. The 2nd week same, 3rd week monday, wednesday, friday 12-5:30. Something happened with store and one person was fired, two others wrote up! I was told I would be working 7:30am to 5:30pm ( July 1st and July 4th thru July 8th ) to fill in. Asking how many commercial repair shops were open on the 4th, I was told I would working in store, they would put me on retail sales ( didn't apply for ) . When no deliveries are called I was told to stock, or clean dead leaves/ oil ( from rusty container behind dumpster in 85 degree weather ). There's a gentleman ( 81 years old ) that does ONLY deliveries! Nothing more. I felt USED. I quit..."
bad,"It seemed to me that, finding parts and stocking parts is neverending.  I i did learn a lot as assistant manager for this position."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the job itself. But the money wasn't enough to help support my family.
bad,"From upper management to store level, communication skills are woefully lacking.  Misunderstandings abound and are usually answered with finger pointing in various directions.  Unwilling to look at ways to do things more efficiently, stuck in the “this is how we’ve always done it” mentality."
bad,This is a tariable company to work for I wasted 3 years thare. And work like a dog. Witch normally I dont have a problem with but when they stated hiring people at 8.75 witch was a dollar more than me. And I asked to be bumped up to the new hiring rate. They let me go.
bad,At 10 $ per hour this job does not pay nearly enough for anybody in any situation especially not for the amount of work they expect outta you for a little bit of money
bad,"Under staffed, low pay and lack of parts in stores. They need closer ware houses. "
bad,"Managers that don't fix problems, or only do so for a week. They make it seem like you're not important, and they keep taking away higher pay raises. And on top of that people leave all the time so for most of the year we were short staffed."
bad,no matter how hard you work and dedicate yourself to the company they will always look over and aspect you yo do more.and they like to hire out side the store then to promote with in or they will take a good running store and ruin it
bad,"Horrible pay, management that dosent know anything about the automotive field, bonuses are horrible. It use to be a great place to work than the new upper management came in and destroyed that making it unsafe to work some nights having only one person to close and most the time there is only one person in the store."
bad,"My day at work would start with reading e-mails and answering them. Then getting my day started by seeing what I had to get done first. Make sure that I had enough team members to get the job done. Placing everyone in the right position. I had a very great team to work with. They didn't mind getting dirty if needed too. The hardest part of my job was when I didn't have the product to send to the stores, that was ordered. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking the team to a level that they didn't think that they could get to. That was getting all the parts pulled on time and all the trucks loaded and out on time. This was my most enjoyable moment, and also seeing that the team really worked together."
bad,"Its all smoke and mirrors to the customer, Angry customers and poor management decisons. No organization, No Teamwork, expect no pay raises and expect to work years being told you will get full time and it will never happen, 8 bucks an hr w/no raises."
bad,I overseen the sales of all the garages. Made sure they had the parts to run there bussiness. I really enjoyed my job but corp. was not so good.
bad,"It was a good work place, everybody worked together to get our jobs done and on time. We delivered a lot of parts to mechanic shops and we always made sure our stocked parts were accounted for."
bad,"Being there, the employees were like family. The problem is the total lack of safety, and the company doesn’t care about your safety. They don’t pay enough for the amount of work they expect."
bad,This company is a joke to work for. Your just a number at the end of the day. The district managers have no idea what really goes on at the store level or who the over achievers are or who the people are who deserve promotions. They put MANY people in GM positions who have no idea what they are doing and dont deserve to be there and steal. If you just need a job to get by then do what you gotta do.
bad,I was very unhappy because there was no team player atmosphere. There was also a substantial amount of prejudice towards preferred employees who were given special treatment
bad,My store manager looks out for herself and not the rest of her team the work aymosphere is tense because of thier expectations words of wisdom Do not apply here its a waste of time.
bad,"i felt under pressure, and stressed out most of the time. there were a few good times, but very few.my manager was good fair, and nade me want to do better."
bad,I really enjoyed learning about cars and their parts. I love helping customers and being part of a team.  Several honest and considerate co-workers. New safe and reliable company vehicles to drive for deliveries.
bad,.Not a friendly place to work for. Pay scale is very low sad considering they are a fortune 500 company. they dont give raises nor treat you like a member of the Advance family.
bad,The pay suck if u r looking for a real job this is not the one everything about it suck the ppl that workn there management the hour and benefits suck
bad,bad hourly pay decent benefits with no ways to invest in company but job is not very physical.........................................................
bad,"This company has been consistent in giving a lack of guidance and a continuous change of standards with a  large amount of time taken to act upon anything. "
bad,The only problem I had was the advancement and the pay. They don't pay enough and I worked in an area with mostly Latinos so the advancement was just impossible in that location.
bad,The manager was great the manager was not though. The job was easy the coworkers were great if they had a new manager the store would meet it's expectations.
bad,This company is the worst communicator I have ever worked for. Very unprofessional
bad,"-Busy work day"
bad,"For near minimum wage, why would I clean bathrooms? Maybe they don't know unemployment rate is under 4%!! For the pay they offer, there are many other low wage companies to work for that don't require cleaning bathrooms. The store manager was great but was held to insuring these cleaning jobs were adhered to. Sorry, no additional comments."
bad,"I was offered many opportunities that I graciously accepted, but the promises were never kept.  I have a family of three children and my last month there I was scheduled 4 hours per week, as they hired administrative staff families for my position.  I called out ONE time in 6 months because I was legitimately sick,  and was taken off the schedule for the only 4 hours that week.  I showed up and was sent home.  However, another staff calls out weekly and still gets scheduled 44 hours a week....a single female with no dependents.  If I could give 0 stars I could"
bad,"Schedule to work on day of my Mother's Funeral by upper management who had knowledge of the whole situation since my mother's diagnosis, her being place on hospice, due to cancer stage 4"
bad,"Decent place of employment, if not raising a family, however you will need a second job as the pay rate is lacking"
bad,"interviewed there and got the job. Told the manager that I required a set amount of hours and they agreed, however after my 2nd week they started cutting hours with excuses. After a few months the store manager started changing the schedule without notifying anyone. So not only was the communication horrible so was the appreciation for being the top performer. I was the top performer for months with the promise for a promotion and it never happened with excuse after excuse. i just gave up and found a new job. This place was a circus."
bad,One star is too many! Management is seriously lacking. It seems as though their employees are just a number and they have no concern for them. They changed my schedule a lot and at the very last minute making it hard to have a social life.
bad,Never hated a job so much as I hated it there. The only thing that made it okay was the other co workers. We all became close and thats what got me through the day. You try to advance but it’s all who the manager likes and not how hard you work!!!!!! If you kiss the bosses butt you make it... if not they target you
bad,Very high management turn over.  No warehouse black supervisors and the ones they had they ran them off. Someone is always short on their pay check. It looks as if some embezzlement is going on in the HR department.  Because of the shorted pay checks and this happens every week to someone here at DC 42 in La Vergne tn.
bad,GM & DM doesn't care about the employees. Not all of them anyway. Weird and shady group of people . There was a few good employees but they aren't treated very well. If you are a dishonest person than the W. Memorial store in Lakeland will b a perfect fit for u if not go elsewhere . Don't waste your time .
bad,"This company is hiring incompetent management with low training or no training at all.  overworking teammates, and"
bad,This company is a terrible company to work for. They do not care about their employees and believe that all who are employed by the company are easily replaceable.
bad,"This may be someone's dream job, but the hours and lack of security on site was reason enough for me to leave.  It wasn't located in a desirable area of the city."
bad,There is absolutely nothing good or bad to say about the job. It was a cool part time job and I made some good friends here. I still talk to some of the people.
bad,Good for high school grads frist job. Upper management doesnt care about you at all what so ever. They demand alot from you with little to no help . Your just a number . What a waste of 6 years being lied to and told that ill get the promotion. That was promised but never given to me.
bad,lot of back stabbing from older employees not a fun place to work no backing from upper management been there for 14 months and have had three different managers and not one has done anything to help the employees
bad,"The company want let you grow and advance yourself they don't have a very good leadership"
bad,I did not care to work with this company. The management was horrible and rude. They liked to cause problems between employees. They also talked down to you and were very rude not only to their employees but to their customers.
bad,"Overall the pay really isn't that competitive. I didn't mind the job that much. It helped that I had a good crew. Once I got a management position, it was all downhill. It is impossible to please both corporate and the customers. On several occasions, I was lectured by corporate for following procedures instead of risking my job and bending the rules to help customers. Can't win."
bad,"Not a place that allows innovation to grow. In-house talent squandered, unqualified 3rd party vendors on-boarded instead."
bad,"After four dedicated years to this company as an assistant general manager they terminated me along with several other AGM's in a program called ""Project 12"" which cut labor hours in stores. Awful benefits and employer/employee interaction."
bad,"-Maintaining a safe work environment for team members"
bad,I didn't have a good experience here. More training for all employees would benefit this company a great deal.
bad,"The company runs like a farm. For hiring and promotion the standard is who you know, and not what you know."
bad,I enjoyed the knowledge I was able to use to help others. disliked the corporate sales tactics used.
bad,The staff are very rude including office management. I had a horrible experience working with this company. They treat you as though your worthless.
bad,busy work days
bad,Good management at this location.  Great employees to work with also.  Learned a lot at this store.  It is out in the country a little so people are a lot easier to work with.
bad,Good Gen. Mgr. Very understanding and polite. Nice co-workers. Told you early about my driving schedule. Some times between stores are hard to meet. Best part is driving and being outside.
bad,I like my jobs looking for some thing better in my life. something the pay well with benafits
bad,"No room for advancement unless you are part of the circle. Management doesn’t have a clue on the process, and refuse to listen to the employees ideas!"
bad,Unless your a gm or assistant manager your need and issues in your life that you need to take care of are not met. If your looking for somewhere to treat you fairly look else ware. Your not paid fairly if knolaged.
bad,"The pay was terrible the management  stunk the Aemployees not treated  "
bad,they pay poorly and they have more drivers hired then what they need to do the job they treat the workers poorly i was rearended while working for them and them made me take a drug test like i was the one at fault and i was sitting at a red light when it happen
bad,"I really have nothing good to say except that they hire great people. They just aren't typically treated in that manner. "
bad,Nice pay. Management was okay. The company paid decent. A typical day in the life at advance auto parts consist of opening up the store and assisting customers with their inquiry.
bad,"They run things no different than a retail store at the mall.  Auto parts is a skilled sales job not just a throw any joe schmoe know the fire and go.  No auto parts store needs to stay open till 9 at night or ever be open on sundays or holidays.  I have family in the independent auto parts store business and never have they been open on a sunday or past 6 p.m. and their sales numbers destroy ours on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis."
bad,Don't work there if you are looking for advancement because in District 2802 the DM hires only AutoZone ex-employees for management and other key positions and no one ever stays long... frequent turnover...
bad,"I met a lot of great people from shopping and discussions as well as watched a TON of people who were all stars come and go due to pay treatment and being undervalued. I put in 8 years and held on until i was told by my regional manager "" Ill be damned if you ever make it higher than you are within this company"""
bad,"District management was not interested in seeking to resolve problems nor improving retail functionality, only in 'not rocking the boat'."
bad,So many employees in & out because of poor management. They tend to treat you different based on your knowledge and will shame you for being lesser or greater when it comes to knowledge. Management will not promote but instead hire someone else that does not have the credentials.
bad,"Mangement Dosen't care about their employees, Puts objectives that individuals aren't paid for and need to be completed before COB, while also doing normal closing tasks, while also dealing with customers."
bad,"I truly love working here, the experience of meeting new people and having the pleasure to help a customer diagnose their vehicles problems and to see them smile is a wonderful thing to me, but where the problem lies is when it comes to promotions and moving up in the company. It seems that the people that are hardworking,  determined and focused team members they get the harshest time working for them. For instance,  they rather hire managers outside of the company that doesn’t know anything about the company and skip over the next manager in line that knows everything, then exspect the person that was already there to teach the General Manager his job. Then on top of that it’s a lump of Buddy, Buddy going on, so it’s very difficult to move up in this company or at least in this area."
bad,Management at my location is somewhat in need of training.communication skills are awful. No incentives and I am being paid my worth but those who are in higher positions already know that.
bad,"virtually no support for growth,"
bad,Everything is day to day and nothing is set in stone...if you are a good worker you will be the one to do most of the work. Most people sit in the back on their phone.
bad,"Very poor management, dirt, low payment, harassment from manager. Don`t go there, newer-ewer-ewer! You gonna work for free. No one gonna learn you, or help you."
bad,theres really nothing much i can say about this job. only reason i stuck to it was because its a small town and its hard to find a job being a student at the time.
bad,Unqualified management trying to play roles there not experienced for to begin with. Job positions are doing different department jobs because of that department has fallen behind. There's not a day that someone has to leave there own work to help a different department because there so backed up. And this is the  problem since the first day I started.
bad,"Very poor management and hiting skills, if your a hard worker you will not like it here. This company favors slackers and underachievers. I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"The company has no sense of organization. The pay is not worth the stress. HR is a complete joke. You will work long hours to accomplish nothing. Distribution in a way feels like that, but this company is completely blind sided but their ideas that suck."
bad,This place is under staffed and over worked to many chiefs not enough Indians.General Manager cares only of herself. Hires people who dont show up to work they call in all the time. This place is horrible to work for.
bad,"demanding,not enough associates per labor model,which made it difficult to run daily operations.the stores budgets were un attianble ,which made it impossible to recieve any bonus compensation"
bad,this company promises alot you go in work 80 plus hours a week because you are the manager  and you cant keep and staff because they want you to keep your staff at 10 hrs a week but they  cant live on that i feel bad for them
bad,"This job is best suited for the single person or the retired. Great second job, but not a primary job. Meeting new people while giving them the best customer service is a great feeling."
bad,"I didn't enjoy working for this company. They did not care about the employees or their outside life. I did appreciate some of the experience I got from working there and the people I met, but that's it."
bad,One of the most unpleasant places to work. Corporate not caring about the employees. Only thinking about the money to make. With no concern about the live they affect.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,I believe this is an ideal environment for anyone who has just entered the working force. This is a great experience to learn the inner workings of today's modern business structure.
bad,"I would not go into this expecting to get paid what you're worth, to have any back up from management, or any advice or help along the way. Corporate toxicity through and through."
bad,For the little bit of pay did they pay they expect way too much you get stuck out in all kinds of weather reading car codes putting on windshield wipers changing out batteries and they like to put their full-time employees down to part-time
bad,They do not care about the employees they work you 16 17 hours and look for you to come back and give them 100% and paid holidays you never have a paid holiday off you still have to go in and work
bad,"The company wouldn't be so bad if it didnt feel like a pyramid scheme. My manager at the time was horrible. She was constantly outside smoking and talking on her phone to her husband. And there was no support at the store I was at. The DM was no help either, but I will say if you are lucky enough to find someone in the company that cares that does help"
bad,It was a job. You go in clock in do your job and then clock in it and go home. Just a basic rinse and repeat. The customers know basics or they dont. Help accoordingly.
bad,"If they would get rid of the current store manager it would be a great work place, manager treats you how ever they please and it differs from day to day."
bad,This job was by far one of the worst jobs I ever had. The entire team was just doing dirty work behind the bosses back. Nobody cared and never did any work and when something went wrong they always pointed at the new hires it was annoying
bad,"Store manager was great. The other associates were great. However, everyone has a problem with the one associate yet situations pertaining to him were ignored."
bad,"I was invested and willing. I wanted to learn and advance and I was met with "" meh"" from management.  Empty promises, lack of any support of any kind. Sad, really."
bad,"Poor Management, allows employees to do whatever they want while messing up inventory. No desire to address the individuals that they know are constantly causing problems."
bad,"Fast paced, rude and sarcastic customers and no recognition of a job well done from management! They offer employee discounts which are not as good. Micro managing at it's finest!"
bad,"the best part of the job was that I learned alot about auto parts and how to utilize their data base. Other than this, the job pays poorly and tends to credit only management when staff !!"
bad,"Women are the parts delivery drivers, if they sale parts the male customers second guess them, or try to pick them up. The management was okay at the beginning but towards the end the new manager was sexist."
bad,"This is one of the single biggest let-downs of a company I've ever had and I was an unpaid factory worker from 8-18yrs old."
bad,"This company has a potential to be good, there is lots of turnover and no real direction. Your job depends on who likes you from what I have seen. Outside of New York things might be different but the expectations are not for commercial doesn't work in NY."
bad,"I've learned a lot about different vehicles and how they work, the parts involved and the time needed to do repairs. Online training videos available to learn about any aspect of vehicles"
bad,"It was nice working for the company when they were not hiring toxic managment and weak employees who can not or WILL not hold their job for more than 3 months. Scum managment, take TWO YEARS to get even 5(FIVE) days of UNPAID vacation, paid vacation after 10 years."
bad,"I worked here for a few months and wasn't doing what I was hired for. Management wasn't really there for help, he just say there expecting everyone else to do his job"
bad,"clock in grab,keys an cart with invoice and parts and deliver to customer planograms, zoning an putting up truck."
bad,When I started 16 years it was a great place to work. The managers were helpful & quick to give u a hand. Each year went bye & the managers got worse. The company decided to let the good managers go & kept or hired bad ones. The training is terrible all management wants to do is rush the new employees to the floor. They treat the senior employees unprofessionally & chest  them out of raises. They always take something away from employees. I worked in PDQ the only reason I stayed as long as I did I loved the ppl I worked with. Most of us worked together for 10+ years. Upper management right now is the worst I’ve seen in years. I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy. Corporate needs to clean house with DC 23 management team.
bad,If I were given more hours for my own work and not that of others leaving I would love to continue to work with this company. I believe that this is a great company but managed by someone who doesn't fully understand what the company implies.
bad,Advance auto is a great place to work for people needing part time work. the job is easy and can make good friends. the computer system is easy to run and easy to learn quick
bad,"They do not take care of their employees. They hire ""no experience "" managers and fire hard working, reliable and loyal employees. Getting a raise is like pulling teeth, no matter how valuable an employee you are. And it's a shame because I truly loved my job."
bad,"The work that I did at Advance Auto was as a temp employee.   Advance at the time was supplementing almost all of its labor at the corporate office in Roanoke with temp workers.   I am not sure what the purpose of this was, but the down side of it was that no one took their job seriously or had any work ethic.   They did not hesitate to call in whenever they wanted, so absenteeism was rampant.  Those of us who actually came to work had to bare the burden and pick up the slack.  This made it a demoralizing, stressful and crazy environment to work in almost every day.   Calling in became  contagious because it was either go to work and make virtually no money and be miserable, or stay at home and make no money and make whatever you want out of your day, which would be much better than working there."
bad,Extremely low pay for the demands required for the job and management doesn't offer advice or assistance. The level of education and experience of those reported to offer no feedback.
bad,I made $7.50 an hour to stand and stock shelves as well as assist disgruntled customers. I would not recommend working here as not only do they pay poorly but you are required to push a monthly item which isn't always possible.
bad,As long as you aren't a manager this is a decent retail company. If you are a manager be prepared for a lot of corporate oversight and no real power to accomplish goals.
bad,"upper managements treatment of employees.  Policies and procedures not enforced.  Pay and benefits poor. Boys club where if not upper managements ""lap dog"" no advancement."
bad,If you are not a grease monkey do not consider employment. Customers are very rude and aggressive. Works you very hard limited breaks and flexible scheduling.
bad,"Manager was absolutely terrible. He sat in his ""office"" all day and barely came up to help customers. When he did, he was rude, and i ended up having to attend to so many unsatisfied customers because of him. None of the employees even tried helping me when I wanted to know more about cars."
bad,"management does not reprimand all employees equally, favoritism clouds his judgement, some employees spend more time on social media then actually doing there job. Corporate is unaware of many issues at this location."
bad,"Expected to go above and beyond, which I never had a problem with doing, only if the pay was according, which it never was. Upper management and company policies changed to often."
bad,"Since ive started at Advance, they have cleaned out HR twice, now with the third HR rep there. They've fired more then half the managers, The GM of the building resigned while i have worked here. I dont exactly know who my manager is and who i should go to. When they switched all the managers around i didnt even have a manager to run our ""start up meeting"" When they fired a majority of the managers they let go of all the temps. Forced me from second shift to first shift, when doing that they took a dollar on the hour from my whole department, since then i've been working 50+ hours a week and when i get there ill have no idea when im going to go home untill after lunch. Some days its up to a 13 hour shift."
bad,I worked for this company for over 10 years until a extremely poor district manager came into our division and ruined 14 different stores for the company. I had never had an issue with any employee or manager until this person came into our division and all of a sudden I had been written up for bogus items and then I separated from the company. They didn't want to pay anyone anything and I had more people quick because they couldn't afford their monthly bills on a full 40 hours a week work. Terrible that this company went downhill.
bad,I opened store daily without any staff store was never properly staffed day to day operations where very bad store never met daily goals unless I worked both commercial and diy
bad,"I started at Advance Auto Parts right after high school. In the beginning I thoroughly enjoyed working there. I did not have any automotive knowledge when I began working there and the management and employees were very accommodating to me and my eagerness to learn. I ended up going to college to pursue an Automotive Technology degree. Unfortunately during my second year of college my relationship with my manager significantly deteriorated. I was one of the top three sales associates consistently, I acquired a very trusting relationship with many regular customers,  and I worked hard to train new employees. I was promised more training and a management position for all my hard work. I did not get what I was promised, my General Manager had a relationship with the retail sales professional and I felt I was overlooked because of that. I ended up quitting a few months later as well as many other employees."
bad,Poor communication with team members. There's no pay raise at all unless you have to kiss the DM's butt. There's favoritism and they just laid off a bunch of team members due to a fail experiment they were trying to do last year.
bad,"Severe problems with inventory management and control and also poor utilization of information technology."
bad,"I knew every area for my job but had to do the hardest job daily because new employees wouldn't understand their outdated system.."
bad,"This employer does not recognize a hard worker, they tend to have favoritism for employees who have been employed for a period of time even if they do not do their required work & leave it for other employees to do."
bad,This company lacks in security over products like racking high priced items and no security cameras in store to protect all assest and associates. This wasn`t a great experience for me.
bad,"If you're good at hitting your numbers EACH and EVERY month then you'll be OK at this.  My local management, from front line supervisors to store manager to the store manager's boss, routinely used abusive language, intimidation, and fear in order to try to motivate their respective subordinates.  I was never the recipient of such behavior but definitely witnessed it first-hand."
bad,"When working at Advance Auto Parts, I worked as sales associate helping customers decide what they needed for their car and then providing it for them. I also helped with stocking and cleaning throughout the store."
bad,"Love being a Driver at this job, perhaps in was the Monticello NY location that I worked at but management and staff were pretty terrible. Lacked passion, basic common sense and customer service. No medical benefits, hours are scarce unless your a manager."
bad,"I've work for Advance Auto Parts for 2 years and in the time I was here I have getting nothing but harassment, lying management, lazy manager who is almost never here."
bad,"as a part time driver and older person in this store , management always catered to the young employees giving them all their requests such as preferred days and hours or work. these young employees said this was just a short term job.  which resulted in taking advantage of the people who wanted to work there"
bad,Was with company for about a year and they change the system on how data was recorded and corporate clean house and alot of people there less the 2 yrs where on the bottom of the list they did alot of wrongful fireing
bad,The management was a huge mess. No one had a handle on the employees. The one thing I learned was customer service.I would have to say I would never go back to Advanced Auto Parts.
bad,"Company recently acquired another company and procedures and not fluent and almost nothing is done to fix a completely out dated system. Autozone our main competitor is leaps and bounds ahead of us on system, personnel, and service to the customer."
bad,"Its an okay place to work. Typical day at work answer phone calls, look car parts up on the computer. install batteries, wiper blades."
bad,"Not much back-stabbing, which is uncommon for retail, but GPS in vehicles was a real drawback. Some local store general management lacked good leadership. Corporate is behind the times in terms of employee growth."
bad,I did not like this job too much. There is a lot of favoritism that occurs throughout the workplace which is in no way shape or form fair.
bad,"When your management, work unbelievable crazy hours, being new created stress. Did enjoy meeting new people. Way too much turnover with employees."
bad,"A lot of lifting and carrying auto parts.  The assistant manager did nothing and demanded that the rest of the employees do everything for her, other than her my co-workers were great people.  The hardest part of the job was having to constantly lift over 50 lbs. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to help customers."
bad,"A group of 8 to 10 other co-workers traveled throughout U.S. Typical work schedule : work a week / off of work for a week."
bad,"it's okay. not my career choice. I really had good times here and bad, overall it was an okay workplace. The management wasn't very understanding or professional."
bad,Company and stores are micromanaged. Happinesss and satisfaction are always out of stock at Advance!
bad,not a fun place to work. management is horrible. hours were terrible.
bad,"I would recommend this company to students who need a part time job. However, I would never recommend the company to anyone looking for a career."
bad,conflicts among workers everyday. not everyone treated the same.
bad,"I worked with some amazing coworkers.  Management is another story.  The company only cares about making money for their shareholders, but could care less about their staffs."
bad,stay away everyone at this company cares about themselves so much so that I have seen calls go to HR only for the person a low level employee bee terminated with no recourse and all the lawyers contacted wanted money up front.
bad,"if you make your numbers they do not care what others worker act rude and poor inter action with other verbal abuse poor langue and little respect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"Very hard place to work.  Long hours systems are out dated, Management not ingaged. No advancement opportunity. Turn over very high, some employees skate by."
bad,"My store had very poor management. This eventually resulted in the store being closed. This was bad location for incoming traffic. There was poor parking space. This created unnecessary traffic, that in return turnt away customers. This site could have benefited from more knowledgeable leaders in not only the automotive industry, but also with experience in management. The site was often short staffed and this prevented trainings for senior employees."
bad,"They tell you what you want to here, and look out for the company only. Your told you can grow, and you controll your shop, but you are micro managed to no end."
bad,"Worked there 2 years had to pull teeth to get a raise also when the Manager and friends call in sick others were stuck pulling a double, poor manager and also a poor District Manager always hiring friends that don’t know anything about a vehicle"
bad,It’s ok for a beginner job but not many promises fulfilled after you are hired but great for fresh out of high school. Not very organized have to go in and fix the location the way you want it
bad,"I worked for Advance for nearly two years. They are all about making money. Not sure if it was just my store manager and district manager or just the company. However, My pay was messed up three times or more. My hours were insane. If I used the time I had earned fr vacation or sick days to take care of my son I was punished for it. I was mentally tortured for a long time. Scared to go to my boss any time something was wrong or I needed help. Got in trouble for following rules and then for trying to do what was best. It was all in all a ""damned if you do,damned if you don't"" situation and always was. They treat you unfairly and the pay is unreasonable."
bad,Company really doesn't seem to care about the part time workers. No raises in two years. Other employees complain all the time. Large turn over and they are always trying to hire.  Most of the time they only get employees that are senior citizens on social security wanting to supplement their income and don't mind working for minimum wage.
bad,"Get everything on paper because management lies even when it’s shown on the employee computer/files, management discusses personal information with employees, management has favorites, other managers talks badly about employees, is not a professional place to work at all"
bad,Dont work for this company the will use and abuse you until they are done.I worked tirelessly never called out always showed up on time but they could never offer me a full time position.
bad,"Poor Management had heavy manager turnover! Poor raises n advanment!  Port regional manager!  No breaks! Promise a raise  by regional manager,never happen!"
bad,Started just over minimum wage and never work hardly any hours. The lack of training because of the store manager lack of concern. I BELEIVE YOU CAN FIND A BETTER PAYING JOB.
bad,I stocked there shelves with new parts and then late morning started delivering new replacement parts and collecting Core parts and payment for new or rebuilt parts in either cash or charge card and then took that to P.N.C. Banks they used from Castle Shannon to Brookline and returned the receipt 0f what I deposited for them. When your day was winding down you did maintenance jobs like replacing burnt out light bulbs or sweeping floors or putting there garbage in the Dumpster.
bad,"Where management allows its managers to threaten employees and customers."
bad,"In a tough economy, I took the job while continuing to look for a job in my field. Was always viewed as a temporary job. Job provide income and health benefits."
bad,When hired was told one starting wage and actually given a lower one. Took six months and still did not get the hourly rate promised.  If you like working long hours for minimum pay it's  for you.
bad,"The management at the Vestal, New York store doesn’t care about you or your family. Management    Doesn’t care that u want alittle hours to work, he doesn’t listen to your wants. Only what he wants.  Pay is minimum. He doesn’t know how to manage hours"
bad,team work is a must and advance lost that years ago. communication and stragady is important in a work place to create excellent customer service and satisfaction. to maintain organized and to provide excellent inventory so that our customers don't go running to our competitiors across the street. in some area where advance sit is NOT a good area. some need more attention than others. a district can not succeed if you only have 10 stores striving and the rest hanging on.
bad,"love the team members i worked with over the years, management has no unity everyone is for themselves. Benefits are not great not family oriented at all."
bad,Company run by people who have nothing to do with Auto Parts. Very poor strategies. Little support from corporate. Lack of Auto Parts knowledge starting to trickle down into lower levels of management. Totally botched CarQuest acquisition.
bad,"unfair wages, worked FT hours but PT status so did not get any benefits. 3 managers within a year. understaffed and under paid. the whole crew left...."
bad,"Advance Auto will make big promises to you about intent to hire you permanently if you are a contractor, but they will cut your throat if they think it will save their stock price. In fact, they literally fired an entire building's contractor staff in Raleigh when they received bad earnings news. They then hired back cheaper contractors to replace them afterward. Do not trust their management under any circumstances! Their marketing staff are also completely out of touch and incompetent, unable to even compete with an awful jingle their competitor has. Advance is an empire teetering on the edge."
bad,This company says its all for family and it wasn't. They can careless about your well being. The only focus is making $$$$$$ and its selfish. This company will do better if cooperate got involved with the stores rather then word of mouth through General managers.
bad,Perspective of workplace culture drastically varies between departments. Large communication disconnect and employee moral breakdown within middle management.
bad,"I am in charge of the front of the store, I am the person that make sure parts are order for the front to keep it stock so that customers can get what they need with out going to the other competitors. I enjoy changing the planogram to per new sales, change of inventory, and a little touch of cleaning so customers wont have to get their hands dirty before they get the chance to do the job."
bad,too much wor for too little of pay. no free time even to pay bills. they will overworkj you and you will not be happy at all. you will be a zombie no lie!
bad,working there is not that bad. you do your normal where house duets from Lift Driver/Order Filler Unloaded Processing. so it is very good place to start
bad,"Horrible management, long hours, stressful, always understaffed because corporate doesn’t want to pay people they’ve hired; which are usually incompetent to begin with."
bad,"After many years with this company, seeing multiple DMs come and go, I decided it was time for me to go."
bad,I’ve been with Advance for 4 years but I feel like u have no life because u work a minimum of 50 hours a week. I enjoy my job but looking for a Monday thru Friday job with no nights.
bad,"Started okay, months in i saw the ugly truth. Don't wanna pay, overworked, cry babies everywhere, backstabbers all over the place. District Managers a waste. Some General Manager's okay, some better off being the District manager. Micro managed, cancelled spifs, bonuses out of reach, labor laws not respected. Just trash."
bad,"Working at Advance Auto Parts was a very demanding job. This job required you to work nights, weekends, and holidays. It was very tough to get a set schedules as it always changed."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, not good to there people, you dont get hours to work so your pay check is not great. The pay is not great, no benefits."
bad,This job was not secure because the hour they gave you fluctuated.They would say that you are part time but then cut your hours to 20 a week. I would recommend this job to college or high school students.
bad,Management needs to refocus on corporate culture.  Still operates as multiple companies which creates friction among employees. There's hope with the new CEO.
bad,"employees are treated as a number, not a person, poor inventory, low pay, high prices, low salaries unless your above store level, i wouldnt reccommend it to anyone"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Advanced to anyone,  the company is dated and not up to date on any user interfaces.  The management was sub-par and all around not geared for anyone to succeed."
bad,Mangers wanted all the raises and wanted to work when they wanted.. worked there almost a year for the same wages and when i was due for a raise they cut my hours..
bad,"This company is full of good people, but the leadership from RVP up lacks the ability to lead this company into the future. Being a GM is the worst job in the company."
bad,I was a gm for the work they put us through it's not worth the compensation my first day as a new store manager I opened and closed with little to no training didn't see my rvp until I was six months into a broken store that the last store manager walked out I got the business back up just for someone to walk in a nit pick the work life separation is nonexistent
bad,"I'd arrive to work, count my drawer in and assign myself to a counter for sales.  I would then put parts away on the floor and in the backroom area.  I would restock shelves that needed product.  I would help customers complete transactions and take phone calls as well."
bad,Very poor management and ungrateful for the extra mile you give to better the store and yourself. Too many non qualified kids that work there and don't care about customers needs or concerns of anything whatsoever and a very dishonest company who changes hours that you worked for
bad,The job is ok but the management is not the best and my boss is a racist. I am a key holder but I don't get benefits or full time hours and my boss does not know how to run the store
bad,Managers are usually a-holes .somewhat low pay. workers know nothing of cars.Look at the you tube videos of this place all managers are like the videos are presented .If u don't sale enough the take your pay partial at least or disciplinary action seen people get fired just cause it was a slow day.
bad,"if you get lucky you get a good store manager, their always raising your goals ( how much money  they want you to make them) and they dont give meaningful wage increases."
bad,"There are in transition between advance auto/carquest is not going well,It is the other way around it will turn out to be carquest Carquest is bring all there  all there own Carquest parts/ not Advance parts"
bad,"Advanced Auto parts is not a good environment in my opinion. When it pertains to the work load and the assignments at task is not a problem, but the work environment and some employees and management are not the best to work with."
bad,Employees compensation & treatment was degrading. Very low employee moral due to upper management. Worst company I have ever worked for. Profit over people. Including customers.
bad,Don't waste your time or efforts for this company. The company is  mis-managed beyond belief.Throw in that they are publicly traded and its a perfect storm.
bad,"Dealing with the public. I learned the general public are always looking for the cheapest if not free auto parts. Management in retail are looking for people who will accept 8.00 dollars an hour and would like 40 hours of work done in one day. I also learned there are a lot of underpaid extremely hard working unappreciated individuals that will never be recognized for their hard work. The hardest part of this job was telling customers that had little or no money, we could not warranty out defective parts that only days past the stated warranty terms. The enjoyable part of this job was the end of your scheduled work shift."
bad,"Unreasonably low pay when other part stores pay more especially for what kind of work you do. GM doesn't care about his employees and shows favouritism when you should have an ""open door policy"", it doesn't exist. People getting promoted within that have violated company policies and it has been brushed under the rug even after HR has been notified, as well as certain people having set schedules when others have been told otherwise by the GM. Unless you're a student or have another job, this place isn't for you."
bad,Management is terrible.  No advancement opportunities unless you are in the click or buddy with management.  Do not apply for Advance Auto Parts.  Further your career by doing anything else.
bad,"the job and job assignments are nice and you dont get bored easily, but overall the pay is quite low... even if some may say that the job is not that hard either"
bad,Come in early and stay late most of the time with no compensation. Working at ground level on a start up with a new WMS such as Red Prairie was a rewarding challenge. Training new team members was also a highlight with my career at AAP. The management team was at one time very close and team oriented but it became divided not by choose but by the system and balance we lacked. Hardest part of the job was staying focused with all the WMS system issue we ran into and the day to day changes that may or may not had been communicated properly. I would have to say that the most rewarding part was working close with the team members  on the floor everyday. Building a team work atmosphere was my number one priority and keeping it maintained was hard at times but so rewarding at the end of the day.
bad,"Schedule constantly changes, management always screws up, and tons of politics. Low pay and high demand and almost always part time."
bad,could have been a fun place to work upper management didnt really care about the boots that were on the ground. alway wanted more.Management was not very good to many issues . Managers were to concerned about the district manager were not with their workers on the floor.
bad,"Retail sales, understaffed, overworked and management who does not care about employees."
bad,"I worked for This Company For almost a year and never received a raise, and the Management was terrible. It seemed to me as if they held their employees back, and the hours where horrible."
bad,"Worked for Advance Auto Parts for years. Never had a problem until the District got a New DM. When the DM came it is like he looked for stuff to pitch a fit about. Everyone worked their hardest to make sure that the store wer up to par, but there was just no making him happy."
bad,"This company is somewhat relax but if your looking for a 9-5 m-f  40hrs a week don’t waste time better for someone who is just getting out of high school. They tell you that they will give you a certain amount of hours but the lie about that, my schedule has changed so much just the few months I’ve been here and I told them I need to have a certain schedule for school  but they don’t care. They talk this talk of being a family but it’s all BS"
bad,The company has poor training and treats people badly. They have entirely to much upper level management and do not give programs time to mature. They do not support employees.
bad,Management was okay but the workers were terrible to work with. pay was too low and the GM would cut everyones hours down very low. very friendly customers though!
bad,The stores barely make goal each day. Management is told to cut employees hours according to sales. Commercial Sales keep store open. If not for the Commercial Customers the store wouldn't be able to stay open.
bad,Advance does not support their people. It is about money. You are just a number. The company allows people to break the rules if they make them money. If you don't you are expendable. They preach take care of your people. But then don't care about family functions or personal life events. It's only take care of them when it is convenientfor the company. Upper level management is either to busy to help you when you need them or they don't care. eitheretothelpw
bad,"Parents don’t let your babies grow up to be Advance Auto Parts employees. I have never been so miss-treated in a job and expected to do so much for so little pay in all my life."
bad,"Everyone is doing what they want and to much playing around, no supported by  certain people and there is lacking a great amount of seriousness in taking the job in being responsible for any smooth running."
bad,"If you've worked there, you'd understand. Poor management, horrible environment, nothing gets done on time, lazyness and Inventory is completly worthless, for backstock. It's an easy job for anyone."
bad,When you first start there it’s cool everyone puts on a facade of this place it great. Once your in it’s a terrible company management have arguments in front the crew and they talk about everyone behind their backs but talk so secretive when it’s something to do with them just don’t make this a career move make this a stepping stone to something better
bad,I have been employed with the company for more than 8 yrs and advancement is non existent unless you are in the group with the get along gang. Most of the store staff are great but of course you have some District Managers that have no respect for the moral of the store. They have no sympathy for you or your outside life its work or nothing. Stay away from this place.
bad,"The store I am currently at is not managed very well. It has become very stressful and just not a fun or enjoyable place to be.If people don't like you, they treat you poorly and the manager does nothing about it."
bad,"A lot of management turnover,  poor upper management,  not very well organized, Advanced and CARQUEST employees management do not get along even though Advanced bought out CARQUEST.  two different work perspectives."
bad,Sale car parts all day answer the phone make sure the customer is getting everything they need and if it’s not in store we order it. The job is real easy it’s not a lot of work to do. Everyone is real nice and out goin
bad,Management is awful. If you a good worker you treated badly.  not friends with the supervisor you be treated badly. I drove rc rr sp. Not a good place
bad,I built this store from ground zero. What's sad is nobody that built this store is around anymore due to managers or drama in the field. I could have been the manager of this store and it would have succeeded. Only part store in town that closes at 7 PM
bad,As a temp enjoy coming to work every day what's got hired it seems like you was on your own training it's horrible Young thug pretty much trained yourself and learn as you go I hate myself told management looking to  learn and move up and be on in the company I'm strong and willing to learn by any cost
bad,"As a contract driver it was difficult to make all the deliveries on the timetable set by the company. No leeway given for traffic detours, accidents, weather etc."
bad,"No hours, low pay, heavy lifting. Fast paced.  The job never went anywhere for me.  Training was PC based.   Learning locations on the job.   Need your own cell phone and GPS for driving deliveries."
bad,"I worked for Advance Auto Parts for 16 years this moves around to various stores to help fix situations with lack of sales. It's always successful in being able to help the stores get back on their feet and was told numerous times that I would be, store manager and have my own store. It's never happened though I was always told maybe next time maybe next time and I got tired of the maybe next time so I decided to leave with my head held high knowing that I was worth more with their offering."
bad,I enjoyed the employees they were great. Management needs a lot of work with employees though. manager shows favoritism to some. I would not tell anyone about a job there.
bad,If your not on the inside your on the outside. Not a good place to be Not worth wasting time on this but I need to use 150 minimum charachters not proper training or management.
bad,"Difference from recruiting to actual job as a manager in training. Fast paced and hard to get used to, especially if the training is sporadic at best and you're basically thrown on the sales floor your first day. The store manager was not a good trainer at all."
bad,basketball games softball games family fun days holiday meals drawings awards to team members for best attendance and for being hard workers bake sale
bad,wrap pallets and tote pallets and load on the trailer. it is a nice company to work for to start off had a great experience working as a team. learned great team building.
bad,"Since the very first day Advance took ownership of CarQuest, the company I knew & love started to go south quickly."
bad,I enjoy the people at Advance but there is not very much room to advancement in the company and seniority is held much higher than performance. I would like a job that I can be rewarded for doing a good job and have the chance to move up in the company.
bad,"Management does nothing to correct any problems throughout the day (i.e. passing problems off to anyone else). Compensation is minimal for the type of work expected, and there is no room for advancement; even if there were, the raise would be literal pennies on the dollar."
bad,"You're gonna bust yourself while management sits arnd getting sales. ""customers first"" employees DNT matter. Theyll continue to lose employees if it continues."
bad,Management needs to be consistant and fair with employees hours and advancement opportunities. Female workers deserve the same respect and advancement opportunities as the male employees.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of making sales, assisting customers, and organizing inventory. Learned key components to parts sales and good costumer relations."
bad,come in clock in put up truck or scan it in then put it up order parts help customers answer phones organize clean count registers count safe answer any questions solve any problems
bad,this is more consistent of nothing and when the day is going. Ok so this is not enough to qualify so I will keep saying almost nothing and see if it works with a longer statement
bad,"The lack of leadership at advance auto was very shocking to me. The general manager was hardly ever there  and when they were there, they didnt want to provide any kind of customer service."
bad,"I have learned their company system of how to search, order and cash vehicle parts out. I've learned how to control my anger in stressful situations. I've also learned how to communicate with difficult individuals to troubleshooting problems."
bad,"I loved working there for the most part until I had to repeatedly report a coworker for harassment. Then when I had to report that he was threatening me for speaking up they pulled me into HR and said they could either fire us both or I could deal with it. They turned it around on me and told me I brought it upon myself. A lot of the management in DC 31 is backwards and they refuse to cooperate with each other. One person says one thing, another tells you something different."
bad,"If you don't need a lot of hours & don't want to move up in position, Advance Auto Parts is the place for you. Little to no raises, hours are 20 a week or less, the only exception is if you're the only driver working at that location. No real chance of moving up, even in the store. Hours were erratic. Expect to cover shifts EVERY TIME the full timers want time off. You will be EXPECTED to cover them. No paid time off, no benefits, plus now the parts they're getting aren't even in the right boxes, so you get an earful whenever customers come back. A lot was expected of me, and there was no compensation for the added responsibilities. Decent job if you're in college or retired & need a little extra cash. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
bad,No accountability. Lack of pay. Didn’t promote within the company. Corporate should provide incentives for the part time workers that are doing all the work. The one pro was meeting new customers daily.
bad,"decent place to work unrealistic sales goal if you dont reach them you get written up no inter promotion only get people from outside hired in who dont know what they are doing, raises are few and far in between, learn a lot about auto parts and customer service which is good but again they ask for way too much for too little pay company treats its employees not very well at all. always worried about not having a job the next day"
bad,The job is not a bad job but the low pay and no benefits make this a job that can't support an individual nor a family.  The workplace environment can sometimes be difficult given the customers attitude and other employees.
bad,"I was hired part time but I work 35-40 hours a week for 9.35 an hour. and it still does not pay the bills or my childs daycare.  We have two drivers a day, we run our butts off and make close to nothing. too much favoritism."
bad,"If you are able to handle a fast pace work environment, this would definitely be a job for you. Teamwork, great communication skills and the ability to work in highly stressful situations is a must as far as requirements skills, not to mention one must also have automotive and computational knowledge."
bad,"A typical work day at Advaance will start off slow. As the day goes on it will get very busy. Customers, and deliverys the customers comes first. As a moblie pro delivery to shops. At times it would be to drivers. At times it would get crazy with deleverys back up and trying to figure out witch direction to go."
bad,"a lot has changed in my time in advance.  failed acquisitions have lowered bonus totals, pay increases, and incentives for team members and customers."
bad,"Advance auto parts will suck you dry, it will take every will you have to live any ounce of pride you have left and squeeze it all out of you until you are a robot who can not think for themselves and when they have you in that situation they take advantage of you and treat you like your garbage."
bad,Working for Advance. I was asked to prove myself as a manager by fixing one of the worst looking and performing stores in the district. Within 12 months this store became the best looking a greatest preforming store in the district. Winning the best store in the district award 2005. Still didn't get promoted or move to a close location to my house.
bad,"Worked at advance distribution for 6 months on a weekend shift. was hired to work 40 hours Friday through Sunday but was worked 7 days a week for 28 straight days. This resulted in 80 hours weeks; causing extreme fatigue in employees whom began having at the least 3 accidents a day and began walking out. Pot heads steer clear!"
bad,Scheduling nightmare. no home/family time. Not near enough money compared to the responsibilities put on you. Not enough time between schedule being made and when you find out when you have to work.
bad,"I worked for advance for almost 2 year, it's fun, fast past, learn new things, the store manager was flexible with my schedule (when she remembered)...but the pay is horrible not enough to pay bills...store manager played favorites. Some team members (particularly who she had a crush on) could get away with murder, come into work a hour or two late and there would not be any repercussions. While others would get a write up for being 10 mins late. Manager would often change the schedule at the last min and would not notify anyone of the revised schedule, which led to another write up. I was a mpp (mobile parts pro) when there isn't any deliveries we had to do retail associate duties. Drivers would often steal other drivers deliveries just to get out of the store. But over all not a bad place."
bad,There is no way I could say anything positive about this job management was terrible. I was the only employee that did any work.
bad,weekend shift hours were 12 hour days. hot and stuffy. not much ventalation in summer months. The co works are mainly rude and although you're told they speak english as a requiremnt they do not. hard to interact with co works due to language barrier/
bad,Management is lazy. Inventory is never correct. Most employees know nothing about what they are talking about. Unfair pay.
bad,The company itself is all about a dollar and not customer satisfaction. Part time jobs are a complete joke and the full time will have a hard time advancing.
bad,all opportunities for advancement have dried up.  no faith in team to do a good job.  management not supported.  products are failing.
bad,"Enjoy working there but management is poor, employees get no benefits and advancement is hit or miss. Nice getting to know shops and other walk in customers but rather work for them."
bad,"I, like everyone in the store, I was just a number. No opportunities for advancement. Instead of spending time training their employees for management positions, they relied on new management personnel  from other retail corporations."
bad,delivered parts stocks shelves answer phones. co workers were awesome. i learned a lot about cars. was able to get to know customers needs.
bad,Female store manager was a lesbian and disliked male employees. Manager used male employees an escape goat when store had internal management problems. Manager very unethical in manage style
bad,To serve the community in a fast and friendly way. A typical day at work is very busy and has to work in a fast friendly past.
bad,"Will schedule people 8-14 days in a row without a break. They hire everyone as part-time to start. They lowball the heck out of anyone working there especially if female. Yes, men make lots more money for doing the SAME job. The job is simple, they push sales on ALL workers including drivers. This company does not care about their employees. Management is allowed to fire anyone without prior issues."
bad,"Store manager was nonexistent and had District Manager in his back pocket. My position itself was a delight at times, but was stuck picking up the slack after the General Manager."
bad,You were suppose to work 70 hours plus even if your family suffered.
bad,I was RPP and inventory control specialist but my job was based on sales goals that I didn't meet for 2 months.I was demoted mid shift after all I had completed my tasks.My manager and 3 others knew this for a month.I did everything to set the store up for sales and promotions which in turn set everyone in the store up to meet or exceed their goals.I enjoyed the job up until then ..your hard work and dedication goes un noticed because you were $2 short of you goal
bad,"Worked there for a couple of years. They wanted people who knew about cars but they didn't pay anything. You can earn up to a dollar more an hour making french fries than you can selling auto parts for Advance. When they changed managers, 4 employees over 50 were gone within 6 months. Hard to prove discrimination and not worth the effort for the little bit they pay their employees. Never a pay raise no matter how many years you work for them"
bad,Gave this company my heart and soul blood sweat and tears for 5 years only to get sold out by management to weak to stand up for me against corporate.
bad,"Upper management is the reason I left this company. You cannot do what is necessary to build business because the district Managers play favorites with the stores. You are just a number and very replaceable, and they make that known."
bad,Job was okay but company doesnt care about you at all. I really loved working there but when things would fet tough they were no help. There’s no respect for employees that have stuck with the company.
bad,"Worked as a driver, the first few months will seem chill but then the truth comes out. The General Manager was lazy, had no clue how to actually run a store and didn't care about commercial despite commercial making the store all of the money. If your a driver don't expect a raise even if you help out with things that's not in your job description."
bad,Management is a joke . Job is fool proof but they will over work you and you will not be compensated for the work you do. Some co workers are Good people. Others get by doing the minimum.
bad,"They will work you to an extent, where is when you leave your job ,you're not worth a dime very short staffed....Not good management 👎👎👎👎If you're a favorite you have a chance to move up...."
bad,"I really only found the hours I was asked to work convenient. The pay is low, and you will need to work in the rain and snow to install batteries. This is not fully described in the job listing."
bad,"Typical work day is helping customers get the right parts for the job they are doing.  Doing inventory counts, setting up sections of the store, changing prices in the store, setting up deliveries to pro customers.  I've learned a lot working with this company.  They have great training and the pro customers are always willing to give advice.  Store management has been great,  but their hands are tied on most issues.  They are not given much flexibility to run the store.  At out store we have a great team that works very well together.  We find it best to be able to joke around and mess with each other while still getting the job done.  The hardest part of the job is reaching your sales goals while keeping the store running.  There is more work to do than employees to do it.  You end up spending more time setting up  areas of the store than helping customers.  The best part is when you are able to help a customer out of a jam and save them money by helping them do the job on their own instead of having to take their car to someone to fix."
bad,They keep you on as part time and make you work 35-40 hours a week.  No pay increase.  Even when becoming a key holder.  1 1/2 years and finally got a pay increase of $0.65.  Was told I was getting $1.25.  Short handed cause no one wants to work there for the pay.  No vacation time cause they keep you tagged as part time.  Management is a joke.  Doing GM and AGM's job because the store never has both.
bad,"Management, employees, and customer base still somewhat stuck in the ‘women belong in the kitchen’ mindset. They expect you to do your job as well as your coworkers AND bend over backward for management, while barely paying you. Lies about promotions, raises of .10/year (if that) because upper management is greedy."
bad,Hardest part of the job was dealing with how management responded to a busy day or any sort of issue. They do Provide online training about a vehicles systems and have a bunch of information available on how cars and trucks work.
bad,"Managers don’t care the GM and ops managers are never on the floor in the summer I guess they scared to leave their AC office, all someone has to do is say your harassing them because they are not working and you can lose your job, if a male manager thinks a female is pretty she gets all his attention even if it’s his team lead that’s telling him it’s not true... overall they don’t care about employees (I was there 7yrs) why I stayed I have no idea ... I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WORKING AT DC31 Remington... been open 8 yrs and already been through 5-6 GM..lost so many good ppl there because of favoritism.. so much drama and rumors even the head of security is involved in the drama and rumors .turnover so high in the last 3months they lost 2 managers 4 team leads and multiple TM...horrible place to work need to fire all managers too to bottom."
bad,"Upper management didn't care about anything but numbers. Went thru 7 managers in 41/2 years at job. Got a promotion but was never paid right and other employee were upset I got job because they were there longer, even if they were not qualified for job. Out of store management was no help, actually made my job harder. Would not recommend long time employment. They do not value good workers."
bad,"Hot as hll in the summer time in that place. They say you will work 10 hrs but you leave when the job is done, which may be 11 or 12 hrs. They spring overtime on you @ the last min. Mgmt has favorites. So don't look to advance in advance"
bad,Very low paying company that has no benefits for part time employees. I’ve had 3 different managers in the 4 plus years I’ve worked there. They have been easy to get along with generally. Upper management only care about sales and how good the store managers can make them look. Little to no advancement opportunities.
bad,"Problem is the new DM is ex AutoZone and all the GN's were from AutoZone!!!!! Just call all the stores here in Las Vegas NV AutoZone cuz that's what they are!!!! I loved my job and did my best every day.  I was told I was promoted to AGM and it never happened!!!!!! It's not the company,  but the DM who is to blame.  He got rid of a lot of long time employees and replaced them with people from AutoZone!!!!!"
bad,Some stores are better than others .Not impressed by all of the computer updates with a lack of tech support. Lack of understanding from upper management for employee family time and availability.
bad,Worked there for 13 months and I had 4 district managers in that time. During that time I did not have a DM for three months. Each district manager had different ideas and no consistency on a clear business path.
bad,Advance Auto is a great company however at this location the management was poor.On average I work the minimum of 25 hours a week if that. Working part-time Harley there was any benefits.
bad,The hours always change weekly. very stressful fast pace work conditions. The company only looks out for the company not it's employees. Company made over 1.3 billion dollars and still pay employees poorly
bad,"Great people "
bad,I went through three different general managers within less than a year. The only manager that had experience was the person who hired me. He quit due to having poor district management. The company takes employee concerns as a joke. Unnecessary stress that no one needs. I had several items stolen from my purse while working to the point I stopped carrying one. I complained to upper management and nothing was done. I worked at one of the Kalamazoo locations. Overall its not worth it unless you are applying to be a manager.
bad,we was never provided with uniforms we had to buy them. we got no breaks and they would schedule us short hours to make sure we didnt get a break at all.
bad,The management does not help u to succeed at all the workers do what they please there's no place for advancement the customers are awesome and they appreciate your help
bad,Great stepping stone company. Learned a lot about where in wanted to end up in a career and how I could achieve those goals. Would recommend employer.
bad,Demanding. Disorganized. Confused regional leadership.  Some district manager accountability. Disconnect between store and regional leadership. Frustration. Requires managers to work 11-12 hours a day. No autonomy for manag
bad,"Company is on the decline.  Trying to do too much too fast and none of it is a solid product.  All programs are half baked then rolled out to see what sticks and none are getting traction. "
bad,I am underpaid and frequently deceived.  Senior staff express dismay at the decline in effective management over the last 10 years.  All the store GMs I have encountered lack a certain degree of professionalism and integrity.  Everyone of the ones I have met have told me at least one lie and or omitted information.
bad,"No hay consideración para el empleado, aplicas para transfer y no lo aprueban. No hay prioridad para los estudiantes."
bad,"Because of the way the CEO run the company, the goals for the team were physically unreachable. He required each Team Member to achieve a daily Sales Per Hour (SPH). If this was not met on a monthly basis the team member was written up by me and after three they were terminated. "
bad,nothing to say there is a lot of friendship and nepotism. works who have been there 12+ years are over looked because of who knows who are who can gain something from the hiring of a  freiend
bad,"I chose to work here because I was going to school during the day.  In 3 years, my pay has increased by $2.20, and my responsibilities have more than doubled. Limited social life outside of work, due to the retail schedule. no PTO, sick time, holiday pay, vacation time for part time employees. Insurance benefits are ridiculously expensive and you get terrible coverage. "
bad,"This is a company that will pay the cheapest dollar for it's employees. As a veteran I'm glad I got a job opportunity, but that is it. When it comes to benefits only plus is the health care, but you will only get it if you are working full time."
bad,"The schedule is very unbalanced. One day you'll work something like a noon to close, the next day you're working an 8AM to 6PM. Or even on some weeks, you'll have 39.5 hours, and the next week you barely have 18. There is no balance on what days you have on or off, the management is terrible. Most of the people are a blast to work with and the environment is nice."
bad,"Manager always sick.  Not keeping up with employees, and always changing the schedule causing a serious loss in employees."
bad,The pay is low. The average employee tenure is low as well. The companies computer systems are 10 years behind the competitors and fail frequently. A perfect job for someone who doesn't care about anything.
bad,"the job is very inconsistent , there are some serious safety issues within the warehouse, the pay is horrible, management says raises are coming and never do"
bad,"excpected to stay till the shipping lanes are finished with uneven workloads on each lane make some habe to stay hours later than others, poor management and team work. there's practically no time for home life due to the schedules management has imposed. no morning shifts."
bad,"There are not enough hours at my store. New people are being hired as store closing hours are earlier. Store manager will not do any heavy work and puts it off on anyone else. Constantly makes threatening comments about employees losing their jobs. We are losing customers left and right because of this manager but I believe if we had someone better, my opinion would be different about the company."
bad,"It's a good job for a college student or an elderly people who don't have a need for a higher than average pay. If I had to travel to the store to work, it wouldn't be worth it."
bad,Typical days are boring. At max advancement of what there is to learn. Not enough managers.Mostly white women and men. Dealing with customers who think you are the reason why there car is broken. The autopart discount.
bad,"Delivery parts to business, pulled the parts to be delivered wrote return forms so customer got credit, collect payments on accounts. Put freight out when truck arrives, straighten shelves."
bad,"The management is poor and unsympathetic towards an employees mental needs and the needs of their family. Refuses to put in sick time, and then uses those absences against you."
bad,"If you do your job too well, they expect more from you and wont let you move up. Now I am a driver and getting paid driver salary like everyone else, but I am expected to do not only our stock, stocking shops, covering manager in her absence (even lunch), doing management stuff using mangers sign in and password  (drivers are not allowed to do), making her job easier, my job harder."
bad,Extremely high turnover. No culture at all. Senior management a constant revolving door. Constant new programs to replace those that were barely started.
bad,Advance Auto Parts is a company in transition. It is in between a retail auto parts chain and a commercial driven chain. There are some very good team members in the company and it will do well once the company defines it's culture and stays consistent with driving that culture daily.
bad,"managers expect you to do everything while they sit and do nothing, you don't get recognition and customer service stinks , i didn't like the way they work you it was very unfair , and they got rid of me when i got injured ."
bad,It's a good place to work. Atmosphere is fun an productive. People are nice. Help teach you about parts. Advancement is hard. No benefits for part timing.
bad,"min wage pay, no advancement without knowing someone, very small raise that everyone gets pennies from one or two dollars that the store must share. expects a lot of work for little pay"
bad,"Compensation was low for the hours worked and the sales growth achieved over the 8 year period. I improved sales from $378,000 to $2,500,000. The fast paced environment was great."
bad,the pay at this company sucks no overtime have you working long excessive hours for minimal pay almost no chance of advancement opportunity i wouldn't ever work for this company again
bad,"This job for a part timer is not what you except, customers come in with very nasty attitude in which you have to deal with. I have learned to navigate for parts a little bit better than I already did. Management is not that bad, they do expect a lot from you being said you are only a part timer. Hardest part of the job is getting a raise and you do not get any time off or paid vacation. They just use you pretty much."
bad,"Good job for kids or elderly ppl, I actually loved this job for a long time. I eventually left because of a head boss that had his head up his a hole. Too stressful and intimidating environment for $11.00 an hour"
bad,"I enjoyed the job meeting/greeting customers the environment was great, learned something and about cars learned a lot about car parts and there uses.  I enjoyed always being on feet and learning new things. enhancing my knowledge on cars and car parts."
bad,poor management and  leadership with little to no control over employees. Management allows favorite employees to dress unprofessional and not fallow company dress code along with rude and unprofessional behavior.
bad,"Pay is awful to start.  Advancement within company is difficult past shift manager.  Schedule is variable from open to close and never the same.  Upper management is often corrupt.  Forced incentive programs affect performance reviews,  Ex.  SPEED PERKS even though it is dependent on the customersame decision.  Would not recommend"
bad,"Pay is low and advancement is nonexistent. Management doesn't communicate well and does not invest in their employees. Very top heavy. However, there is good work/life balance. In the accounting department most people pack up and leave at 5, including management. This is not a place to grow your career and the environment is petty. No stability and lots of turnover with management not investing in cross training. No internal growth and they prefer to hire mid level managers externally which can make it hard at times because you constantly have to teach new leaders and that level has high turnover.  The merchandise accounts payable department is highly repetitive and expect to do only one task over and over again. I think it's a good place to stop over until your next career move, otherwise I would not work here. The environment is hostile towards women, especially women of color."
bad,"I gave 4 years of my life to this company.  Highs and lows, but there is so much upper management change, it is hard to feel secure in any position you are in.  The lines of communication are non existent.  I would not suggest for long term aspirations or upper management aspirations.  General Management is the best position in this company"
bad,Pay is terrible but the people are good depending on location. Easy job fast to advance overall a good place people wise management is awful and pay is terrible.
bad,Good place to work just the pay is bad and no room to advance. The pay was bad but hour were flexible good team envirment plenty of hours! Good training.
bad,"always moving around to finish task"
bad,"At Advance the Management seems to bend the rules in the way that best fits them and seems to be very dishonest. The manager often times requires the assistant manager to clock her out several hours after she has already left, She also often falsifies records of hours for employees by creating a schedule to send to the district manager getting it approved, and then creates a completely different schedule. She gives low hours and refuses to work around schedules."
bad,"low wages, expect a lot for low pay, stores vary widely, some good some bad, all depends on the store manager, corporate has little control over stores and managers can act as they see fit if you get a bad manager leave the job asap"
bad,"Commercial Account Manager - Savannah Ga"
bad,did not like the people and not a good place to work not good benifits and job advancedment oppertunities and not very realistic on days off and very poor scheduling
bad,"just know this, you get hired mobile pro, they going to have you doing  installation and register  and everything else in between"
bad,"If you're 50 and don't mind working every weekend with very little pay and no room for advancement, this is the perfect job for you."
bad,"Routine work bases, strong customer loyalty and relationships. The co-workers may get too personal and rub you the wrong way but the job brings along the craving of advancement and creating a better work environment."
bad,"Fairly fun workplace, but low pay and odd hours. The typical day can be busy from opening to close. I like this because it helps the day pass faster"
bad,"It was not a good experience. I worked for them for 12 years and advancement seemed impossible. Once you did really well in a position, they tried to force you to do that job from there out. Most coworkers exhibited a bad attitude."
bad,"One of my major issues working here was that a lot of stuff was continually stolen by management and when it was discovered, they blamed it on the Sales Representatives. The managers often treated employees with disrespect and occasionally harassment of females. They were not held responsible for these actions. They did not give consistent hours and would  often change the schedule frequently in hopes of having an employee they wanted to fire miss a day so they had an excuse. They often lied to customers and oversold products that the customer did not need or sold them the wrong part all together causing the person who did the return to receive significant backlash. If a Sales Representative refused to do something for a customer that was against store policy, the costumer could call corporate and the employee would get in trouble.  They is also consistent sexism from both the customers and the employers. "
bad,"Advance Auto Parts is not a career for those seeking to sit and watch the world go by. A typical day offers the opportunity to serve the needs of multiple customers with automotive problems from start to finish. New approaches and processes are the order of business due to competion. By design, the automotive industry is outlined with specialty parts and products. Advance has the benefit of having a few outstanding performers in critical positions to ensure that the team can survive. "
bad,"This company doesn't want a real parts store. It only wants a capitalist money grubbing culture. The only people there for the customers are true counter help which is hard to find. They will hire anyone, even someone who admits openly that they do not care to learn or advance their skills with parts and knowing the automotive industry. They are highly dependant on the low wage worker, the daily grinder, the managers are only in it for the money and never truly work and if so they are slashing prices left and right for friends but can never do a favor for their team members. It disgusts me that they are so careless. All they care about is appearance and SPH. Planogram this and not to planogram that. WHich amazes me because the people making the planograms I know are desk jockeys who do not know a single thing about the parts. It's remarkable."
bad,Most of the management are hired directly into there positions because of experience unrelated to the automotive field
bad,I think the job is good but its not exactly what I'm looking for.  I am wanting a full time job with room for advancement. I don't receive enough hours to provide for my family. I am pretty open to hours throughout the day and shifts. 
bad,"The auto parts delivery driver position was nice with this company too.  The company, Advance Auto, at that time, went through to many ""managers"".  Working conditions were not good, to many mixed signals on the job and in every direction, very poor management."
bad,"For this employee I was a team member responsible for ensuring optimum customers service. Parts sales was my required task. Also, I maintained the appearance of the store inventory management and merchandising."
bad,Already had experience in auto parts. Trained other people coming in to store. Found out that the men were making more money then I was. Asked for a raise after they asked to drive for the store. So I was driving and running the register and when commercial manager was not their or on vacation I would run his area too. The hardest part was being lied to over and over again about my raise and wasting 3 years of my life not accomplishing anything. New store manager came into the store and was a man and he treated he woman there awful. Two woman left after a month of abuse. Not to waste my time if I'm not accomplishing anything.
bad,The manager always left and dumped all her work load on every one else with out any instuctions on how to occoplish anything
bad,"Manage all comercial accounts and maintance on the vehicels, routing of deleiverys and time managment of drivers."
bad,"My day started out differently everyday. I had several opportunities to learn almost all aspects of the receiving department, We also cross trained in different departments. My immediate supervisor was awesome. My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand when needed. The hardest part of my job was loosing it. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friends I had made and could trust."
bad,This job was not what I expected. It was suppose to be a job so I could get ASE Certified and it turned out to be very stressful. Mainly because of poor management. I was fired because someone in the store didn't like me and said that I was applying for Autozone which never happened. I reported misconduct to the district manager and that didn't count for anything. Management made the job a lot harder than it needed to be. Selling auto parts is not a hard task. Helping customers to me is not a hard task and everywhere I turned around the store manager was always frustrated with customers. I reported that as well and still got turned down.
bad,Not the best company for advancement if your over 40 years old. I was left out of two promotions. The jobs were given to people half my age. I wasn't given an equal opportunity. Overall training is poor.
bad,When your hired on as a part time employ yet work40 to. 60 hours every week you don't automatically get full time benefits. No accruing vaca or sick time.  And when you finally push enough to get full time benefits they put it off time and time again!
bad,Decent place to work.  Upper management doesn’t care about their employees.  Expect to make sales even when there is no customers in the store for hours
bad,All in all with a decent job I like getting it out of the store and driving around and delivering parts but you no need to know this save your money in the summer time cuz in the winter time they cut your hours to the point where if you didn't save your money you won't be able to pay your bills in the winter time because they cut your hours to the point where you can't pay your bills
bad,Management does poor job keeping people on staff. Will hire anyone even with no knowledge or experience. Doesn't offer many options to those who wish to advance their career.
bad,"Part stores attract a very specific type of DIY automotive customer. If this is your crowd you might fit right in. With high turnover and difficulty hiring, you will have no shortage of hours."
bad,i loved it here but you are giving more than you are worth. well at least in my eyes any way i need to branch out and see whats out here that will make me feel balanced in my work area.
bad,"If you like petty, this is the job for you. I spent a year and a half here and I do not miss it at all. You are expected to know everything by customers and management, for barely above minimum wage."
bad,it was interesting and fun but not the career I was going for. besides that I enjoyed the job and working there. they need more hands on work then they have.
bad,"Advance auto parts is a good place to work, if your just looking for a job. If you are interested in a career I would not recommend that due to lack of competition of pay."
bad,Dont pay enough. Worked good hrs just not enough money.  Lots of responsibility for what they pay.  Good for teenagers but then no reliability on what you buy
bad,"Over emphasis on corporate profits with little concern for the workers.  Managers often had poor people skills and poor management skills.  Generally, the workers were pleasant and fun to work with."
bad,"The company's values are great .How ever they need to have accountability for those values work.End of story.."
bad,"It was a change for me. I was making more money, but it was so  unorganized and it drove me nuts. I was able to help with the unorganized stuff while I worked there until I had another job opportunity."
bad,Not very good environment for females to advance. Had issues getting the promotion I was promised. Corporate did not want to do anything about it. They actually tried to pay a Male more money than me that was under me.
bad,"If a store or company goes out of business or is put out of business, it has to stop trading because it is not making enough money.If the company goes out of business, the claim of the preferred stock is junior to that of any debt but senior to that of common stock."
bad,"What the title says.  Avoid unless you have no choice, or you just really like auto parts."
bad,Unfair all the way around.  When it is time for promotions they interview one person.  Then give the spot to someone who didnt get a interview.  Raises dont happen only about 1 every 4 years
bad,"Manager would often use vulgar racist slang. On the plus side he no longer works for Advance. The problem was,nothing was done about his behavior. Don't work here."
bad,"Advance Auto is a very stressful place to work, due to the lack of communication and training. They hire bodies, not workers. Corporate doesn't seem to care about employees or working conditions"
bad,Worked with them for over a year and they offered me a 20 cent raise when i would close for them almost every weekend! Other than that i learned a lot about cars and was a good experience!
bad,Working in register taking care of customers saling auto parts over counter. Doing inventory counting safe and drawers. Clean store closing and open every day
bad,The team I had was excellent but the district manager kept switching which also lead to constant changes with how they wanted the store ran and advancement was almost impossible
bad,Management not truthfull with employees concerning sales and hours given to workers ie hours cut to save money then new hires added at the same time?  Suggestion box needed and ideas should be discused by upper management! People working on the floor see what is going on real time- not seating in some office behind a desk!
bad,"Advance used to be a great place to work. I was excited to go into work every day. As time went on and they got new upper management, I dreaded going to work. I would sit in my car in the parking lot and dream of just turning around and going home. The company has progressively gone downhill over the past few months and no one above store management seems to care."
bad,"Typical work day includes coming in, delivering parts as needed, and working the sales floor when not."
bad,1st we stretch have a meeting about the work for day i learned how to use a rf scanner management could have done better spanish culture not knowing spanish made it harder best time was leaving
bad,"This location really struggles due to lack of leadership from the manager. I had no personal issues with him, but he is simply stuck in his ways and does not provide leadership to team members. Lack of training and direction is the biggest problem."
bad,a company thats out for themselves never looked out for its employees. left a store with no manager for more than four months while the employees scrambled to keep the store open. never felt appreciated.
bad,Working there wasn't too bad of an experience. It taught me a lot of things and gave me some good experience. Only two complaints is management there is very poor and they pick favorites of who gets treated better. Second I always bad to worry about losing more and more hours due to other people coming in and out of the job.
bad,The job is boring and slow. Then some day's are like a feeding frenzy and you can't keep up. Learned to type pretty quick. My manager was awsome and smart. I enjoyed being around customers.
bad,id say the hardest part of this job was the employees because they would just hire anyone that put in a application. the manager would mess around way to much.
bad,Many locations are so needy to hire people they get in whomever will apply regardless of knowledge of products or lack of mechanical skill. So many customers are faced with people who really don't know how to help them but are willing to keep selling them the wrong parts.
bad,"I started as a driver and I really enjoyed it.  Then the managers want to changing too much for my. The last manager was crazy, he was doing things that didn't make sense to me or anyone.  I was stressed out everyday."
bad,"It was Great when I first started, then management changed and it went down the drain. I always thought I'd go back once management left, but it got to the point where all my co-workers left and there was no reason really to return. management kept getting rid of people thinking the workers are the issue when really it was never any of the sales workers."
bad,Rigid culture. Not very flexible. Getting hours scheduled can be tough if you don't have the best relationship with management. Not a great experience.
bad,"High notes"
bad,"i did not enjoy working for this company. I believe the customer service is better at AutoZone, the staff is quicker to help and find the parts you need."
bad,"very excellent if you want to work.good benefits,good hours can work every day of the week open seven days a week.start as delivery driver and worked my way up learn alot working for this great company."
bad,It's a place just to say you have a job until one can acquire better. Poor management skills is the worst part of operating a business. That's primarily why the DC 27 Warehouse is closing its doors permanently in Dec.
bad,I enjoyed my early years with them. I was a key older in two months and part of management. I transferred to another location to better myself and was steamed rolled by existing management. So I left to do something completely different.
bad,"Low pay for laborous, hazardous materials that workers deal with everyday: Battery Acid, heavy Auto Parts and unrealistic unattainable sales goals to reach in order to get bonuses. They find what your weakness is and they use your weakness as an excuse to not give you a raise. They don’t even give a raise to keep up with inflation."
bad,"Very stressful, bad management. Didn't enjoy job at all. No pay raises.  No health insurance.  NO vacation time. no sick leave. No AC in vans. Bad work environment all the way around."
bad,retail management doesn't care about most of the general managers are crooks and only care about there bonus. hours aren't enough to have a good pay c
bad,"Average  workplace, barely organized, very short on staff members, and always low on change at the register for customers. The management team barely gets by"
bad,they have stores all across the country with many different positions open and available if you had to relocate. the company is fast pace and exciting.
bad,"Advance Auto parts is not a fault here. It is the managers and how they operate. The raises are very low, and rare. The promotions, are most of the time, not within the store. The training is very inadequate, as well as, slow paced. The company is not at fault. It is what the managers decide to do with what they are given that causes this problem"
bad,"Sales and operations. Helping customers, performing inventory functions. Overseeing operations day to day, week to week. Training and developing your team. Always recruiting/looking for help as staff is always coming and going."
bad,"Mangers was great.... 5 years ago"
bad,Typical day at work pull parts learned how to work scanner gun how to package car parts  and how to recycle parts run a  assembly line. The most enjoyable part about working here is helping others.
bad,might as well work at McDonalds if you plan on working here as a p on. commercial sales is ok tho. can b a good role before looking for a better sales job
bad,"This company flies by the seat of its pants. They throw things against the wall and waits to see what sticks. They are cryptic in how they will pay you, and they will tell you one thing then management goes and asks the total opposite of it."
bad,"Can be a fun place to work at, sometimes very stressful.  Most Managers lack knowledge of their own department,  some managers do not do their jobs at all & are more worried being friendly to employees than handing out warnings when appropriate.  A lot of favoritism, not much opportunity for growth."
bad,"Cashier, battery and wiper installer, stock front room, sweep and vacuum front room, clean bathrooms, deliver parts to commercial accounts, answer phones, use computers, count down registers, invoice customers, no room for growth even though you are promised"
bad,"It's a very stressful fast paced work environment especially in a management position , the district managers, HR department are very shady people and will do anything to get ahead."
bad,Management was poor. Nobody showed up to do there job. If you did your job well enough you got to do others jobs as well. No room for growth in the company
bad,"Very unfair and very rascist place to work.  It’s not the best place to work for minority’s as you will see working there , it isn’t much of a variety of people. Advancement is only available to the selected inner circle. They will be amongst the other business’ to close in America if they’re not careful"
bad,My time at Advance was very hard at times and mostly a little stressful working with some supervisors and management . I think for the most part it was not a bad place to work.
bad,"This company is a good one for people that do not want more out of life, that do not want to work outside, and from what I can see want to avoid physical labor at all costs."
bad,"Decent pay and okay work, but poor leadership decisions hamper progress. Mass layoffs in 2017 and behind with competition still makes 2018 a risk for working here in terms of job security."
bad,"really need to look into management at a lot of locations. leave store on the clock and don't return for hours, just never had enough staff to get stuff done. customers constantly complained about store manager not ordering parts. manager always came to work with dog hair all over his clothes..his breath would knock you down from bad breath.."
bad,Helping customers find the parts for their  cars or trucks to keep it running correctly. Keeping the store clean and organized. Making drops from the register
bad,got attitude and reprimanded every time I asked a question and tried to learn something and ironically also got reprimanded when making a mistake despite poor training and attitude when trying to learn and was promised to go full time and hours just reduced and reduced till I wound up with 5 hours a week
bad,worked a lot of hours for little compensation especially since being hired as a store manager.  job eas more of a pain than it was worth.  never heard anything but negative from hgher up
bad,"With new district manager continuing to cut hours and store manager unable to lay them out so everyone gets hours fairly, schedual it’s constantly a mess, also barely room for promotion do to they only want one ‘retail parts pro’ in the store so that the current “RPP” doesnt have to split his bonus..."
bad,This place really could be a good place to work if they could get quality people to work there. working with a manager that knows nothing that is hiring people that know nothing is stressful.
bad,Pay was not good. No benefits. bad management.  I learned the area  I was working in.  Workplace culture was bad.  Hard part of job was getting the parts delivered in winter weather.
bad,it really would not be bad but the manager was always on my case even when i was doing things right. um lets see not treated very well by coworkers always felt like i was an outcast and respected for what i did know and not very good at training basicly u have to not be average to work here
bad,"With consistent change in all levels of management, the focus of the business became vague. A very challenging and rewarding place of work transformed into an unstable work/life balance."
bad,"stressful, leadership was poor quality, some department were very cut throat.  Work came before family and individual health,  Benefits were expensive."
bad,"poor management, did not take care of their employees,hired and promoted the much less knowledged employees/people, a very high turn around and offered no benefits."
bad,I was promised advancement and raises upon being hired on at advanced auto parts based on my experience and credentials alone.  All I kept receiving was the run around and excuses.
bad,"It's a man's world, and thats where i'll gladly leave it. Over-worked and underpaid and totally unappreciated. Once they know you'll work hard, they'll promise bright futures, yet nobody wants to put forth the effort of advancing employees through the ranks."
bad,the job was ok at first until I received a promotion. I was promised a raise but that didn't happen at all only thing that happened was I received more work and responcibility.
bad,"I enjoyed working with a majority of my c-workers but, overall my manager didn't know how to be a manager. I would tell him day's I or times that would or wouldn't work for me and he would just basically ignore that and put me on times I said were hard for me to work. Some day's were very understaffed which made thing's hard for employers while phones are ringing we had lines of customers as well deliveires needing to be made. When you call corproite about a problem you are having which you are supposed to I feel like no one really listens, nothing ever gets done about a problem"
bad,This company had horrible management and went through 3 managers in my time there which was less than a year and I constantly had to do management responsibilities because I was the only knowledgeable one around.
bad,Basically do the same thing every day. nothing different. Was a very boring job that did not have any light at the end of the tunnel. Good first job for a kid not supporting a family
bad,its ok...good starter job for someone trying to get in the automotive field. gain useful knowledge of vehicles parts for all makes and models..........
bad,Advance auto parts takes advantage of those who take pride in their job and works them to the bone. Those who do not work or show any work ethic benefit from the hard workers and show poor customer service skills which drive the customer away.
bad,"I have little positive to say about my two year tenure with AAP, I'll say nothing more. As I need to fill further character requirements, I will state that turnover is a huge problem with this retail weighted auto-aftermarket supplier. They are losing or have lost their best/core employees."
bad,No consideration for personal feelings. Very poorly managed. Very stingy in the compensation. Just barely over minimum wage. I would not recommend anyone to work there very long.
bad,"Wages and salary are not comparable compared to other retailers, and not adequate based on the knowledge needed to provide accurate information and good customer service."
bad,The Roanoke office has an old school mentality. If you are not in with someone in management you will have no opportunity for growth. The atmosphere is not one of growth and opportunity. If you are young I would not work here. The pay is low and the opportunity to learn and grow in your career is limited. It is a very political and hierarchal environment which means there is more talking with middle management then actually getting things done and changing things. The bring in new managers from other companies with no retail experience so you end up wasting time training them when you are already short staffed. No promotion from within.
bad,"I was lucky enough to have a good manager that helped with my schedule so that I could balance the job with my school. However, everything else related with the directive of the company sucked, from the pay, to what they expected from the employees, to the resources and  compensation."
bad,"hours are getting cut"
bad,When I first began working here it was a company that provided job security and room to grow. It turned into a company that regardless of your work or time invested you were just a number.
bad,Advanced auto isn't a place that reconizes the skills and talent that people work there. they put you were they need you instead of letting you do what you know. I didn't like working for them
bad,"If you like working long hours in a hot place never knowing when they going to walk you the front door. f you want to work for someone that don,t care about you this is  advance."
bad,i respect my previous employers enough to not use the information i gained while working with said companies to gain any advantage in being hired in to another company thank you.
bad,"Everything (management, operations, people/employees and everything) is always a big mess.  Very fast pace and super busy place. Always shorthanded, too.  Work & life balance is not very good at all. Way too much overtime. Sometimes it's unwanted but too bad. It's good for those who need it badly, tho. My pay is good since I've been there a very long time but not so good for new hires or those who been there less than 10 years. Everything else is too much to list."
bad,i think a work place is essential to relax when needed i think its good to get to know your co workers on a business level at work minimus conflict in the work area. The company i worked for was not coherent to the problems existing within the company to deal with major issues before they got out of hand. the hardest part of the job was loosing overtime when they took limited it the most enjoyable part was that it was third shift.
bad,"wont work for them again. low pay no benefits. terrible schedule implementation, just a poor job all together, will not got unless paid more to do so ."
bad,"Very slow, unorganized, lots of gossip, incredibly rude customers, provided no job training.  Supervisor would disappear when needed the most.  Store was not clean.  Hardest part of the job was the incredibly rude customers - both retail and commercial.  I enjoyed my shift coming to an end and the humorous co-workers."
bad,I was hired in as a full-time employee and barely received part-time hours and I was promised a different position and someone less qualified got the position and better pay. I enjoyed assisting customers with automotive problems and enjoyed the busy work place. I am well qualified for a management position.
bad,"A typical day at work is very hot, no teamwork, you know what time you go in but do not know what time you get off. Management was always full of drama and did not know how to rotate employees. The hardest part of the job was for women who had to lift up to 60+ pounds and had to push over 500 lbs+ on a cart. Men have it made on this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is they do acknowledge you on your birthday."
bad,The Warehouse Manager in my opinion needs to be changed. He is not the type of Manager you would want to work for. He is unwilling to be a boss that would work with his employees.
bad,"Come in put up parts, 5s the store best as possible.  Assist customers as they come in.  Go outside and assist customers with there cars when store isnt busy."
bad,helping the customer is the best part of the job. the other tasks that need to be done daily can be overwhelming. the store typically runs short staffed. the evening shift would be more secure with another employee at night. long hours and no family life.  exhausting
bad,"had a blast with meeting new people, love be a person that could help"
bad,"After enjoying the supreme bliss"
bad,"Not much to say here.  Is what it is....RETAIL.  You do your best to make customers feel like number one, and in turn, they try to make you feel worthless."
bad,they don't employ people for full time is only part time which is not good for a family member holder and someone with high responsibility
bad,"I was not properly trained and when handling customers, they would get upset when I didn't know what they were talking about."
bad,needed gas money to get to school every wee. liked the environment and dealing with customers and putting the truck loads of parts away weekly was my favorite day.
bad,"Unstable place to work, change in hours repeatedly, management does care about employees safety or well being. Constant employee turn over"
bad,They promise one thing and never deliver. They pay the warehouse employees better then the employees in the stores. They penalize you for being knowledgeable about your job. Went 7 years without a raise because I made to much for my position and had wait for the rest of the people in the store to catch up to my pay scale. They reward the idiots and  punish the intelligent.
bad,bad place to work people are crazy and stupid people dont know how to act right and behave. they also steal and stuff and they dont do anything
bad,"Starting pay is 11.75. Raises accrue every 6 months. Management doesn't hold standards and allows low quality employees to thrive while burying the good employees with the work load. Over time is definite, lasting up to a solid year."
bad,"Lead and work as part of a team"
bad,"This store is a great store as long as you are friends with the management team.  You can be the best employee for years, never call in, never late, show up even when your sick as a dog, but that one time something happens, it all turns around for you.  If the store manager find anything out about you that he doesn't like he will go out of his way to find a way to get you out.  The pay is excellent the worry that you may look at someone even crooked or have a bad day that your employment is OVER! Terrible management is what makes this job so bad.  Everything else is wonderful."
bad,"The type of job was fun, the requirements and demand of the job was stressful.The commercial side was fun, customers were great to work with."
bad,In the store that I worked in their was a lot of favoritism and if you weren't a favorite of the General Manager and District Manager their was no way you could advance higher up.
bad,"Enjoyed seeing my other team members at other stores on my route. I enjoyed the responsibility of being ""that guy"" who saved the day walking through the door with that badly needed part."
bad,"I had a rather favorable experience at Advance Auto Parts, largely due to my relaxed general manager. My distaste is with the company as a whole. There is absolutely no incentive to increase sales, outperform, or shine in anyway. The only, miniscule incentive was a credit card like rewards program that was discontinued. "
bad,"As a manger at Advance Auto I did everything from help write the schedule to managing daily tasks.  The upper management was not very willing to help, or come when concerns were brought up.  I had dealt with some very challenging customers including, throwing things at you and swearing at you.  I have also dealt with difficult staff members and the ""it is not my job"" phrase a lot.  I have learned to effectively communicate with both staff members and customers who are not very pleasant to be around or to deal with. I have also learned how to effectively manage numerous people with clashing personalities.  The most rewarding part of the job was finding difficult parts and getting it to the customer in a timely fashion.  Also I enjoyed building relationships with commercial accounts and getting to know them and the ability to serve them efficiently."
bad,"Typical day is quite busy, between customers, telephone calls and various tasks there is enough to keep everyone busy.  If only management would keep them busy, to much burden is placed on the shoulders of to few."
bad,"Company does not care about their employees. Management are only concerned with themselfs. By far one of the worse companies"
bad,"A friendly environment, but sometimes you feel under appreciated. I have learned that working as a team is a must. The quality of the work you do is better then the quantity, and that's what I go by,"
bad,"Started out in Georgia, pay was really good and enjoyed working for the company. The company was expanding with stores opening back in 2006, when moved back to Indiana (family health) totally different in zones and pay. They transferred me 3 times with out helping my moves, they changed my positions and salary, in which was too high of an hourly pay for Indiana.I started $17.50 hr in Ga. when I moved and transferred to Indiana Advance dropped my pay to $12.75 an hour, and was in 3 different cities."
bad,I moved up quick and was on the fast track. Seems like I`ve hit the wall and now I`m ready for a change.I learned a lot about management and working on cars
bad,It was okay and the job have opportunities but the sales goal should be destroyed. Higher management dont analyze daily sales and dont care if lose your job over sales goal. How can you reach $500 when you get 5 customers at night buying air fresheners. Plus people resale what sold and leave you in a negative. Picture going to work ann you start at a negative 450 and your goal is 600.
bad,"On a typical day, I would check the work vehicle to make sure that the vehicle is working properly and filled with gas, A commercial customer will make a purchase. After the transaction is made, I will go to the auto shop and deliver the part."
bad,"Unorganized. Be prepared to have a lot of hurdles to work with. Senior management are short sighted in their company goals and there is a tremondous amount of politics. Unfortunately, Sr Management has no idea how to leverage technology properly and mid managers still can't figure how to connect Staging environments to Production."
bad,"really no job security, very hard to move up in management. Store manager very hard to work for, employees really have no knowledge about cars."
bad,Lacks in collaborate teamwork and reluctant to try new concepts.   Management was often not aligned on strategic goals.   Very frustrating to feel purposeful.
bad,I worked for advance for 6 years. in management and as part time. its great if you have no life. the management sucks and they treat their employees poorly.
bad,"Decent breaks, very detailed work for low pay, not many opportunities to move up. Customers will lie to corporate for free stuff, management gets away with a lot. I don't recommend it if you are seeking full time employment or a career unless you RPP, driver, or upper level employee."
bad,Expect to have to run all over the store grabbing parts and products for customers while having to answer the phones while ringing people up at the same time when expected to do store management duties passed down from corporate including putting up inventory and changing product prices and set ups then having to stop to help customers do to low staffing also if you don't end up having to skip your lunch like usual be prepared to get called in early and or on your day off then yelled at for going over your hours at the end of the week since the store has little money to go around and the compensation is close to minimum wage even after promotion of manager while unintelligent employees that know nothing about cars are being hired that need there hand held through every transaction with a million questions but still have low work ethic and don't do anything to help out around the store with no discipline or corrective actions being done by the store managers or corporate making working very difficult since every one tries taking advantage of everything over all high stressful job with customers constantly upset since there vehicle is acting up and they have to spend money almost always taking it out on the employees at the same time wanting you to install the parts purchased and usually will flip out if you say you can't but trust me they still will try to get you to come to there car and have you walk them through it although you do have to do battery checks and or installs rain or shine so bring an extra uniform that you have to pay for out your own pocket specially when its
bad,"Work wasnt hard, but upper management had no idea what running a store was like, and they often asked more of you than was possible to achieve"
bad,They do not pay their employees good at all. for the amount of work they expect their employees to do they should raise their wages. Even when given and higher position their the still didn't pay good...
bad,"You have to enjoy working with and around a lot of people.  The company is still trying to tweak our routes to make them more feasible and less time consuming for the customers.  New management who is still becoming acclimated, but ok to work with."
bad,"This up and coming leader in the after market parts business. Good work life balance, micro-manages the heck out of everything and everyone. A lot of opportunity for advancement, if you can get past the consistent micro-managing. If you don't have patience and aren't willing to teach skills and acumen, don't apply."
bad,"I've worked at 3 different store throughout the country. The best part of the job is in fact helping customers. It's awesome to see them leave with a smile on their faces knowing they're just a step away from fixing their vehicle. The sales goals however are ridiculous and unreasonable, however I had no problem reaching them though, thanks to my awesome customer service. Most of my co-workers were more than happy to hide in the back when they heard the bell indicating that a customer walked in through the door. They saw the job as waiting game rather than a responsibility. Most of the management had no idea what they were doing. When I was given my position as closing manager, my General Manager didn't even know the closing procedures to show me. The hardest part of the job is advancement. I didn't get a raise until 2 and a half years into employment after moving half-way across the country at which point I was given more responsibility than what I was getting paid for. By the time I had become closing manager they still hadn't even made me a full-time employee. I received no health benefits or vacation time in the almost 3 years I worked for the company."
bad,"Same, Same, Same, Same as previous.  Corporations are the worst to work for"
bad,"Cash Handling, customer service, shipping and receiving parts, ordering parts. worked with my school schedule"
bad,Cheap company and it shows in the way they treat their employees.
bad,The GM at my store is Anti-Veteran/Military. you will work EVERY holiday. The pay is horrible.
bad,"Not a friendly company, Bottom line was focus. No focus was placed on building the team to build the business."
bad,"Basic minimum wage job, basically Mcdonalds/BK of auto parts.  I was overqualified to work their as a sales person and manager but they refused to offer just compensation for my services.  Needed a part time job regardless because of my schooling schedule."
bad,A typical day at work would be delivering parts to the commercial customers. the hardest part of my job would be where the weather plays a big part on my job.
bad,Ok job to learn about cars. Pay is minimum wage. Can't even afford benefits.
bad,Great place to work for a part time employee who is not held accountable for overall sales. The corporation knows absolutely nothing about running an automotive parts business.
bad,I enjoyed the job as far as what I did went. But my manager was a joke. He never took the appropriate actions against team members who weren't doing their jobs. I came in and worked extra hours most days that I was scheduled. And I was called in multiple days a week. I was never appreciated for anything I did. I was fired because of a woman I worked with threatening me and I refused to work with her...
bad,"A relatively easy job if you're good at selling/customer service. Made difficult by lack of management, ""every man for himself"" attitude, and drama created by a few that affects everyone."
bad,"This was the greatest place I ever worked, I served this company with all my mite and all of my heart.I WAS ADVANCE AUTO PARTS FOR 17 YEARS, Never making a unhappy customer always giving service with a smile. When our moto was ( The Best Part Is Our People) this was really true it stood for something these words were powerful..."
bad,do not think that I was treated as a professional towards the end of my career with company.
bad,If you like to be a robot and micro-managed this is the company for you. Poor management skills by district level personnel. Never satisified with being a top performer. Constantly negative culture.
bad,"The Management of Advance Auto sucks, or at least at the store I worked at."
bad,"Prior to this position in NY, I had spent 7yrs with Pep Boys Auto and 2yrs with Tire Kingdom in Florida... with out problems such as these. As always with a new position comes new acquaintances and rapport to establish weather existing staff are ineffective or efficient? I learned that if your from outside the organization your a ""threat"" to all on staff whom fail to meet expectations. I felt I was made a scapegoat or anyone willing to take the position since there had already been 3 others prior to myself according to staff whom obviously had undermining goals having been passed over. In any case there never was a chance of success without the expected support of superiors who weren't there. Co-workers spent more time arguing amongst themselves than accomplishing any directives or helping, this often spilled into customer service. Staff felt cheated by having to help train me while in performance of their own duties which often went neglected till the next day or longer. When confronted there was no support from the Store Mgr while staff did what they pleased. While attempting to address this the Mgr actually doubted and questioned me rather than supporting me. The hardest part of this job was getting superiors to support me and get the necessary time for training required. I had worked 3wks in another store without training prior to assignment in Poughkeepsie. Like many others before me, I did most of my training on my own time after hours initially for months then I was supposed to be given time during business hours to complete it according to the DM which almost never happened"
bad,The most ennjoyable part of the job was working with different people and the relationships that was built.
bad,With my automotive background it was a easy job to to
bad,pay sucks at 7.20 starting out. Management has no care for your personal life. Time off is discouraged. Most customers do not even speak English and they get irritated about it.
bad,"Having read all memo's coming down from dm's, management is taking extreme advantage of the job market,basically if the employees don't like something ,there's the door"".Pay for part timers for the knowledge they have is terrible, hours are so low (8-12 hrs. week typical) that you never get experienced in procedure and are not familiar with changes that occur when your not there.If the job market ever improves like 5 yrs. ago Advance will lose all its good employees and be left with managers with no auto experience at all."
bad,"Lots to do here and some chance at advancement, but not much in the way of hours for the part-time workers."
bad,"Management was a lot to be desired. A lot of back biting & problems between maintainence employees. The maint mgr was the worst I have worked for in over 42 years on the job. if the economy had not tanked in 2008, ! would have looked for other employment sooner. I was not very happy in this job."
bad,Its a ok place to work. The bad thing is the manager at the time wasnt being fair on the days off. Everyone got weekend off except me. Also my raise was based off how the store did and not my actual work that I do.
bad,"Day to day operations of a retail parts store . With no company support ,"
bad,Leadership above management has no support for managers and below.Too long hours and too many days with no time off. Store standard are things of the past. Uniforms are a joke.
bad,Plenty of flexibility regarding work schedule.  Well maintained vehicles.  Management was fairly responsive to needs.  Workplace culture was caustic.  A typical day included driving to commercial locations to deliver parts.
bad,Not a family oriented company. Had a lot of turn over out of the many years I worked there. I feel advance as a company does not care at all about their employees.
bad,"Poor management,worried about the higher up management when they need to be concerned with the employees who making sure the job is being taken care of"
bad,Lots of overtime at times during peak season. Never know what time you getting off until you get to work and they tell you how many hours of work you got. Suppose to be 10 hour work days that could easily be 8 or sometimes 14 just depends on work load.
bad,"The job itself is stressful and fast-paced. Then add on the fact that the company changes its schedule and management staff what seems like once a month. The job is a good starting point to get trained on a forklift and or a stock picker, as well as getting some warehouse experience. Though if long term employment is what you are looking for try someplace else."
bad,"Job started as being titled ""Mobile Pro"".  That was fine as I just retired from USPS and was not looking for a second career.  Got along great with fellow employees but they were looking for advancement.  As management exposed me to retail and then commercial sales I was then considered competition,which I was not.   Consistent hours and decent working conditions"
bad,"The company needs to learn to take better care of the good team members, with that i mean pay. The competition pays as much as 2 dollars more per hour, so it's really hard to keep good help."
bad,Advance does not pay based on quality of of work and performance. They pay based on having a warm body to stand in their store. Knowledge of the job is not required.
bad,The job entirely depends on the type of district manager that is assigned to the store. Seems like a dying company that is living off the motto of being too big to fail.
bad,Didn’t really have a life and management was not so great. Would only recommend someone who is 18yrs. And not to much to do after. Truck days are pretty rough.
bad,"This company was a great place to work in the beginning. After company mergers, it seemed that they lost perspective of the employees, the core values, & the original culture of the company."
bad,"Part Time, no benefits,low pay "
bad,Management was a joke and HR was worse. No future in advancing there so you’ll always be working in a store struggling to pay bills. Not something to try and build a life with
bad,"This is a very physically demanding job, involves filling orders for nationwide auto parts stores to keep their shelves full of products, easy to learn but low paying."
bad,"Loved the jobs with fast pace work friendly supervisors ,the always reorganization for good work.well clean safe environment.supervisor well planned and ready for the work morning to make work more smoother."
bad,"The company is continuously cutting allocated store hours, and unfortunately, team members not equal to the task are not held accountable."
bad,"Coming out of trade school from the auto field, I was told i should look for a job in auto parts first. Happy to accept the job offer, but its difficult at first to learn the various cars parts and location. I just think it was the store location and constant management changes that limits the experience."
bad,"Advance Auto Parts used to be a great company to work for. Over the last few years, they have shifted their focus from people and service to nothing but profit. "
bad,very stressful especially when dealing with unhappy customers. high volume of sales daily. no room for error. the training is a joke. district manager is never around to help
bad,"Part time only makes 8.50 an hour. The days are long and excruciating for only 8.50. I made friends but the long days, under compensation and sometimes irritating customers make the job pretty bad"
bad,"Not thorough with evaluating its employees work ethics. "
bad,"is not god work over there, no fulltime positions, poor management, the hard part of the jobs is installed wipers and batteries when is raining or snowing ."
bad,"My experience with this company over the past three years has been a bit of a mixed bag. Although I enjoyed my time as a mobile parts pro, I have found the management side of Advance arduous to say the least. There is a severe lack of support from upper management, who all seem to have the ability to answer questions without providing any actual information. Training in this corporation is an afterthought, and I have yet to meet anyone above the title of general manager who has worked in a physical store. I realize that my experience is only dealing with a small portion of the company, but I stand by my observations and would not recommend this position or company."
bad,"I was a supervisor and ran the commercial desk for 5 years. Corporate pits stores against each other, and encourages stealing of commercisl customers from other Advance stores. They under pay anyone below manager level, and hire managers from outside the company because they can pay them less than managers they promote from within. So in most circumstances you can't ""work your way up"" past assistant manager or commercial manager."
bad,"A typical day at advance is OK.  I work with some great people, the manager is awesome an easy to get along with as long as you do your job. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the entire shift,  and rude customers. You can learn alot if you're willing to try. "
bad,Unload truck help with commercial  working hub and helping other parts of store when I  can but other then my day do truck and go hime for the day work a Monday through Friday.
bad,Advance has a great workplace environment.  The downfall is how the employees are treated from a corporate level.  Just a number.  The truth about them and most corporations is 95 percent of the workforce will qualify for welfare.
bad,They only hire part time people and since mgmt. does not work nights. You do!  My final straw was working till 9:30 pm. for 15 of my last 17 days there. And only getting 24-30 hours with that.
bad,Poor employee morale is rampant at AAP. Top management is continually cutting costs and making the company's offerings non-competitive in the market. Goals for salespeople are often unrealistic.
bad,"Management definitely needed some work, communication wasn’t really there, I would say it was at least a good part time job. Good first job in the auto industry"
bad,"I worked there for almost 3 years 7 months  as a temp never once had a write up late clock in, but all because I was accused of harassing a female co worker even after providing the evidence that I wasn't even talking to her I still got let go because of an accusation."
bad,Store I worked at was in such bad shape it took a year of constant working everyday just to get it back to normal operating hours. Main headquarters are located in Houston and the Area Manager never gave any positive support. He had no prior automotive skills so he knew nothing about the business.
bad,"This is going to be a great turn around story.  The CEO Tom Greco is making the tough decisions to ensure Advance is a company that will be a force for years to come.  He has brought in a diverse talent bench of experience, different companies and embracing different thought processes and embracing the digital world we live in."
bad,Manger was a whimp wouldn't fire people stealing an not doing job. Bad hours always a promise of more hours an pay. You are nothing to them. Prices are to high for junk parts. They make a killing you get nothing.
bad,is from 3PM-130AM Sunday - Wednesday  I barely see my family  constant troubleshooting throughout 10-11 hour shifts-- the new hires are a struggle because of the way they are trained--however recently that has changed.  There has been improvement with the training programs leadership.
bad,"Not a lot of room for advancement, input from store managers not allowed. Pay was not great compared to the numbers of hours worked. Was all about who you know."
bad,"Worked long days, bosses did not care if you worked 80 hour work weeks on salary. "
bad,"Merging of two companies quite difficult and computer software not ready, very difficult to do a good job with the given resources.  Too many changes and chiefs."
bad,The job itself is okay. It's not difficult and it's easy to learn but the works are awful. The hours are very inconsistent and inconvenient. You work shifts in the middle of the day where you can't do anything before or after work. You also don't get paid enough for all the work you need to do.
bad,"typical work day was selling parts, stocking shelves, checking inventory accuracy, cleaning and closing the store. "
bad,"Throughout a one year work period, had 4 supervisors and two restructures, several re alignments, and no productivity improvements. Company has no path to growth and no career opportunities."
bad,"Some days can be slow others fast paced, "
bad,Not really a career more of a part time endeavor. It was fun to meet new people all the time but was taxing personally on trying to figure out what they needed.
bad,"Company has new leadership, solid CEO.  Lots of chaos as we work through transition.  Will be interesting how the company will unfold in the next 6 months."
bad,"management is not fair because I was'nt given a second chance to return back to advance to work and i really want to, and the pay sucks, but phillis and patty are the best mangers ever and i would love to go back and work with them, and also how advance put your sales up on scene i do not like that, the hardest part of my job was working for an unfair manger an was not promoted when i felt i should have been. the most enjoyable part was working with phillis"
bad,"I applied for full time. i was hired part time. after months of being told lies i left without warning. There was a constant problem with missing merchandise. An assistant manager was removed. My online identity was stolen and I could not get into my employee account despite reporting it to management. I felt that this corporation only cared about profit more than theft, lies, the employee complaints, or fare pricing."
bad,"Was hired when Advance was opening stores in the Augusta GA area.  Started as an assistant manager after 10 years in the military and enjoyed the job very much.  Even went to Roanoke for manager/sales training.  There were quite a few of us veterans working for the stores and helped open the rest in the area.  We had a great District Manager that appreciated our can do attitude and introducing improvements for the company.  Things changed when that position changed to another DM.  He was intimidated by the veterans and made no haste in running us off.  I was fired with no explanation other than Georgia was a hire at will state.  I tried to get re-hired and found they listed me as fired for theft, WOW.  There is no recourse to have this false accusation addressed.  If you are a VETERAN and expect to have input to improve this company find another place to apply."
bad,I have learned quite a bit of new things since I've started at Advanced Auto Parts. My co-workers are awesome and the workplace is very pleasant. I just need more employment to maintain.
bad,The scheduling procedure is not very effective for the demand of the customer base. The amount of hours allowed to cover the work load is under projected.
bad,worked with less than knowledgeable persons that thought they knew everything. always shad me clean or do stuff they didn't want to do.
bad,"Just remember: this is a entry level retail job. No hope of advancement (ironically the place is called ""Advance""). Things started off decently, fellow employees were friendly, management started off ok but later begin to take heavy advantage of employees. Scheduling is a ridiculous joke to say the least. If you are in desperate need of a job, by all means its not the worst place to work. Just don't expect much in the manner of pay and also be prepared to work a very wildly changing schedule each week. One day you'll have to close the store and the next day you'll be right back just a few hours later to open it. Then the following day you'd only work from 12pm to 7pm. The schedule is ridiculous to keep up with; my recommendation would be to have a physical copy of it on you at all times so you don't get mixed up. Management is ok, not the worst but certainly by no means the best. All in all, it makes a good first job for a 17 or 18 year old but thats about it."
bad,"Like any job, Managers can be bad and some can be good. My GM now rocks!!! Last one, not so much, PAY is very low compared to competition.  And let me repeat VERY LOWWWW! No job is secure, and like any sales job, you must sale to keep your job, and the standard is very crazy high. And a bunch more, but if you have a great boss, the team will be great so your job will be better then average. (y)"
bad,"Great place to work but I would have loved to have seen a solid investment in the culture, ethics, and integrity to move towards a service oriented model."
bad,Possibly an en try level job in management. Lots of expectations without reward. Able to produce positive growth year after year yet no bonus compensation. As a DM you are on call 24 hours a day and even asked to work on vacation. No work life balance.
bad,"The hours at Advance were not steady and the pay was based on the route driven. Also I was not an employee but worked as self-employed using my own car. This situation made it difficult to make a living as a Fleet Driver."
bad,"I got the job knowing it was 4 10's a week, occasional overtime. In the few months I was there I rarely had a week without mandatory overtime. 6 days of a 10 hour shift for weeks on end is not my idea of a life. 2 10 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch seems to be a bit excessive and I was over worked."
bad,This could have been a GREAT place to continue to work. But when the selected management does not or choose not to support the sales team there is an issue. And It is time to leave.
bad,"I did enjoy my work but for some reason, those who make the schedule requirements for each store decide that the store can get by with a bare minimum (and sometimes even less than bare minimum) of hours."
bad,"In my time at Advance I went through some great times and some very bad ones. When I first started I was part time and just trying to do the best I could. I went up the ladder rapidly and I enjoyed what I was doing."
bad,I have worked automotive for a majority of my life. With this company my co workers and some of the regular customers that came in to the store were great. The management how ever did not truly care and there was not much for advancement. I was not able to provide a living working here.
bad,"I loved the job and working to help customers.  I could talk shop all day about cars and troubleshooting.  The company was just in constant rotation of DMs, and GMs.   This left an ever changing work environment, but not in a good way.  There were never enough man hours to properly staff our store despite repeated requests and attempts from the DMs who sided with your staffing troubles.  Employee turn over was relatively high because of the split shifts and low wages."
bad,"I would help people purchase car parts and often deliver car parts to local auto repair places.  The job was often quiet.  The management lacked in communication and excelled in insults. The hardest part of the job was being the only woman working in a store of all men, working in a male dominated job. I did enjoy delivering parts."
bad,"I was a mobile parts pro, i delivered auto parts to commercial auto businesses. I learned a lot about auto parts and how to navigate pflugerville really well. Management was okay but a lot of the times they were not willing to work with my school schedule or other job schedule. My co- workers were nice guys, i did not get to talk to them a lot because i was driving most of the day. Hardest part of my day was not being able to take a lunch break sometimes. I really enjoyed being on the road and listening to music."
bad,"New things every day, and always different.  I learned to deal with all home repairs.  Management was often  good, generally."
bad,A typical 10- hour day stocking module shelf's full of auto parts and returns using an RF scanner.
bad,lots and lots of hours on salary equals no home life and bad health don't do it
bad,"The benefits are actually pretty good for both full time and part time employees -- health insurance, short term and long term disability, legal program, paid time off and sick days and some more -- but the pay is terrible; minimum wage if you have no automotive experience and not much more if you do.  There are, to my knowledge, no regular evaluations or pay raises."
bad,The typical day on the job here is unforgiving. The management is controlled by corporate. They have no room to think of you as a human being. The co-workers get along well. But management cares only about themselves. The best part about this job is assisting the customers.
bad,"It's more of a job than a career, and it's the same as any other retail type job.  Unless you happen to be one of the managers (not assistant managers), you don't get any desirable benefits, no sick days, not paid enough for what you do.  It doesn't matter what your job title or job description is, everyone does everything there.  As a driver, I delivered automotive parts to shops.  It doesn't matter if it's raining, storming, snowing, or heatstroke hot outside, you deliver.  You have to lift a lot of really heavy stuff all day long.  Repetitive work, which a lot of it is very tedious.  Not a very organized company, and stores are disorganized and not kept up with when it comes to inventory.  Lazy coworkers make everyone else's job that much harder because we have to pick up their slack.  Almost always got off way later than I was supposed to.  Lunches are not kept track of.  Sometimes I would come in at 7 or 8 in the morning and not get a lunch until 3 pm, if I even got one.  It's a good part-time job for a college student.  Not for full-time, not a career, and it's harder if you don't know much about cars.  No real training.  It was more 'learn as you go' and ask questions and hope it's not too busy so someone can show you what to do."
bad,"Lots of things to do, but not compensated properly for what is expected by the company."
bad,"Love Love Love the customer the DM is horrible very rude,nasty,and one sided(Michael Marchmen) overall the job is a great place to work the management is great"
bad,A good position to interact with the general public and help people and mechanics in need of finding the right part.
bad,"I start saling asap help customers and stock the shelves, truble shooting ,and sale more then the managers . i did $2,500 a week . top sales person."
bad,Advance is ok to start out your career in the automotive industry.
bad,"If you choose to work for advance auto or any other parts store be prepared to deal with customers with very little knowledge about vehicles or automotive repair. They will become very frustrated with you because you sold them the part they told you they needed, but they didn't actually know what they needed but its still your fault. the hours are flexibly spread between Sun-Sat, most of the time an off day will be like a Tuesday or Wednesday during the week when all you will be able to do is stay at home and your family and friends are at work. Most of the time you will have to work second shift for inadequate compensation. Not the place to work on a full time basis unless you are the commercial parts pro. Perfect for part time summer job."
bad,"Upper management is completely clueless as to what goes on at the stores, our hours keep getting cut, but yet they keep demanding that we do more, certain things in the store are difficult to accomplish due to the lack of hours and man power, we cant hire anyone to help because we are already maxed out on hours. the store managements jobs have been threatened because we cant do much when there are only two people in store, one helps customers, and the other does planograms, cycle counts, and other store processes. the good that you do does not get noticed here. upper management only ever tells you what a bad job you are doing and harshly criticizes you. This company only cares about profit, and does not care about its workers on the store level. if you where to have a goal set to sell $1,000,000 in parts, and by the end of the year you only sold $999,999.98 it wouldn't matter if the store burned down, it fell apart, or what else you have done. the fact you didn't sell a million dollars is all that upper management would care about. If you have to work here then go for it. but don't expect to be noticed for your hard work, this job should be temporary at best. i encourage people to go and make something of yourselves. don't work for a company where the people in the trenches are running out of ammunition, and the enemy is advancing, but central command tells you that help is not necessary, tells you there is no enemy, calls back some of your troops. and tells you that you need to conserve ammo. ill be for finding another job before too long, Ive wasted enough of my life here."
bad,"Luckily, I didn’t work in the actual warehouse. I was in the office. The place was ran horribly and unfairly. They clearly did not care about their employees at all. Underpaid, overstressed, and a huge drama fest."
bad,"Liked the work environment, also the customer contact. "
bad,Down time is ridiculously a factor of working here! For the most doing your tasks are easy if you can lift over 35 pounds and use your brain to teach yourself the instructions to install wipers.
bad,"Ivr worked for Advance Auto for 6 six and the management  was unbelievably unfair."
bad,"Came in, pulled parts, delivers parts to customers. When stock trucks came we stocked the shelves while also delivering orders. when we had no delivery's we also helped take care of walk in customers"
bad,Took a great company and ran it into the ground. The customer's went from being the most important thing about the business we did to not mattering at all. Became only about the money they bring in and not the people any longer
bad,"It was ok as an rpp , until I moved stores and took on a new title as agm,  I ended up doing my job and my GM’s job for my measly hourly rate, I left."
bad,The managers here are like little trained hitlers. They are rude and will always have a problem with you taking any days off. You are always wrong and the managers here do nothing. They pawn their jobs off to everyone else.
bad,Not a very stable company. Recently laid off approximately 750 employees last year. Always seem to be chasing its own tail. DId not feel secure working there.
bad,The job is fast paced and you are asked to multi task at all times. There is very little down time. You have to hit the ground running. You are expected to know the information fast and execute it even faster.
bad,They were very inconsistent. It always felt like it was a company constantly chasing its tail.  Always trying to figure out what the competition was doing.
bad,Standards are not enforced due to shortage of qualified personnel and fear of not having people to work in the stores. Company has great policies and standards but they are not applied fairly.
bad,"The job lacked support from the corporate level in areas such as hiring, providing enough payroll hours to sufficiently staff the store and complete tasks in a timely manner."
bad,"nothing to review with this company, The store i worked in was unfair with raised, and promotions, Need to change out the Manager on duty, He allows other employees to walk over him"
bad,"I have learn a lot from the company. I have been a good worker and loyal. I'm still part time. I don't have any benefit, vacation time, or even sick days."
bad,Wages are about 40 years behind the time. Fast food workers make a better wage. Wage doesn't cover even the basic costs of living. Sad that in this country people actually have to work for this kind of wage.
bad,Slow paced job. Difficult to move up in position. Just enough hours to get by. Good job for someone looking for part time work. Not enough pay for the amount of work done.
bad,Take orders delivery parts around the Asheville area clean driving record handle returns and take payments from customers om daily basis make sure customers are happy with the service.
bad,This is a productive work place and could be lots of fun very educational depending on your direct management. But there is little to no advancements within the company. Good job to hold you over but you'll find yourself stuck in the same position with the same pay for years if you allow it.
bad,constant demand on having to wait on in store customers while I'm suppose to be taking care of commercial customers (aka my job). Got  so stressful that blood pressure was trying to meet. Loved helping people  and some my coworkers. Still one man can only do so much especially for his pay scale.
bad,"This company has found itself chasing its competition, not creating a new path or culture in its industry. With many internal turn overs and management restructuring. The structure of internal management is weak and lacks discipline and integrity and morals."
bad,At first AAP seems like a great place to work that is very inviting and fun. However upper management let a lot of their employees fall through the cracks and did not provide support.
bad,If you have some automotive knowledge you could go here for a short while until you find something better. I would not make a career out of this business.
bad,"If given the chance to work anywhere else, go ahead. Pretty much the only way that youre gonna get good hours here is if you are a driver or a commercial manager."
bad,"I loved my job, but poorly managed. Word open to close, split shifts, often alone.  The store I worked in was called ""the grinder"" so yes..  Loved my first store in PA though."
bad,"Competitive place to work, had to learn to do every job in the place not just the one I was hired for. Very physical work, hurt myself often. Had to clean bathrooms & take out trash...not what I was hired for."
bad,"District Manager was a joke, he is a poor leader and has no clue what he is doing. The company is not that bad to work for, but the upper management for the most case is no good."
bad,To many bosses not enough pay not enough hours rude management dress code was great too much slack in between hours break wasn't enough we need better supplies
bad,"Not a bad place to work, Crummy hours, poor upper management, dealing with retail customers is never a particularly fun job however this one pays fairly well."
bad,"Worked there for 4.5 years advanced in rank to RPP. Manager at time of hire was great, was replaced with manager not so great and store fell apart.  As long as the management structure is good it was a great work environment."
bad,your first months are great your boss is nice. you will have long hours. They will not give any days off that you put in for. Management is very unorganized. My boss lied to me saying I will have off the days I put in and then the day before will change the schedule without telling me and then call me telling me I will be fired. I tried going to human resources they did nothing.Lunch is only 30 mins.
bad,"Overly demanding of employees,  lack of pay raises or employee insentives. Easy to get burnt out company has high turn over rate. Very fast paced envir"
bad,"After 13 years of employment with company all paid vacation time and sick time benefits were removed by changing status from F/T to P/T status. Because NC is a state where employment is considered "" At Will"" nothing could be done about this immoral behavior by the upper Management of the company. They say my status was changed to P/T but have worked the same hours for the most part since this change was put into place, never gave back vacation or sick time that was accrued before the change. Nor do they have any intentions of giving it back. You are promised the vacation time then they simply take it away. A very deceptive and cruel act! Do not waste your time working for this company long term, if it happened to me, anyone is vulnerable.  Steer clear of this company unless you are only planning to work short term."
bad,"I love working with the customers helping them solve their problems and getting their vehicle on the road again.   "
bad,"No Culture. There is no drive to do anything with this company. Not sales, not Customer Service or Satisfaction."
bad,"This company thrives by working the GM tireless hours and using him or her for actual ""coverage"" taking away the ability to manage the overall business. Zero quality of life because as the GM, you have to constantly monitor the store from your own phone."
bad,"Extremely stressful and overly demanding as time went on. They cut manpower to a skeleton crew while job duties, goals and expectations grew."
bad,"Overall the customers are great to work with, they make the environment so much better. However management within this company is a total joke, as well is there is healthcare. Don't expect anything to be done if you complain about your Store Manager or Supervisor the District Manager won't do anything and nor with HR."
bad,"was night time manager 90% of the time, but opened and closed(was absolutely proficient on paperwork). most of the guys and gals who worked with me had other jobs and most of them had high ethical and work standards. we had fun and had a good comaraderie. worked 8-10 hrs until they started cutting back. went from 40+ to 35+ then 25+. hardest part of the job was doing some of the battery installations."
bad,"Long hours, poor managerial support, limited ability to move up within the organization.  District Manager tied the hands of store leadership and negated their authority to work with their people."
bad,"They do not treat there staff with respect, nor there customers. They do not pay well and when it comes to time off to hang with the family they do not care about that."
bad,"Normally we would stock items on the shelves to preserve a full inventory of auto items. Up-selling was our main goal. If a customer came in for wax, we in turn, sold the whole kit for detailing a car properly. The down side to working with this company was the limited hours and room for growth. Some weeks we had 8 hours others we have 30 hours. With so many people working for the store the hours were not able to be distributed in large quantity."
bad,The job itself wasn't horrible and if your really into automotive its probably a really good job. I learned a lot from the commercial parts pro and learned a lot about keeping commercial customers happy. Their were internal issues that upper management did not get in in hurry of resolving. Learning enough about what the customer needed to get them what they need was difficult at times. Pictures do help. I personally never enjoyed the job. Mostly because of what was going on behind the scenes. I am sure its not like that at every location but during my tenure it was.
bad,"They mostly only hire part time help to avoid paying benefits. It's an ok job until you find a full time career. Part timers get no benefits, no vacation, and no evaluation or pay raises! ALL part time help starts off with $8.50, but that also depends on your location. Best part of the job is your co-workers and some of the pleasant customers that come in"
bad,The work atmosphere is mediocre. The employees there are just going through the motions and have no long term plans on staying with the company. The employee relations between the management staff and team members does not exist. The hardest part about working there was the racial inequality. I learned to never settle and to always look for better. There were days that their was no coverage and I wasnt able to get a lunch.
bad,AAP has some of the worst head store managers I have ever experience at any job.
bad,"Within this company, the team works as a family, the problem is, the higher management does not pay close attention to the lower management like they should and unethical problems arise.  When lowest management feels that it is a problem, the individual with the concern ends up being terminated for saying anything."
bad,"The management on the district level and higher (not all I'm sure, but my experience), are stuck in some very antiquated ways and mindsets. Common sense business practices did not exist. Customer satisfaction was more important than employee support and safety."
bad,"A typical day at work was you come in see what your goal for selling was then help the customers find the right part. Then train the new employees in how to add on sale. Then stock parts, scan in outs, do paperwork, write a schedule and also to do planograms. I learned allot about auto parts I became the best at the store and I also learned how to run a store from opening to closing. To training new personnel to managing profits and loss. I learned how to hire and also learned loss prevention. I had a great time with my coworkers I would always challenge them to beat my sales or production there was always a great environment with them. The most difficult part was that it was a high volume store with high traffic and we never had enough coverage for them. The greatest part was the customers and my coworkers. Helping a customer find the right part and tell you that they would come back because of you was a great feeling. Also seeing your coworkers become better at there job was great."
bad,"put up car parts, worked assembly line, the hardest part of the job would be not knowing when your schedule would change."
bad,fast pace
bad,good to work not enough to make a carrer very nice values and good pay
bad,Its good if all you need is a job and some money. I don't recommend this job if you need to support a family or in some cases even if you are living on your own. Its just not enough money to pay the pills and there is a lot of downtime which seems to make the day drag.
bad,"~management lacks proper training for the position of leading employees."
bad,"Hours are absolutely horrible, breaks are almost non existent, can’t take sick time or vacation time that I have earned because of shortage of staff and inability to hire proper help."
bad,Fast Paced low pay very few hours and inconsistant. Most enjoyable part of the job some of the coworkers. management is fine. Problem is with corporate and them being cheap.
bad,"Everyone helps out as a team and manager of store is great, the security of the job is always going to be around and should always start out as part time and work way up scale"
bad,"I was fortunate enough to take this job. I was really looking forward to it, working around cars and all of that. However, little did I know that this is a job only a select few people can handle. I can deal with people and their b.s., but some people in this world can't. If you can handle rude customers and their bulls*hit, this job isn't so bad. If you can't deal with people, best to look elsewhere."
bad,"not organize , low pay and alot of work , fire ppl for no reasons "
bad,customer service  delivery driver sells floor  front faceing  inspecting trucks  commercial sales planograms fun friendly coworkers learning how fix head lights  install batterys
bad,I was quickly put in charge of closings and for what ever reason i closed every night of the week. 8 hours a day from 1-9 as part time with no benefits.
bad,Alot of under appreciated team members. They do not stick with the inspire serve and grow aspect of the job. The motivation to move up is no longer there.
bad,"I had a learning experience , but it was nothing to brag about but the co-workers that treated me fairly, a typical day at work, my co-workers were very helpful, friendly, it was interesting"
bad,"A typical work day requires a great physical effort. Everyone attempts to do their best but there are always some that tries to get away with a minimal effort. As with most low wage salary jobs employees are ghosts to upper management. Do not expect to work 40 hours a week (30-35hrs/wk). In my experience, I had an exceptional store manager. It is too bad that they pay so little for such a demanding and physical job, if you happen to be in the warehouse."
bad,Everyone works well together at this fast paced establishment. Commercial customers order parts & I deliver them. I love helping & meeting new people.
bad,The stores are old and difficult to keep clean and the management does not seem to really want to support the stores or the team growth a lot of the district managers and regional manager never ran a auto parts store
bad,Hard labor out of you for less pay and you do the job of 5 people. It's a lot of favoritism and poor management inside the company. Don't expect a raise or bonus. Would be a great start for a high school student.
bad,The people I work with are great. The company likes to micro manage too much for my liking and the only way to move up from my position would be to move to a different city to manage my own store.
bad,I worked for advance for 15 years my production was always over what it had to be I always helped others even if not in my department but if your not willing to brown nose you will get no where.
bad,Leadership was lacking in my experience with Advance Auto Parts.  There was no communication and a general lack of caring about the team members.  The company didn't have an identity as it couldn't figure out if it wanted to serve shops well or just pretend to. A constant lack of inventory and no real way to correct in order to have the right parts for the shops.
bad,"I was hired by the manager at a certain rate of pay. After I did not Recieve my first paycheck on time, I spoke to H.R. and was told they decided I would be paid less acorsing to their pay scale. So after 3 weeks if working I was told I was being paid less than was promised at hire and would only get a raise if someday I took a management or key holder position. The difference in pay and less hours was over $100 per check"
bad,"Went back to Advance Auto Parts in 2002 while getting a call from former past District Manager who heard that I needed a job change."
bad,It would get very busy and the general manager had to ensure that customers were taken care of but they didn’t give the time needed to allow us to make sure that we could do what exactly they needed us to do besides helping the customers.
bad,"The nature  of Advance is not what it lives up to be, bad management .The store would open late and have angry customers. I really would not recommend this company"
bad,"Working at Advance was a very unpleasant time for me, the culture was almost caustic, the management was constantly in disarray, the crew lacked morale, and the lack of affordable benefits was saddening, i was able to work myself from part time into a full time but was unable to receive management training or pay advances."
bad,Can't move up. Good ole boy system. Poor vision. Huge issue with free time. Couldn't live outside of the walls. If you don't want to be held responsible for all of the stuff you can't control don't work here
bad,"Advance Auto wasn't enough for what I needed to get done and I had to get a second job just to maintain my bills that wasn't meeting at first, so I had to leave and go to the Air Force."
bad,"I enjoy dealing with the few customers that come in. Work isn't strenuous. The upper management district manager, Have no idea what its like to work up the ranks as most of them come from different companies. They expect you to do the impossible, while making everyone happy, but don't allow you to do your job to do so. Deal with violent customers that call corporate then i get in trouble for not returning their item, but if i do i'll  still get in trouble.The computers and software are garbage."
bad,"at first i thought it was a fantastic place to work at, then the layoff happened and i realized that by the time you become successful with the company, they get rid of you for making to much money"
bad,overstaffed and most of the employees are unskilled/knowledgeable about the automotive industry.  upper level regional management is disorganized and uninformed about corporate strategy and procedures.
bad,"I feel sorry for anyone trapped in the purgatory of retail auto parts all of their lives. No raises, no rewards, plenty of punishment. If you don't reach your sales goals you get written up, if you do reach them you get nothing. This company pressures it's employees to stay up to date on their training which can only be done at work, yet doesn't provide a computer good enough to adequately watch the required videos, or speakers to hear the narrative. Store hvac is controlled at the Corporate Headquarters in Virginia, it's hot in the summer cold in the winter. The best part of this place is the people, it's just unfortunate the mother ship has no clue of this, employees are pretty much livestock to them."
bad,"When you first start, its great. However, when you've been there for a while you start to notice the lack of ""teamwork"" and more of you pulling everyone else's weight up. If you do take it easy for a day then your hours get dropped down."
bad,"It is a very laid back working environment, but very slow paced.  You don't make a lot of money.  I would recommend this to someone in college looking for a summer job."
bad,"Advance was once a good company to work for, but as of late has brought about a lot of uncertainty for job stability. Company has recently made major cut backs and laid off several people, most in high ranking positions."
bad,"Working with Advance has become extremely stressful. The culture has become extremely toxic, and working with both the logistics and corporate side has shown a gross mismanagement of resources."
bad,"If you are just starting your career and want to work for a place where you can learn a little and explore what you ""really"" what to do with your career, this is a great place to work."
bad,"Fun place to work, just doesn't pay enough for what they require from you.  I did learn how to change batteries and wiper blades.  The hardest part of the job to me was putting up truck, took me a while to learn where all the parts were"
bad,Its a fun place to work and the atmosphere is great. The upper management isn't amazing. The benefits for part time employees is also not very good to other places.
bad,"customer service, cashier, cleaning, modes, driving parts to shop like brakes, rotor, wipers blade, starter, battery. didn't like working with a lot of guys everyday. do not no how to talk with women. I enjoy helping  the customer. install battery in there cars or wipes blade. outside a lot rain, heat, cold. car wash"
bad,"horrible work environment, forced to work with only two to three people all day. racism through out the upper management"
bad,"with the right management this is a very good place to work, store managers need more training with people skills ! with the right store manager people will do an above average job and enjoy what they do."
bad,"My review is of the manager after applying for a position. I would not accept a position working under the current manager of the New Smyrna Beach store #9409."
bad,"When the goal is to develop skill and win games, it’s easy to forget that soccer is supposed to be fun. Nowhere is that more important than in practice."
bad,"70 hour weeks."
bad,"They are flexible with your schedules and will help you push through college. I would deliver parts when ordered to local shops. In the downtime I would put up parts, unload trucks. Help assist customers and whatever else was needed. Hardest part of the job is looking at my paycheck. Easiest part is the people because they are great to work with."
bad,"The workplace was mediocre and the management was unorganized and regularly changed schedules without notifying those involved. Given that, people were cared about even if management style was unconventional. The in store training was inconsistent if at all received and the online training had no relation to the job position. The coworkers were generally kind and a couple went above and beyond their job rolls."
bad,a typical day organizing and working with customers.i learned alot from this job alot about how the parts are made and how many different parts they are. hardest part was the distance.
bad,"working for advanced was a good experince. The managment there was great , good people and friendly co workers were always there to help or teach."
bad,the job was awsme..coulda been ran a lil more efficenlty and better treatment of the employees and more repesct from the store mangaer
bad,"it was a part time job through the holidays to pay off some bills "
bad,"I worked in several different stores in my area...I worked my way up from an associate to a key-holder, to an assistant manager to a GM.  Your job is fairly easy and protected if your a driver, an associate, or an assistant...however your compensation will reflect. "
bad,"A typical day at work at Advance PDQ Warehouse, I start up my RF scanner, and get started on truck if its a truck day or if I'm closing, start picking parts from my section and scan them in to the store containers to be shipped. I also communicate with different advance stores to order parts or reserve parts for customers. We have customer part claims everyday. Sundays there is Cycle Count or Inventory Count. We are given 2-3 aisles or 500-800 SKUS to count to match up with our inventory."
bad,"Not treated fairly. Lots of unfair practices. I went to work early everyday, followed all the rules and still wasn’t appreciated. Being a good employee didn’t seem to matter."
bad,"I thought it was alright. Wasn't my Favorite job though! I quit bc I worked there 6mos, we did 4 10hr shifts, well, I got moved to Heavy Bulk Packing, it's where all Heavy stuff is... I weigh 130Lbs, and the ONLY female in that Department. Still... No biggie!  I was trained and operated a Center Rider, was supposed to be Certified after 2 weeks of operating, well 4 weeks went by, No Certification, said something to Management, 2 more weeks went by... Still no Certification... So I quit!"
bad,"Way too much to do without enough time or proper staffing. You had to pick what you were going to get yelled for on a daily basis, of concentrated on sales then you got yelled at for not getting store operations done, and vice versa."
bad,"Managers are great.. My peers are nice as can be."
bad,it is a very good company to work for the problem is which location u working for because some store are fast paced while others are super slow like 2 people an hour slow
bad,"wish they can move faster on the checkout. over all you come and find what you need but they need to move those lines, a client cannot stand 10 minutes waiting to pay."
bad,You drive to other advanced auto parts stores and and deliver parts. The coworkers are positive and great to be around but the store manager abuse power
bad,"Learned a lot about how not to do, but never really learned what I should be doing. Not many people stuck around through the process of the rise of advance so to say, others enjoyed more disliked it"
bad,Fault in this job if its slow you get no hours with a bi weekly pay its difficult to survive with just this job the managment was okay but parts knowledge from some higher staff was lacking
bad,worked here for 3 years. it was not bad at first but then the company went thru a change and everything was different. it has its up and downs but overall it all depends on the team members that you work with and the manager.
bad,"Would check in & see if orders were available for delivery. Learned many auto repair places in area. Management was just a number there, place is too big to care about individuals. Hardest part of job was doing all the seminars for learning all the products. Didn't make sense when I was just delivery person. Did enjoy seeing different people I hadn't seen recently."
bad,Advance Auto Parts is a great place to work at.  i just need a steady job with weekend days and weekend off.  very nice to work for.  management is also great.
bad,"Performing many tasks made shifts go by very quick, great team. co workers are very helpful and the management team are also helpful."
bad,"Half the employees dont know anything about cars, management especially. Complaints arent handled right , Shareholders have Way too much involvement when most have no working knowledge of automotive parts let alone the industry , If you arent management, you dont exist."
bad,I have to provide great customer service while managing inventory. I also have to make sure all inventory is stocked and done properly.
bad,job responsiblitiles included opening/closing the store. handling large amounts of money and doing bank deposits and change orders. helping customers solve issues pertaining to mechanics
bad,"I found this company to be very judgmental out of the gate. There were massive communication gaps with upper management full of promises that were not delivered. At the store level the people are great, but outside management is where the problems are. To me this is a very money driven company rather than a customer care based situation."
bad,"I made the best out of what I had. I worked hard at this job everyday.  I was there a short time and seen management change, people leave and get fired. There was a lot of fighting going on among my co-workers. I got to a point where I started to get blisters on my feet from working so hard. I learned that I had the managerial skills and ethics to do things the right way. The work I put it in and the outcome I was getting was probably the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was hearing that it didst go unnoticed by the managers which led to me getting an offer for a promotion."
bad,It's an okay place to work. received good hours. dealt with friendly customers and was fun helping people and checking them out. Work day is tiresome but very productive.
bad,advance rather hire a lot of part time workers and cut hours just to save money.
bad,"A typical day is rough. It is a very fast-paced environment with many tasks and deadlines to achieve. I am always on my feet walking and jogging on hard conctrete, which is wearing on my knees. I have learned a ton from this job, mainly gaining valuable supervisory experience. The warehouse management is okay, but many problems have happened recently and things have gotten all discombobulated. The upper HR management has not been truthful and we recently found out that after only three years of being open, the Warehouse is being closed in October! As far as my co-workers, most are good, but there are a few that I work with that cause way too many problems. I can go on and on about many of their problems, but I don't want to write a book. Basically, moral is very low because everyone knows we are closing the warehouse. The hardest part of my job basically is trying to keep every employee focused and their production high, daily. Other than that, working second shift, from 1pm-9:30pm is rough. The most enjoyable part of this job is the competitions of getting the highest numbers daily, which I usually win. While averaging either 500 picks or 500 recieves per day, I have the warehouse record of 638 picks on one day and around 1,100 receives in one day. All other employees only average around 200-400 per day."
bad,"My number one priority is the customer, I greet the customer and help the customer with a great attitude and knowledge. I always learn something new everyday with every customer, at the end of the day my customer is 100% satisfy with my service. Also I have to assist my manager with store's inventory, appearance, shipping & receiving, store goals, and commercial department."
bad,"A typcial day at work is fast paced, up tempo, and wecked.I learn something new everyday. Management is management cant complain. The hardest part about my job the hrs. I enjoy helping people with thier cars because thats my comfort zone."
bad,"As far as working was fun to talk shop, about cars getting people what they needed to work on there cars. Management very seem'd to last, went through five store mangers and two disrict mangers in one year. disrict mangers where always change rules and looking for a reason to fire someone to cut there cost. Store manger did the same always had different ways of running to store and looking for reason to write people up. I last ten years before sliping last manger seem'd to have a anger mangement problem."
bad,My location worked well together and we're always friendly with each other and customers. Management would write us up for any misstep or mistake. This was a great lesson in trusting the wrong people.
bad,"This is a good job for young people looking for something part time, for someone who has grown children and do not see them anyway, or for retired people just looking for something to do. Very hard and stressful to support a family."
bad,"Advanced Auto Parts does a lot of talk, with opposite action. They advertise that they prefer hiring employees with experience; however they actually prefer to hire ignorant teenagers that won't complain about making minimum wage and working less than 20 hrs a week. They refuse to rehire qualified professionals because they don't want to have to pay someone what they're worth."
bad,"Typical warehouse  work area with plenty of work to do and different things like clean, do orders, receive parts, make the shipping parts order and make the work by yourself"
bad,They would rather Lose 50k a year then pay there employees and they make you push product for them to get more prophet from the seller you will work harder then ever and will get told if you don't get people to sign up for there program you will lose hours and next your job
bad,It’s a job. You can build a relationship with customers. Getting the right parts for the customer is a plus. Making them feel more at ease & comfortable.
bad,"Advance was a great place to work....was. The store had no security measures in place and alot of items came up missing. Apparently this had been happening for awhile and then an uptick of missing items happened and all of the employee started getting blamed for not being attentive, on their phone or just straight up accused of stealing. Unfortunately I was the latter. Funny thing I spent over 6 years working in law enforcement and I told the manager that I felt an employee was stealing from our location and said I would help find out who it was because they refused to call in loss prevention. The manager kept saying they would be blamed  for the items and the manager was always the one who took the fall for everything and ended up in handcuffs. after that my hours went from 40+ to only 1 day a week. My starting pay was 8.50 an hour and in 2.5 months my pay went up to 9.75. I was made a key holder and given manager credintials on the computer.... so I don't think I was a poor employee. I took money from my own wallet to correct shortages in the bank deposits and the nightly drawer counts. I have driven my personal vehicle for parts deliveries, and went to meet customers broken down and jumped their vehicle to get them to the store to purchase batteries and other parts. So I'm it's extremely frustrating to be accused of theft. I finally  quit the store because the drama and hour cut were just too much."
bad,"Days are 12 plus hours per day and 5 to 6 days per week . Contracted at 50 hours per week it is very rare to work only 50 hours . A salaried position with no give back to employees , but no excuses for not putting in 50 plus hours per week . With new policies and a continual pounding of new policies and tasks for manager daily , the thought process is that employees always have time to do more and will be disciplined when there is a human error factor . "
bad,The typical work week starts on a sunday afternoon preparing my task list for the upcoming week of what i want to get accomplished for the store.  I have learned a lot in 10 years.  The most enjoyable part of my job is developing each member of my team.
bad,"A lot of Micromanaging there, If one shift isn't pulling their weight then other shifts suffer. One Shift leaves a mess the other shift has to clean it. Thier was a lot of Management that complain about other shifts not doing their job, for the same job they don't do. All in all The Job isn't bad, it just has a lot of Drama. "
bad,Exposer provided for a functional retail service experience with little micromanagement. Good training opportunity with improving automotive repair knowledge. Pay not based on experience and slow advancement. Great networking opportunity.
bad,"The company has very weird rules/pocilys when it comes to the customers, they are not fair about a lot of things when it comes to people’s money and could take some serious time to revamp the website and systems they run on."
bad,Set-up appointments with customers they bought parts from us.  I would handle any issue the customer was having with the store or trying to get labor claims handled.  We could offer lunch or give credits if the customer needed taken care of.  I was the consultant between customers and the stores.
bad,"A good flow of customers that come in. If you do not know much about vehicles, no worries because working here will teach you everything you want to know."
bad,"management was disrespectful, I really liked the work but the management was very inappropriate. I would definitely go back to work there under different management"
bad,"I was recruited by Advance Auto Parts to join their category management team.  The job description and the conversations during  the interview did not match the reality of being a Category Manager. Everyone was well meaning, but they did not have time to train me on navigating the system.  Sadly my boss did not give me the tools. On top of that, he was suspicious of others. He asked me to bcc him on emails which made me uncomfortable.  Between those two, I left."
bad,not a bad company to work for if you are a student or looking for a part time job. the pay is min wage starting out for most people. the only plus is the discount on car parts......
bad,I worked with this company for 2 years as a manager. From day one they told me how I would get this raise and how this store was going to open and then I would get to take it over. But all I seen was a lot of managers that would leave the company and they would work with another parts store and then come back when another store for advanced auto would open. Just a lot of jumping around. They didn't really trust the people that were actually helping the store run due to the fact that you had to have been a general manager in the past to be a general manager.
bad,"Unwilling to motivate employees, poor leadership regarding time management, funds, stock, and basic store operations. Employees lacking training are found to make their own way in regards to store systems, customer service, returns and cash handling questions."
bad,"learned all about P&L's, Corporate business run by investors is not a good thing, bought Auto Part International and Carquest but is running seperately and against itself."
bad,It is a cheap company to work for unless you want to move up. I worked there for almost 4 years and never got a raise. And don't let me get on the benefits.
bad,Good place to work lots of advancement in the company. Fast paced and a great learning place! No need of car knowledge its taught.
bad,"fun work, great coworkers, not loyal to long term employee  advancement, a lot of frustration stems from flip flop decision making and micro- management"
bad,"It was a learning experience. I enjoyed helping customers and injuries on cars and performance. I assisted clients with ranging requests and inquries. I performed wiper repairs, battery changes, and free battery life checks. I utilized UB2 sensor when solving the customers engine issues."
bad,All in all I was instructed to lie to customers to increase sales. I left as soon as I found new work.
bad,"A typical day here would consist of phone customers in search of parts for their vehicles. Not all phone in customers have any idea what they are talking about so it will take much vehicle background experience to determine what it is they are looking for. Walk in customers most of the time will come right to the counter and buy a hard part which is behind the counter for their vehicle or order it in. Then most other times they will browse the store and ask for help here and there which usually involves you having to know the store very well to find everything because there is alot of merchandise on the sales floor."
bad,I learned how to communicate with customers. I enjoy all of my coworkers all are team players. The hardest thing about the job is learning about parts for vehicles and what their used for.
bad,"Deliver parts to mechanic shops, receive money, stock shelves."
bad,"A typical day would be filled with cash handling and one on one customer service and sales, along with inventory and logistics. I learned all about logistics and enjoyed it. The most difficult part of the job was heavy lifting, but the best, most enjoyable part of the job was the one on one interactions with customers."
bad,"Best part of the job was making the deliveries, time seemed to fly by."
bad,over worked and under staffed. Did not like working with management
bad,well the training could have been a bit more hands on and not just a week at another store standing next to the lady doing everything and not given a chance to explain while shes doing it
bad,The drama within each store is unnecessary and I first hand saw a female Manager get harassed and disrespected she had went higher in the company and nothing was done in the end she was let go. She should have filed a lawsuit for harassment
bad,"The typical day of work at advance auto parts was long but occasionally enjoyable. Coworkers and customers were friendly and respectful. Management was too demanding for the wage given, frequently having regular staff doing the work of assistant managers while getting paid their own base pay. If you worked 60 hours one week and 20 the next there was no overtime due to the total amount of hours not surpassing 80 for the biweekly paycheck. For a job making minimum wage at the time, having specific sales goal was added stress for no benefit. I would not recommend working at an Advance Auto Parts."
bad,"They will ask you to take on more duties, that in itself is not an issue. The issue come when you ask for them to pay you for taking an increase in duties."
bad,"The coworkers and customers are great to deal with and you can learn a lot about cars."
bad,Good place to work for most part.i think it just has poor management skills and alot of favoritism .but beside that decent benefits and decent pay rate
bad,Its ok I guess. I'm just not making enough. I have to work two jobs just to make it. I think they would have a high retention rate if they would pay the lower level employees more an hour.
bad,Work was so enjoyable!  High turnover in management and associates due to lack of training with both.  Needs organization and communication!!!
bad,"My coworkers were awesome people, but the company had ridiculous expectations of each employee and staffed our store with a skeleton crew most of the time."
bad,"Orders taken and attending customers needs, I have learned a lot about cars and management is excellent. Partners are fun to be around. The only problem was the rude people that sometimes used to buy there. Conversations with my boss."
bad,being a manager there was a fun exsperience. I have learned a lots prosedures and learn what it take to be a manager
bad,"I enjoyed working there very much. I met a lot of great people, most of which is still talk to on a daily basis. However, the entire corporation lacks management skills."
bad,My manager is awesome it his boss is an idiot the company has gone down hill over the years due to hiring people from outside the industry who have never worked with mechanics or cars in general . The stigma of women being in the industry is still there as well.
bad,"Working at an advance auto parts warehouse was good for the time being if you need to find something that could pay bills and keep you afloat. Working in PDQ could get stressful and overwhelming with bad air inside the warehouse and no air conditioning, a majority of management did not seem to care too much about their employees in PDQ. work place culture was getting the right part for the customer and doing everything to get the right parts. The hardest part of the job was sometimes managers would be not taking the job responsibility seriously. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the interactions and subtle teamwork with members and getting the day done was satisfying."
bad,"It's a high output, low reward job. Was never able to get enough done to keep middle management happy."
bad,I enjoyed working there. The people I worked with were awesome. The job was fun and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. I liked the managers. The downside was the pay. It wasn't enough to make a living on.
bad,great customers to deal with have also learned a lot from the store manager on how to run a store over all great people to work with but the culture of the  company sometimes does not apply to all.
bad,Not organized  . To much favoritism  they pay? Very low.. being company  for 2 years expected advance management  position  never got..
bad,I have already sent a review and not telling much more. its a good place to work and hate to leave but supporting family is always a need. the business is good and really strives to much everyone to become a better salesperson and help the customers as much as possible.
bad,every day you don't know of when you'll be getting done for the day. Work flow varies daily. Hot environment with long hrs. Great benefits if you get hired on through the agency. Productivity standards with a 4 day work week.
bad,"Great place to work friendly people, loved to help solve customers problems"
bad,"The Hard part about my current job is accepting a low pay grade knowing you love the company.The most difficult part about my current job is remembering different auto parts and belts because everybody has different things for their vehicle,everyday and figuring out which part goes to what without the customers willing to tell you what type of part is which is hard."
bad,At my recent job I learned how to look up different parts on the computer and also learning to put parts in the correct place. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers and also learning new things that I never knew.
good,Never liked it. The compensation/work balance was unfair. It was too much work. With barely any growing opportunities. Too much expected from management
good,"After working there for quite some time, I moved up quite a bit, I loved my job and my staff. Unfortunately they don't look into the back rounds of their hired outside people. I was paired with a racist Manager after being passed up for the promotion i worked hard for. "
good,"Good for a first job, don't look to advance, they can't or won't recognize leadership since they have none!!!!!! It was horrible, never received my AGM training!!!!!!!"
good,All they want to hire is young kids that want to play on there cell phones and have there friends come by and stand around and move things from one shelf to another
good,Management was not very good but working with the customers was great. The co-workers were great to work with and we got things done in a timely manner.
good,It is a prison.  No one really wants to work at one.  One of the most unprofessional environments I have ever been in.
good,Management when I worked there was not a to run the store correctly therefore it made it difficult on other employees.
good,"This was part time employment, good experience, but no room for advancement with the store manager I worked with. And hours were difficult to obtain."
good,"Working for Advance Auto is a decent job. You work basically the typical Mon-Fri, if you're in Commercial, and the occassional Sat. However, the management here is not all that good. The assistant manager requires you to do job functions that you are not trained for, and there is really no room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at advance requires a lot of heavy lifting, including car batteries, rotors, cv axels etc. You can't complete task as you'll spend most of your time at the register."
good,"As a single mother i was not able to close the store during the week. they told me that i needed to drop down part time and hand in my keys because they needed someone who was more ""reliable"" for closing."
good,"if you don't have any knowledge about auto parts this job can be intimidating for you, if you do have experience in auto parts the pay still isn't that good."
good,My time working for advance was a waste of time. Manager would call you in on your day off so he can go to strip club or the movies. No advancements because they don't hire from with inn.
good,"You will work hard for your money at advanced auto parts with very little break. They expect women to pick up 100 pounds a day at once when they are not supposed to do that at all, they do have weight limits on the totes that they dont follow."
good,Worst Years of my life working for a company like this hands down. Broken Promises and terrible managment.
good,"it was an ok place to work, management is kind of shady. they don't give you enough hours"
good,"At first the job was great, fast paced and exciting. But before long the holes started to open up. My managers were incompetent when it came to training. They would constantly text in front of costumers and would blame the workers for the complaints."
good,assisting customer with diagnosis and testing of their automotive needs to help fix their car
good,Im still working here but i got to save the employees lack the ability to want to work and take advantage of you if the see that you will do the work the take continuos smoke breaks about every five minutes and on the day of inventory they put nothing away and the managment is even worst this has been the worst manager i have ever had and he is also racist.
good,"If you like long unpaid hours in management, then this is for you. My success came at the price of working 100 hours per week. Planogram changes and inventory discrepancies were a weekly issue. Being bilingual helped meet sales goals but hampered managerial responsibilities. Hourly employee hours were always being reduced."
good,This company only cares about how much money ends up in their pockets. Employee needs are neglected. They make promises and guarantees and never follow through with them. Rather from promoting feom within they hire people from outside the company.
good,"worked like a dog but just a cog in a wheel easily replaced ."
good,"I ended up becoming friends with my Assistant Manager and my 3 co-workers. Everyone else was petty, shady and negative. The pay was awful, they gave you an ""allowance"" for uniform items. Barely enough to cover 2 shirts and 1 pair of uncomfortable pants. I had to purchase many of my own pants. Once the Winter hit, You had to have your own winter gear, while driving. Rediculous Once the"
good,Employees always upset poor manager. This is not a good enviorment push push push to meet crazy company standards with no consideration of difficulty of position
good,It's not that great company. I did have  good coworkers just the pay isn't there. They want people with experience but don't wanna pay for it. As far as advancement its who you know not what experience or hard work you put in.
good,"i do not have anything against advance auto parts, but the store manager that i started with was old tired and was kind of behind on everything, after he got fired the manager that  came in was more interested in another store than his own, the last manager that came in told everyone that he was told that there where no hours for anyone and then goes ahead and hires another manager and gives him 40 hours and cuts everyone hours to the bare minimum. the people that worked at the store where disrespectful and would sometime scream at themselves and even be mean to customers there was no work ethic and it was all a disaster."
good,"I was highly trained but well under paid, but that was not the problem because I love what I do. The company is very large but, yet and still they stayed under staffed during most busiest hours of the week and over staffed during the slow ones."
good,I was higher-ed and told I would go from contract to hire. This did not happen for me or any others on my team. Management took sides and did not care that there full time employees were behind in technologies.
good,If you are not a male expect to be treated differently I was often ridiculed for being afraid of heights as well as for having ADHD I was often made to feel like less of an employee because I was a woman
good,Management did not make time to be available for questions and concerns. I had to leave the store because I was pregnant. I would not work for this store if given the chance to.
good,The place is not very clean. I like the people that I work with. The manager is accommodating. The pay is way too low for the responsibilities that I have.
good,In 6 years with them I was only written up 1 time about 4 years ago. I was transferred to 2 different stores turning both from negative to positive in less than one year in the DIY portion of the stores. I was fired because I yelled at people to get to work.
good,The job was good just not enough hours I got pretty much everything on the first week managers were impressed because usually takes 2 months of training for new employees.
good,"Very sales oriented company, which can be fun, but loses its glamor when it pits ""Team Members"" against each other to hit their sales goals. The better employees are often punished with long hours, promises of better pay, and have to make up for either lack of talent on thier team or lack of team all together."
good,"The management didn't communicate well, if at all. And they would always call you in and say the schedule ""wasn't supposed to be that way"" or they would forget to post the next week's schedule altogether."
good,"no good at all, didnt like it. dont ever work there i dont know what else to say other than that i didnt like it at all and will never ever go back there"
good,"Retail salesman and delivery hub driver for commercial businesses, stock parts on shelves and did planograms. Had a bit of problems with how co-workers including the manager not being organized and were not very professional at all. They lacked experience. The manager would use the company car to send out for pizza every Saturday afternoons when it was not allowed by company policy for us to use any company car for personal use. And there was a bit of racism going on with the co-workers."
good,The company overall seamed good management at my store was poor. Nobody wanted to work including management staff no flexibility on hours and poor training.
good,Need change of management to further their establishment. Requirements were simple and basic. I do feel as though this job was cut throat and did not have opportunity for advancement.
good,"O.k place to work not all bad pay good, if their interested. Upon working there with-in my first 6 months. Witness 7 unprofessional terminations in which. Supervisor and a technician would ambush a employee take his work truck and leave stranded at a work site."
good,I ran the most successful store in the District with a positive over target for each year I was in my store.  I made if a fun place with a positive atmosphere at all times.  Coached others to become management in my store or to be transferred to another store to help develop them to make more money and further their careers.  I was inline to be promoted to District Leader soon.
good,This job offers very little and does not accomidate for medical needs. After hospitalization came back to a cut from 30 hours a week to 8. Had doctor note but still punished
good,I really don't have much to say about this place because every advance is different and every manager is different in how they run their advance. I loved my boss she was the best and that all i have to say.
good,"very slow in most stores, delt with the most irritated customers on the planet, management had no clue how to schedule competent help, bathrooms stank"
good,This is not my ideal job.  I never thought I would be working in an auto parts store.  The management  does not care about the associates and what they have to go through.
good,I think the managment team needs to be more into what the business needs vs. Been too friendly with the employees & promote their friends & not the people that really proves that they can do the job.
good,Using the employee discount to fix on my truck was nice. It was convenient to work at the store when I needed parts. The manager was alright. They hire people with no experience with cars and trucks and therefore are not good help.
good,Pay is not good. You dont feel appreciated for anything you do. Very stressful place to work. Would not recommend this job to anyone. You do so much for nothing.
good,"Its a fun job at first, but I've dealt with racism and sexism. The managers don't do anything for real for real. Its not somewhere ill suggest someone to work at unless you're mechanically inclined."
good,They change a lot of managers for no reason. Some of the employees like to put you down the bus just so they can look good to other managers. No respect and no team work while i worked. Changes were suppose to be good but the way they do it it just wasn't the way you win a customer over.
good,"This is a company without a direction that stays in business in spite of itself.  Company focus changes on a weekly basis and district level management is a joke.  They only use SOP when they are interested in firing you.  It's like the Wild West."
good,"On a daily basis I would check the vehicles for safety. Pull, and deliver auto parts to various accounts. Interaction with many faces, new and regular. Data entry into computers for customers. Solving issues customers had or answering questions customers have about their vehicles. inventory counting to find misplaced products or missing money. stocking new inventory and backstock."
good,Was an Ok company to work for but the only thing I had a problem with was management was never around and never got any formal training in the way that they do business
good,Its whatever you can grasp from it. The process to get hired was fairly simple the training wasn't great and they only seek to fill positions fast. high turnover rate with employees.
good,"A job like that should be paid higher wages. Not enough employees put away truck. They didn't train you enough on things you were expected to know. No cross training for answering phones and computer catalogue access. Nothing but a pin for anniversary date. Very small raises. The driving was okay but that was because you were away from the store. Only got busy on occasion. When it was slow it was very slow, other employees said it was dead and wanted to go home. Many employees came and went, the quitters were too numerous to mention."
good,Was a fun place to work until new management. Always on the go delivering and if not delivering then putting away stock. Good job to learn about parts and functions of shops.
good,"Low pay bringing bad workers, managers sabotaging eachother, infighting and drama. Pretty toxic. Not exactly the worst but if you step up your game you get to have more expected of you for the same pay! Added plus is the district manager is going to ask you why you are not running the place even though you are just an hourly following the rather conflicting orders."
good,"Since Advance Auto Parts (AAP) swallowed Carquest, it has been one long process to integrate the two companies.  In that long 10 year process so far, management doesn't seem to stay long at any level below VP... regional, district, GM, AGM  you name it, management comes and goes maybe 5 in a year at best, more often usually. with so much ""leadership"" change, there is no consistency in messaging for direction in the company or field."
good,I delivered auto parts to paying customers and businesses during my time at Advanced.  I didn't mind the constant in and out but there were times I felt looked down on because I was a woman working in a mans field.
good,Advance is not a bad place to work I think the location I was at had no room for advancement an hour's started being cut out of spitefulness so I had to move on an glad I did better job an stress free!!
good,Advance auto parts needs better managers to make work Place better for employees and customers as will and making sure that employees get there lunch breaks and if there customers are treating employees not fair they have to learn how to handle business partners and employees the same
good,"What a bunch of lazy people there, i pretty much had to learn on my own on what was going there ,what needed to go where , except the driving part to get out of there"
good,I really enjoy the time work around advance I learn many different thing it was a challenge put I out weight the bad to show them that I can do it I work hard everyday I always told myself try to do better then u did the next .
good,"Though I had developed great friendships and connections through this job, there didn't seem to be any room for advancements with the company. I also had to file a few complaints for sexual harassment and a few complaints to HR about management. Nothing was ever changed or taken care of by management. The work place was decent. The hardest part was not being taken seriously by male customers as a female, and also not being taken seriously by my manager who offered raises based on favoritism. "
good,Awesome place you will enjoy it. But they don't pay enough. I wish they had better training and also make sure that every employee does same amount of work instead of one employee doing almost everything.
good,No benefits. Too many lazy coworkers that generally will not pitch to help make sure all the work and cleaning is done. The HVAC is spotty at best. Low morale.
good,"Overall average place to work. Low pay, not likely to move up, average benefits, not many hours unless full time. Managers are brought in from other places instead of promoting the people who have put their time in."
good,Was part-time employee but worked me full-time and unwilling to put me on full-time. I was told to do things that were above my pay grade. With that being said I was unable to get benefits.
good,"boring environment"
good,Expectations changed and you became a number to everyone 
good,The co-workers were enjoyable didn't get very many raises and no promotions. Management was never consistent so that made for a harder workplace not having a set manager.
good,"Basic Job, Parts Delivery Driver.. Had to work the counter when things got busy.. Alot of BSing on my part. I'm not a mechanic even at hobbyist level. I'am a Driver."
good,"I enjoyed the job, had to move for my significant other's job he went to college for and bought a house that was over an hour away. Tried transferring to a closer store, the GM there harassed me so I didn't stick around. I enjoyed most of the job and the people most of the time but, the guys in the company get way with too much too often."
good,"Management was horrible, the manager quit right after he hired me. On my first day he was a no show. The regional manager let the store run without a manager for a month. The co-workers were fine and did their work. They have a revolving door of managers. But overall it wasn't too bad."
good,Doesn't give the best pay or hours unless fulltime but is good for a job while in school or just to make a little extra money. Benefits aren't the best but the people you work with are great.
good,company lies to you to get people in the door and treats the employees like garbage . they pick an choice their favorites then treat the other employees like blah
good,"Management is political, employees are lazy and illiterate, and the pay is not life-supporting.  Room for advancement which equate to 40 hours and same low pay - regardless of your education and experience."
good,"Wonderful company to work for during initial tenure, but the new executive management team doesn't know or understand retail and are very self interested and appear to make decisions in a vacuum."
good,"There is no clear direction of where AAP is going. Direction and initiatives change like the wind. Management changes frequently, hard to retain talent. Most of this is a product of poor culture and the inability to think past a stock price."
good,"not the worst job and by far not the best, upper management should be aware of what store managers are doing and how they handle crew. *****************************"
good,"I like working in auto parts in general . the problems with advance auto parts is staffing never enough staff, the computer system is so obsolete it is very frustrating working with such a poor computer system. the phones are junk  . they need too supply the tools so to speak too do the job correctly and efficiently. but they are so cheep they will not put the money wear it is needed. especially in the employees if the pay was better the employees may appreciate and care about the job and in turn be a better employee for the company"
good,"the pay is not good, and unless your management its hard to get benefits. the staff is friendly but teamwork is hard. if they would of offered better pay and benefits i would of stayed."
good,"At 6500 I had to deal with a lot of racism other store had great people. didn't give raises to people.                                "
good,"Basically it is a large corporation owned by stockholders, and their main focus is on monies generated and hire most anyone who comes thru the door, and just as many exit.  A good, knowledgeable, and conscientious employee is not rewarded in any way, thus discourages staying with company."
good,"Management turnover awful. Everything else pretty good. "
good,The job is in basic retail level. There is not very much expectation of work ethic from store management and that mind set trickles down to lower level employees.
good,"nice place to work at, it is an appropriate place where to start your job life. it is not a place to set your goals high and place your golden eggs in that basket unless you are serious about selling car retail parts"
good,management had a hard time staying out of employees personal life. the work wasn't bad or hard. i got the opportunity to learn about some different vehicles. the management had a drug problem and did not want to do their own job.
good,This job was challenging but not quite what I'm looking for in employment. I learned about automobiles and parts associated with them.
good,parts sales is what i have done for 26 years . would like a new job want one that i can just stay out for good dont want to have to look for a job again
good,Main job was parts delivery but did preform a broad range of other duties within the store when delivery was not needed.
good,"I have work for Advance Auto Parts for over a year and when they acquired CARQUEST all of the CARQUEST employees got promotions and none of the original people from advance got an promotion. I have been trying to work up front for the past 3 months and the excuse that I'm getting for not getting put up front is that I do not speak Spanish. I'm selling about $800-$1,200 a day in patrs and they are still refusing to put me up front is that make any sense to any of you."
good,Like most of the review's on here my management was very self-serving anything to get the heat off them and make it through the day. Just one struggle at a time. So glad i got a another job.
good,"I enjoyed working in this type of work because I always dreamed of working in a auto parts store since I was a kid.  I have a passion for automotive business and services.  Although, I did enjoy it, the company could use some leadership as far as recognizing employees taking up too much of their time on their cell phones enjoying themselves on facebook.  Other then that, it was an enjoyable experience and I would work again here!"
good,Difficult place to work due to the fact that it helps to be mechanically inclined which I am not.
good,good place for young person entering the job market. Knowledge of auto parts not necessary to become a team member.
good,"A dying culture."
good,"A typical day was fixing holes in a wall or ceiling. Painting a house interior or exterior, sometimes both. Learned a lot about house repair and interior work. Job was not very secure due to management and lack of money management of the owner. Company closed a few weeks after i left."
good,Enjoyed working there. General manager quit and the store went down the drain afterwards.
good,"Your typical RETAIL auto parts job. Lots of add on sales, barely knowledgable employees, and being courteous to customers by installing wipers, bulbs, and batteries for free to make them into return customers. I learned a few of their cultures through their outdated computer skills tests, but with more than 24 years experience, nothing was gained. Management was typical. They schedule you some hours by following direction from upper corporate...or else. Otherwise on slower days, their 50 hour work week is more like 35. Coworkers are typical retail. Most are neutral retail robots just there for a paycheck with some without any common sense where as other better picks are actually ""into"" automotive technology and advancement. The hardest part of the job is when you have superior automotive knowledge with certifications and employees know it, they become lazier and find it easier to just pawn everything off on the smart ones rather than attempt to solve their own problems. I also had a 27 mile commute each way which is not the employers problem. Most enjoyable was being able to come to work a few hours before the store opened and be on my own getting things done, which is hard to do when you are constantly ""helping"" customers."
good,"There was a lot of insecurity there. I had three directors in my time there. Each one brought in their cronies so people were let go to make room for those people. Older people were often let go to hire younger. Jobs were ""eliminated"" then all the duties incorporated under a new job title and given to a younger individual.The CEO of the company made the remark that he had to hire people from Minnesota where he lived to fill upper management jobs because there was not talent in Roanoke."
good,"I feel as much money as this business makes, they should be able to compensate their employees better. Plus there is no full time hours if you're not management."
good,Company is only worried about shareholder value. Store level employees are required to do more with less. Managers often work 70 plus hours a week to cover needs left short buy not having enough hours for proper staffing.
good,"Working with the people in the same pay grade was wonderful, management could have been better. Hours constantly changed, sometimes without your consent or even knowing. Days you requested off got approved but turn around got changed by management."
good,"Low pay, poor scheduling, certain stores are better than others but for the most part the company does not back it's employees at all. Every employee is highly expendable at every level."
good,All ways busy never enough help short handed all the time boss  never work pass 4 or 5 left no insight for next shift or any question so most of time a bad night
good,"Advance Auto is a good company to work for, a great brand and great parts, but your success (and happiness) with the company is solely based on your work location/store. I loved the day-to-day job as a driver/CSA and I managed most of the stock and inventory single-handedly. The GM was an awful human being; if he were a neighbor, I'd avoid him at all cost. A real disgusting person with absolutely no work etiquette and completely void of professionalism (store #9450, Bob Wallace Avenue in Huntsville, AL). The ""key holders"" at the store (employee's designated as ""managers"" were just as bad; total lack of work ethic. One had to be picked up and driven home everyday because of his car being broken down- for over six months! He also took 2 and 3 hour lunches because he ""falls asleep"" when he goes home. Another was an out and out thief; he would sit in the company truck, lay the seat all the way back, listen to music, and hang out there all night. All of this activity was reported on several occasions, but we were called ""tattletales""! Unbelievable. Very embarrassing to work in such a messed up environment."
good,Was hired as a hub driver for about a year and a few months or so. And then the new management said I was really good at the front counter stuff. They took me off hub driving and now I do it once and awhile. Not very happy about that! I’ve worked front counter at other part stores for 11 years and I wanted to do something different! And finally had it and now back to the same old poo! Now I’m looking for a completely new job somewhere else!
good,Job security is very low and too much micromanaging region. UNBELIEVABLE turnover from PT to Regional VP. I had 3 DMs and 2 RVPs in a year alone with 2 Arlington stores with no actual GM at times. Company culture is great but DFW lots of opportunities. No room for Advancement during to poor managment bench.
good,The pay for my job is rather low for the responsibilities and for the dally job requirements. Being open on holidays and the store not making sales goals is a major problem.
good,Needs a little work on staffing. Feels like a really stressful and hostile work environment. Many people do not see how some of the employees are still there.
good,"I can't complain about my position at Advance. Friendly coworkers for the most part, low pay, as expected, and delivering parts allowed me to get away. Humorous coworkers help the time go by, a good job if you need part-time work and know a fair bit about auto parts."
good,"I was just looking for some part time work at advance, a consistent 25 hours a week would have been nice. Adding something to my resume is really all i came out with it. Pay was low (9$ per hour) and i was put in a situation where i was having to work 35-40 hours a week with no benefits. The hours interfered with my transmission building so i had a stressful balance between helping out at advance and keeping my customers happy with my transmission sales."
good,"I worked full time providing inventory management, sales, and overall daily operations of company business. opening and closing the store. accounts receivable and payable. training sales associates regarding product information.the hardest part of the job was working outdoors changing batteries. the most enjoyable part was training sales employees in stocking inventory, sales, and product knowledge."
good,"fast paced , knowledge of cars and parts helpful, good customer service skills and troubleshooting helpful.not many hours available, 2 person working most of the time"
good,Work hard stand your ground make sure you don't budge or waiver be on time. Always push to be better look for any and all opportunities within the company.
good,"Long hours, too many meetings. Most of the managers are not supportive. I was glad when I found other employment. I will never work at Advance again. Not enough training to do your job effectively. the company shows favoritism and doesn't know how to keep employees happy"
good,Advanced Auto Parts is a very unprofessional place. I was a driver but nothing was organized at all. Customers I delivered to was never happy. The hardest part was having to watch the customers unhappy.
good,If you have to ask you don't know the job! I don't have time to write what I think of the previous manager who lied to me in front of her entire management staff about my job and promotion that never happened!!!
good,"Come in, open and start filling online orders from the evening before. Pull parts for customers and get the delivery drivers out the door quickly so we could provide the parts to our customers at a good time. Go through new inventory and restock the shelves. Make sure everything is nice and organized. Acknowledge the customers as soon as they stepped through the door. Answer phones before the third ring. Locate parts in town if we did not have them in stock and let the customer know where to find them."
good,"I feel they did not give me a chance to prove I was not vaping in the car, someone told them they seen a charger for a vape, and that is what they went by."
good,"They do have you doing a little of everything putting stuff away or helping a customer, or they may send you out on deliveries."
good,I wish team work was in play. I felt as if i worked harder than every one other than the manager and one other employee. No room to grow there. lacked communication. how ever I did love the customers that came in.
good,"Enjoyed the job, and didn't have to work hard. Don't really need much automotive experience because they offer excellent and informative training. But corporate management makes poor choices and clearly doesn't care about their employees, made obvious by the high rate of turnaround."
good,Needs better understanding of family first with job security for all employees. Better wages. More breaks. Better technology sales equipment. Being able to Do more for the customer if time permits.
good,Managers for most part were only bodies. Customers were best part of job. Some co workers were fun to work with. Most had no experience in auto parts.
good,"I would have to say that being on the management team at Advance Auto was a tolling task.  You worked long hours for very little pay.  I was never home with my family.  My operating budget was small.  Therefore, I had to work as both the manager, stock clerk/cashier.  The roles and responsibilities don't line up with the paid and hours worked."
good,Not  bad company to work for the perks of the discounts are the best. lots of inside drama that management never put  stop too. No room for growth in the company unless you knew someone
good,"Working for advance I have been through more managers than I have uniforms."
good,It's an ok place to work at. Too much drama and bad management. You just have to keep to yourself and focus on working. This is definitely not a place to make friends.
good,A typical day at work you start at your start time then you work until it's time to go home or your workload is done you learn alot management takes some people's work for granted
good,There are some serious safety issues within the warehouse.  When I tried to bring issues to their attention they acted as if it really didn't matter.  No urgency.
good,"Commercial based sales but high demand in DIY, a lot of other side jobs, such as Plan O Grams set up, scanning for inventory outs, checking truck incoming and put away, driver delivery, DIY by walk in or phone in requests, must answer phone by 3rd ring."
good,"I really enjoyed working there for the most part, until the last manager would schedule me long hours on days that I needed short hours and vice versa."
good,bad language was accepted Poor management and too short of hours some days  Worked late every night with hardly no business while the other store closed earlier.
good,"I really like helping people with their auto needs, I actually learned tons about cars; but, the pay was really low. I could work as close to 40 hours as I wanted. I worked for about 16 months there, but never received a pay raise, even after a few customers reached out to the corporate office with such high accolades about their shopping experiences with myself. It was a beyond frustrating experience."
good,"Advance auto is not a bad place to work for. Definitely need some management improvement. A lot of favoritism goes on in the workplace. Fast pace, high demand for up selling parts to customers"
good,great place to work for 25hrs a week and if you dont need to pay bills.  only 8.50 an hour and no chance for a pay increase people working there 4 years later only have gotten a pay raise when minimum wage went up.
good,"We work 4/10's. Sun-Weds or Weds-Sat . Management changes way to often (6 managers in 18 months) Team Leads are not given any kind of leadership training, some are excellent, some have no business being in that position! Dental & vision ins. is good, medical isnt.  Doctors slips are not excepted so save your sick time! Lots of mandatory OT. Doesn't matter if you can't stay! You have to get those numbers out. If management would listen to the people who do the job every day things could get a lot better!  Pay is good for this area, but not enough for how hard we work!  All in all it's ok, nothing you could make a career out of. If you want decent pay & 3 days off weekly & don't mind working in a fast paced, hot work environment it's for you. Definitely walk a lot & that does help you stay in good shape!"
good,This company is behaving as if their looking for a buyer. They are just cutting hours continually. The local manager has trouble with attention and believes he is an executive when actually a working manager.
good,there is no stability you never know if your working your 40 hr week or a mandatory 56 hour the business is up so we work but next week still in the same mess but we can't work overtime. Just don't understand and exhausted I would just like a job that I could be proud of and I know I would contribute 100
good,"Good for learning about auto and for temporary job and to get used to handling some tools.  "
good,"It used to be a great workplace to work, but i've not been able to advance in several years and current management has a very lazy, un caring attitude towards the employees, workplace, and customers."
good,I learned that in this job I had to do everything myself temparary store manager was just standing around and not performing his job!! Managers were changing constantly they fired most my co workers
good,No communication at any level with the distribution center in Indianapolis.  I think my talents would be better utilized by flipping burgers at Wendy's.
good,"Management is a joke, if you're a female and you keep the store manager sexually satisfied then you're good, if you have a family emergency they fire you, they force you to work on your off day and don't bother to tell you they schedule you on your off day and then write you up for missing."
good,"If you worked at the right store it was a very good place to work, if you worked at the store that I worked at however, it was one of the most miserable experiences of my life."
good,"Working and dealing with mental health patients is not for everyone."
good,"This company though has opportunity to be a wonderful employer, has a lot of management development challenges. The managers are all self gain, there is no making the employees feel valuable. The environment is made to feel like we are all expendable and unimportant. The ""there is another were you came from"" attitude puts a hurting on the working environnment."
good,This company is currently unstable. It has too high of price and doesn't pay well. Needs to pay 2 dollars more an hour. Needs better flexibility.
good,"I was hurt on the job, and given certain restrictions to follow at work, the manager disregarded the restrictions given by a doctor, which ended up in more medical treatment. Definitely not a company I would recommend working for."
good,"I am very disappointed in Advanced Auto, they promised me the world to come to work for them from AutoZone.  Then when I go over to them they did not follow through on any of their promises."
good,As a typical work day goes its not that bad you have sales goals that are required to hit. I have improved my retail experiance and my people skills.The company has very poor managment but what do you expect when you try to cheat them out of pay. The coworkers in my store are amazing they are my motivation to work hard and finish as much as I could in a work day. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the all the different rules including the non company policy ones. It is not a job to expect much incentive to do better after 3 years I made an extra $2.34. My coworkers are the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"A typical day at work includes, clocking in and going to the back where new shipments of parts and supplies are brought in. As a team  every employee was responsible for stocking the new shipments in it's prospective place. Since I was a driver it was important for me to put parts away so I could learn where everything was located to better improve my time and efficiently for our commercial customer's everyday demands. I had great managers and co-workers friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was being hired as a part time employee, in which I felt uncompensated due to standard living expenses. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers making them happy and satisfied which comes natural to me as a person."
good,"Company had good intentions, but focus was on getting sales numbers high enough to make budget with absolutely no interest in fixing the real problem.......getting the inventory numbers right and getting the PARTS on the shelf.......not stickers and spray paint.  Good people working for the company, some good ideas, but unwilling to do things the right way, like inventory control and having the right parts when the customers need them."
good,"schedules are never close to being the same, and supervisors do not supervise. Some people want to work and others don't"
good,No srtucture for job duties and today do it this way tomorrow different.
good,Compensation is low.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer find exactly what they need.
good,"It is a very hands on job. Meet lots of people, answering questions,and help people understand how their vehicles work."
good,"good company to work for, no management in the store or no district manager to back up all the things they promise you. they will tell you anything to get you to do the job and fill any thing they promise you,"
good,The people (customers) you meet working here can be pretty bad. Also you can pretty much forget about advancement or raises. All positions at advance are totally expendable and you can and will be replaced overnight.
good,"learned more about vehicles and parts, meeting interesting people"
good,Pay is not that well more for a part time extra income. Easy job but a lot of duties for low pay position. Learned a lot on vehicles parts and some mechanical work.
good,"The position is a great position; but the place it’s self I would t recommend, unless they re-staffed the entire warehouse. It’s a high school, it doesn’t matter what shift you’re on neither. The pay is decent I could be better."
good,"It's an ok place to work, we will learn certain things, I would be better if training was a bit more structured. It takes them a long time to hire personnel that is definitely needed."
good,Management very disrespectful and i have broughf yo harassment to my d.m. from g.m. and they do nothing. Have an open case now with them . It took my emailing the vice president of h.r. to evem speak to someone about the issue. My general manager just wants to sweep harrassment under the rug like nothing happens. Management sucks and doesnt card about you unless you are higher up in the chain.
good,its ok if you have enough help  alot of times you are on your own with very little training    stores are always short staffed with less knowledgable personnel
good,It was a good job for me when I needed a second job but was not given enough hours to make it a full time job. I was promised promotions and higher pay when hired but did not receive tools or instruction once hired on how to properly advance.
good,Enjoyed working there.been there about 1 and half yrs..had high production numbers..but just got laid off. Looking for a better steady job with health inc.
good,Wages are very low and is not a fun place to work. Management  is always in a bad mood and puts everyone else in a bad mood.  They aare cutting everyone's hours at this time and everyone is very unhappy..
good,Your upper management does not let u advance in your career they pick who ever they want and on top of that just because u can be better than who they pick they try anything to get u fired
good,"It was a great learning experience, i loved all the new experiences i had every day. and its convenient if you ever have car problems. Its easy to move up if you work all the time."
good,"it was a pretty basic job, I know about cars so the job was easy for me to do, management was ok could of inspired employees more, fellow employees were a pleasure to work with."
good,Just watch your surroundings it's very cut throat. Management can be jealous of your abilities and feel threatened if you know more or just as much as they do. You're always working with a skeleton crew
good,It was a overall good place to work hours wasn’t bad was a flexible schedule but management wasn’t to great and some employee where rude and didn’t care to much.
good,"I had also helped out at other stores with smaller crews that were managed differently a few times."
good,"Not good pay, management poor,  no hours for people who don't sales 2 items per transaction which is dumb. I say as long as you selling the things in shorebird shouldn't matter. And the manager will be on you every shift you work if you don't have a 2.05 or close to the number at the end of your shift"
good,It doesn't matter how hard you work or how long  you've been there one mistake can get you demoted. Sometimes you lose your position because of changes in the company and you never see it coming. Then it is too hard to move back up
good,"The job is very relaxed, not a rushed environment. The people you work with help the day along, so hopefully they are good. There isn't much opportunity to move upward in the company. The employees and management are constantly changing. There is no additional benefits as an employee, unless you're management, and even then it's not worth the time and energy you put into the business."
good,When you work with the right people going into work is a joy and time goes by fast you can also get moments of excitement when you are able to fulfill a customer's parts needs
good,Good place to work. Everything was self explanatory and nothing is hard or different. Every once and while you get times where you don't know what to assist the customers but with people that worked there years makes it easier.
good,"I enjoy working with all my guys and gals...it’s like family at my location!!! I’m glad to be a part of advance family!!! Always learning new skills to help assist every and all customers, whether retail or commercial"
good,"I worked for Advance Auto parts numerous times, the last time I had a DM who didn't seem to like women in a management role, I had advised I was interested when restarting, I was told I would get training which I never did, the DM transferred 1 manager and hired another from outside the company."
good,"I used to be proud to work for this company, but as the changes started coming, the more they took away from the customers. It became more about the dollar sign than the customer experience. Not many steps in the process to help new managers"
good,"It payed the bills and great benefits. Not fair opportunity. It is what it is. No communication, and no motivation , no compassion and thats why the union has stepped in."
good,Had lack of respect of employee needs.  Management did not work with employee schedule needs and consistently insulted employees. Would insult and comment on sexual orientations and race
good,Things could have been better. A better manager who actually like his employees and helped them each time. The scheduled could have been worked better to suit everyone.
good,I have no clue if it has changed over the years but it was an ok place to work for.  But the management brain washed you into thinking that they were the best.
good,"Honestly, Advance was one of my favorite jobs to work. The job itself was fun and the employees/ management where good. But considering the amount of work and the part knowledge you must obtain it really makes the job not worth the pay. I stayed there for over a year and was promised a raise every six months but when my one year came up the district manager refused to give out any raises causing me to have to look for work elsewhere being that I was not valued as an employee."
good,"When new management was brought in, in April the work atmosphere completely went sour. The new manager spent more time on the phone with his new wife and his kids than he did actually managing the store. Which in turn put greater strain on the other team members."
good,it was a good place to work other than getting your upper management to take care of problems.  I had a major HR issue that I should have been stood behind but they sided with the offender over me as the manager and the documentation I had had showing the proof.
good,"management needs people skills"
good,Lots of turn over of employees. You never knew your schedule because of staffing be so short. They did not keep their promises on pay of work schedule.
good,Summer job in college and this place was a mess filled with management less competent than my 20 year old self. Pay is low and they overworked their best employees.
good,"I actually loved this job, but no, there was not enough pay or hours-I often got only 6 hours a week.  The last supervisor I had was very fire-happy-I was the fourth person he let go in a three month period, and most of the conversations with him had the word ""Fire"" in it-which led to VERY low morale.  They also had a great deal of trouble keeping store managers."
good,Moving up in this company is very hard. They want you to provide excellent work related tasks and always go above and beyond but they want to pay you little to nothing for your hard work
good,"It was so much going on inside that I rather not leave a review at the moment. Some of the people can really show you so much as far as part knowledge, if they are trying to help and not trying to date you."
good,I worked there in several different capacities.  It was a good place to work.  The hours were long but not difficult to work.  The biggest problem is the regional management and the inconsistency.  Things changed so often it was awful.
good,"scheduling is erratic and you work most weekends"
good,"Your particular experience will depend a LOT on the relationship you have with your manager. Don't expect many Saturday, Sundays or weekends off. Managers often take the most advantageous shifts."
good,"when i first started there it was lovely. many promises were not kept by management and the buck kept getting blamed from one to the other as to why hours were taken away."
good,"To maintain my stores competitive edge, I was required to work no less than 55 hours weekly. Most of the time was spent answering emails and fielding customer concerns."
good,"was ok place to work i enjoyed the customer contact,really didn't like the jumping around on different shifts,p/t help has lack od desire for being on time"
good,A typical work day can be slow and then quick pace once the customer  start coming in. What I have learned that customer look to you for guidance on the care of their car problem. In management you should lead by example and not complain about thing or talk about other people.
good,"Allow poor management practices"
good,"It can go from a mad house to no business in 20 minutes. Management was not always open to people that didn't fit a certain mold. The work place was not always a good for Women, management didn't always stand behind them or would harass them."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"The people in leadership are all about the dollars. "
good,the new mangement at the location i was at was failing and stressful. they showed favertisim and offeten went against rules to get a sale. without talking over they cut hours to get you to quit so the dont have to fire you. they will go as low as 8 to 20 hours a week.
good,Gm has total control over everyone which is correct but if u are a good worker you have no ability to advance because they don't want u to leave that particular store .more advancement that means leaving that store .
good,"The work is decent,  ringing out customers like would anywhere else. The management pushes sales , asking you to recommend more expensive parts from the premium line. good sales numbers equal bonuses for the manager. The company  pays its staff minimum wage, and  people working 3-5 years only make $2-$3 more. For a sales driven environment like that i would think that they would offer some kind of benefit for being lead sales employee. I think that would better make a sales environment that they constantly want from there employees ."
good,short staff un organized people are rude employee under trained wouldnt recommend to anyone sorry but i must be honest the place should be reconstructed
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a good job for those whom jut need a job to kill time, I do enjoy working at Advance Auto Parts but the pay doesn't really cover up al my bills. Working at Advance Auto Parts is not an easy job, especially if you're a woman, you have to be able to lift heavy items like for example big 5 gallon buckets of degreaser, hydraulic oil, batteries as well as the2  2-3 ton jacks."
good,"There is not enough support from Region Teams and above. The company communicates poorly and does not have a solid direction of where they are going."
good,Routinely understaffed and busy workplace.  Helping two or more customers at once while answering the phone is routine.  Constantly shifting schedule to cover other team members needs is routine.  Handling irate or especially rude individuals is routine.  This position is best suited to individuals that cannot work full time and do not have a need for a living wage such as college students or retired individuals.
good,not more for advancement and does not give raises. can not make ot on the salary i started with. thought i would get a raise. they do show favoritism.
good,"Will definitely go with your school or other job schedule, depending on your manager. Great for part-time, short-term. This company has no interest in moving you up, or giving raises, more interested in training you to do everything in the store, making you do everything you're trained to do, and say it's all a part of your job no matter what your title. Definitely a job for between jobs, not one to stay at. Coworkers seem nice until you walk away, rumors spread like wildfire, everyone is in it for themselves, no teamwork."
good,"advance auto is not a place that i would recommend to try to live off the pay, or have a normal social life outside of, there really wasn't a hard part of this job. there were frustrating things like parts not coming in on time or companies claiming they have stock when they don't. the only enjoyable part of the job was the fact that i was doing something with cars."
good,"very disorganized"
good,A typical day at work is starting out slow looking for work to until things pick up to start working. And then it's like you in rush hour traffic everybody everywhere.
good,I learned a lot of motor vehicles and how to take better care of my own. Each but day was challenging pushing you to do better every time
good,"In the 2 years I've worked there, I've had 4 general managers, 3 district managers, and haven't had a single performance review or raise. However, they are flexible with hours and the customers are great to work with as well as fellow employees."
good,"You drive. you get parts from shelf, you deliver them, sometimes you bring back returns. You do not eat or drink in the car. You take shorter routes and stay aware on the road"
good,"If you're looking for an environment where you can climb up the ladder, Advance Auto Parts is not the place for you. Unless, of course, you are friends with someone in management. "
good,"there has been another change in management.  The new management knows how to do their jobs, but due to the customers attitude (rude, angry, blame you for their mistakes, they will yell at you, and if you are a woman they might even refuse to believe you might know anything about automobiles or try to pick you up even after being told no multiple times.)"
good,"For a software engineer, this environment is lacking in standards, guidelines and discipline.  It can be a great opportunity to try and effect the changes required, as I have.  However, without management support and many self trained software professionals it is a challenge.  There are some great, talented folks here.  But, for the most part they stay because they are tied to the area and there isn't really much else or they leave.  The mediocre stay."
good,"I worked a third shift for Advance Auto and I didn't mind that schedule, however, I was disappointed with my involvement for input and lack of invited input overall as a key member of management."
good,"Advance is a good company in that their sales system is easy to learn and master and the computer system one of the best I've"
good,It is an okay place to work considering the flexibility. we deliver parts to our commercial customers and when there down time you put up stock around the store after stock have been received.
good,well at this job the division leader does not like give pay raises to those who have earned it or when they have been promoted for a position that requires a pay raise by the company.
good,I have been with the company twice and have been screwed over twice as well. I have been victimized by their restructuring and have had my position eliminated both times causing me also to have to take a large pay cut even though they want you to continue doing the same job as you were in the eliminated position. They are losing employees like crazy due to all these cuts as people are having enough of it.
good,"A good place to work if you had the right management and personnel,off on sundays, serviced a lot of stores but had fun helping guests get the right parts"
good,within this position there was no room for advancement. I tried several times to move into the management position and they wouldn't interview me. They would post an available position after they had already choose a candidate.
good,"Performed duties as Inventory Control Manager on various shifts. Responsibilities included operations of pallet jacks, stock picker, slotting and re-slotting of parts, cycle count.  Was also responsible for supervising and training employees to perform shipping duties, store audits and inventory responsibilities (including no need/no read, selection process, shipping/receiving process etc.)"
good,great company to build customers service skills but needs to work on management and benefits for employees raises can be more for employees and how the raise is given. advancement in company to be improved.
good,"Advance Auto Parts Dawsonville, Georgia. Is a good place to work good environment and good people? But the pay is low. In there is. Virtually no room for advancement. People are very professional. And Courteous."
good,Work hours were back and forth no set schedule and hard to have a family life. People was good and advancement was ongoing
good,"Person has alcohol on his breath every day.  Does not offer advice / suggestions to his management force. Observed Person tell one manager: ""I'm not going to tell you how to do it, or what to do. Just get it done."" "
good,The company has a lot of issues to work out including clear and accurate job descriptions and duties. There is a lot of confusion amongst employees as far as what SOP was.
good,"It's really not a friendly place to be apart of, No time for family life or bring home any good feelings."
good,"I was Mobile Parts Driver, enjoyed the job when hired was promised full time and only given part time hours.  When stores needed help I  volunteered work my up to full time. Management from store level to regional level told me if I got a babysitter to cover evenings I would advance to in-store employee and start to work on me career.  So, I did that within a week I was receiving full time hours moved up to Head Mobile Parts Driver.  I filled out my insurance paper work for my son and me, then when time came for my move to in-store hired a new full time employee was hired that quit and rehired another new employee full time and told because I was only a driver would be demoted back to part time.  I professionally asked why and what I could do to improve any performance issues. I was told by several management members that performance was great and my GM like the fact I was the only employee that had no issue do chores in the store (i.e. bathrooms, sweep, take out trash) between deliveries.  My hours were cut to 20 hours a week and 2 more drivers hired.  I asked about my promotion and was told that had no more payroll hours.  I was exceeding sales my daily sales goals for in-store and commercial deliveries.  I also caught my Commercial boss stealing from the company and reported to my GM.  Was rewarded with cut hours and no promotion. Management is always gossiping about each other and other employees at this location it is sad because I work for the company twice because I loved it but after this experience I will never return,"
good,A typical day at  work: Deliver auto parts to commercial account customers and provide DIY customers with excellent and professional services in the automotive parts industry.
good,"I started working here with a fantastic boss. He then had to move and we proceeded to have two different managers in a few shorts months. The upper management kept changing rules and it really messed everyone up."
good,got to learn allot more about cars during the time i was employed there and even got to deliver parts for a short while...just had issues with always getting the short end of things with management
good,"start you off at 8 an hr that's only 20 cents more then the McDonald's worker, you get a max raise of 20 cents per year , if you are part time they try and keep your hrs under 30 and full timers get 30hrs and 40hrs max because they don't want to pay over time they would much rather hire someone new with no experience then pay you your over time , also as far as promotions go they will try and get you to move up and take on more responsibilities with little to no increase in pay , Retail parts pro only about 10 per hr and the assistant managers about 13hr and the store manager is on salary based pay which isn't all that great .besides that if you're into cars and are looking for a part time to accommodate a full-time somewhere else its good . Also you do get some nice customer but depending on your location some will try to haggle you on price like you owe them something when they barely shop at your store."
good,"leadership "
good,"Well first to start of the pay is terrible. Very hard to live off 8 dollars an hour and there are alot of management issues.I thought it was gonna be a team effort but instead they pile up everything on one person. They also do not treat there employees well as if they are valued, but im looking to better my self this is a place that i cant see a future with and im looking for possibly a potential career."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the store.  Counting inventory and ordered items.  Customer service including answering phones, e-mails, look up automotive parts and handling customer issues.  Put together store plan-o-grams  and close store.  I learned management and customer service skills from this job.  Management was confusing because they always changed the game plan.  My co-workers were good team players and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was handling angry customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was selling products that had a commission based benefits.          "
good,Good luck getting the hours you need. In addition to low pay.
good,This is a good company for your short term goals. This was a parttime position for me. Enjoyed working with and meeting shop owners in which auto parts were delivered to
good,"learned about maintenance of cars, team player"
good,finding out how to help people with their auto needs.
good,Its an ok place to work at. i learned that things are not always what you think you hear
good,This company is not a bad company to work at though it has its bugs just like every company has. I enjoy the people i work with. Though I do not enjoy having to fix things as per my own mistakes to other peoples.
good,"While working at Advance, some of the people were enjoyable to work with. However I do think Advance because of the low pay, hire some questionable people...."
good,"Part time and don't have any plans to move up, then go for it. Depending on your management, you could be able to succeed some how. On the other hand, there could be narcissism that will just really make you think about going elsewhere."
good,Managers often delegate tasks that they don’t feel like doing. The scheduling is ever changing and can never get a set reliable schedule. Good to meet new people and gain some automotive knowledge.
good,I feel There is no room to grow within the company i’ve been there three years the computer system changes 2 to 3 times a year there’s consistent work.
good,This company does not provide adequate training or support for associates. The work environment varies a lot from location to location. Pay is poor. Hours are unpredictable.
good,Management made empty promises and worked too many hours as a part time employee.i was promised I could have off when I had my children every other weekend and that never happened.
good,Great place to work good people good management. Needs more ways to get promoted through. Been there over a year and only raise I got is when I got keyholder
good,Never would know what scheduling would be general manager didn’t care about anything. Very slow paced and strung out work. Very old outdated store. Would not recommend to work there.
good,I started out in selection at advance auto parts distribution center. Learned how to drive a center rider and end rider. Built pallets based on stores orders. For the past year and half I moved to weekend PDQ where I had to be provide more precision selection and quality for the customers. During this time also learnwd how to do e-commerce selecting. Got certified on reach truck and walkies during this time
good,"The company purchased a large building in Raleigh, that they are making the new corporate office of Advance Auto. It is only a matter of time and "
good,More worried about finding “follower” than “leaders” for management. They were looking more for the “yes man” rather than the mud to lead by example and get results.
good,Other employees good prefer men. But was not a bad job but not much of a career. It's a job to make extra money low pay mostly only part time even if the give you full time they call you and keep you as a part time employee bonuses are only for management.
good,Come energized to work everyday. Know how to deal with all types of different personalities with customers and co workers. Be willing to learn the ways to help customers solve there DIY projects
good,"When I started I loved my job. I worked for the company over a year. I never once got offered an advancement. Then when I tried to get transferred out of the store where I was VERY uncomfortable, I was refused the transfer. Needless to say I ended quoting my job:("
good,I loved my job but management is not what it was at 1 time they tell you 1 thing and react a whole different way when you do speak out was working at store another employee walked out no excuses dosnt show back up the next day go to work 15 min late other employee is there and I’m told to go home for being late NOT GOOD MANGMENT
good,This was a part time position and I was not impressed with the way the company was not open to suggestions. Not good communication as far as management. No room for advancement.
good,As mentioned in the summary above. Too much drama and favoritism. The company doesn't support all it's employees for what they expect of them. Too much controversy and contradictions
good,I would come to work and sign in and start my day. I would help people who came into the store. Throughout my time there I learned so much about cars that I didn't already know. It was a pretty relaxed low-stress job.
good,"Overall I give this location of the company 3 outta 5 stars. "
good,"Not enough hours, no ability for full time and no increase in wage.  I like the close proximity to home but if they could give me a raise or offer more hours this would be a benefit."
good,"The customer comes first, What I do is Stock and receiving our stock truck once a week., Anywhere from 1500 pieces to 2600 pieces catalog them in. It keeps you hopping"
good,Little room for advancement. Managers bounced around from one location to another. No stability for store teams. Hurts advancement due to varying management
good,"The pay is good and fair, especially for a starting position. But my experience with the company was not enjoyable. The work enviroment consisted of lots of yelling, no smiles whatsoever, and lots of injurys happening around. There was one point I almost got run over by a forklift that came into the walking lane, and the manager faulted it on me. The work enviroment was not friendly, in fact it was scary. The labor is definitly hard, but does pay well. You will have not much time for other things, especially if your grinding for 50+ hours like I did."
good,"Working in a warehouse midsummer means saving money on AC and working our workers ragged. You were required to hit a certain orders picked per hour number. If that dipped, you'd be questioned about it..so breaks and lunches were accounted for, but you better not have a bathroom problem or feel sick. Be prepared to call out sick if you can't work your hardest."
good,Good Company poor upper management.. The middle line district on up needs alot of work no caring of the people in front line only worry about what they get at the end.
good,"It was a tough temp job I did not work in the store "
good,Startesd off great but once settled in the company started cutting hours. You ask management why they could not ever give a straight answer. After being there a year I did not receive and evaluation or raise. They just wanted to work you and expected you to keep doing more with out any type on incentive. Overall the people I worked with were nice and friendly the general  manager was was really nice for the most part aslong as he wasn't under pressure by the district manager.
good,It all depends on the store you work at in my opinion. I started at one stored which I enjoyed working at because of the management. Then I got moved to another store where the management was not good. The building was old and had a lot of leaks. The staff was not a team and did not help each other out.
good,At first this company wad great to work for. Company is fine just some management team is hard to worl for.. Good for part timers. Pay is a problem within the stores.
good,"Great learning experience, for those looking to get into warehouse work this is a great place to understand the culture and general idea of speed and accuracy!!"
good,Starting pay is 8/hour.  Its tough to attract a high functioning/committed co-worker.  You really have to scrape the bottom of the barrel at times. Best of luck.
good,"Typical work day at Advance was just running parts to other local Advance Auto Parts stores, when there were no deliveries other duties included cleaning your vehicle, stock incoming parts or general house cleaning duties. People were pretty good overall."
good,"I loved the job and worked with a great team/staff. However there was no advancement, no raises, and no appreciation of a hard day at work. When i was offered a better pay and better job elsewhere, I ended up leaving."
good,"The company was once very supportive at local levels as well as allowed there to be room to help customers in critical situations. Now I see in my district many stores without GM's and a DM that rather pass off work to the remaining GM's instead of addressing the lack of leaders. As a result we have unmotivated employees, who think they will be without a job soon and I don't blame them. The ones who are then truly getting the short end is our customers that are now :waiting on one of the few team members to serve them, working with new hires that can't be trained, and trying to get advice from the vets that are to busy taking up the slack."
good,The culture at the time was very good everyone got along and was supportive. Through this job I learnt more about responsibility and how to conduct B2B business.
good,Great company but the management is very uneducated and very ill with the employees. I was very unhappy with the amount of time they took to listen to employees and to help make situations better .
good,"shift could change at anytime, new manager was not willing to work with me after 2 hip replacement, corporate took my name off the list and would have had to reapply and start at min wage"
good,Working for advance auto parts was awesome until new management came to the store. Things began to become unorganized and very stressful with a manager that didn’t care for his team. Other than that I loved being able to help my customers
good,Not a terrible place to work but no real chance at advancement.  Although the job is not extremely difficult and can be enjoyable its hard to make a decent living.
good,use to be a great place to work un till all salespeople had to meet a quota if you did not meet the goals you would be writing up and eventually fired
good,We had a great team on the counter always working together and working through solutions !  I enjoyed working for the company the reason I left was because I was only given 5 hours a week and I couldn’t afford to pay my bills with 5 hours a week but over all good place to be ! Management wasn’t the best but management had pros and cons
good,"lets see where do I start, well the environment was friendly everybody got along well, but the job was stressful always doing something fast paced, and sometimes customers would get angry for no reason but you always have to keep your cool and handle the situation in a professional manner"
good,This was a nice place to work and the management and employees were great. It was a bit far from home to get there for the part time hours. I would recommend them for future employees
good,"I enjoyed getting to know my regular customers and being on a first name basis with most of them. However, when AAP aquired Carquest, the focus turned more towards hitting rediculous sales goals that where unattainable and trying to fire you for them."
good,I would pick parts to be sent to various stores. When we were done picking we would restock inventory or help out other departments. The management is not on the same page so it is very frustrating. I think this warehouse needs a revamp by there corporate office. They don’t care about the everyday employees that actually do the work. They need to remember that’s who keeps there business going not the managers. The management only oversees.
good,i liked the job and most of my co workers. i would constantly find myself without help to complete a task and help a customer. Most of my coworkers would not help me even when i was a new employee.
good,"Coworkers were immature, and general manager wasn't suited for his job. There were uncalled for expectations levied upon the workforce, and major issues were made out of small inconveniences."
good,"not the greatest, my knowledge is severely taken for granted. the benefits are not great. Any kind of medical leave will result in loss of position. no job security."
good,"At a time, the best job ever. Most rewarding and exciting, that has changed in the past few years.  Getting to know customers and their projects was most rewarding part.  Leadership has changed over the past three years.  This has resulted in three different sets of cultural beliefs, seems to be an identity crisis of sorts.  The passion is gone."
good,"Was an ok experience working with advance auto parts, some poor management, but I think to depend on the manager, how he treats his employees. Overall, it's a great place to work but depend much if it has a great manager."
good,"I enjoyed seeing the customers everyday, watching them leave happy after providing them with great customer service. I enjoy working with my co -workers after many years together."
good,"I really enjoyed reviewing leases and working one-on-one with landlords.  I liked the challenge of getting our accounts to a zero balance,  The hardest part of the job was reading survey maps to match real estate tax bills."
good,The field has done exceptional and are getting rewarded for success while the support team are being excluded from any recognition.   The integration of Advance Auto Parts and CARQUEST has caused disruptions.
good,I would rather focus on the future rather than refer to the past. I want an opportunity to grow my talents and to work on a focused driven team. Success will determine my future.
good,Was part time working over 50 hours a week with no raise or being moved over to full time. Fought with them to get medical bills paid after a work comp injury.
good,"If you have no kids and no one to keep you from the job and are a male, you'll go far, even when you have little mechanical knowledge at all.  As a single mom, I have reached the top of my pay scale and will not be allowed to move higher in the company."
good,"DMs aren't trust worthy. Don't care about what their employee think or say when it comes to issues in the store. They pick and choose who they look out for.  Would never want to work for Herold Smart again, he is a true lier."
good,It was a good place to work. But was passed over for promotion twice because they brought in outside people instead of promoting within. The management was very weak when it came to confrontations. Would not stick up for employees to district office.
good,Management is pretty cool but as far as advancing in the company forget about it .They want you to work 38-39 hours a week as part time but only working six hours a day so you work almost everyday . No set schedule so you cant really plan a life because you don't know when your going to have off because the scheduling sucks . but other than that is was pretty cool .
good,"Poorly run by management, no chance for advancement if you want a career there , not a lot of commercial business !! New GM was not fair to all employees picked certain employees to do assignments and would let others not do the same !!"
good,"The company is oriented around a good time when working on any automotive job. Inspiring a job well done attitude when, corporate is disconnected with the actual employee base whom are in-store and are aware of what is effective for the advancement of the company."
good,"theres no worse place to work, no opportunity to grow the management is incompetent  and theres no balance on work. they have preffered persons and if you are good at work they push you harder."
good,"Enjoyed working with and building relationship with customers,and store team  members. Challenge was to recruit qualified team members due to low introductory wages and limited hours offered. Increased demands for additional hours resulted in difficulty balancing work responsibilities and caring for or providing family time."
good,Pull parts to deliver to customers. Get the returns to the store and put in the self or bins. Help to clients to find parts by internet and sell collet money
good,I thought it was a good company at first but after working there for 2 years. I thought different. Management was not very good and let way too many people get away with things. They all ways were moving them around so the employees could never get to know them. The biggest factor was safety. They all ways said safety was the first priority but almost every day some one got hurt or had a incident on the equipment. The shelves were over stocked and heavy product put up too high. The employees never really seemed to care. They would throw product in the pallettaners sloppily and damage them.
good,"I worked for Advance Auto Parts for many years and loved it for most of those years.  Once they acquired CARQUEST, it changed so much that it did not feel like the same company anymore.  Management changed, jobs were eliminated, and it was no longer a fun place to work."
good,"A company that rewards superior service will ensure the employee's continued excellent service. If not, the job just becomes another job."
good,slow not enough hrs pay sucks i would never work for them again unless you are young and its a second part time job the employees i worked with were friendly and the customers were never a problem but i have a family to take care of and minimum wage is not good enough for delivery stock and cleaning the store and then not even being able to have 40 hrs a week
good,"Upper management doesn't care about lower level employees. Even if you do an exceptional job for years don't expect a pay raise. There is some opportunity for advancement, but you won't get vary far. The people you work with are the best part about this job."
good,Not a great experience for me. The hours were hard to come by and the manager did not motivate people in the right way. There were goals to reach and he emphasized none of them.
good,Working for this company its great if you are a student or if this is a side job the future there is really low . The pay its a joke for a primary job .
good,"While working there was really the only part I enjoyed, some days were total ""heck"". Management always was micro-managing, yet unable to provide schedules ahead of time."
good,This was my first experience working in a full retail store environment and I believe if given the proper training I would have been further along in my career
good,They offer a lot of pay incentives for staying but that's only because they wouldn't keep their employees otherwise.  It's riddled with favoritism and overtime inappropriate managers. Frequent mandatory overtime without any notice and you can get fired for trivial things if a manager dislikes you not to mention HR refuses to help any employee with bully supervisors.
good,Advance Auto is a parts store so you will be working with customers and helping them solve mechanical problems. A few years back they introduced strict sales goals that must be met. You must be good at ad on sales and pushing specific merchandise. Getting time off can be a bit of a problem.
good,I've worked at Advanced Auto Parts for a short 3 months but wasn't that bad of experience. The work isn't hard and your coworkers make the job better.
good,The employment is geared more toward a stepping stone in retail than a career choice. No opportunity to think outside the box or take initiative. All work duties are formatted and must be followed. I agree with structure but advanced ideas can serve to better the company as well as the associate.
good,Management in a retail environment that is dictated by the corporate gooroos. Long hours with compensation that is just lacking. Salaried employees are overworked.
good,Old management didn't really care about being organized and working as a team. New management is the opposite. New management care about you getting the training you need in order to serve your customers to the best of your ability.
good,"If you are not in parole or you don't like drugs ,like to steal or have a criminal record,this is no the right place for you. Unfortunately this company have a program to help people of this kind."
good,ok place to work long hours ok wage  very physically demanding on body co-workers some what childish fast paced some people will help if behind some will not everybody out for self
good,good place to work if you are looking for PT work and have no life or family. they take advantage of your willingness to work over and don't even consider any kind of compensation
good,They cut hours their policy is constantly changing ever since the company has changed owners. the company has become unorganized. There are a select few stores that don't have this issue. Don't have someone with no automotive experience run your company...
good,Most of co-workers don't know anything about cars. I myself knew a lot about cars thanks to my dad showing me and always being around cars helped a lot.
good,"The current management team doesn't have time for the proper training of team members in order to help them advance. Will not give you the time of day when you ask to learn something new not to mention it is a really rough work environment. You have to be able to handle the rude, antagonistic and lazy crowd, and that's just the associates. The customers can be twice as bad and difficult to handle. Female workers get little to no respect as personally witnessed. Advancement for people who work hard is not rewarded. What is rewarded is bad behavior."
good,I was a commercial specialist.  I took commercial customers calls and delivered the parts they were requesting.  I also worked with customers that came into the store.
good,A company that needs to invest more in there people. The associates are hard working and dedicated. A fast paced environment that make the day fly by.
good,"It is typical for what you expect for any retail job - inevitably you will hear the same questions asked over and over again, so repetition is something of a necessity to tolerate."
good,Hard Job.. Need to be able to help customer at a fast paced.. also a lot of training that has to be done without a great team one will never get anything done
good,"It is tiresome to work a job where you don't want to be there. When your advances go unnoticed, and people are constantly being blamed and penalized for other persons' incompetence. I was able to learn much from the job, but that would be the only advantage to be noted."
good,"The store management at the location which I was employed is less than company standards. Also it was the merging of two stores into one after one company bought another. There was no typical day you always walked into something new,"
good,"fast paced at times, great employees, workload extreme understaffed"
good,"A typical retailer, cut hours, cut wages, demand more and  more for less and less. the worst part is that they have these terrible corporate propaganda videos they make you watch."
good,"They assign unrealistic sales goals for slower stores and expect them to do as well as established stores as far as years open. Benefits are good, but that's about it. They do not want to hear reasons why the store is slow, such as, construction, excessive snow, flooding, etc...... Also, no support from upper management, even when they agree with you."
good,"Balance between work and home not considered. Job no matter what. Managers were required to work 50 hr a week, which is not an issue but when you worked that 50 to 60 hrs per week you could not take time off early another day to off set time.Managers are now being required to attend Divisional meetings on their day off."
good,"I was hired at an assistant manager position because of previous job experience, however it seemed difficult to advance withing the company.  Most people I witnessed advance did so because of friendship above performance.  I was payed well but it seemed anyone below me had a hard time getting hours and most worked for minimum wage.  Advance Auto Parts put an ""automatic write up"" system in place where if certain goals were not met a computer generated a write up, which could result in termination.  This computer based system is a very cold manner to run a business.  Employees may have strengths that the numbers in a computer do not reflect resulting in hard working employees receiving write ups where as a human manager might pardon some weaknesses because of said strengths.  The delivery trucks were fitted with GPS tracking devices that also generated write ups for a multitude of reasons, making it frightening to even get behind the wheel because a slip up in your driving technique might result in your termination.  Finally the GMs and DMs seemed very lax in handling customer and employee issues, or ignoring obvious problems because no one feels like solving them.  For instance I worked in a high theft store, but everyday for hours a day there are only 2 employees on the schedule, so if one person is handling a task at the back of the store and the other is helping a customer, the entire store is up for grabs.  Large boxed items were known to disappear on a regular basis."
good,Provides a good balance of satisfaction of being able to assist customers and make a difference as well as alot of hands on work.
good,This company dos not help its employes when they ask for it.It has alot of managers that don't know what they are doing and that don't train their people correct.
good,poor management no opportunity to advance always changing schedule without contacting employees never enforced company policies
good,"Advance auto parts is a great place to work. As long as you're willing to work your hard and stay on task, the sky is the limit if you're willing to be patient and stick around."
good,Expected to pick up slack for your managers as well as your outside sales team aka do there jobs as well. work almost every weekend not much time for family.
good,"I delivered auto parts to dealerships and auto repair shops. When I wasn't making deliveries, I had to help out at the counter and stock inventory. Dealing with the public was difficult at times. Different personalities some who were having a bad day, came in to the store."
good,A typical day at work includes customer service needs as well as store needs.  The hardest part of the job would be having to balance many tasks and yet focus on them individually at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have helped out a customer and solved their concerns
good,"Made deliveries in the morning, when I was finished, I unloaded trucks and stocked shelves. Waited on customers when needed. Started this store as ""new"" shop."
good,"My job was simple, I provided excellent customer service both in the store and out of the store while I was doing my duties. I learned how to change a car battery, and about various car parts. Management, though, was not that great. There was too much drama and managers kept trying to drag me into it because I wasn't super happy in the mornings. "
good,"Its all starts off well until, you really get going and you see that its only you and one other person holding down the building they expect alot from you and do not pay well unless you are a store manager in some cases guys leave that spot also"
good,didn't get along with the manager she didn't know how to manage an auto parts store and I left because my hours got cut bad
good,Management personnel shows lack of guidance and ability to lead in a positive manner.
good,"My job was to deliver car parts to private businesses,as well as other local stores.I got along with my co-workers."
good,"A typical sales day includes trying to find parts for people's vehicles that are either too old (often no longer produced parts), not for a car/truck/van (boats, ATVs, etc), or for something completely abnormal for the area (lambourghini in a rural area). While this is often expected by the customers, the 1 guy who flips out about the lack of availability for HIS needs highlights over the other 9 people you did help. The best part is, it's usually on the phone, the person not even present to try and show them pictures of parts or repair manuals to help explain anything."
good,"Check task schedule, see that customers are being helped, answer questions to meet the needs of customers. Parts logistics. Plano-grams. Assist team members in daily functions. Training. Opening and closing of store."
good,"With it being a retail environment, it was not too bad. Was able to establish private customer base due to proper customer service. This also improved the commercial program. "
good,"delivered parts, installed wiper blades and batteries, and learned a lot"
good,"Not sure if other regions have started the scheduled template yet but watch out. You no longer can do anything fun like bowling leagues, dart leagues, card night...ect. You must work you template in which does not give you one of the same night off ever. If you have a doctors appt. you have to take the day off with no pay or use your earned sick or vaction time, no requests off."
good,District Manager couldnt remember my name and I worked there four years. I enjoyed the customers and the actual work though.
good,I learned that it is always not best to take the Promotion to another store. Working for my manager was not an easy task and he is not very personable towards his staff.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers in finding/selling parts that they need for their vehicles, answering general vehicle questions, changing batteries and wiper blades, refilling shelves, keeping up with emptying trash cans, and anything else that the manager on duty asks."
good,"The one thing I liked most about this job was helping customers fix their cars, it was sometimes a challenge. I really liked my co-workers, we were all able to learn a lot from each other. Hardest part of the job was the varied schedule from week to week, and no scheduled lunches."
good,The job is a good job and sometimes it gets very busy. I do not get very many hours or the pay I would prefer.
good,it is fast pace usually one customer after another on rainy days lots of wiper blade installations in the winter lots of battery installations. it is a fun work place everyone gets along well.
good,"My days started with opening the store, counting the safe and loading all tills into the registers. I learned how to read a P & L, and also how to produce a workable schedule for all team members. I managed up to 20 employees daily, assigning different duties to be completed in a timely mannor. I had to recieve and ship out all material for enventory purposes. The hardest part of my job was being able to be in 3 places at one time. Makeing sure that my team members were in the right place at the right time to help all suspecting customers with any issues that they had. My most enjoyable part of working for Advance, was learning all I could about cars. The know how to fix something that has broken or went wrong under my hood. Dealing with my customers on a day to day basis also made me very happy."
good,Sell parts and stock shelves. If you need a second job and a little extra cash its not to bad. Hardest part of the job is not getting frustrated with the customers. Best part if you love cars you get to see and learn about all sorts of new products.
good,"Handled all aspects of store. Managed employees, inventory, displays."
good,"I would like to work for them again, they didnt have room for me to advance at the time, I am now 2 year store mgr. I think the situation may improve."
good,"Eg; Corporate in Virginia tell us how to staff, how many workers, during what hours, etc. They do not know our busy/slow hours of day."
good,"It was ok. But if your a woman at some locations you will disappointed because management treats you different from the men. Im not saying that it goes for all the locations, just for reisterstowns location."
good,Strong push on sales and upselling even if the customer is not interested. Management above store level seems disconnected and seems more concerned with sells and not customer satisfaction.
good,It's was a good job at first but with the company changing its head office employees so much throughout the 2 year I worked there it slowly got worse in my opinion. They would come in and change almost everything from the shift hours to the layout of the building and it was a little frustrating at times.
good,Management team will not stick their neck out for you but if you show that you're willing to put in the effort and work as hard as you can then you do eventually see the results.
good,Enjoy helping people. Seeing results at the end of the day. There is not enough time to do your job correctly as a manager. Training could be much better.Helping people correct their problem is most satisfying to me.
good,"A bilingual hard working individual with lots of retail experience. I offer skills like scheduling, inventory, hiring personal, etc. I’m change oriented and a quick leaner. I have broken stores and turned them around to profitable stores in a few months."
good,It is for the most part a good place to work. You get to know the customers and you get to learn about the retail side of the automotive industry. If you like cars you will like it here
good,"Good place to work just not consistent with employees. Pool Table, high medical low coverage. Handbook I there is a lot of  lead way with what managers can or can not do to correct team members"
good,"if it weren't for the location this would be a great place to work, you have to get on your knees for drivetime, which is crazy. you just leave any logical thinking at the door."
good,Cool laid back. Nice environment. I wish I could go back and continue to work there. I loved my hours and I lived the overtime pay. We got paid holidays as well
good,require minimum of 50 hours a week and on call all the time and the pay does not meet the hours you end up working. on average store managers have to work 60 to 70 hours a week
good,It helped pay the bills but idk how an adult can make a living doing it full time. Unrealistic sales goals set by corporate that were complete unattainable.
good,i think advance is a strong company with a long history of being a leader in the field.  over the years advance has helped me to grow with strong leadership.
good,"Fast-paced with customers at an up and down rate. No one holds GMs, DMs to the same standards as far as attendance. They dont hire from within as promotions. they hire people outside the company and expect the employees they overlooked to train the new employee that's above them."
good,"management will throw out anyone for any reason when they want to move someone up in the company but other than that, its a great place to work. When i mean management im talking about the district managers and Loss prevention. They will watch the good employees and look away from the corrupted and harassing employess/management"
good,"My position was a driver which I loved. Being forced to work sales not so much.I did not know anything about working on cars which made counter work extremely stressfull and was not worth the 8.50 an hour I was paid. "
good,Low pay with very slow advancement opportunity.  Was hired as an assistant manager with the promise of advancement when a store was available.  This would had taken years and I couldn't wait.
good,"The year I was there we went through 3 different district managers. The warehouse was always dirty, orders took longer then usual to fill due to the lack of effort from the team members."
good,"Managers are required to work 50 hrs a week and possibly more depending on the work load.  "
good,"Have been with the company multiple years, promotion is obtainable with good work ethic, turnover is very high, upper management disconnected with realistic performance of stores goals, will work you nonstop if you let them, pay isn’t bad, a lot is expected out of a salaried manager position"
good,If you like dealing with car people and learning the way that talk about car parts. Then it’s ok. But some of the customer can be pretty rude on the price for their parts.
good,Advance Auto Parts is a great place to work. The hardest part about working there is taking the information a customer is giving you and translating it to what they are actually looking for.
good,"I have been to a few of our advance Auto stores and ALL of them are ran differently.. there is never a set of guidelines that are followed. The amount of manual labor that goes into an Exploris store to make sure inventory is correct and the store is in order, is not balanced based on the pay.. APAL stores are a little better.."
good,The typical day at advance starts with putting away freight. Then the morning deliveries. The hardest part of the job is the fact that there is some many different vehicles that it is difficult to give better advice due to the fact that i do not know enough.
good,"I enjoyed my time there with the store team members, district leaders and commercial account managers. Store members are protected and taken good care of. Positions outside of store or at GM or above get challenging. Hours were crazy and work never seemed to end. Pay and bennys were good, but with the hours it kinda gets watered down to below average. Work 5-6 days weekly. Putting on training events in the evenings, working special events on the weekends. CAM is on call essentially. Culture of never stop working. Not a ton of upward mobility or ability to change roles without stepping backwards to do so. No real structure to promote individual development career wise."
good,"Customers were usually angry. "
good,A typical day of work consist of coming on time & being able to stand. I learned how to operate Fork-lifts & Hand held computers which was easy to program. Most of the time we had different Managers but they all was fun to be around & communicate on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours with just two 15min breaks & one 30min break. I enjoyed working in the environment because of the space that the building provided to move around.
good,Worked here for 5 years and didn't move up in rank or pay grade management didn't help with anything had to learn on my own co workers where cool though
good,Great job but had to perform manager duties and did not receive managent pay nor the position to go with it. When the spot had opened I would apply and still get told that I was not capable of the job but yet I was completeing it
good,"was a great place to work before it sold, cutting cost at every expence has made it hard for any one to get ahead and do a job. I wouldn't recommend it as a good place to work"
good,Advance can be a great place to work for if you are in the right store with the right manager. With that being said you will not advance beyond a retail or commercial manager if you start in the company. The upper management tries to micromanage without any solutions for real problems that will prevent you from achieving personal goals.
good,Auto retail environment. Selling parts keeping store clean and helping customers out. Stocking shelves and handling money. Making sure store was stocked and looked good.
good,"Fast-paced work environment, limited career advancements, when slow there are many things to do around the store. Easy learning."
good,"The price mark ups are horrendous, they only want you to sell sell sell, I often times suggest they order online where at least it is discounted. This being said, we should be paid more for what customers expect of us."
good,I learned the value of customer service and positive attitudes in a fast paced job can go a long way working for advanced helped me as far as gaining parts knowledge
good,Good place to work if you have another job also. Have to make it known that you will work only certain days and hours or be taken advantage of by management. Learned that certain customers get better treatment than others. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work without someone right beside you constantly.
good,"The pay is not great"
good,Good stepping stone to gain experience for cars and customer service. The job can be stressful but once the right training is given work isn't as hard.
good,"Depending on the store location, it can be a quick paced and/or slow paced environment. You learn terminology of parts, parts location and identification. You learn vast automotive knowledge if you are willing. Learn logistics and reverse logistics. Learn sales. Gain knowledge and build relationships with your walk in and commercial customers."
good,"A typical day at work is stressful. When we get busy with customers, there's no time for errors or tasks. We get backed up on in store tasks because we are understaffed. I have learned most of my mechanical skills from working at my job. Management is a twisted subject. I have worked for the company for 5 years and 3 different stores. Each store was unique with their management so I can't really say anything about an overall outlook on the management side. The hardest part of my job is balancing out what the important things are and overcome the overwhelming feeling of being busy. The most enjoyable part is being able to have conversations with certain customers about their vehicles and actually understand the terminology being used as they explain what type of vehicle they are working on. Some customers have awesome stories to tell about their project vehicles."
good,By the time I had gotten to Advanced I was really struggling to want to stay in the industry because I had been in it for so long.  This makes it hard for me to give an honest review.  I was really struggling with the lack of knowledge about the industry from Management all the way down to new employees.
good,Typical retail environment. Advancement in minimal. Will receive product training consisting of modules. They will not teach you other product knowledge.
good,Just like marriage... Started off good then the honeymoon is over and you start finding out things. I learned a ton from my superiors. The company seems to be driven by rules and regulations than customer satisfaction and retention. Things change all the time and way too quickly. Stability does not seem to be a priority.
good,Sometimes I would open and close the store because my store manager would leave when he felt like leaving which would leave me to uphold the retail registers and safe and making sure the store was properly opened and closed along with keeping the storefront well stocked and ordering necessary parts and products when inventory count was low or out of stock. Sometimes coming in at 7 am and not leaving till 8 pm because my store manager did not see through with his tasks leaving me to complete all opening and closing protocol to the best of my ability.
good,I was let go after they had me train all the new employees. Then when I filed for unemployment I got approved and never got a penny. So I had to struggle up until now where I'm still trying to find a job.
good,Overall this is a nice place to work. Either part time or full time this job can be fun. The pay isn't the greatest but the customers are great and its nice to help people. This job does not offer any benefits.
good,"It was an OK place to work for in the beginning. They want u kiss the butt, Just a lot a petty stuff going on with this company the supervisor don't know what there doing . Go work there and find out for youself"
good,"As a Gm long work days 10+, district managers are usually very good folks but with the recent changes to corporate management they have lost focus of taking care of the people under them. Including the customers they service."
good,"No advancement, low pay and upper management is ignorant to what stores need in stock for customers. Needed 50 more characters in the review before I can exit."
good,"Waiting on customers and putting parts away"
good,"Advanced Auto Parts was fantastic in gaining automotive parts knowledge, however lacked upper management integrity and overall support.  This does not relate to all areas of the company."
good,"Working at advance auto parts was great constantly learning someting new. As an employee every month sometimes 2x a month we were set to watch Diy videos, on how to improve the information we give the customers. Sometimes we were set to change batteries, lightbulb and trinckets like that, although as a mechanic I know that stuff. It was great knowing that a company wants its employees to exceed on the part knowledge and not just sell. As for my expirience working for a company that I worked for 3 yrs nearly 4, I was never given the proper chance to go past part-time. Until I decided to take a two week vacation which became a problem, and turned out to me leaving the company for good."
good,"Relaxed work environment, inconsistent hours, unequal pay. Started part time, said I needed evening shifts and immediately was placed in morning, working over 50 hours a week, some 12 hour shifts"
good,"used to be a great place work, but many corp changes over the years has degraded the company from what it was. Trying to get turned around in a highly competitive environment creates a huge challenge to the future of this company and its employees"
good,"Understaffed to save money, lack of inventory to save money.  While these things save on one hand, eventually they cost more to the company in lost revenue due to inability to service customers properly."
good,"When it is slow, it is slow in there you get sent home regardless. And when you are not in their clique, you get treated like poo. Over all liked job, Hard work."
good,"i thing it is a good company, but they have to proby more benefits and hours to the employees. it is a nice place to get the experience of retail and learn about custumer"
good,"Advance is somewhere i would not tell someone to go get a job at. The hours are never steady, you might work an 8 hour shift one night then end up working 5 the next night. The employees are way under paid for what we have to do. The management is very poor and is unwilling to work with you or hear you out on any complaints you might have. There is no room for advancement at all."
good,"Advance Auto Parts used to be a fantastic place to work and I would have recommended it to anyone. After the acquisition of Carquest didn't profit the company as they expected, rolling out a new Point of Sale System and a rewards program that only really rewards the hardcore do-it-yourself customer, the company decided to cut one of the most important things to properly run a store. Labor hours were drastically cut across many stores, limiting our ability to available to customers, effectively deliver parts to many of our professional customers and ensure our stores are properly presentable. Until this company can learn to not be as afraid of labor hours as it is, I would not recommend working for this company."
good,I found out with the company realignment that they didn't care about you and you were only a number. Overall I enjoyed my job and being on the road daily meeting with commercial customers
good,Working at Advance was fun for the most part. I delivered auto parts and also worked in the store. The only reason i left is because they cut my hours and gave them to someone who worked there previously and was best friends with the General Manager. It was a political issue within the store itself but I liked Advance itself.
good,I didn't really take the job too serious in the beginning but eventually I begin to like it and I tried to learn all I could. so I can honestly say its what you make it. room to grow if you work hard enough. I saw many promotions while I was employed there.
good,"maintaining the floor of the store clean, making sure all planograms are up to date. Helping customers as needed with looking up parts and help solve the problems they're having. To deliver parts at a timely manner to our commercial accounts"
good,There is plenty of opportunity to grow and learn at this company. The job tasks are fairly simple and management is usually willing to move you up and give you a raise when it's deserved. If anything ruins this job position it is the co-workers you may get stuck with.
good,"I spent most of my time fixing mistakes that other employees created the day before, and when I came to work the following day, the same mistakes would be there again. It was incredibly disorganized, and I spoke with every level of management within that location and nothing was addressed or fixed. Training was an absolute joke, and the hours got to be ridiculous. Mandatory overtime was a regular occurrence because of the problems that no one wanted to address. Product would be stocked wrong, which in turn led to the product no being able to be found when it was supposed to be collected and sent out. Resulting in delays and back ups in productivity. The key issues that affected efficiency were never addressed no matter who I spoke with about it."
good,"In the short time I worked there, there was a lot of drama and stressful duties. Everything was disorganized, store function wasn't easy going at all. The management that used to be at that store was plain awful... Thankfully they're both gone now, so my review here is definitely out of date. From what I've seen the store recently turned around and has been better lately. So it could possibly be a good work environment now."
good,I do indeed learn lots of new things each day most of the customer make it the environment worth working for. For the most part things are well pay is ok but nothing is consistent. the schedule is never stable its back and fourth and very inconvenient for people with a familey plus the health benefits are not worth having or dental way to expensive.
good,overall management wasn't the best in terms of operation and overall welfare of the corporation. Employees are train more to focus on themselves verses the ideal team focused environment.
good,When it comes to the daily routine there are only a few things that need be done. The issue with working here as briefly as i have is corporate and at extension the manager is only concerned about numbers and statistics. Daily sales are reasonable for the most part provided you maintain your position. Its the other numbers that are ridiculous. Their rewards program is the main focus of the company at present. If you are unable to get a specified number of signups each week you are threatened with termination or hour docking. The issue is the program needs a phone number a name both first and last and an email. When it comes to daily customers most are repeats so we do not see much of a verity and the ones we do see do not wish to have their emails or phone numbers stored anywhere and as such do not sign up. Only been working here a few weeks not even a month yet and if it weren't for this rule i would likely not be looking elsewhere.
good,"With retail and food service companies offering $10.00 per hour to start with no experience, AAP does not compete for quality hourly employees very well.  Company does not recognize that we are competing with all retailers, food service and general labor segments.  Not just the other automotive retailers."
good,"Fine place to work if you don't mind low pay and high hours. AAP puts high expectations on employees but the compensation isn't great. Lots of promises of advancement and ""bonuses"" that are basically unreachable due to work load."
good,This place was a disaster when the old boss was there. They sent over a new boss and she changed the store up a lot for the better. Just the atmosphere was different every other day. It got to the point that i didnt want to deal with all the drama and different personalities changing. I didnt want to be around that negativity anymore
good,"No hours I could never get morning shift I always had to close"
good,"This company was an average experience. The job is not that intensive, but morale is at a low, and it shows in the customer service. Overall, a decent job to supplement an income with, but it is non constructive beyond that."
good,This was a good job for me to start into the professional side of the workforce. Very good availability to work with me on hours regarding my school schedule. Management could do better in valuing employees and the effort they put into a retail job.
good,"Too many management shuffling, Integration problems post acquisition. System issues. Not many internal growth opportunities due to new management. Good team and wonderful coworkers. Great location and plenty of stores nearby. Seems to have too many growing pains and integration problems but if you stick through it, it may work out in thelong run."
good,"There is no advancement in a good buddy system.  General managers have no leeway and  they are tangled by their  inability to make correct, good decisions, and are threatened with their jobs."
good,"not enough hrs to much stress by management , not a team player job , not a good [pay for the  job performance , not proper training for new employee"
good,Just do your work and hope for the best. Cause at any time they will pull the plug on you no matter if they wrong or not. It's very good place but like I said the people in charge are not the most considered people in charge.
good,Not much to say. Just that if you are between jobs it will get you through tough times. A bunch of hopes and dreams until reality hits you. You will start as a driver at minimum wage for a very long time before you are even thought of to get a five cent raise once a year.
good,customer service skills different people come and go but you get to satisfy them. working with my employees as a team and showing that i was dependable
good,hours are shared and minimal with tasks always growing as well as advancement only taking place when necessary or when needed
good,This location is particularly slow and had little business. Nice people but to boring for me. There's a lot to learn if your willing though.
good,"I enjoyed the job driving a lot, but did not like the workplace as a whole. I always felt bad for the guys working up front who were paid just over minimum wage but expected to have a mechanic's knowledge by endless often angry customers. There's a good bit of lifting and climbing ladders involved for any employee."
good,"accomplish new sales everyday."
good,"sold  products"
good,I like helping customers making sure they are Happy when they leave store Great people to work with solving customers problems is a good feeling
good,"A normal day is usually slower than i would like it to be, i like staying busy. Although this job has taught me to be patient with customers as well as co-workers. The management  could communicate better and be more active in the store. I have no complaints about the co-workers, the majority of the time everyone does there job and pulls their own weight around the store. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job is not having something to do and waiting for customers come in. My favorite part is helping someone with their car whether it be putting a battery in for them or helping them find a part another store didn't have."
good,I delivered parts to shops and mechanics. I liked being able to get out of the store. Was able to develop a report with most of the shops and mechanics.
good,Looking for more hours im not getting enough hours i need to have steady work schedule  i love working outside just not enough. Hours too be working.
good,Ya'll are going to work hard for barely enough money and have to have the store looking brand new for the time of open
good,"You can't work more than 32hrs a week for 3 weeks. otherwise you have to become full time so, they put you on a list and, your hours get lowered to almost nothing."
good,"All work with no reward. in the past year that I've worked they have taken a lot of rewards from....bonuses, pto, etc. I wish i Knew that before I started working there."
good,"A typical day would be answering phones, helping customers in store, cleaning shelves, dusting products, front facing products, changing windshield wipers, and batteries. One co-worker does whatever they like without facing any repercussions. Which is very nerve-racking because I have been left alone in the store with a customer and phones ringing off the hook. That would be the hardest part of the day if I am ever left alone in the store. Or when co-workers let their personal problems effect their attitude at work. The most enjoyable part would be when everyone does their job and we do work as a team. It makes things flow smoother and that makes happy returning customers."
good,"I had the opportunity to learn more about auto parts, thus aiding me in my ability to help out the customers. It was a friendly environment."
good,hours are all over the place. Upper management is very cryptic as to what is going on in the company. you never know what is going on. Its very hard to move up. the dont care about there employees.  great job if you dont have a life
good,Understaffed to meet the customers needs. Upper Management could care lease about their employees. They completely took away your ability to serve the customers needs.
good,"Too many changes at different levels. Like most large companies, all employees become just another number. Hardest part of the job is not knowing who to contact at any given time because they are no longer working there or have moved to another area without anyone getting notified."
good,The store itself is doing horrible. I am one of the most knowledgeable employees they have. Perform well above the SPH( Sales Per Hour) goal. Customers trust me they know I will give them the correct part they think I am a manager because of how I manage myself but I am just a sales man. I have to put up stock while everyone else just jokes around and they do not get written up. Their are a lot of favorites in the store I work in and I am simply tired of doing everything.
good,"pallets pallets and more pallets, fast paced environment where you have to be on your P's and Q's at all times. Cold and hot environment at times depending on the time of year."
good,"Everything is about sales. Manager cuts employees hours to reduce store costs, raising store profits, to improve his/her year end bonus. it is everyman for himself and would not work there under this management again."
good,"There is no promotions at advance auto parts into the management"
good,"I have been a hardworking, loyal employee for over 10 years.  Being a large Corporation, they truly do not respect their employees.  I have learned a lot about management and continued to treat my employees with respect and appreciation for the work they do"
good,"Job is great initially , There is room to move up within the company but very slow. Great job for young adults but not good for making a career out of it."
good,"Company has a strong turn over in employment, most work for a year or less,and those who stay longer, do not get recognized for any accomplishments that are made within your stores unless you are one of the elite group."
good,"A typical day for me consists of multi tasking serving customers, assisting service techs as needed, process shipments, order inventory, etc. The hardest part of my job is to get a irate customer to understand why a certain service is in his or her best interest when it is more of a financial commitment than the customer was prepared to make.   "
good,"Not bad for a retail gig. Low wages, odd hours, high expectations, good benefits even for part timers. Managers are weak in most cases. Showing favoritism and infighting among themselves. Management is very political at the district to store level."
good,"Being a regular employee, the pay wasn't bad. Advancing to night manager and making less than new employees was a major problem. The manager also refused to balance schedule around college, which led to termination over placing college schedule first. Other than these flaws I enjoyed working with this company. it offered advancement and many things to learn."
good,"The upper management has a high turnover rate, but even when they were good, there were mostly hands off. You have to make your own way, or you go nowhere."
good,"There is much to be improved with this company, such as computer and parts databases, as well as warranty records and customer service."
good,"Hours were not family friendly, good working conditions and enjoyed working with the customers"
good,This company lacks structure and respect for the associates.
good,"High stress work environment. customhouses where mostly un-happy with most results of not having parts on hand, network system to track parts, history, warranty was bad. Not a happy place to work."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is to help customers fix there vehicles
good,A typical day at work depends on your position. As a sales associate you answer phones and provide solutions to automotive problems. The pay and benefits could be better. Good job if you are a student or if you have your sites on becoming a manager.
good,Working with cross-functional teams from around the nation contributed to a challenging work environment that involved bridging multiple gaps and overcoming cultural roadblocks.
good,"Begin recording your work time. Document every minute of the day on any work or projects you are working on. Be ready to provide technical support for Macs, software support, Adobe CC support, go between person for your department and IT. Using Photoshop path up to 23-50 images a week, created naming scheme, load images on art server and DAM. Flight check and process PDFs for print to multiple printer vendors. Print large inkjet banners, signage, package design and other signage for the team. Train every new team member project management software, InDesign, Photoshop. Manage Apple workstations in multiple states for the team. Working with IT to replicate art in multiple states. Order all supplies for the team including, images, office supplies, toners, inkjet inks and papers. Provide training of the asset management tool to over 100 corporate and vendors partners."
good,this was a fast pace fun environment. meeting competive sales goals and helping on customers projects. i learned a lot about cars. management was fair in proportioning hours and work load. the hardest part was installing batteries. my co workers were young and upbeat and we worked well as a team during rush hr. the most enjoyable part of my job was the team work.
good,"Good first job, let s you figure out what your capable of with working with public."
good,it was a good place to work and i would tell someone that there is no advancement with the company.
good,"Cashier, handling large sums of money, ordering of car parts, stocking, and counting inventory and placing items in accurate positions, as well as setting up displays of new promotional items, and keeping surrounding areas clean and sanitary. Helping customers find there auto needs and assisting, removing and putting in batteries in vehicles as well as windshield wipers."
good,non consistent if your a commercial driver. I did gain valuable knowledge in vehicles.
good,"Advance Auto use to have a theme stating ""the best part is our people"".  This no longer is true.  Recently they have hired and promoted management from outside the company.  Many Management people with 10+ years of service have been fired or have chosen to resign.  Much turnover and very low morale as a result."
good,"Working for advanced auto parts I didn't get enough hours to take care of myself. I was making $50 or more sales a day by looking up and selling car parts, and also delivering car parts because I was a mobile pro driver, but I was still only working less than 25 hours a week. In order to become a full time employee at Advance Auto Parts you have to work there a year or longer. Management was ok but the store manager was a womanizer. He was very sexes. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and helping solve solutions."
good,"A typical day would be to clock in and see what is needed to be delivered. Then do back stock, after that straight the store. After that find things to make you stay busy. maybe check the trash or straighten the counters. Then It would be time to go home. Loved working there."
good,Enjoyed the Job and it got me through college.
good,"Had great experiences here, with the exception of one manager I had, just a ""dinosaur"" who just stuck around for the pay and wont retire AND would tell customers he didn't care when faced with problems."
good,"The job was mostly performed w/o supervision or other co-workers. The job itself was great, but there was not enough hours given to support myself or to justify the long trip to work. If it were not for that I would still be there, I miss it."
good,As an assistant they don't pay well. They require you to do 50 hours but the advancement in the company is to a minimum. Company is hiring from the outside with people that have no car knowledge.
good,"My typical day is 8-5. I've learned alot about the different parts of an automobile and how they work. The level of management hasn;t changed any but the personality of management has changed drastically. My co-workers used to be fun and out going but now they are more ""childish"" like behavior"
good,A typical day at work is hot and sweaty fast pace lifting heavy products. I learned how it to really appreciate team work for meeting deadlines. Management could have been better. Co- workers was not always providing consistant team work. When you have team memebers not doing they part to get the job done in a timely manner. Being off on friday and saturday.
good,"enjoyable, busy, interesting work, lots to learn about vehicle maintenance and upkeep"
good,clock in go in shop talk to first shift to see what was going on if anything if not finish any repair on mhe that i was working on the previous day of start a repair on a piece of equipment or a p.m on something sometimes boss would ask you to do something else like hang picture in office unclog drain in restroom etc.
good,"A typical day consisted of answering phone calls, controlling inventory, stocking merchandise and selling parts. I learned more about automotive parts. The upper management dealt with us mostly by phone. I worked at a few different locations and worked with some great people. The hardest part about this job was working ten hour shifts off one hour of sleep due to having two jobs. The best part about this job was the information you received about cars and taking care of customers."
good,"nice people, somewhat nice customers. very hands on and fast paced."
good,Really enjoyed the job and I learned alot. Had a great manager who taught me alot and knew alot about the auto parts industry
good,It was a Great place to work. I loved my coworkers but when it came to management and corporate politics it was a disaster. Switching DM's every year so you barely got to know any of them made zero sense.
good,"A typical day at work consist of me stocking the work truck on the floor, counting inventory, shooting outs, and mark defective parts. As customers walk in , I engage them greet them, ask how can I help them. my management overlooks me to make sure every thing is set. work culture is pretty focused and medium paced. hardest part of the job is when we short staffed and busy but as long as you're focused it'll be fine. most enjoyable thing about the job is the customers you meet."
good,The job let's you learn a lot about the automotive world but has very little forward movement. If you work over 40 hours you are fired. The higher ups care little about you and prepare to be understaffed (and this is coming from the highest grossing store in our region). If you are looking for a good side delivery job it's great! However if you want a job to fill hours best look elsewhere. Your $ per hour will struggle to break 10 at best and the work required to have it. If you were doing this because you like cars like I did just become a mechanic instead
good,It was a great energetic environment. Staff was nice. I learned how to work with a faster pace and how to take the initiative on things. I also learned how to be a leader from the perspective of not being management.
good,The DC was poorly managed and there was plenty of favoritism going on. Some people can say they did not want to do something and the supervisor would pass the job to someone else.
good,If you don't mind being told you will get 32 hours (which the company conciders full time employment) and end up getting 15-25 with no say so what days or hours you work then this will be a job for you.
good,"I only work part time, only the weekend.  I've been doing this for close to 12 years.  I enjoy what I do, helping people with their car problems.  Very knowledgeable..."
good,Typical parts store experience. Good location from home. nice staff. Won't move up unless you're part of management. Clean store. Sunday's are probably the busiest.
good,"The company struggles in new England yet refuses to pay a decent wage, yet wonders why they have such a high turn over rate with counter people except the ones who cant work anywhere else.  Comercial Parts is all thats keeping most branches afloat."
good,"After interviewinf three times for store manager, they told me I didn't have enough exp. Okay fine. after working for the company 12 years, the new bonus structure and the pressure of forcing sales on customers and the way the individual was graded on performance; it got too corporate and lost the small town part store vibe. More about the dollar and less about the person. Employees were easily replaced and not with quality people. Towards the end it lost the luster it once had and my input and suggestions where never taken into consideration. Didn't feel valued as an employee."
good,I actually loved this job. The only problem I think Advance has is the pay; for this city it’s pretty bad. They start you off at about $9.50/hr. $10/hr if you’re lucky. Fortunately the people that work there were fun
good,"I love my job, but its not flexible and not enough money. Life changes everyday. I don't feel like this is some that I can make a career out of and I wish I could because I Love my job."
good,Good place to learn retail. Not a place you want to make a career. Not a good place to advance you career. Job promotions are rare. Goals and technical side of operating company constantly changes. upper management at top no clue what goes on in a store.
good,great job to chill on  Little responsibility real simply culture broken though typical day deliver parts to local shops get parts from warehouse other stores stock selves
good,"I was a former employee at advanced auto and left because they didn't want to give me a pay raise although I was flying high in colors for commission rates and doing an outstanding job, I provided excellent customer service and did my job timely, and always worked overtime or double shifts. Its not a long term job if that's what anyone is looking for. And they don't give you any good benefits."
good,the job was good and pretty easy the management was the only problem  I think if they get better management then the job will run smooth and sweet sailing
good,very little room for advancement pay raises are far and few between if ever did learn a lot about different cars and auto parts other than that not a great place to work
good,"The Company has everything that the best company should have but they have poor and management problems. I have been working there for a year now, They let go almost everybody that was there for not good reasons. Every time when they hire new team members, the old team members will have multiple write up. Most of the new team members won't resist the pressure and behavior of some managers. My direct manager told me that he left to go 35 employees in less than five months since he was hired in the company. But in general, the company has a new warehouse management system (High Jump), huge parking lot, nice break room with ping pong game and very good pieces of equipment like flat TVs, IC machine, coffee machines, and microwaves. The company has also a nice locker room for everybody, nice policy, and benefits."
good,"Your experience at Advance Auto Parts will vary based on the people you work with and the people directly above. In my experience when I first started it was great, the manager was nice and understanding but a year and a half later I wanted out because he got promoted (deservedly so) and the new manager was not as nice and hands on which made a lot of employees leave creating a staff shortage our store never recovered from"
good,Training could be way better. I was literally put on the cash register on the first day on the job with almost no knowledge of their system worked. The physical labor needing done for this job doesn't match your pay rate. Customers are somewhat nice and sometimes clueless as to what they need for their vehicle so you got help them fill in the blanks. If you scheduled an 9 hour shift you get an hour long lunch.
good,"In my area they start you at 8:50/hr which is lower than most other company's starting pay. You are required to learn a lot of skills in order to do your job which is a good thing and while the general manager was really good at keeping the store running, upper management was clueless and set unreasonable goals. The hardest part of the job was remembering where all the parts were in the back area and the best part of the job was connecting with customers, helping them find the correct solution for their problem and gaining their confidence in order to make them loyal customers"
good,good company just work alot of hrs for the pay.cost me my wife and family. but if you are single go for it ....................................................
good,they pay less than most fast food jobs. The amount of work and knowledge required for the level of compensation is a joke. I would not go back there unless they start to pay more.
good,Not a difficult job pay attention to what you're told although I do feel the manager at my location could have done a little bit better about getting after employees who totally avoided their job
good,Goo people to work with though upper management is reactive instead of being proactive. This is a large corporation so I understand things on the upper level take some time but lower management down to the store level follows suit.
good,the culture is undergoing drastic changes. Just like every company change is necessary to advance. We will weather the waters to come out on the positive side of the change
good,"As the title says my manager (GM) was promising me some sort of advancement and/or pay raise. Shortly after I realized it may be MUCH longer until I ever get my opportunity they went and hire some guy (who obviously had less knowledge of motor vehicles than I, or anyone else that worked there) and pay him a whole dollar more than me. No thanks, I'm out."
good,It was an ok job just didn’t like the fact that we didn’t have a manager for a very long time and everyone would do what they wanted and we were under staffed
good,Ok company to work for ok pay but poor management and poor work ethic in employees and managers I worked here for a year now and the stores have not gotten any better
good,I learned to not allow for people to not pay me what I am worth. To maintain professionalism within the workplace no matter what and stay being a Team-player no matter what.
good,"I went into Advance Auto Parts because I have a passion for cars. The company satisfied my curiosity. I love working for the company because it teaches its employees about car systems and I have learned all that I could possibly learn about cars."
good,"I Worked here 3 years. Never enough coverage & pushy upper-level management targetting sales.Don't expect to get a lunch break there's never enough coverage to take one."
good,"I have been through 4 GM's.all have their flaws, but showing favoritism is not tolerable. The job is fun but alot is placed on one person. Outside of their own work they need to complete."
good,Pay is low people quit or get fired often customer's are extremely rude or dumb or worse both put away deliveries too much supplies not enough for it all waste of time and money
good,My 19 years at Advance were not always stressful but the last year has been stressful- the manager was disrespectful and  arrogant and I have not been subjected to that kind of treatment in 50 years of employment. If you are looking for an experienced part-time counter person who is dependable-good natured and there’s a location close to my home with a need then I am the man who can enhance your business. I left on my own-I was not terminated.
good,"I enjoyed my time there but only because of a few of my co-workers, they are good but there's no point in asking for a set schedule. I have multiple times compromised my beliefs for the job only to be expected to work days I have been approved off without my consent I know I truly would not miss it."
good,I have been with the company for quite some time now and all i have received was a 15 cent raise after 6 months. For the work you do it is not work $10 dollars an hour for someone who is bilingual. having full time hours without the benefits still barely gets me by for bills and food.
good,"schedules as an assistant manager are difficult because they changed a lot especially with advanced auto parts, you had to do a lot of different stuff and were not really well compensated and little to no benefits"
good,The manger is not very good but the team around is they get there job done on time and share the workload pretty well. Good job if you know how to keep your head down
good,Good place to work for the most part.  I would recommend more promotions within and support for mid management. Too much noise and not a lot of direction.
good,I don’t have anything to say. It was a job the didn’t pay well so I got another job and when I reached the point of making full time with 50 plus hours I left.
good,Very good company to work for. Flexible.schedules. Friendly associates very knowledgeable. You learn so much about cars and business workings. Fun atmosphere
good,Enjoyed driving parts to various businesses. I enjoyed working for the manager who is no longer there and enjoyed meeting all the individuals on my deliveries. Job wasn't hard.
good,"Someday we're good, some days not as good. The air conditioning worked in all the vehicles that I drove and was a good thing. The air conditioning  did not work all The time I. The store"
good,Typical day at work was face pace. You had to get the client in and out if possible. Management was not the best. The workplace was clean neat and organize at the location that I work. The hardest part about the job for me was trying to put a windshield wiper on a car. I could never get that down pack. The enjoyable part of the job for me was when I was delivering part to the vendor
good,Neverending learning of new parts and availability and ways to get parts. Great place if your taught right. Upper management is great! Store level needs to be assessed.
good,"My location is a very fun place to work at, Although there are no yearly raises and no room for advancement as well as most of the locations though out saint Augustine, great company but hourly pay at 9.oo per hour, makes it more of a job for collage kid then a family man."
good,Very fast paced industry that can be cut-throat. Not for everyone. Must know cars. Must be able to understand car lingo. The pay is not enough for the work you are required to do.
good,Only think I disliked was there was no room for advancement .. the bonus structure was for pennies and the company culture kept changing .. not a bad job just not for me
good,the job itself was a piece of cake but management was horrible..allowed  family members more hours and advancement over other employees with more experience and time on the job management did not stand by its employees when a problem came up they would always side with company even when the employee wasn't wrong
good,"I started here at the age of 18 and think it was a great place to start working at. I did learn a lot and was able to work my way up to assistant manager quite quickly. Unfortunately, a district manager hired in two family members from outside the company and promoted them to store managers at our store and the next nearest location. This made me feel like my time working up the ladder had been wasted so I chose to advance my career with another employer."
good,"Come in, work hard, be patient."
good,Coworkers are very fun and know how to make time pass also are very knowledgeable in our field which helps me to learn a lot which i really appreciate. Eventho the hours and pay arent great its still and fun learning experience working there.
good,A typical day at Advance Auto Parts it was ok..I learned a lot about car dealership and how they get there parts to fix there customer cars.i liked driver car parts to DIY customer as well as businesses.
good,Company retools all the time cutting hours. Changing titles and pay structure. Can not depend on anything.  Will cut hours or pay without warning or reason. Once you are located anywhere promotion may be froze for years.
good,I love the job. But for working with advance auto parts you have to put them first and family last. My manager told me to pay someone to go to my sons appointments
good,"Typical work day involves dealing with customers and stock.  There is always stock to put up or take down or rearrange the store.  "
good,It should be a straight forward job in retail auto parts. A few things makes this job good and bad. You are often under staffed if you are closing to cut payroll costs. Most of the help that is hired has no car or parts knowledge. They do not pay as well as the other parts stores. It can be a fun place to work given everyone does their part but it is mostly put off onto a few people. Training is basic at best.
good,"Hours fluctuate depending on corporate. Store operations are micromanaged by corporate to satisfy the shareholders and have significant profit gains. Pay for experience is drastically under par for other jobs in the automotive, customer service, and management positions as well as subject to personal emotions of certain employees than professional experience and worth."
good,"the company was a lot better before merging with car quest and world pac. they sometimes have targets forecasted way too high."
good,"I have worked for the company for four years and have experienced the best and worst of retail management , Somebody with a thick skin and easy temperament has the ability to do OK here. The team culture is strong, and supportive but that does not carry over to management team who usually seem more preoccupied than helpful or concerned with team members ."
good,"From top leadership down, AAP is committed to be the best at delivering delight to customers. The merger with CARQUEST gave both companies opportunities to reach more customers in new ways."
good,"Average: Average opportunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the only problem I had was the pay rate was not enough to cover the cost of living.  Also the advancement opportunities were not as openly available as they explained to me when I was hired on."
good,I really liked this job i drove around all day. didnt have to stand around the store. It was stressful as well cause their are alot of bad drivers and it is a high risk job.
good,"I've worked in the industry for over 20 years, not a bad company, could pay a little better, Some of the store managers are not good,"
good,Managing staff at a fast pace and also completing store task while taking car of customers and answering phones. The great part about the job is being able to interact with customer and assisting them with situating.
good,"I have done retail, stocking, inventory, planogram mostly a lot of delivery driving. Have always been on time and never missed a day of work accept when i got injured or a doctors appointment. Other then that the boss told me he was proud of me cause i came a long way."
good,"Advance Auto Parts was where I worked my first job. The whole experience is dependent on what store you work at. My colleagues were all pretty nice except my manager. He didn't know how to let employees grow. I made a few mistakes and he punished me for it the rest of my time there. Otherwise, good customer service role."
good,"Overall typical retail job, do more with less while maintaining company profits. "
good,its really cool working with cars. I just wish the way the company is ran was different. Its quick management turn over is the worst. Its raises depend on if you and the store meets the goals posted in the beginning of the year. So you con be here 3 to 4 years and never see a raise.
good,"Short staffed, low salary, too many hands in the pot at times, poor communications from other teams. Rarely received quarterly bonus and rarely given comp time for working over 40 hours"
good,Meeting and greeting people along with being able to get outside the store and deliver parts made the day more enjoyable. Learned about auto parts and vehicle repair.
good,"The company focuses more on the bottom line and less on their employees. If you want a career with Advance, I would not recommend it. The training is not very good and makes one feel like they are just going through the motions."
good,"Company is inconsistent. Im fulltime and get 25-30 hours. When mentioned about my hours to the manager he cuts them lower and say he'll look out for me. They dont give raises that often and dont care to much about your outside life. Hours aren't set. One day it'll be 8-3, and the next 10-6."
good,it was ok to work for  i just delivered parts parts and picked up parts from customers. was not a hard job at all just a lot of driving all over town and to the warehouse.
good,"I worked terrible hours, the folks there didn't really care, no lunch and the pay was terribly low and the I was put on the schedule for one day out of the week for a month."
good,Advance is a great place to work only a couple of flaws. Flaws include favoritism and not to much advancement opportunities. The hours are great and the work isn’t hard
good,Depends on the store.  Each store presents its own challenges.  I would only work here if your not afraid to work very hard and but underpaid.  The work culture is not great.
good,"The coworkers and general management are very supportive to ensure the store does well. Little support from upper management and limited, if any growth opportunities from the store level."
good,Too politically correct. Cant have fun. Have to watch all wordage. Makes a tense hostile work environment. Shouldnt have to stress about saying wrong thing and living on a edge of a needle.
good,"A typical day at work is conference calls in the AM w leadership then with support team."
good,Due to regular turnover in management there was no one person consistently in charge. The managers were good caliber people but they either had one foot out the door or a notable lack of experience.
good,The people there are good to work with; there is no drama or problems. That is about the only good thing about it though. Customers are often upset because their car isn't working and are often difficult to work with. Its also low paying. Its just not worth 8.50 an hour to change peoples car batteries in the winter when its freeing outside.
good,Poor planning on the part of Advance Auto when acquiring CarQuest. Lost a significant amount of commercial accounts due to poor planning on replenishment.
good,"After nearly a decade with the company I seem to have reached my cap in advancement. Should have been running my own store by now with my know-how and enthusiasm for the company but I don't believe they agree with promoting from within. Also, I was forced to relocate which does not sit well with me."
good,"Working at Advance Auto is just like working any other job in sales. You have to up-sell, you have to make sure the shelves are clean, there really isn't anything stressful, even if it gets busy. If you have an interest in cars this is a great place to work as you will be dealing with car parts and people a lot. If you're friendly and you know your way around an alternator you'll be fine."
good,At Advanced Auto Parts I typically looked up car parts and sold the part that was needed to the customer. I sometimes ran diagnostic tests and installed wiper blades and batteries. I learned a lot about cars and how to identify parts and there functions. The management was professional and fair. The workplace could get a little greasy and dirty. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting car problems but the most rewarding was helping people fix there car problems because we all know how much of a necessity a car is.
good,"Challenging disorganized environment due the pending merger of CARQUEST. While I'm thankful for the opportunity I can't recommend them for employment."
good,The job is not bad. Can be a great job if you have a good store manager and a good district manager. If you ever do get that combo it is quickly changed from restructuring or someone leaving because of getting burned out. They cut hours on part timers to the point where the simple tasks to get done can't so managers wind up working twice as much and getting stressed out.
good,"The management was horrible. It was such a stressful job for such little pay... Most of the employees were rude and didn't play as a team player. Made you work so hard for nothing in return ,"
good,I wouldn't recommend Advance as a career option due to slow advancement and low pay even after time served. Hard work and diligence do not necessarily mean am advancement in this company as in many cases they tend to hire from outside the company rather than promote from within. The company however does make a decent option for a temporary job while in school or while pursuing other advancement oureside the company.
good,"It was a good learning experience,But some of the employees were alittle much to deal with,But as long as you did your job you were well treated.Just the pay ."
good,staffing scheduling profit and lost control. Raining and development of team members. Cash management . Providing great customer service at all times.
good,"A typical day at work would be receiving the product into the system and reaching the goals. I learned how to separate different freight and make sure it gets to the right department. Working under good management prepared a good team. The managers had extensive set of skills to make sure we were set up to successfully to do the job. The workplace culture was a great environment to work in. Everyone was treated equally and there was an open door policy. The hardest part of my job is working in the heated environment, but it was easy to adapt. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different things and adapting to change."
good,My experience with this company wasn't a bad one.  I was part time and had a smooth time working here.  The general manager is good and that makes everything work better while i was there working.  Pay sucked and there were no raises. I left.
good,"Delivering parts to mechanics from our store back and forth. When it was slow with deliveries I would help stock the new shipments that came in, assist customers around the store and any questions they needed me to pull up on the computer for them about their vehicle. I also managed the register."
good,Started as a driver and worked up to a commercial sales and it took 6 years and quitting and coming back after being bugged for weeks no support from management level your on your own there til you screw up
good,A good company to work for. Management has changed multiple times in the last 2 years and that makes it harder to adapt. Current general manager is not the greatest
good,"when i started in 2014, the managers seemed to care about the employees. As the years went bye there was a lot of changes in management, this DC ran without a General Manager for over a year. The moral in the company has gone down hill. Their is a lot of favoritism as to who get promoted and who doesn't"
good,"poor pay, weak management, no advancement possibilities. Having been a store manager in the past I can see the problems here, there was no attempt to manage the people working here, only complaints from management to other employees about the work habits of others. Never any corrective measures instituted."
good,constantly working to get parts out of the warehouse to the stores. Need to be in good physical shape to pull orders in a timely matter.   overrall good place to work
good,"Loved learning parts and being a female it helps alot. "
good,Life can be rough sometimes as it is still retail. It's not so bad if you can sell parts and lay low. I had more bad days than good but individual experience may vary.
good,"A typical day at work involves delivering automotive parts to local dealership and automotive service centers. "
good,The job that I was doing was fun as I saw different people on the daily basis. It did not seem to be quick advancement with the company. My work days consisted in visiting commercial accounts and building sales with them as well. That was also the most favorite part of my job.
good,"Advance auto parts used to be a great company to work for until they merged with care quest. Since the merger many of the employees who have been with the company for 10+ years are no longer working for them. Write ups now come down from corporate offices instead of being issued by the store managers, due to employees not meeting required sales goals."
good,"Overall it is not a bad company to work for but they still have a few things to figure out."
good,Advance Auto Parts provides opportunities for career advancement.  It is extremely competitive.  The workload is not always balanced.  Expectations are not always clearly defined.
good,Went to work here to break in to the parts business after many years of commission only sale jobs and the instability that comes with it.  Overall the place was well organized and good.
good,"If you dont know much about vehicles or parts of a vehicle then this wouldnt be the job for you. I didnt know much about vehicles, i learned a lot while I worked there but it wasnt my ideal job."
good,Typical day started with the creation of our sales report and many Ad-Hoc report requests throughout the day.  Team was very knowledgeable and fun to work with.
good,Its ok place to work if your in school or part time job for extra income. They will work with you on your schedule. There isn't any advancement opportunities.
good,start up meeting and talk about the day and address any problems before the shift starts. the hardest part about  the job was the long hours and heat in the spring and summer.
good,Advance was an alright place to work and is a good job for someone that is not looking to move up for a very long time. The big guys of the company are not bad but the immediate bosses do not take care of their employees. its a good job for someone that is just looking to go to work every day and go home but for someone that is looking to make a difference and advance within the company they make it very difficult to do so.
good,They do not offer competitive wages and and hours. They expect you to go above and beyond for the company and give nothing in return. There is no work/ home life ballance as a manager. You are expected to be on call everyday.
good,Aside from the terrible hours (6:00am-6:00pm) and mandatory overtime on your days off they make you do (which is usually 10 hours a day). You get to work with some really good hardworking people.
good,Management needs work. The lack of communication is terrible and they claim an open door policy and that's a lie..I experienced breach of confidentiality and a hostile work environment
good,I worked at a store that almost received no business and was closed down shortly after I left. Because of the lack of customer foot traffic I wasn't scheduled many hours and I had no chance of making the sales goals so I would actually be able to make some decent money. Pay was low and they benefits were lacking.
good,"If you like cars and need a job fine, but if you expect to get paid for knowing about your stuff and being educated, forget it. Minimal pay, minimal hours, no advancement. They will hire outside company before moving somebody up."
good,"There are a lot of tasks to keep you busy during the day or night sometimes both. "
good,Don't become a store manage if you want a family life. I f your single it is good. Trying to hire and keep good help is a problem. Corporate is always on you about sales.
good,"The good: customer relations, work culture, skills gained, growth potential. "
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people. I always learned new things, the down side was the schedule. Never had evenings or weekends with my family. I also didn't like the fact that they use sales as a decision on weather or not you are a good employee. There are other things to be done to keep the store running properly."
good,manager was helpful but was focused on clicks within the store. company was fair as an employer. not a bad first experience in industry but not stellar either.
good,If the company would go back to customer relations instead of seeing the customer as a walking wallet it would be a far better place to work.
good,"In the relatively short time I've been with AAP it has proved to be an enjoyable place to work due to the people around me. They have given me an opportunity to advance, and it is an environment where I have the chance to learn more about the area of concentration I'm working."
good,"The company moves people around from store to store. Store managers come and go making it tough to know what their management style was. I worked at 3 stores a week for 3 months. The store hours are the hardest part of the job, 7 days a week store is open 78 hours/ week."
good,"Good company to work for. Room for growth and advancement. Parts knowledge a plus but not required. If you would like to learn about cars, enjoy helping others and having fun while you work then this is the job for you."
good,I enjoyed every minute I worked there fun place to work advancement opportunity learn about cars over all nice place to work made me feel like I could do just about anything a man could do
good,People who work they are great. Learned how to drive a reach truck and run the merge. Hardest part was meeting they rates. very fast pace warehouse keeps you moving
good,They move you around a lot. The company does a lot of outsourcing therefore jobs are not stable. They do try to prevent shrink and promote a clean store for the customer with a variety of product.
good,Advance Auto Parts should care more about their employees. Part time employees have no job security and no competitive pay. Advance also need to upgrade their security.
good,Advance is one of the leaders in its space.  They have the shell and size to be the dominant player in their space. I worked here during its largest growth phase and largest acquisition.  It has a good culture but has struggled to fully integrate its last purchase and make it profitable.
good,I worked for the company for little over a year.   Typical work day was the same as any show up help the customer and make sure they are happy and taken care of.   I learned a lot from our Commercial Parts Pro which is a good guy.  Store  Management is  a joke almost no knowledge of parts and mechanics and wasn't a leader or someone you would look up to at all.  The key holders I guess you would call management while store management was off are great people as that was my position before  I was released for a technicality in the employee hand book which I was never given or shown. (First and only time I had done anything that was frowned apon).  Pretty much everyone I worked with are good people and would give you the shirt off there backs.   The hardest part of the job was dealing with management screw ups and trying to fix them everyday.   The most enjoyable part of my job was being around people and helping other with there problems and them coming back and telling my how much they appreciate my time and help.  I was a top seller in my store with loyal customers and happy customers and I would do it all again if I was given the chance.
good,"Great part time job, working with the public is rewarding at times, But management can be demanding. Too much repetitive days, over and over the same thing, nothing ever new!"
good,Ive worked at advance for 4 years now and the company has changed a lot some good some bad. But ive learned alot throughout the years mostly from talking to the customers. Hardest part is you are expected to do everything.
good,Company culture was to ring them up and move them out helping customer secondary store manger had poor people skills was always talkingdown to employees in frt of customers and at times makeing coustomers embarassed not a good manager or trainer all abou his bonus
good,"A manager shift was 10 hrs a day where you needed to meet daily basic tasks and develop/coach a team to provide excellent customer service."
good,I was a young college kid working part-time it was ok for the time being but eventually I had to move on to a bigger and better situation.
good,"not hard work, but stay busy all day, must budget time well. Management stays focused and are a big help. Strong co workers makes job much easier. Hardest part of job is being on your feet 8 to 10 hours."
good,"I was mislead by the human resources manager that hired me. I was told I would receive company paid healthcare for my family which I later found out was completley false. It was not a very clean facility when I worked there and seemed very unorganized. In the short time that I was there, several managers including the human resource manager that hired me were fired. I hope this company has made some serious improvements."
good,"some managers team are great to work with fallow up companies cultures ,some rules are to be fallow and there not  many of the commercial parts pro do not fallow up company procedures ."
good,I started out as a Commercial Department delivery driver which was exactly what I wanted.  I occasionally worked the retail side which was great interacting with the public and having fun with my co workers  while getting the job done.  Things were great until unfortunately we lost our manager temporarily due to a medical issue.  Upper management brought in a manager from another store to cover.  He proceeded to cut our hours and give them to his own people. to the point that some of us had to leave for other employment to maintain a steady paycheck.  Its unfortunate that this happened because I truly enjoyed working for this company up until this point.
good,"This is a big corporate welfare company that cares nothing for their employees, only for the money they will make. I went back to school to better myself, and to create a better life for my family and myself, so I don't have to rely on the Advance Auto Parts of the world. My education is Key, and I will keep striving to do my best."
good,"Some customers are rude and obnoxious but I manage through them, others are fun and I'm glad I got to meet them. That's retail customer service for you anywhere. I love my job I just don't think it right that they can just come to us and tell us we will no longer have fulltime positions because the company had gotten high in over their heads buying out another company. Now expect us to pay the consequence for their actions."
good,"good place to work and learn more bout your car."
good,Long hours but usually work with a good team.  Things get hectic very quickly and it can be difficult to balance everything.
good,"Was able to learn more about cars while working with co-workers. For most part job was repetitive. If parts were stocked in right places, no trouble finding them for customers"
good,"I usually open the store, counting in each register, doing to morning paperwork from last night and filing it away. throughout the day, I help customers and in between I put up stock and count inventory. Before leaving I make sure anything that I had out is cleaned up and the next manager and I talk about what has happened throughout the day to keep one another on track."
good,"A typical day at work is about what you would expect in any retail setting. As a smaller store, interaction with customers is more personal and I have gotten to know many of our regular customers well. "
good,"I start off the day by pre-tripping the pick-up truck i drive. I kind of like driving the pick-up because its small. I get orders I generally pick my own orders, i'm out the door. I do about 3 orders at a time. Sometimes i have to other store locations to get parts, it can get crazy sometimes because orders are stacking up while i'm out making other deliveries. The people I work with are great."
good,"Overall it is a nice company to work for. The co-workers were great.  Would have loved to see the job stay in Roanoke."
good,Helping the consumers was the best part.. over all the staff worked hard and were relaxed.. the most difficult part was the in consistent work Schedule...
good,I used the parts database to help customers on a daily basis. I was also responsible for monitoring inventory logs and recording daily transactions at the end of the day. The most difficult part of the job was the lack of flexibility in scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers.
good,"I basically just deliver parts. Commercial customers call the store or make a online purchase. I pull the parts from the selves and deliver them to the customers in a safe and timely manner. On days that we get inventory I help the sales associates in the store to stock the items where they belong on the floor, in the hard parts area or in back stock."
good,"Typical day at work consist of stocking the selves, plannograms, Call backs, keeping the store clean, answering the phones while selling.  Store managers are great people to work with as are the co-workers,"
good,Although the job itself was very interesting the upper management was rather upsetting. Rarely would things get done on time while the GM or AGM would be working because of their refusal to do anything but sell parts in order to meet their sales quota. Often times I would come in on the weekend and have to finish tasks that should have been finished Wednesday.
good,I check the computer to see if there is a delivery if so I go get the paper work and their change if they are paying cash. I then get on the computer to log where i'm going and estimated time it will take me. I then go deliver the part or parts and while i'm there I see if there is any cores or returns if so I do the paper work and bring them back.I answer phones and help customers when there is no deliveries. Manager will change days and hours and not call to let you know. He is not a very good manager. I enjoy being able to get outside a lot durning the day. Manager also talks about you to other employees. I get along with all the employees at work.
good,I monitored daily workload to insure all was properly and timely picked an staged for the shipping department to be delivered to east coast stores.   Leaned new operating systems. My manger was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Some co-workers were lazy and did not do their part. Hardest part of the job was the travel one hour to and from.  Loved working with the agents in mentoring and training for them to succeed.
good,When Advance Auto hired Blackstone to assess their fiscal situation quality control and inventory management at the warehouse level became very problematic and there was no effort to regain control of the situation. As a result customer service faltered and the reputation my store had gained in my tenure there ceased. At this time I decided to fully commit to my bachelor's degree.
good,The place is acceptable but if you are looking for something that is going permanent this is not a good place. It's a good part time job but not fulltime.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a work place with a diverse population of both employees and clients. Daily job requirements vary and are continually challenging."
good,"Each store is different, with a different feel and atmosphere depending on who you work with. I can only speak about my experience, and Its a very laid back job, but fast paced. The only way to move up in the company (sadly) has nothing to do with how well of a worker you are, or even how hard you work. Increasing your sales numbers is the #1 way of advancement. Which is difficult to do if you are a delivery driver."
good,"A typical day at Advance Auto Parts consists of delivering merchandise to commercial customers, assisting customers that come into the store, and making sales over the phone as well. Since working for the company I have learned many things about the automotive industry,  the in's and out's of automobiles, and a better understanding of customer service. In the past two years I have worked for the company I have had three different General Managers. I learned many things from each and every one of them. Management as well as the team members have an excellent bond, we all communicate very well, it makes the work day go by very smoothly. This job, like every job, has its ups and downs but the hardest part would have to be the lack of hours I am getting. The company recently merged with a sister company and unfortunately my hours were cut due to the increase of employees. Regardless of the loss of hours, I enjoy many aspects of my job. One being the professional relationship I have created with my commercial customers. Over the past couple years I have gotten to know most of my customers very well, the relationships make it much easier to ensure they are pleased with the company and my service."
good,"long hours, management could be better about work scheduling,people that work are trusting, hard part is not having enough people to get all the work accomplished, most enjoyable part is the returning customers that come to see you"
good,Management is hit or miss. Pay is low. Full time can be as low as 20 hours some weeks.
good,A typical day is a productive were customers comes in request help and anwers for the problem they need to solve.
good,"females were expected to do the same jobs as males such as installing batteries, and the customers did not respect the females"
good,"Total  operations ,  Responsible for recruiting training staff as well as obtaining sales goals and profits"
good,"Each day presented new and more challenges, but not a lot of assistance from the upper half of management."
good,I would get there in the morning and load up the truck with orders from the day and night before. I would make a rout out in my head and dropped the parts off to each garages that needed them. After i dropped off the last order i would go back to the store and see if any new orders were placed and i would go out and do it again. If not I would wait on customers or stock shelves.
good,"While with this company I was able to learn the art of multitasking and patients. I learned a lot about myself, such as not dealing with different employees the same way. The main thing i learned as a manager was to turn a bad situation into a good one, such as making the environment for every one as fun and energetic, while trying to keep the company demands in check."
good,Did not enjoy working here. The employees were hard to get along with and there are not positive aspects of this job.
good,Enjoyed the customer interaction. It was like working with family.
good,Helping customers find the right parts for their vehicle repairs via database.  Speedy safe delivery of parts to commercial customers to ensure that their customers are happy.  I work with a great group of people at my store.  Hardest part of my job is trying to help customers that have customized applications because we are not ASE certified mechanics yet all customers assume that we are.
good,"A kind way of putting it is that there's much to be desired. Between secret in-fighting, blatant favoritism, hypocritical slogans and customer relations I'd say that the atmosphere there was more stressful than any I had ever seen. Only a pair of my coworkers were the team orientated, good customer relations building people that would make Advanced an otherwise remarkable place to work. The rest of the team were less about camaraderie and more about 'how can I slack but still make it look like I work'. As a driver, my dispatcher would tell me where to deliver the parts and only one of them was any fit to be so. His orders were accurate down to every detail, knew exactly what questions to ask and knew how to give reviews to crew members. My other dispatchers were either short-tempered, incompetent, or just lazy and in a fog. Other drivers were about 50/50 two were great team members and the other two were great at the job itself but didn't really care at all for rules or other crew."
good,I have learned many different things while working for Advance. You really have to be a team player because you do not get to leave until work is finished so you are moved to departments to help out. Overall a good place to work.
good,"I loved my job and the people I got to deal with on a daily basis, but there was a lack of strong management. The poor management not only made it hard to earn recognition, but it made it extremely hard to keep the commercial department running in proper order."
good,"pay not so great "
good,"At first I loved this job, and I did like the store level management. The corporate level management does leave some to be desired."
good,Advance Auto Parts was a good company to work for unfortunately the location I was at suffered from poor management and upper management skills. Monthly goals were almost impossible to meet which created more stress in the work place. My co-workers were great and we made the best with what we had.
good,"not a place to try to make a career in, low pay, management was unfair with some employees."
good,Clock in and start checking safety charts for store and vehicles.
good,"Answering the phones, customer service, responding to e mails, training and development of myself and other team members."
good,"This company allows you to be knowledgeable in vehicles and in customer services. They support you in learning more and provide opportunities to grow within the company if you have a valid degree. Although the company has some positive aspects, there are many negative aspects to come. Upper management do not have experience in the store level. The pay is very little for the amount of work required. They do not hire enough workers, therefore no store coverage. Not an enjoyable work environment."
good,"Generally, a day at Advance for me tends to normally go fairly quickly; if the commercial department is buzzing, I would be out on the road most of the day doing parts deliveries. In instances where I am confined to the store, the day tends to take a bit longer, even with a fairly steady stream of customers."
good,"It was a nice place to work, gave me more knowledge and other cars I didn't know about."
good,I learned about car systems and parts. This company is ran on politics. If you have a good GM it can be an excellent job to furhter your career in the automotive field. If not it could be the worst job you ever had. The most enjoyable part of this job was the feeling you get after you help customers solve their problems.
good,Advance was a great place to work but then they pressure there team members too much for sales when you cannot pressure people to buy buy buy if they don't need it. The goals they set are capable for some stores but not all and getting your job threatened everyday if you did not accomplish these goals was the down fall.
good,"A typical work day was assisting customers with parts and putting merchandise back into proper placement. While working there I've learned things about cars and got promoted to became a key holder, which acted as a manager and performed manager duties. Got along with all co-workers. The job was self explanatory and never was to hard to put up with the customers because I enjoyed them all even when the customers were upset with the company I always have them leave with a smile on their face."
good,"Though compensation is a bit above minimum wage all the ""free services""  employees are expected to provide is overwhelming. Especially when the company places the whole store on two employees after 5pm."
good,hrs are flexible pay is minimum need to be at least $15 per hr to keep employees they cut your hrs a lot and ask to much for $12.50 per hr part time job is a joke i wouldn't recommended this work place.
good,"A typical day there is talking to a lot of people and trying to help them,  orientation for the job needs help they just throw you in to work that's ok for a seasoned professional but not a newcomer."
good,"I worked for them for almost 10 years. I began as a part time driver, promoted to CPP in the 1st year, Assistant Manager by year 5, General Manager by year 7."
good,This is not the worst place to work but there are improvements that need to be made. Pay is low unless you are very specialized. At entry level McDonalds currently pays more. Long days working without adequate coverage. Have not been able to take a paid vacation without problems for the last two years. Employee discount is less than ordering online. Paycheck always comes through with no issues though. Standard full benifits package
good,Waiting on customers daily with very little time to do other duties that are important to the business. Love the customers. You have to stand on your feet hours at a time with a 30 minute lunch. Great crew I work with at the store.
good,"The company has increased starting wages, but has a low salary cap. Opportunities for advancement are very limited and not always awarded to the most qualified candidates. Use this job to gain warehouse experience and equipment training, then apply that experience and training to get a better paying job elsewhere."
good,"Ok job. Could be better. Management is to relax. I like my job, but my co worker is off the hook. Lies about me and my performance at work. And trying to get be fired"
good,"Company has stores understaffed to save hours "
good,"pay is not enough to bring in workers"
good,The work here is extremely labor intensive and co-workers are not helpful. Management quality is dependent on the individual and does not do a good job in enforcing standards when I worked there. Turn over rate is high because warehouse associates are sometimes temporary workers.
good,The pay is very inadequate and the work can be very stressful. Sometimes your hours are reduced if the store does not meet weekly goals. Moving up in the company can take a very long time.
good,"OK place to work, but hours have been cut to less than 40 currently. No Sunday hours and no late hours.  Knowledge is critical for the auto repair industry."
good,To me Advance Auto Parts does not look after the employee. Just numbers. It can be stressful as some expectations are not within possible reason. Not a “complaint” just experience and observation. Understaffed or over-staffed.
good,"Like all other corporate jobs, your work experience for Advance will, most likely, be only as good as your manager is, whether it be a store manager, district manager, etc. Also keep in mind GOOD managers, for the most part, move around or leave the company fairly quickly, so keep this in mind if you're considering a position with the company. I've been in auto parts for over 25 years and when a DM tells me that inventory management in my store isn't important itstime to move on."
good,corporate doesnt realize just how much effort goes into keeping a store up and running and they keep adding more to the list of requirements such as a new system to operate while the computers them selves are dated to 2003
good,Great place to start your career off. The Manager that I had was great. He taught me alot about the job. Looking up parts and how to handle difficult customers.
good,Already said in previous questions...Would definitely go back under a different DM.... REALLY like my customers...never bad complaints much within the store.
good,i enjoy cars and working with car parts so i enjoyed being there and didnt mind helping people that didnt know what was wrong with their car. i also enjoy doing inventory
good,"job was simple and easy especially for someone that was in high school, flexible hours and learned a good amount on automotive parts and recomendations"
good,it is a bit difficult to really evaluate as I arrived just as they had purchased Carquest.  This made things really confusing for  a while as they tried to determine how things would work.
good,Very stressful work environment at times. Other times its a great place to work. Pay could be better. Would be nice to be able to work overtime........
good,Good fit if you have automotive experience and kn owledge. Not really a good place if you want total structure. must have common sense and a general understanding of customer service.
good,"Advance does not give the opportunity to move anywhere. The job I had was simply, however given the time that I was in the hospital and out of work, I did not get the leway for occurrences."
good,"I enjoyed working at Advance Auto Parts. The pay wasn't good , $400 or less every two weeks dosent pay the bills and put food on the table, not to mention gas in the tank. My GM was very cool and was the hardest worker there. He was a great mentor to all of his employees. I learned alot from him. All my managers were easy to work with, except one. I always liked the feeling i got when I helped customers. Knew a bunch of them on a first name basis."
good,Great experience great company. I've worked here for 5 months and its was a great learning experience. I wish I couldake a little more here and that would definitely satisfy my need.
good,"Being a young male I continually had to do heavy tasks that the women couldn't do or do outside duties such as DTC code check, change wipers and batteries for other sale associates and got let go due to low sales."
good,"I will say that being the only black there as a driver had a Good ole boy attitude about it. I hate to say about double-standards however, it gave me the impression if you had a problem it's a matter of keeping the peace because we are in a no-win situation."
good,Fast paced. Sales oriented. Always wanted you to push a different product. Got reprimanded when sales were slow. Advancement opportunities didnt come up very often.
good,Working for Advanced Auto Parts was fun but quite uneventful. Taking care of customers automotive questions and helping them select the parts they need was the jist of the job.
good,"Whatever you do is never enough. Break a record? Great, now let's do it better!"
good,"come in early, stay late, need to take a two hour lunch because now  you have too much time. to many tasks and not enough time to do them due to skeleton crew."
good,"A typical day at work for me could be stressful on some days, and not on others depending on the day it was during the week.It was not very quick paced for me due to the area I lived in, and there would often come times when you had nothing to do. I learned a lot about the mechanics of a vehicle and how to problem shoot many things, and also how to work well with my team to get the right parts. The management was good at this job, and easy to get along with, and the culture was easy to fit in with. The hardest part of the job was when you had to unload the parts from the shipment truck, and place them in the correct spots throughout the store. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and seeing the satisfaction of getting the right stuff that they needed for their job"
good,Did not have enough help per shifts to complete all jobs. department needed more qualified personal and also needed more support from management. Management changed too often.
good,"was not a terrible job but the hours I worked were variable never knew when I would get off day by day, sometimes the managers were crabby.the workplace culture was had to deal with new people all the time, high turnover was common especially in the summer, very hot in the summer, the enjoyable part was lunch hour and special events"
good,"if interested in a store manager job that provides a work/home balance and no more, then this is a great place to work. advancement beyond that, I'd suggest finding a buddy to help you."
good,It is a decent place to work. If you work hard and dont miss any days the likelyhood to advance is pretty good. If you arent reliable and miss more than 1 or 2 days your chances of advancing are pretty much gone.
good,"The atmosphere is built around sales. Teamwork can aid in sales, along with the simple training that is done monthly. The environment is based around a structured customer first environment."
good,Low pay at all  job positions. Pay is gauged at store sales. Alot of work lot hours to work to get job done. Poor management from higher up management.
good,"Too many KPIs. Company's focus is on introducing new technology"
good,"Not the best place to work but it's nice if your co workers are reasonable people, and you learn tons about cars and how to fix them. Also you get to network with many mechanics in your local area so that never hurts."
good,It's really going to differ from location to location and job to job.  What might be good where one person is could be totally different at another.  Just go in with an open mind and be willing to work and make your place better.
good,Its an ok place to work. they don't care about your advance in the company. and they don't pay you what you deserve. its definitely not a job you can live off of.
good,"They over work their employees while significantly underpaying them. Then when told you deserve a raise, you never receive thus raise. Not professional."
good,"Definitely more of a boys club type job at most stores but if you stay long enough you become part of the club. Can become a work family. "
good,Other than the pay rate I enjoy working for Advance. Manager and other staff treat me very well. Have learned alot from RPP and CPP. Have a very supportive staff.
good,"Answer phone, customer service,"
good,Can not move any further within the company because of favoritism.  General Manager and Operations managers  never come to the floor and never engage with the team.
good,Managment is an issue but what job doesn't have these issues. Company needs to re train there management or change the way they train them. Also the way they use there upper management is not good they are way too limited in what they can do
good,"Typical Day: Can be crazy busy or a day to catch up. "
good,"Typical day with Advance Auto involves long hours with little compensation.  The job itself is fun, if you like solving problems for others.  Personal satisfaction is very high in these areas as you are looked upon as an expert in the field of automotive repair. However, many stores are undermanned and cannot meet the organizational commitment to its commercial customers.  Most of the internal teammates are very pleasant to work with and try exceedingly hard to please the retail and commercial customers.  There is a large turnover in middle management. Created mostly from hiring retail managers with no experience in the automotive industry.  Key performance measures are consistent, but accountability is not."
good,"They tout a good program, but do not follow through with non-corp employees. People are expendable here. They have a great culture, if it were followed. But unfortunately most things are ignored unless it's made public."
good,This compnay has given me the opportunity to provide for my family and has promoted me from within.  Large company and opportunity for advancement and diversification.
good,"Store level management varies place to place, but upper management has inconvenient priorities overall. They seek to give the appearance of a functional store using the least resources possible. Painfully limited hours and the lack of proper staff are strained to the point of customers calling corporate out of frustration. Outdated software and equipment/supply shortages are common problems. Job security is very solid from what I've seen, due to the high turnover rate of employees leaving. If you are there to take responsibility, be prepared to be given a list you will never finish without working off the clock."
good,when i was scheduled to open the store i would count the safe make sure the number add up from the closing shift night before.Count the drawers file paperwork then open the store for the day.i learned it is hard to run a company if you don't have the right team put together.
good,If you're willing to learn and do research there is plenty of mechanical knowledge in the workplace to be found. This job will allow to find out how and why mechanical parts operate.
good,"deliver auto parts to commercial customers"
good,If you want to stay where you are at when you apply for the company then this is great. but when you work hard and get told that you will move up to a different position and you wait over half a year and nothing happens and you keep getting nowhere it is very aggravating. Love the people I work with just the company itself is ego damaging. If you can upsale and get people to buy more then you are golden but when you can't you need to work on it and if you can't then you are made an example of.
good,Advance Auto should value the good workers they have and  allow them to use there skills. Notice the hard work the employees have to do in retail during all hours.
good,Having many responsibilities as a Parts Manager I really enjoyed doing cycle counts ordering more merchandise as customers brought some items more than others
good,"a challenging, labor intensive job. advanced quickly, but wasn't appreciated for the work done. wasn't given the opportunity to advance to GM, although i had ran the store with the absence of a General Manager for months."
good,A typical work day  it’s a good job but the management is not is good as I thought is would be but over all I like the job cause I learned a lot about Vehicle
good,"some of the managers doesn't know anything about cars, but still in management. Also some dont know how to lead. give order but don't now how to take orders"
good,good employees just bad management. lots of customers most of the time we had all the parts in stock just was always a problem when the parts were lost somewhere in the store.
good,"Was not a bad place, store manger was not good but company is good, Can be real hectic and stressful, but still not a bad place. Enjoyed most of the customers."
good,Job was ok store supervisor really didnt know what he was doing and leaned to hard on assistant managers to make him look good but everything else was ok
good,"it not a very bad place to work at, but co-worker and mangers are sometime rude and ignore the help when in need or in trouble and it an okay job not too bad but the workers need to respect other and work together as a teams."
good,Great to work for if your coming out of high school . people are friendly work culture is great. You learn alot. The hardest part was dealing with customers
good,Go to work and delivery parts. Stock shelves with stock. receive stock. Always keep busy. Clean store if not already busy doing assigned duties such as delivering parts.
good,So far the training is good and they give you a fair pay and theres always someone to help out when you need help or have trouble doing something and management is good
good,Tough to balance life. Many closing and opening shifts. DM calls conference calls at the last minute. Have to work holidays. The only two days closed ate Christmas and Thanksgiving.
good,At first the job was great and appreciated. Later it began to be just a job until i had to move and was promoted in the store in my new town to retail parts pro.
good,Allowed commercial operations to mishandle cash steal from commercial accounts. I reported my evidence to HR with nothing to come of the proof presented.
good,"I enjoyed everyone I worked with and for.  I enjoyed going to work everyday and checking in all of the special orders for our customers that were delivered overnight. The manager that hired me was friendly and fair.  He would praise you if you did a good job. But he would talk with you if your work performance was not as expected.  Once a quarter, we had an employee appreciation lunch.  "
good,"Job environment lacked accountability between morning shift employees and evening employees. Task were not shared among workers,  No accountability of what you did or didn't do throughout the day"
good,"First real job started out as a retail cashier, then after a year I got to be a mobile parts pro where I delivered parts to garages all around. I liked that position a lot. Sometimes I miss it but not enough pay which is why I left."
good,"Working at advance has been a great opportunity for me, it advance my parts knowledge and people skills, I have build a great bond with co-workers, over the 6years I have worked I have had 3 store managers with different management skills"
good,I genuinely enjoyed dealing with customers face to face and solving problems together with their parts related needs.  To me it was fun to interact with most customers and learn what I could do to help them.
good,"It was all good & brought in at a nice salary, but never received the training & was thrown ""into the wolves"" in way to many situations.  The General Manager went on vacation 2 weeks after I was hired so I was only trained in certain things so I could open the store.  But then training was never continued after he was back."
good,I did deliveries. Some days were busier than others. No chances for advancement as a driver. I learned a lot about cars and how to fix them. Met a variance of people.
good,there are a few weeds that need to not be working it makes working there hard when the weeds are there. you dont get lunch all the time becuse the weeds are no where to be found so you cn leave.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts has helped me to learn more about automobiles and the car industry.  The people there are willing to help you, and are friendly.  The management at Advance is good, but could be better.  The workplace culture is just ok.  The hardest parts of the job include; memorizing where everything is, installing batteries and wiper blades in extreme weather and communicating with rude customers.  The most enjoyable parts of the job is that the co-workers are nice people, and it is great on a resume."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a good company. Unfortunately, moving up is difficult and pay is not great. Customers are difficult to deal with sometimes. I would recommend this job to college students who need a good part-time gig to hold them over while in school but if you're trying to pursue a career with the company good luck. Advancement and promotions are scarce to come by unless someone quits. Pay is not great but that depends on experience and knowledge. Overall Advance is a good company but retail is always stressful wherever you go."
good,"good company to work for if your working full time, pay is not that good its a steady relaxed day at advance auto parts  some managers are cool but some are not"
good,"The manager and the culture they bring really makes or breaks a location. We had great relationship with everyone in the store and everyone wanted to serve our customers. "
good,The job had its ups and downs. There was a general inconsistency across the company in terms of staffing. The stores were usually understaffed which is a benefit if you wanted a lot of hours. It is also an okay place to work if you just want a few hours a week. A decent place to work if you want a career in retail sales.
good,"While the company is very good to work for, of course there are some things that could be better. The main thing that the company needs to work on, is management. There is a bad habit of putting managers in a fast pace store that can't keep up."
good,"very stressful job for store mananger, require long hours and  sales projections are set very high not possible to to  be met, medical benefits  are very expensive"
good,"A typical day at work is normally random. Different people come in asking for parts but dont know what they are called so they try to mimic the sounds there cars make. alot of stocking, cleaning, and store facing."
good,"I worked here for over a year. This job was very fast paced but without the manpower to handle it most of the time. Our particular manager did everything he could to help that, and he was a great manager, but the company itself wasn't that great. They only gave me a $0.10 raise after a year, and promised a promotion to manager which I never received."
good,"Long Hours no Sundays off, Hard to keep people working there more or less young folks in college or just don't want to work but usually you find a diamond in the rough"
good,"Should work here while in college to get valuable experience.  Pay way too low to pay for life's expenses.  Problem solving fun, but you aren't designing anything that is your own."
good,"Relocated for this position. This is a good company to work for, however, there have been a number of org changes and financial pressure, due to recent mergers."
good,Great values and principles and it's an employee friendly company.  Good pay for management and opportunity for advancement is excellent.  Good benefits and discounts once full time is attained.
good,"the job is a job, here you can come in to work and just do that work, management is very poor as they only care about themselves, raises are base on the company making money so no matter how hard you work."
good,They are a good company but benefits aren't good there at all. Unless you are management or full time. But even full time workers have many issues with he company.
good,A typical day began with helping customers with the appropriate items that they needed. I helped organize new shipments that came in weekly and operated computer/register when needed.
good,great place to work as long as your not looking to work hard or advance. very laid back and easy going. management were awesome as long as you do your job.
good,"A typical day as a field sales management consisted of seeing at least 10 accounts daily/50 per week. Each of the events had to be accounted for & summarized using Salesforce.com CRM."
good,Being a driver is my favorite part of the job. Retail is a rewarding job with being able to help customers with the issues they are having and trying to fix them. The employees are great people and make working for Advance very fun.
good,everyday I went to work was a new day where I learned new things about vehicles and the people I worked with as well as new things about the customers that came in.
good,"Advance is a great company to work for if you're a car enthusiast like me. Your constantly around vehicles, you can help people solve their issues, and finally have a satisfying feel knowing you helped."
good,"ok to work for, could not have a set work week, too much required work for pay. Too many people playing chief and not enough team work together. Just was not a fun place to work"
good,"- I would check in parts that came in overnight, pull back stock, answer phone calls, help customers that are in the store, look up parts on the computer and figure out the best way to get them the fastest. "
good,Its a good company with alot of tools and learning capabilities its just too slow paced for me with not enough physical demands I felt like i wasnt going anywhere as fast as i wanted to it was too lax..
good,"Lots of busy work, but the knowledge is invaluable. Learn to recognize problems in automobiles. Coworkers are generally easy to get along with, and knowledgeable."
good,"Sometimes because, automotive industry is a male dominated career, customers and even management would assume a woman wouldn't know about the parts she was selling and installing. So as a woman I pushed harder to prove myself in my career path. I succeed with my goals I set for myself within the company."
good,"Too much complaining/talking about other employees behind closed doors. Lack of training. There were not any SOPs. Over 40, you may not have a job there one day!"
good,I am currently a manager for Midrange Systems. A typical day at work is managing resources and providing direction to my 9 team member. The workplace culture is changing to meet company goals inline with better processes. The hardest part of the job is prioritizing projects and meeting strict financial limitations. The most enjoyable part of the job is managing an outstanding team of Engineers.
good,"The work can be engaging but some decisions by management are short sighted, though this has greatly turned around due to better leadership from a new CEO.  The pay and benefits are not competitive compared to the region and against some very successful companies in the area.  Beyond that, the people are nice and everyone (mostly) gets along.  Little events and ongoing food truck appearances throughout the year bring teammates together and liven things up a bit."
good,"I enjoyed working with most staff. My responsibilities included taking phone calls, working front counter and delivering parts to customers.The hardest part of my job was dealing with corporate. Trying to make the required sales."
good,Coming in to this job it's more beneficial if you knew more about the products you are selling. You are always on your feet.
good,A typical day at work is going in and being kind to people and helping them with whatever needs they may have about their vehicle. I learned a lot about vehicle parts and components. I get along with all my team mates. My manager is very professional. The most enjoyable part is getting to help people. The hardest part of my job is being kind and helping the people that are not in a good mood
good,Good environment to work in. Low pay for time at company. Enjoy going to other shops and the experience of dealing with customers.
good,working for Advance autoparts was a good experience. they were war and welcoming. nice people to work with for the most part. good structure and not bad pay.
good,"Great pay, hours suck. midnight hours for drivers. Long hours so you'll make overtime. Travelling sucks because you will do 400-500 miles in a night. Most bosses are good."
good,they provide you with the necessary tools to learn more in depth so that you can problem solve with the customer as well and make sure you can get them the entire project they need to fix their car.
good,"On a typical day the store will about 50 customers per day.  I learn something new every single day about automotive.  The manager an assist managers are very helpul and easy to work with, also co-worker are great employers."
good,Ok place to work pay is ok but not great. They don't give out to many hours for part time Jobs. They mainly give the hours to management. You don't ever get to set down you are constantly on your feet even if you have no customers.
good,good place to work .Feast or famine workplace. Either terribly busy to the point that you could not keep up or so slow you were bored to death. Over all good .
good,I worked their for over a year and was showing better numbers then some of the store managers and still didnt see a rise nor a promotion. not to mention i feel like they decriminated against my age
good,The best part of my job was getting the customer in the vehicle they wanted and a payment they were comfortable paying.  I really enjoyed being able to drive new vehicles on a daily basis.
good,Anything you have available for me to go The Surreal Life good place to work for everybody to easy-going anything go ahead need to be done I can do it I want to also do something like that or the manager anything good what is available for me to do
good,Fun work place. Bosses were fun to work with but tended to push all of their work off on you. People came in with broken cars so it was difficult to deal with the public and their anger for having to spend money.
good,"set up clean up , check orders to deliver too, deliver items to customer if no deliveries help with customer service inside company store ."
good,"Over all it's an ok place to work depending on who you have for co-workers and store manager but, that is everywhere you work not just Advance Auto Parts."
good,very hard work machine opt so the machines are old but workable I guess haven't been there in a while but the management is bad and very place to work at I guess
good,I enjoyed the job every bit but the general manager was a mess and rarely came in even though he was scheduled 50 hours a week.
good,"Working here was a great pleasure, and I was able to work in a field I am very passionate about. Learning something new every day at work was very appealing to me, and I was also able to build my customer service skills."
good,"the company is pretty good to work for but its a young mans game if you have a family then its not the best lace to work, you are very involved."
good,"Busy environment"
good,Very stress related job.  Hard to find the time to do the work required to meet goals because of the extreme amount of reporting required - all about the numbers and reporting.
good,This is a just a typical place of employment where you go in and do what is required to get the job done.  I drive a ford ranger delivery truck to deliver auto parts to customers on a daily bases.  Some co-workers are great and others are not. No hard part of the job at all. Enjoyable part of the job is getting away from the store driving the company vehicle.
good,"Advance auto  is a great place to work if you love people and selling."
good,Provide the best customer relationship that you can. I learned that communication with your customer is the key to find the perfect product for them. Everyone there was very friendly and upbeat. The hardest part about the job was putting away stock. The best part was actually building the customer relationship.
good,Starts at 7 AM and ends at 6 PM. Helping customers repair their cars. Management can be very supportive at times but sometimes forget how to be. Most team members are nice and helping. The hardest part is not getting a raise in 5 years and dealing with irate customers.
good,"major upper management issues. Magment has lost touch with the retail world completely, causing major issues in communication with day to day operations"
good,Very busy. Customer orientated. Fun helping customers fix their problems. Perform routine inventory. The hardest part is when it gets so busy it is overwhelming and customers get very annoyed.
good,"Scheduling, helping customers get the right parts for their cars and equipment. "
good,"The employee turn over was increasingly high for any company.  There was an employee being fired for performance issues.  Often times able to be corrected by adjusting time to fill an order.  This was even true for managers/supervisors.  In 18 months I went through three General Managers, two managers, and three supervisors."
good,"A typical day at work mainly consisted on selling parts, accessories, installing batteries and wipers. However another typical day at work included having to listen to my GM scream all day to us and customers. Complaints were made by the employees and the customers as well to the hierarchy of management in the company, but it seemed to be to no avail every time. All other co-workers were great, we got along just fine when the GM was not present. We would even sell more when she wasn't there. The hardest part of the job would most probably be the way people come up with their own names for parts. Especially when you live in the border to Mexico and mechanics have all sorts of inappropriate names for the parts and EXPECT you to know them, An example would be, ""cacahuates"" (Peanuts in English) for the sway bar link kits! The most enjoyable part of the job however was building that customer rapport and getting bonuses for those positions that qualified for it."
good,"Typical day at work for a commercial manager is making sales calls to commercial accounts and managing drivers delivery routes. If and when problems arise, there is little to no help from upper management. When new employees are hired there is no training and they are thrown into difficult situations with no experience on how to handle them. It is common for stores to be understaffed for the company to make extra profit and managers have no way to get around understaffing because of computer controlled scheduling and negative repercussions from corporate management. Bad employees that do not follow their orders, cause issues with customers and employees, or simply do not do their jobs do not get terminated or reprimanded, but simply moved from store to store with no consequence. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with the customers and helping them solve their problems. There is also very little room for advancement in the company. They prefer to hire outside help with no experience for management jobs."
good,"The people you work with are great people, the pay is rather disappointing for everything you do, and it isn't based around knowledge or skill."
good,•	Suggesting and installing replacement automobile parts for DIY customers.
good,I learned most of my automotive knowledge from advance through there online training system and on hand through working with the customers.
good,learn to operate equipment such as pallet jack and forklift. May see some unfairness in each department.
good,"My favorite part of my job would be my customers. They are funny, frustrating, and always teaching me new things. Which means they are also the hardest part of the job. My co-workers are an eclectic mix of young and old. We take care of each other as much as possible."
good,"Good place for work as a college student. Learned how to do inventory and handle cash, credit transactions."
good,"Typical day is posting payments, maintaining customer accounts,coding mailed checks with account numbers and process remote deposit.  "
good,filling orders to go from the warehouse to the stores. picking product quickly and efficiently was a great workout while on the job
good,"Customer Service, Assisting customers for parts needs. Commercial Deliveries. Stocking, etc. "
good,i have no comment about advance auto parts at this time. it is in my best interest to not give any information about my work experience at the company.
good,"Assisting both retail and commercial customers in the auto parts business. I've learned a great deal about cars and the retail industry in the process. I enjoy interacting with customers and fellow employees. The management is good overall, they are typically overworked just as in every retail business. The hardest part of the job is that it is retail.  Customers can be very appreciative at times, and very unappreciative as well."
good,"Stores were great, but communication with corporate was very hard to get. Often left you hanging when you needed them."
good,"A typical day of work is fun, yet professional.  We try to develop a customer-employee relationship so we can better help them with getting them the right part they need, when they need it.  "
good,Busy work environment always on the go.  Answer several phones at once and process several orders at once.  Can be stressful at times but overall good company
good,"Not a bad company to work for but I think they expect a lot for the money they pay, and they do micro-manage store manager's.."
good,"long days,fun people to work with"
good,"Typical day included managing others, handling problems with customers, ordering product, doing inventory and receiving. I was promoted to assistant manager after short time working there. My co-workers were fun and worked hard."
good,I worked a lot of hours  and even thru holidays . I spent most of my time Doing inventory adjustments. I help with costumer complaints and help assign jobs for the employs. Ran the store up to codes and educated my self thru constant training. The team we had was professional except for a store manager that was fired for stealing.
good,"At Advance Auto Parts I primarily managed the Quality, Provisioning, Staff Management, Training and Documentation for the commerce division, encompassing five contact centers globally.This work included daily metrics reporting and coaching for all associated centers."
good,i was all ways working covering for people that didnt show up for work
good,There is some personal satisfaction when you are able to help a customer resolve their issues efficiently.;
good,"The typical day at work was fun.I have so much about the fast food business .The management was good,the co-workers that has work with me the time I was there was respectable. The hardest part of being there was not smile because it was fun working there.Also the most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the customers"
good,"This is the best job I have ever had, but the pay is less than most fast food line cooks, and the benefits that do exist are so expensive almost everyone chooses to not participate in the benefits programs."
good,"The pay for working in the distribution center is extremely low for a company so big and the amount of work they expect you to do in a day is ridiculous. The environment is go go go with short breaks, short lunch, and goals that are enforced by corporate. If you want to make the same amount of money, do less work, and not have to kill yourselves to make your performance based goals, work for mcdonalds. This job would be ideal for high school students that could work either a night shift or 6am - whenever shift mwf. You could make a living doing this job if you had another job and just use the money from Advance for gas because that is what your weekly paycheck will cover. They used to have pay for performance which was a very nice benefit but they did away with that a long time ago. So no bonuses, very little overtime if any =(, no pay for performance, and very little room for actual advancement. You start at 9 and make 11 in two years. After that the pay tops out at 14 but it could take up to ten years to make that."
good,There is a lot of turn-over at Advance Auto partly because of the low pay scale. The hardest part of the job is working at different times and on different days every week.
good,the company was ok to work for but could use work the workers could use alot more parts knowledge and people skills
good,I ran the day to day function of over 20 employees. I learned that in the Automotive world there are several different names for one part. I was the General Manager and I tried to make it fun for my employees to come to work. The hardest part of my job was making a schedule for 24 employees and not having enough hours to accomediate all the employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers.
good,"Inventory management, dealing with customers and helping them trouble shoot their problems. I managed a good group a employees thus making my job easier."
good,Good company. The pay is fair..Management was too easy going.
good,"Helping people complete there projects, and showing them things that can help prevent the problem, What I learned by working with advance auto parts is patience, and team work. The hardest part of the job was the customers stairring you down when the customer your currently with is dragging and taking his or her time, and the line just keeps getting longer and longer. The best part is when you see the customer that you helped the next time in the store, they thank you for leading them to what the needed to fix or complete their project."
good,I enjoyed the customer service. I am a people person and like meeting new people.
good,the people I worked with were great but I feel it was not a job that provided chances for advancement
good,Depending on your location of hire more work than other locations. Pride upon customer service. Put you through thorough training of parts and supplies. The pay doesn’t fit the work that is required. Every employee for themselves attitude at times. Will promote inexperienced people for higher positions
good,Its ok to work here but it can get crazy sometimes. It takes forever to advance in the company. I dont really have to much more to say. Its a great for part time
good,Just need more structure in job performance and leaderships. A little more of opportunity for job advancements with a clear outlook into the main vision of the company.
good,Does not back employees I have a boys backs has big turnover rate on employees customers get mad at you for not having a part that they want but weren't on time that are transferred from other stores
good,Alot of work for alot of non pay always busy and always had to find something else to do for money to sustain myself need some knowledge of cars to make it
good,"The company was always great to work full in the early years, but too many upper management that would change what was required or was too impossible to reach."
good,I noticed it was a ok job didn’t seem like much in the way of moving up positions really but all in all wasn’t to bad but I will say pay wasn’t the best but still wasn’t bad as long as you do what you needed to do
good,Its a good place to work it's a laid back atmosphere most of the people enjoy coming to work there. Only downfall is they only have one shift so if you want evenings or nights it's not for you
good,"There were a lot of bosses and leaders but many did not even interact with you unless you were in a important role. I did enjoy the driving, getting out of the store and freedom. They did give you a encouraging environment and were pretty flexible. It was a fun place to work for overall."
good,Good place of employment.  Hours are flexible and can adjust to most schedules.  A lot of customer interaction and has a level of advancement to make a long term career.
good,"An alright place to work, with a good group of people who are always sure to offer help when needed. Training was simple, and easy. A great place to work if you’d like to know a little more about cars."
good,Great place to work as a first job or giving you something to do. Not great for a single mother with small children unless you have lots of help. If children are older it's easier with schedules.
good,"The management was great and the store ran very smoothly. It would be great for a high school students first job, but the pay isn't ideal and I didn't see how you could grow past the store manager."
good,"Not a bad place to work, nice co workers and easy for the most part just dealing with people isnt the funnest. I would recommend someone to this job if they asked"
good,"A typical workday revolves around providing correct parts for customers, sometimes it can be a bit stressful because you are always on your feet. Enjoyable because of flexible work hours around my school schedule."
good,Working for advance auto parts was very easy. Delivering parts to commercial shops. The hard part was lifting some of the bigger parts. But it was a great job.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is an excellent place to work.The most enjoyable part about the job is my relationship with the customers. I became very knowledgeable about cars, different parts and what they are for."
good,I took the job so that I would be able to balance life while also attending a school and still be able to support my family. The management is a bit disorganized and sometimes unprofessional.
good,La empresa te motiva a creer en ti y a ayudar a los clientes a encontrar la solución a sus problemas con sus vehiculos.
good,Though hiring manager demonstrated a good head over his shoulders sometimes was hard to determine his priorities.  Training was lacking and brief.  Some stock will be missing with no explanation as to why.
good,"work was always slow and the schedule was always messed up and people were always in a bad and stressful mood, there were times i had to close the store late at night then be back first thing in the morning to open."
good,The company constantly changed its rules and operation. When they were bought out and changed from car quest and went to Advance everything went downhill.
good,Typical day usually consisted of answering phone calls and looking up the correct parts for the local automotive shops. Once the sale was completed then you need to pull the parts and deliver them to the customer
good,"My previous experience here had me working at several different locations.  I met a lot of good people at heart, but some were clearly miles better at managing than others.  Hours are drastically downsized compared to when I had originally started, so that made things significantly more difficult towards the end of my time when I was in more of a managerial position."
good,"Was a good and reliable job. Things were changing and we had things happening that shouldn't have been allowed.  I had 15 good yrs and I did the best I could every day. My customers were always treated with the best I could possibly do."
good,"Good place to work at, it was fun and chill and my coworkers were great, but it didn't pay great and there wasn't a lot of advancement opportunity. There was too much turn over in in employment, we had trouble hanging on to employees."
good,Its a good company and I enjoy meeting new people and being around car parts and getting to answer questions and helping customers with there auto questions and problems
good,"Advance Auto Parts is definitely an unforgettable experience. It has taught me a lot. How  to differ good and bad choices. I have seen it all I believe. Sometimes things change for the best, but sometimes attitude never changes. Character is important. Too much is too much! How they will do things need some flexibility."
good,"I was a driver and counter person. I felt that pay was very poor.."
good,I would look up the year make and model of the customers car and then i would see what part they need and see if we have it in stock.I would also have to install wiper blades or battery if the customer purchased those items.
good,a good place to get experience. It is the type of place that you must have a plan for everyone and your self. otherwise you will be all over and nothing will get done.
good,I took the job as a driver delivering parts to local vendors thinking I would be out on the road and no stuck inside the store.  It turned out that I was helpful in the store so I ended up not driving as much so I could be in the store.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with!
good,"This was a great starter job. I learned how to be more customer oriented, and the basic ins and outs of working in the retail industry. I became familiar with many of the customers and enjoyed working with them."
good,"good to work for. People are nice. Corporate listens to employees. Good time off, respects the requests of employees. Discounts are excellent also. Nice company"
good,learned ordering  and returning item . Customer service . Stocking shelves unloading trucks. Inventory and price changes. Dealing with customers complaints.
good,"good for part time starting position in auto parts field ,"
good,In advance auto parts we build a strong connection with our customers so they know that they can always come back and get the job the need done right once.
good,"I have no complaints about working for Advance Auto Parts. The work was steady paced, and very laid back. Customer interaction was easily facilitated by well working point-of-sale software."
good,I was able to learn about car parts and services while being with the company. The team members there were easy to get along with and made the job easier to do.
good,I was the assistant manager to a outside hire. I opened and closed the store daily and did all my paperwork. The job was not hard and I loved all my customers. My favorite part was the planograms.
good,"Working this position provided me with an unique opportunity with an ""out of the office"" feel to meet people in the community and build work relationships that can last a lifetime."
good,"Hardworking dependable Coworkers, nice work atmosphere. Flexible hours. The only problem was the pay rate being low and the company benefits wasn’t  beneficial."
good,"These reviews are pointless.  Everyone's experience is different.  Every job has ups and downs,  ones persons pro could be another's con. I had good and bad times there."
good,Adavace auto parts is a great place to work. You get paid great and you work with great people. It's a great environment. There quite a bit of training to do but it's easy.
good,"A typical day consisted of 8 hours shifts, sometimes you were on call, the staff was knowledge of the store functions and policy's. there wasn't nothing that was hard about the to me, i enjoyed every day working there."
good,CEO has a winning plan of action that is being executed.  Confidence in plan to win is increasing as are the results.  Bring a passion to win and execute to work each day and you will be successful here.
good,The manger was really nice and it had a pleasant work environment would go back if asked under a different manger. Store was clean and the crew were very helpful to work with.
good,"They’re paid rate promises never reach the meets of the team members, being working for them for 6 years now and in that time I only have received a $1.35 increase on my pay. Benefits are getting hard to meet and pay and in order to get a pay raise the team member has to take a different job position in the store. They’re start payrate is $10 if the DM approves it there’s 2-3 team members on each store every day, that makes stressful for employees and customers to be helped inside the store."
good,Advance pay is to low for all that you do. Only managers get bonus but they talk alot about team work. Advance has too many people running cash registers in my opinion. Advance pressures its employees to sell but that's hard to do when people make it clear they are not interested.
good,It was a good learning experience for management positions. It expanded my knowledge and was overall a good experience. I just felt it was time to move on from this location.
good,I started working for advance auto parts in Tampa Florida and transferred to the Oswego ny store and it definitely isn’t the same. I’m very disappointed in my job..
good,Easy job and definitely great supervisors! When you need help or have question they are always around to ensure things are good and support you! I would recommend this job for anyone looking for a stress free environment
good,It's a good place to work if you know what your doing and have a thick skin and dont take things to heart an can read people so you know what they are trying to say
good,I think the business is too big to notice the little guy. Questions about how to drive sales and gain more customers based on the guidelines are left unanswered. I have a degree that should land me in the marketing department but can't talk to anyone to know how to get there or increase in store awareness for sales
good,Your constantly tested. Even when doing your best you feel like you fail. You asked to go above and beyond. You have no life outside of the company. If that's for you apply
good,My work experience with this company pretty much varies working for both.my location has a pretty cool atmosphere and cool coworkers.nice benefits and company time off.
good,"It was a nice place to work, but the down sizing after acquiring Carquest left AGM without jobs and the ones who were saved took huge pay cuts. I guess that business."
good,"Very poor manager. Unqualified with no leadership or managerial skills. Company has a very high turnover rate for general store managers. The work is rewarding and the customers are most often easy to help. Benefits and pay is very poor with little to no improvement over time. Lack of supervision allowed me to flexibly complete any and all work that needed to be completed.  No encouragement from manager, but personally rewarding."
good,"Very normal experience for a lower position job. Dealing with customers was problematic or annoying at times, but nothing that would turn the average amateur car guy away"
good,Advance on the whole is not a bad company to work for. Upper management is where the issues began. Store level management was great. Raises are rare so be aware of that going in.
good,"I've worked for 2 parts houses and no matter what they say about oh, we're different, we're like a family...it comes down to what team you're paired with and what kind of manager you have. That is what will make the difference. Bad management runs all and a good manager will make all the difference in the world. I had a decent one but they were a little selfish when it came to my future because it meant promoting one of their strongest managers out of their district and therefore losing a profit making monster so after 2 attempts to get what I wanted were blocked by them I decided it was time to leave."
good,I think Management can be more professional then so disrespectful and foul mouthed.. Then i think they should pay more with Health insurance and all coming out of your check. It’s not a hard place to work it’s just who you work with and how the work gets done cause everyone doesn’t care and don’t work the same
good,"Overall a good place to work with lots of incentives, unfortunately the targets were not always attainable.  Management was tough but I learned a lot from his leadership."
good,The time I spent here just flew by. Everyday there was something to work on and we stayed busy on the sales floor. Meeting sales goals was always top priority.
good,"Worked in shipping dept & selection dept..During training/temp service was getting $11.65/hr. Then after a 90 day raise and getting hired onto the company ended up getting 14.65 had another raise right after I left at I think 15.25. (Was there for 11mos)"
good,"This job was fun, but the pay was not enough. Even if you got promoted in the company it still wasn't enough to match the cost of living. You will meet a lot of different people and be able to network."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with the customers and getting to help them with their problems. A typical day at work is that you clock in and get with your Manager to find out what assignment you need to complete.  Learned a lot there and advancement is possible if willing to work for it.  Everyone is pretty cool there, but some drama from time to time."
good,"Nice part time job, the people i work with are fun and friendly.  The discount on parts is nice.  Gives you good experience working with a variety  of customers to save them money on car repairs."
good,"Advance was once a great place to work, however with the recent influx of online ordering the stores have taken a big hit. It was nearly impossible to give enough hours to employees. Senior Management was only worried about making their year of the end bonus, even if it was at the cost of the lower hourly paid employees."
good,"I had a good relationship with all fellow workers and management, it was a pleasant experience for the term of my employment. I made several friends there that I'll keep in contact with."
good,"I have mixed feelings on Advance Auto, as a Parts Pro/Driver it was a good job to get your feet wet in the automotive world. Unfortunately, the majority of folks you deal with are coming in upset already (due to car troubles) and you will more times than not have it taken out on you, the associate."
good,This position was very insightful as the business to business aspect of the job managing the commercial sales was challenging and rewarding.  Balancing the business to business and business to consumer aspects were many times a challenge due to staffing guidelines.
good,The work place is very casual and peaceful. i meet alot of people through out the day of me working in there. i like looking at cars and delivering parts to other retail stores and associating myself around good people.
good,Overall I would say it is a nice place to work. Very relaxed environment as long as the work that was needed to be done was completed in a timely manner.
good,This is a good spot to start if you want to learn about cars and get into the automotive industry. Great system to learn the basic and take your career from there.
good,"My job consisted of delivering car parts to various mom and pop shops throughout Orlando, FL. Along, with delivering to corporate stores. "
good,"a typical day at work lately has been slow almost little to no business daily, the employees are all great and cool to work with, the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers with bad attitudes and don't know what their driving."
good,Great company that has over spent on other Auto Parts Business. The company is far behind on their competition. Software programs need updating and upper management needs to be more open to change. Not a lot of growth within the company.
good,"Offer descent pay and benefits.  Also offer advancements in positions.  Was fun working with the other employees.  Some long hours, and lots of weekends."
good,I really enjoyed my job at Advance but there wasn't really any room for growth and with me being 28 years old I'm looking for a career. The work environment was nice and I liked my co-workers but the pay was minimum wage and sometimes I felt like I was working too hard for that small amount of money.
good,"Adv.Auto is a fun place to work if you are into cars, you must have at least basic mechanical knowledge to succeed there. You must be capable of lifting 50lbs on a regular basis"
good,Start work at 5a.m and work til 3p.m or later. Learned to drive forklift trucks and scan products with scanners. Learned to pull and stock parts on shelves.
good,I loved the experience and co-workers. Also loved to learn more about the automotive industry. But I could not support myself and children on the hourly wage Advance paid me.
good,Cuidense su salud pq de ello depende su produccion recursos humanos es más para la compañía que para los empleados pero ejerza sus derechos de ser necesario..
good,I worked at Advance Auto for a year part time to earn extra income. Job is good for a side hustle. You get 9 an hour to start (minimum wage). Management gets compensated well. That's only when the job security kicks in. When your a sales associate your just a number. They are in need for workers.
good,calm work setting it had its days where the work is heavy but work is mainly light for the most part. Great learning experience for vehicle lovers....
good,"So the experience in working there is great, unfortunately I have never been given a full time position or a livable wage. Due to new additions to my life, I need more than a  part time, low paying job."
good,It was a fun job out of high school.  I was interested in cars at the time and I learned a lot.  The pay was okay and I liked working with my hands helping customers with batteries and so on.
good,Long hours with limited support from area supervisors. Experience levels were inconsistent and support was difficult to obtain. Ability to transfer within company was allowed but not generally supported by numerous district managers.
good,"I come into work in the A.M. Clock in using computer. Set up cash register. Unload auto parts from truck. Scan unit  barcodes and place product on shelf. Face front all shelf items and set up store displays. Greet and expedite customer orders. Clean bathrooms, clean store floors using service machine. Test and Charge car batteries. Replace car batteries and windshield wipers for customers. Check and refill car fluids for customer. I've gained much experience about cars and customers. Great place to work. The hardest part is showing up for work. The most enjoyable part is helping customers!"
good,the markers are there to mae it a top dog but there are far to many tripping factors stopping the company from growing in the right direction. far to top heavy and needs to be more involved with those at the customer level to make the difference and define the brand.
good,the location i worked at never slowed down. had many walk in and commercial accounts so it was a non stop nogt slow down from start to end of shift. was never boring.
good,They want you to work for very low pay for the type of work your doing. The benefits are okay but could be better. They cut hours from one employee to hire a new employees.
good,Fast paced working environment. Always got to be ready for the next set of stores to open for parts. Got to be thorough and steady paced with selecting parts.
good,"Auto retail is definitely not your average retail store, one learns primarily on how Advance products are useful for our customer's line of work and how the product itself works. Advance costumers are very informative and understanding, especially towards my lack of fluent Spanish. This opportunity was a great way to improve my knowledge on motor vehicles, such as installation of wiper blades, batteries and etc..."
good,"It's not the worst job I've had. I actually liked my job, I just had issues with the manager being completely incompetent. Not to mention he refused to give me a raise in wages despite giving me a raise in responsibilities."
good,"Very face pace and competitive work..."
good,I wound up working at Advance once I lost my job. The job was easy to get and there weren't many requirements for getting the job. It's really just retail. There are no commission bonuses for doing a good job. There isn't a good recognition program for doing a good job. It could simply be the different types of management but working at one Advance is probably like working at any Advance.
good,Management was horrible. It wasn't the best place to work. The work itself was easy but the management was constantly changing. It is very hard to advance.
good,"Short breaks, high insurance, need better pay increases. Need to have better Management. Typical days was sometimes stressful. Need more qualified people to be in the Management positions."
good,"Working for Advance has been real. At times it has been fun. However, the corporate leadership has turned towards profitability versus employee retention. I believe this is dangerous ground for any company because it undermines customer service. That is to say unhappy employees frequently produce unhappy customers."
good,"There’s really nothing hard about this job. "
good,Good environment mostly and nice people to be around.  The pay isn’t too great but the work isn’t very difficult either.  There are a lot of parts to memorize
good,Definitely a experience to have as a young man. Knowledge about automobiles is a must in our world. I learned how to sell and how to assist customers with learning about their vehicles.
good,"This job is fast paced and can be over bearing at times."
good,"I had to deal with the public that needed repairs for their automobile.Tensions could be,at times,high. Overall,the company was alright to work for.I had good and bad management that I worked under. Co-workers were for the most part,average."
good,"Abrir departamento comercial"
good,"Sales Calls to Commercial repair shops, market parts and equipment along with weekly specials. Also develop memberships for an exclusive program. "
good,I had 5 different managers in my 3 years working here. It is an average retail job that I worked over the summer in college. I did not register for benefits.
good,"Learned a lot from working at Advance Auto Parts. Even at first only having a low basic vehicle information, I learned how to change a car battery and install wiper blades."
good,"Pay was the biggest issue. Say one thing and do another is not taken very well. Direct management was okay, however the higher level management team was not very helpful."
good,That job is okay if you really like dealing with cars but my experience was okay cause I did learn more about cars then I came to the job with I appreciate that
good,Working in an auto parts store taught me about retail operations and day to day goals. They use a variety off different strategy to balance knowledge of your job and duties as well as focusing on great customer service.
good,"advance auto parts, where to begin ? well ill start with the positives and move into my view in a second. I enjoy most of the people I work with, managers are awesome and make it more enjoyable to work a stressful job. your job is assist every customer in your store. 9/10 of these people are already upset because they are having to spend money on a part for a job they dont know how to do because they cant afford to pay someone. most people would say in this case not my problem. well when you work at advance you become the problem until you are the solution. In all of that I do enjoy what I do because every day I work there I helped a person with something they needed. I would never reccomend this job as a career. The pay will never increase."
good,"great long and hard nights"
good,"Working with the public in retail can be a trying experience. As a retail associate, you don't make very much money ($8-8.50) start and the pay raises are infrequent. What helps you along is if you have good co-workers to share in the tasks required to keep a store operating. Too often, you have certain people the at think all they have to do is sell and don't have to share in the other work load (seems they think its beneath them)."
good,I do not recommend working for this company other than part time sales or driver.  There is minimal room for advancement from General Management within the company.
good,No specific review to provide at this time for Advance Auto Parts.   Enjoyed working with the various teams and gaining experience in working with the functional areas.
good,Me dieron la oportunidad de aprender y mejorar laboralmente en un part time
good,Advance is a very fun family oriented type of workplace. In my time working there I was able to meet a lot of new people. I learned a little bit about vehicles that I never knew. I learned how to install batteries and wiper. It also gave me good customer service experience. I was able to meet different types of people from various backgrounds and help them in getting the parts they needed to fix the issues they had with their cars. Overall Advance has been a fulfilling job and has taught me a lot. It is a good company to work for and rewarding in different ways.
good,not much opportunity for advancement on the retail level. even as a keyholder i was only making the same as a cashier. good employee perks and its an easy to run store
good,The work was not difficult or stressful to be honest but management had a way of making you feel like your job was always at risk. Also the warehouse was highly unorganized compared to other places Ive seen and worked at. The feeling I got from all employees including those in upper and mid management level positions was that they just wanted to get through the day. No one there seemed honestly happy to have their job and I felt like the work environment suffered because of that attitude. It seemed no one actually took any pride in their work.
good,"I learned a lot about cars and car parts by working with this company but there's no room for career advancement, the work environment is okay just depends on what store your in."
good,"It was fine until they closed my sales department to boost the sales of another store. The work culture is acceptable, but the pay scale is a little low after you advance past an entry level position."
good,"I’ve learned to work with customers more than before, I’ve learned how to handle situations with customers. I’ve learned how to diagnose cars or trucks with what the customers tell me."
good,it has been a long time since I worked at the PDQ. They are no longer at this location. They moved almost 10 years ago over to Kansas. I counted car parts and when orders came in from the stores I filled the orders
good,Management was overwhelmed and didnt communicate with employees properly. was kinda just a jumbled mess. Never fully got trained on what I was suppose to do.
good,I only can say that you can go to work and school. Could use management with people awarness skills to better understand work schedules and employees. Could use better employee reviews
good,"Enjoy working for the company, but the pay is pretty low.  The company needs to look at paying their part time as well as full time more per hour.  Excellent place to work other than pay."
good,I have mixed reviews and do not wish to comment at this time. The job in Phoenix is different I am  sure than other locations lots of travel .A good company
good,"Stock shelves, keep the store clean, regular deliveries to local auto shops, friendly regular customers great family feel"
good,"Do vehicle inspection."
good,I worked here full time in college to help pay my bills. The store managers always blame all faults on corporate and say they can do nothing about it. I did not receive a single review or raise in my time here even though I exceeded my sales quota month after month in a store where no one else was doing so.
good,Decent company to work for the staff is nice and the managers work with your schedule and help you learn the new systems quick. you are able to establish good customer service.
good,Enjoyed delivering parts to the auto shops and communicating with the people in the shop and offices. enjoyed  restocking parts to them proper place on the shelves.
good,There was a strong divide with management and myself. My values did not align with management so I left. When I worked there in previous years there was a better team of people that had more fun. Those years ended when I returned.
good,i like working at advance auto parts.A company if you want to grow is a good company. i enjoy the benefits and the work place. Thank God for Advance Auto parts.
good,Quiet workplace and helpful employee.  Ability to work independently as well as with a team. Loved being able to bounce ideas and my manager was very accessible.
good,"It was a fast paced environment that made you have to use time management skills, organizational skills, housekeeping skills, teamwork as well as individual, and able to adapt to change and new policies."
good,"The workers are fun and helpful, joke around, split the work load, and will answer any questions you may have if they can. "
good,it helped me become strong on car service and identifying car parts.  I'm able to help customer with suggesting the best oil to lube their car with and suggest some chemicals that would help their fuel efficiency.
good,"The manager in my store is wonderful, I can't say that for all the stores. Overall, I think they need to pay employees more. It is hard for them to get and keep reliable employees because of their pay scale."
good,"fun, fast paced work atmosphere.  management treated employees fairly and were easy to get along with.  I recommend Auto Zone as a good work place. They also offered great employee benefits"
good,"I Lead a small team problem solving with knowledge of store systems and expert knowledge of automotive systems and parts. "
good,"Good company, but limits your growth, should hire within, more training need for management, team members should be treated better , be recognized for there accomplishments"
good,The people working there always where more than happy to help you learn new skills. The Manager was more than helpful and willing to assist you in working through Ny problems.
good,"When it gets to district positions the company rather brings people from others companies , so our management don't get the opportunities to continue the career path."
good,"The company changed the way we had to deal with customers too much, one person would tell you one thing and then you talked.to another and they would tell you something completely different."
good,Really enjoyed working for the company.  The management at the store was a night mare.  The store was ran as a dictatorship with zero care towards your feelings as a person.  Cane was the worst manager I've ever worked for.  He talked down to people and treated them as a place to wipe your feet.
good,"Good place to work, employees were fun . the job was fun and flexible hours. Good pay flexibke hours. Easy going work. Not stressful. Great costumer employee relations"
good,"deliver parts to commercial customers interacting with professionalism, learning how to satisfy their necessity in the shortest possible time, always working in a friendly environment"
good,assisting customers with their auto part needs and installing certain parts on customers cars. work out side in all conditions. work evenings and weekends
good,It can be a fun job if you genuinely enjoy helping your customers and providing solutions for their issues as I did. The pay is absolutely horrible and upper management really doesn't seem to care about the front line employees. But that's to be expected of most corporations now a days.
good,With this job you have to work for every penny. While there some people were able to get away with doing nothing leaving me to have to pick up the slack.
good,"You wont go anywhere, the management often doesn't care at all about you. They will argue for every penny tp pay you despite being the best or most knowledgable in the store. may managers care more about their numbers than their employees ad it shows. I will never work for this company again. i don't recommend you do. the only reason i even purchase from them is because ive known them for several years."
good,the actual work is ok but management seems to change direction constantly. One minute they have you go a direction and then about face on the same thing
good,good company to work for if your not looking to advance your career.If you only want to skate through life then work for Advance AUTO PARTS.jUST DO NOT WORK ASA A MANAGER HAS YOU WILL NEED GOOD TEAM PLAYERS THAT WILL WORK AFTER THEIR PROBATION PERIOD
good,"Co workers and managers are awesome , great work environment. Rewarding as you get to help people get back on the road . Learned a lot about auto parts."
good,I have enjoyed the time I have worked for Advance Auto Parts it is very team oriented. I’m a people person and I love helping those in need. I have been with the company for about 6 and a half years now and since then I have had a baby and I’m getting married. The job no longer pays what I need to Survive on and at this time a raise or promotion is not available. I enjoy the work but I am passionate about getting  into law enforcement or security services. I’m looking for a career instead of a job.
good,"I was asked early on to become a key holder and received a pay bump. I felt like there would be opportunities for growth for me if I stayed on, but I went back to school."
good,Slow paced. Lacks potential career advancement opportunities. Company processes and training needs better structure. Overall management  is not the best.
good,"A typical day at work, sometimes some extra work and longer stays. They were very flexible with the lunch hours. It was ran very good by the GM. The days off were really flexiable."
good,This was a good company to work for. I learned how to install car batteries and a lot of other important details about cars. If  given the chance i would go back to this company
good,Depending on your career path. AAP could b e a good place to work. I had several coworkers that advanced and learned a lot. The Management team was okay.
good,"as an RPP I had to do a lot of work and at the end of the two weeks my check was terrible, so much to do and little pay. sometimes you would over work for more than 8 hours without a lunch break, due to company taking away hours equals not enough staff. "
good,Good company to work for. The manager was excellent and very fair with your schedule. You get to learn as you go and get good hands on experience learning about cars.
good,Learned even more about vehicles and their auto parts. Learned about some of the better local mechanic services. Meet new people daily. The employees are a team
good,We are extremely busy during tax season and you must be on your game to keep up with the pace of customers (diy and commercial).
good,"this was a good place to before they went public on the stock market.they installed a lot of new visions that cost us money in the negative light.however we had fun in this company, they just lost a little of what they  were founded  on whe n it comes to the ream members."
good,"It was a fast paced job which I enjoyed.  I attended several management seminars and learned a lot.  I also learned budgeting, scheduling and customer service skills."
good,Stock inventory
good,Lack of communication from upper management. Many of the long term employees are leaving. The personal touch is missing. In a different position with the company it might be different but I cant say.
good,a typical workday was relaxed but could sometimes get busy depending on how many customers were entering the store. Our commercial business depended on how busy those commercial business were.
good,"Quick paced, everyday brings something new. Teamwork is a must, a knowledge of auto parts is a plus but with the training they offer is not a have to ."
good,The job is very inconsistent. Management is all over the place. The scheduling system will always have last minute changes. Overall very unprofessional
good,"parts business, delivered parts to customers, stocked inventory, customer service, management was decent, company changes continually trimmed payroll."
good,"I enjoyed myself working at Advance Auto, because it is a very physical job. I enjoy sports and activities that keep me moving fast paced and this place is definitely a workout."
good,Not too much opportunity to grow but it is a okay job for part time the people are great but the management team doesn't show much support. I can say that I've learned a lot about car parts working there.
good,too much work and responsabilities for the money. you can earn more money and doing less in other companies like department stores or any other retailer
good,"i loved my job at aap.  i was disheartened by the initiative to make money no matter the cost.  my job went from an educational experience to stressful, racing other cashiers to the register to make a sale so you could keep your job.  i used to love the company, now i dont."
good,"Supervised 3 managers and 13 employees."
good,"every job location is different.  For the location that I worked at, there was always something to do to keep yourself busy.  The company is sales driven.  The work environment is truly based off of what the store manager dictates.  My location felt like a family when I started working there, I had the support of the store manager and I was eased into duties that at the beginning I felt a little uneasy about. the staff was friendly, and I felt welcome.  The best thing I can suggest is to try and work a store that is being prepared to be opened as a new store.  Its a truly bonding experience with the team that you will be working that location with."
good,"Learned a lot about customer service. I had to learn fast. It's a joy to help the customers who needed it since they mostly came after having car troubles. Towards the end of my employment, management was making a large change for the better."
good,Advance Auto Parts has a fun work environment. There are good employees and I have enjoyed working their. It is not a very stressful job. I want to find something better though.
good,"arrive at work go obtain the manifest for the inventory we are about to receive. clear a path for the pallets that are being received. unwrap and scan all inventory that was received."
good,Most of the time working here was great. The only issue I had was the ability to advance in the company seemed too low. People who have a job there tend to keep it a while so not many positions open up.
good,Cooperate would rather out source for management. Outsourcing planograms so cut he in half. The hrs leave you with no plans outside of work. And the disrespect from cooperate is ridiculous.
good,"Pros---Training is provided"
good,"Work loads changes day to day... Consisting of scheduling, training, stocking , monitoring, loss prevention, and opening and closing... Customer service is a must..."
good,Advance is a great place to work. I learned a great deal about cars in my time there. They just didnt offer the kind of advancement I was looking for in a career.
good,": Opening and closing the store. Monitoring register deposits, and counting end of day deposits to deposit to the bank. Assisting the General Manger in interviews to hire potential employees.  Handling imports/exports of weekly truck delivery and adjusting inventory accordingly, as well as designating/helping to stock the shelves with new inventory. Regularly preforming checks on inventory and adjusting the inventory numbers if necessary. Changing the layout of inventory as designated by the corporate office. Filing daily paperwork to be stored properly. Helping to preform weekly price changes. Helping both retail and commercial customers in finding the correct parts they need and ringing them up as a cashier. Preforming part testing, and reading check engine light diagnostic codes. Installing batteries and light bulbs for customers. I would assist in customer service with customer needs to help resolve any issues. Making weekly work schedules for the employees, trying to accommodate to both the stores and employees needs. Finally designating employees to daily tasks that need to be completed."
good,"Very fast paced cut throat 10 hour nights loading trailers and working with a conveyour belt sorting system a lot of inventory work , office work and order pulling."
good,"usually its pretty steady. face paced, people are great. you put up parts and pull them when needed. you meet new people while out on deliveries. have to keep work area neat."
good,"Unprofessional and racism is the company model.  Rules change daily.  What's good for one doesn't apply to everyone.  Secrets, Terrible wages.  They are like prison guards."
good,"Job is not difficult, and management can be really great at the store level. Corporate, however, can be overbearing and difficult to get a straight answer from."
good,Very relaxed job other than the occasional bad customers. Most of the time you are cleaning the store and fixing shelfs. If you can do that you can work here.
good,It was an entry level job when i started there. Loved the people i worked for. Enjoyed the job because I got to interact with businesses around my area.
good,"good place to start out your experience meeting and greeting customers, learning the cash registrar, making deliveries and meeting the commercial end of the business. Pay wasn't the greatest for driving 80 miles round trip to work everyday."
good,"Typical day at work would be to come in on or before your scheduled time and take calls, providing as much help as possible to the caller. "
good,"Worked different areas while at the warehouse depending on what they needed that day. Was a good working experience, management was felxible with hours and co-workers were nice people to work with"
good,Drove parts to shops and people who needed them. The facility was always clean and workers tried to be friendly. Sometimes the customer service of some coworkers could have been better. The management was competitive and would cut corners to make the sale regardless of price and how much they cut the price to please customer.
good,The company has or used to have a strong culture (7-5-3) which I enjoyed.  Good training programs and room for growth in small towns to be manager or even higher.
good,"Great co-workers, not enough hours. It was supposed to be a full time position but turned into seasonal to perm, status changing after 90 days. It's been four months and all the new hires are still seasonal."
good,"It's not a career choice but the job is ok.Managment throws you store to store,sometimes without asking you. Ok they also keep you under hours so they get quality work cause they always pushing you out the door"
good,"take care of the customer, job duty's are as needed. can be fun place to work. store hours are long for shift coverage. no issues with time off requests."
good,Advance auto parts is a fun environment for the youth straight out of high school . it will teach you basic auto mobile mechanisms and how they work. also you will interact with customer who want a quart of oil or they want to purchase a engine.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is the largest auto parts retailer in North America. Through a period of growth and acquisition of companies like Carquest, Autoparts International, and WorldPac, it has expanded to be a leader not only as a DIY retailer but also in commercial sales. "
good,"Start the stretches and cheering! "
good,"Somewhat stressful at times, but the worst part was the terrible coworkers making it a bad work atmosphere. If you get rid of the cut-throat coworkers thoroughly enjoyed the job itself"
good,productive fast paced work specifically enjoyed interacting with customers about there vechiles . management was ok pay rate was horrible also a lack of benefits.
good,"I would open the store and get tills ready for the day."
good,Always had a great experience working here with both the store staff and upper management. Career advancement was always a good possibility with this company.
good,"pulled auto parts for customers,worked with people great training good management .the hardest part of the job was the company policies . but enjoyed the job."
good,it was an easyjob and really chill. it breaks me that I lost it but there was nothing I could do. as long as you can handle weather and awkward conversations its cool
good,Nothing really to explain about job it was a part time position. I haven't worked there in years so don't really know about new policies or management
good,"My supervisor was not friendly.  He chose to make it rough for me.  And I feel the manager did not do anything to make it any easier, my co-workers were nice"
good,"Advance Autoparts is your normal sales job with Cleaning, Stocking, and Counting of inventory. Nice coworkers and customers (both DIY and commercial). the only downside is that there are a few full time employees and they never leave so there is little room for advancement and limited benefits for part time employees."
good,"I worked for this company for 4 years and in my store we went through four different managers.  Two of the managers were great. They were team players and involved the entire store in sharing responsibilities, learning new tasks, training, and maintaining morale. They stayed on top of their store and made it a better place to work. Unfortunately, the last couple of managers were not up to the task. They spent more time on their own agendas, standing outside smoking, and not working with their employees. Morale went down the drain, people simply walked out or were no-call no-shows leaving those of us who were left to carry on with little support."
good,"Learn everything I can and try to make workplace more fun instead of stressful, cater to my comercial customers and walk ins, do more than whats expected of me"
good,corporate micro manages which makes being a manager tough but an excellent place to work and learn about cars. slight knowledge is good when you get a job here but you learn as you go. tip to corporate: hire GMs that know about cars.
good,"Everything was ok until the manager started to get  some of my hours to give other people more hours. Actually, it was a temporary job for me.So, i had to leave and look for another job that has a better career. In other side, you have to sell, stock, install batteries  and deliver parts to the customers. All of these things and they don't pay well."
good,"delivering mechanical parts to different shops. Collecting money and getting them to sign the receipt, the part i like the most about this job was the relaxing part of me just driving."
good,"answering phone calls, helping customers in store, stocking freight, ordering and receiving special order product.  Also basic housekeeping needed to be done daily."
good,Advanced discount auto parts is a well organized auto parts store. The managers are friendly and help you learn as much as possible to help the customers with their auto needs.
good,Hot move u to different location tohelp other people no hrs.hot no water stations not hiring at the moment im seasonal no free lunch good hrs thst i need
good,I am starting to feel like a liberal made up this website because you are forcing people to do something stupid for your gain. That is the kind of junk that really bothers me.
good,"You'll deal with a bunch of types of people and shops that feel like the walk on water. Having a knowledge of the automotive world is extremely helpful. You will be under paid for the amount of work you do. Even when the manager wants you to be paid more the corporate side is not willing to pay people what they are worth. Spend 2 years just to have a new hire be paid $0.50 less than you and they are only a driver and could be any less useless. Advancement is only for those that suck up and play the game, but even then it's not a given. The Job will always go to the less qualified so they are paid less."
good,"Not enough work driving for certain stores . Advancement too quickly to fill management spots without proper training. Company is attempting to grow without proper upper management. Too high of employee turnover. Although the pay scale is low,they will hire people without automotive experience and expect them to install batteries,windshield wipers and perform technical tests with company supplied equipment during intrepid weather."
good,"My customers and coworkers great...!! I started out with 2 delivery vehicles, but with my sales I soon had a 3rd delivery vehicle. I made more sales than that store had ever seen. Then when we got a new DM I was fired the first day I met him. The company used to be awesome, but in recent years it has turned into a boys club. I still run into my old customers and every one of them remembers me and wish I was back."
good,The employees were great to work with and I have no complaints about the people there. They could have not kept hiring and given the employees the have more hours and pay.
good,"Not a bad place to work. The pay is not the greatest but its a job and it helps pay the bills. Prefer 40 hrs a week. Training is getting a little bit better since we've hired a new manager. Other than that its not a bad job to start off at, but for the long haul its not worth it unless you're trying to become a manager or commercial parts pro which pays more."
good,Recommended with some reservations for quality of life. Nice starting point for someone that wants to learn the aftermarket business due to the extensive automotive e-learning program.
good,lazy management and unorganized. pay is too low to keep good workers. too much mandatory overtime scared some people away. high turnover. Mess up checks often
good,I like the job been that i learned more about cars and how to look up parts an learn how to do wind shiled wipers an install battery's and maling sure customers are happy an also learing how to check battery's
good,the only downfall to working here is that the only way to get hours is to be a manager. everyone else is very limited on the amount of hours the are available.
good,"Employed as a parts delivery driver.I deliver parts to commercial shops.It is enjoyable work,I work with a good group of people everyone has a job to do and they do it.No benefits for part time workers.Pay should be more and more hours and it would be great..."
good,company was amazing to work for but they broke their promises of increasing my salary after the probation period. they didn't stick to their written contract.
good,Great Teammates and customer relations. The benefits and pay were fair. They are a customer service based company and all decisions are based on the customer.
good,Great friendly environment  good people and great deals. Customers are always happy and get what they need. Many local locations and most carry or can get what ever you need
good,"The work load was manageable, the pay was also decent, but not in comparison with the other local warehouses. They did offer overtime hours, if you wanted them."
good,with any job you only get out of it what you put into it. I don't have much more to say however I have a minimum to meet so I will keep typing until I meet the quota
good,was very nice working for advance auto parts. have no real issues there. had room for advancement just had a manager that didnt see it. so i moved on to other company
good,The hardest part of the job was working with people who did not care about work. Call ins and no shows was the norm. Management accepted this. Apart from that is was a good place to work.
good,a good company to work with but management was not up to par. but I did like most of the people I worked with. would like to have the opurtunity to work for them again
good,there should really be more staff and better management more traning and better beneifits and paid time off there should also be better pay for the work that you do.
good,"If you like driving, auto parts, people this is the job for you. I learned more about different auto parts. Management was awesome. Good work environment."
good,Looking for more money and better benefits. Great company to work for though. Would recommend to and one that's just looking for a good and easy job and something to do.
good,I liked the company. They did a reorganization and let over 100 of my positions go company wide. Did not agree how it was done. I thought i would finish out my career with this company.
good,lots of hours lots of bs to deal with very unorganized. the company does not have a clear path to have you grow nor do they want you to grow i tried to get higher positions only to be shut down because they did not want to pay
good,Good place to work if you dont need benefits.  Management treats you pretty well id you are a good employee.  Business has slowed down lately making ir tough to get hours.
good,advance auto was a good experience for me I learned a lot about sales when I was there and leaned a lot about talking to customers id work there again if I could
good,Customer service and Automotive knowledge are key. You must be able to understand automotive systems and know how to troubleshoot issues in order to make sales goals and provide great customer service.
good,"customer service, doing the inspection on the work vehicles, i learned a lot over the years, it depends on which manager you want to know about, the hardest part was learning where all the parts are in the store, the best part was the mechanic i got to meet an work with everyday, i was building a new family"
good,have to keep on your toes. fast paced. must meet quota. pick orders for advance auto parts. restock when items get low. friendly environment to meet new people
good,Count the registers and the safe perform all morning paperwork etc. Fill out the goals far the day assigned a register to associate. make sure shelves are stock and help customers.
good,Every day is new a filled with challenges.  You get to meet a lot of new people and interact with many different people.  The hardest part of the job is staff retention.  the workplace culture is professional and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to run your own store with minimal interference from upper management.
good,Was easy work. Management was friendly and wanted to make the place of work enjoyable. Very laid back and everyone was knowledgeable about the products in store.
good,"Love the fast pase environment, the only downside was and i believe its still is that the managers did not lead employees to strive for more, there was times where production wasn't meat because managers and leads just didn't wanted to ask employees to cut talking and focus on the goal."
good,"The turnover rate is pretty high no matter what store you work at. I worked at multiple locations and this was always a problem. I enjoyed the work, but the pay wasn't good enough to stick around."
good,Well managed place for entry level on automotive business personnel. Gain experience on auto parts I haven't even seen on a automobile vehicles. Well recommended for new automobile leaders.
good,"A typical day included checking out customers, changing batteries and windshield wipers and stocking the sales floor. The hardest part  of the job probably when there is a huge rush of customers."
good,Ok place too work if u need a job but not a long term good decision no good benefits work until the job is done so u never know when u gonna get off and poor management
good,"good work place, general managers and above that are all really nice people. always worked with my schedule while being in college. boss is really understanding if you need to take time off."
good,"This job is all about helping people. If you love helping people, it's a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet all different kinds of people. The hardest part of the job is the hours you have to work, but it is retail."
good,I enjoyed my time there but my hours were getting cut cause the store was closing so I had to seek employment somewhere else. But over all I liked it.
good,"No team effort applied most work is left for closing crew to do."
good,if opened we would count the register and take inventory of the store and backstock. when done with that we open and service each customer finding exactly what they needed.
good,not a bad company to work for limited staffing growth and low salary limited bonus good management and organized good hours and work life balance. knowledgeable.
good,This company is all about putting money in the bank. Yes they say you have all the tools you need to be successful. The minute it's a slow period ready to replace the whole team. I use to enjoy helping the customer. Until the store may have 2 people to help with customer and that limited the time on going over and beyond for the customer
good,"It's all about being quick, clean, direct! Knowing how to help customers find parts for their vehicle. Making sure every customer receive great customer service on a daily."
good,Great job if you love cars and have an extremely fast pace to keep up.  Must have good customer service skills and knowledge of cars. The moral of my store was excellent.
good,Advance Auto Parts is a great company and has some great things in store for the future. The company is growing very fast and i am excited to be apart of the positive growth.
good,they treated you like a robot and I did not like that and everyone that works at this location did not speak very good English and did not do well with math.
good,I worked in selections on the 3rd shift and I have never seen a shift such poirly managed and ran in my life theres always problems people are continuously quitting and walking out the managers are unprofessional they cuss they make fun of their employees and the companies policies are awful the turn over rate is also ridiculous they hire people and then the next thing you know the new hire is gone within a week because they treat you like slaves and work you to death. Advance company to work for and i wouldnt advise working for them atleast not in the selection department
good,"I am a car enthusiast and found advance to be enjoyable at times. It was a simple job and helped me to grow in customer service. If only the benefits where better, I would have considered working there longer."
good,"I was a driver, and delivered parts on a daily basis as well as a cashier. I really enjoyed interacting with all of the commercial customers. I learned a lot about vehicle parts that I didn't know before working there."
good,"It is a tough job, but can be rewarding. I enjoyed interacting with customer. I enjoy cars and work at a custom shop before so the ability to interact and help customers solve issues was very satisfying."
good,i answer calls close down for the day do regular inventory restocking and shipping i also deliver parts to shops help customers daily with there cars i explain step by step in each situation
good,I like working there it was a good job but it had a lot of problem i work there always finish my work all ways on time never call off always was 30min to 1hr early
good,"Co-workers were nice and supportive. New employee training is virtually non-existence.  Your training is basically by trial and error with little direct guidance from management, especially if being trained in management.  Salaries are competitive for the industry and there are opportunities to advance."
good,I enjoyed working with every member of my team.  We all learned from each other and that helped us grow as a team. Wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them
good,Working as a manager for over 10 years was a good learning experience. It taught me how to treat people and how I want to be treated. Being a women in a mans world was a challenge everyday but was well worth it.
good,"The DM was a bit mean, some of the stores are really messy and no one really seems to care about fixing it. I would say 2 stars"
good,"Working with all types of customers is good, you see all types of things there. Company not so bad. But its good if in need of a part time job........."
good,"Upper management kept transferring me from store to store in the same position with hopes of moving up in the company, but nothing ever came from it. Became very frustrating being told one thing and another happening."
good,"My knowledge of cars was birthed and built upon everyday I worked. It was a great experience that I will be able to use not only in my future employment opportunities, but in my everyday living. Not much room for advancement unless you ""know the right people"". Overall, not a bad job...."
good,"It's an ok job . Good work ethic and friendly staff, good opportunity to move up in the company and the pay rate is above the minimum wage depending on location"
good,The company was fun. Loved working there. Got to travel around employees were all great. They had a great training program. Only problem was they hire temp workers only.
good,Advance has made much progress in the 6 months I was there in processes and procedures. Not good on communication. Employee retention is a challenge.
good,Every one is friendly and the workers are hard workers just don't feel appreciate it enough the work environment is a good atmospher
good,A lot of fun if you're in to Auto's but don't expect to be well compensated or appreciated for extra effort. Requires minimal knowledge of cars initially and provides technical training.
good,"The wages that new hires are paid is very low (minimum wage); however, in less than a year of hard work and determination, I was able to gain a promotion from driver, one of the entry level positions, to shift supervisor. I did have to fight for a raise from minimum when minimum wage went up (district manager did not increase my wages because of the minimum wage increase). With the necessary experience in the automotive field, the work, itself, will become rewarding; however, because of a high turnover rate (employees quit more often than they are hired), the work will become overwhelming, fast."
good,"typical work days at advance auto is busy but we have a little fun with work by joing around with other work members of the team!"
good,great co- workers but again they could do better on hiring managers from district down to store managers.Company does seem to pay better than Oreilly Auto Parts and they carry mostly the same product but a little more expensive.Stock with this company is not doing well
good,"worked with great people. learned a lot about cars and how to maximize my sales. also learned that this was a great beginning to learn about stocking, inventory check, getting right parts for customers and working on cars"
good,"I think I would rather work for Walmart.  They do not have sales goals, academic mandates or stressed-out managers.  Personally, I would suggest going back into a repair shop - at least some shops are family oriented."
good,good part time job. work isn't very hard. pay isn't very good. great discount. management wasn't bad and co workers were all pretty cool. only real hard part of the job was changing batteries when its really hot or really cold.
good,Compensation can be lucrative if you are in a location that can meet sales goals with a staff that can perform their duties. Store goals seem to be inflated to make bonuses very difficult to reach.
good,"answer phones, look up bolt patterns per vech, look up wheels that will fit that bolt pattern, take deposit, order wheels and tires, or install if we have the wheels in stock, restock shelves, make sure show room is clean"
good,Advance Auto Parts provides a competitive yet friendly environment. The company balances selling with ethics and makes sure they provide a comfortable place to work.
good,"Advance is a good company in that their sales system is easy to learn and master and the computer system one of the best I've"
good,"There is a New CEO, so we will see if direction of company changes. Currently there needs all around shake-up, as the direction of the company for the last 2 years hs not been positive."
good,"Good place to work but they just keep taking away at the employees pay checks, no more commissions on items, fewer hours, unreachable goals and dealing with angry people. i wouldn't waist my time"
good,The company is micro managed and had very stern sales goals for non professionals in the field. This was a good job while in school getting through and working full time and going to school full time.
good,management at my store sucked but over all the company is great. there is no room to have a family and work here full time with the crazy retail schedules.
good,"Terrible place to work, District manager was not a nice guy to work for. I enjoyed the customers and co workers but there wasnt a future at this company."
good,Always dealing with angry customers so you have to have much patience. But besides that it allowed me to use my patience and make the customers satisfied.
good,"Customer service is the key in this field when it comes to work performance.  If you can do this, then you will be fine.  Nothing is hard about it."
good,"The job was fun and some of the people were ok to work with. But you must always watch your back. People who say they are your friends are not,"
good,Stress level is always high so with little pay its no worth the hassle. Great environment but communication is lacking with this company
good,"Opened and closed store, work 6 days a week just didnt have any family life. Co workers where great alot of knowledge for the most part"
good,"The store that I am in is a very busy and active store. Always moving, lots of customers and parts that move in and out of the store quickly."
good,"it was just something different and a change of paced, An a down and dirty job and it was always hot inside so the paint can stick to the product right."
good,"Most of the people you end up working with are pretty easy going, save for a few . Customers on the other hand are entirely unpredictable, no matter where or what store you're at."
good,Company doesn't seem to have any clear direction.  Between CEOs so maybe things will change.  The culture is one of non-urgency and failing to step up to the plate and own projects.
good,"This was a decent company to sell parts for, I would recommend them to people as an employer. Get communication between all levels."
good,"It's a Tough physical job."
good,"Work at Advance can be stressful at times. It is a fast paced work places which requires a well rounded and knowledgeable individual who can work as a team. Each person that comes into the or calls the store have their own specific and unique needs. As an employee, it is most important to be able understand each person's need and be able to assist them in whichever way possible. Automotive knowledge is not always necessary starting out. This company is a great environment to learn and grow. With hard work and commitment to the company many advancement opportunities are available."
good,To assist customers by getting them the right parts for the right vehicle.  Sometimes i would deal with tuff customers but in the end we would always figure out what they were looking for and sent them on there way.
good,Very busy at times but fun. People are friendly and team members make the workplace feel like home. Time passes by quickly when you enjoy where you work
good,"Job itself not that hard.. but hours not the best.. rotating hours for managers makes it hard for anything outside work.. needs more tradition hours for managers.. "
good,"If you are into performance parts you will love it, customers are friendly, plenty to learn, make connections. Overall it's a descent place to work at."
good,"Being in a small town having a sales goal, can not control who or when customers come into store. The people i worked with was friendly."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much and was dedicated, was not ok with the hours giving and the lack of training an neglected pay raise."
good,I will review the company at a later date.  I would recommend this company for those who are strong minded and motivated in retail.
good,"Always something to do so you were never really bored. Excellent job for those that lack professionalism and customer service skills. Those in upper management wouldn't scold you for making a mistake, but rather work towards resolving the issue and train you to be successful and prevent future mistakes from happening."
good,"Little to no organization in the store. No inventory control. High turnover of employees due to cut hours, low pay, and District Management support."
good,Fun and friendly environment helping customers hands on with their automotive needs. Even offering services such as battery and windshield wiper replacement
good,"The job is simple enough. Retail sales and basic customer interaction, yet the stock work and company store procedures exceed the value of the wages possibly earned."
good,"Receiving and distributing the shipment for the store daily. Contending with the problems that the customers have with their cars and suggesting possible solutions.  "
good,This could be a good place to work if given the proper guidance and training that is required to perform your job. The co-workers are trying to do their best. The hardest part of this job is knowing what is expected of you.
good,The associate review and reward process left something to be desired. Day to day operations and logistics needs a tech integration update to join the different facets and resources together.
good,Good place to get some people and customer service skills and to learn about the automotive industry. The personal was nice and with very good knowledge of their job.
good,Emphasis on sales and planograms. Difficult combination to accomplish. Need entire team to accomplish tasks.  Store location critical to succes. Can experience difficult customers.
good,Advance is a OK place to work not the best but it is somewhere to work instead of not having a job the people are kind of funny acting but you don't go to work to become friends with anybody you go to work and get paid
good,Non stop from open to close.  Hub stores are three businesses in one. Training of new team members needs to be more hands. Need a stronger manager bench.
good,"The work environment is ok depending on your crew members. Hardly any job security, so I wouldn't consider this place if you're looking for something long term."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"fun work place with supportive man. not all about numbers but how you grow personally and develop. decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a large company"
good,"good people to work with low pay makes for high turn over. Always training someone new, good managers they care about their workers . You get to see some nice rides, and talking about cars all  isn't half bad"
good,"A good job to have 40 hours every week and you meet a lot of fun people, but at the same time you meet a lot of bad people too.  People that don't trust you just just because you where a uniform and are required to work with emergency services like the police.  Also the management expects you to preform duties beyond what they pay you and some of them can be dangerous."
good,"The work load is okay, but unfortunately almost always picking up slack of other workers.  The pay is too low for all the work, responsibility and knowledge required to work there.  Barely paying over $8hr."
good,"I was a warehouse employee at Advance Auto Parts in Kansas City, Missouri. I really liked the environment there, including the management and my co-workers. Would recommend to anyone."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a good to start working. The pay is just above  min. pay other than management.  It is retail and Monday thru Sunday with only 2 holidays off for the year.  I work in a warehouse. A lot of heavy lifting and always short staffed, but great working team. Warehouse person gets most the holidays off."
good,Too many changes with management and the rules are never consistent. They play favorites and don't treat everyone fairly.
good,The job is OK if you are big on cars then this maybe a great job for you to work. Since working at this company i learned alot of things about cars also about life.
good,A typical work day is a lot of check engine lights and battery test. The majority of the people know what they want which is a cool thing.
good,"The pay isn't the best but the people are good.I have learned alot working there. Decent amount of red tape a politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Advance overexpanded in years past and is now scared to death to spend money.  They seemed to be in decline when I was there
good,"Typical day at work, clock in and stand at the register. Greet customers that walk in, ask what they need help with. Front-faced products when it wasn't busy in the store. On Wednesdays we put up stock, which sometimes took all day. I've learned a lot about cars about cars and their parts. The management is not so bad, but they could've trained me a bit more on the parts and the store. Some of my co-workers were a bit lazy. The hardest part of the job was reaching the goal sales on a very slow day. I don't enjoy anything about this job, hours a very low, you have to a** kiss in order o receive more hours. I've been working 12 to 8 hours a week! The employees that are full time are the managers. If you are not a manager, then you should expect 18 to 8 hours a week."
good,"I helped customers’ find parts for their car, install batteries, wiper blades and other varies parts. I showed great customer service to customers’ and a genuine interest for their problems. On Truck days I’d restock the stores, and do pangrams to stop clutter."
good,The company has set shifts and if you need time off you have to get someone to trade with.  One good point is that you get a good discount on parts and they offer sales bonuses.
good,"Its a ok place to work at the people are great to work with, there is really nothing hard about this job at all but I did learn a lot by having a supervisor role at times."
good,A typical day at work starts out helping customers with their auto part needs with inventory management done in between.  I learned a great deal about cars and how the internal parts work in a few months without any prior knowledge.  The hardest part of the job were the hours I had to work and never seeing my family except for my days off.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I could help them resolve their car issues and knowing they received quality parts.
good,The only bad thing was asking me to work at another location and then not moving them back as promised. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"good day,good working environment.nice workers.hardest standing on hard floors and installing batterys and wiper blades when bad weather.most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and greeting customer and mechanic. also delivering parts."
good,a lot of free services are used at this location. so your day is very busy because your in and out of the store all day. also you still have to make your sales while only getting a 30 min break.
good,"If you are into automobiles it is a decent place to work, if not I wouldn't recommend. 30 minute breaks and below average pay. Overall I give it a C+"
good,"The people i worked with back in 2009 are probably long gone, but they were very knowledgeable about parts, and guiding the customer to the proper tools, and hardware to get the job done right"
good,"Fun place to work employees were like a small family, upper management was not so good because they have no real automotive experience."
good,"Worked regular day job hours 8-4 or 9-5. I learned about basic auto parts including brakes, filters, transmission components, etc. The management was somewhat wishy washy it changed often and everybody had their own agenda. My co-workers for the most part were good workers and team players. The hardest part of the job was not really hard it was just stocking shelves because it was boring. However, the most enjoyable part was learning hands on about the different systems and parts involved in automotive retail."
good,The store was conveniently located for many people.  It was located off exit 7 in alexandria virginia.  Entering the parking lot was always a chellange due to the Giant at the end of the parking lot.
good,"daily goals are set for each individual base on there pay and job title. The company expects there workers to be productive, just like any other company. I take pride in what I do  and what I've learned working here"
good,"Typical day includes stocking and working the cash register. I learned a decent amount of vehicle knowledge. The co-workers were fantastic, but the management could have been better."
good,A typical day at Advance Auto would start with mainly assisting customers at the front counter until a delivery truck is open.
good,Core night shifts and On call work. Management doesnt consider you if you applying for an IJP. Favoritism by team leader for changing the shift timing. You'll get bored by taking calls.
good,"I enjoy working at Advance Auto Parts because of my coworkers and the customers. The only issues I have is that there is no incentive to push yourself to be better. I outperform and go above and beyond for customers for them, not for a pay incentive or potential promotion. I've been at Advance Auto Parts for a year and a half. The only people still there when I started is the assistant general manager and retail parts professional. Everyone else has quit, usually within the first 6 months. I feel the reason is that Advance has a high demand for it's employees to be extremely well trained in everything automotive, but offer the same pay as a Walmart cashier."
good,"A busy day at Advance can be fun with a variety of customers looking for different products while a slow day can be cumbersome with mostly customers who are there only because they desperately need a part.  I have learned that most customers are good to associates and appreciate help from associates.  The management of the local stores is usually good, but the districts are only as good as the district manager.  The district has a new manager and the management of is improving because the new district manager is more involved with the local stores.  There has been a high rate of employee turnover due to limited amount of hours and low rate of pay, but that is common with part time retail.  The hardest part is dealing with the customers who are not satisfied with the help of any associate, but that is a part of retail in general and fortunately those customers are rare.  The best part is dealing with customers who are thankful to associates and enjoy being at the parts store."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, however they were constantly changing and restructuring the employees.  Made it very difficult to have a functional team."
good,"nice place to work if it is your kind of thing. it takes a special kind of person to deal with the different district leaders, and to make everyone happy with all the changes in management. you can promote pretty quickly, but if you have to know someone in order for that to happen."
good,"This place was a part time job during school. It was not a very fun job, but the people there were good people. Auto Parts stores people do not come in happy so you have to have good people skills"
good,Atmosphere at work is light and lively. A fast paced sales and service oriented career. Overall a great place to work with opportunities to expand your professional portfolio. Can be stressful at times.
good,When I first went to work there it was Western Auto they did alot for the employees Advance took over and most of that came to a halt
good,"Took care of customers, answered phones, found the parts the customer needes to finish there jobs"
good,"Over all company is solid....!"
good,Company did not care about their employees as well as the associates too lazy.
good,"Well when I started it was fun but as it went along and I got moved to other stores further from my house and was not as fun then I was told that I was a driver, and I did not apply for that position but finally I relented since I needed the Job, coworkers were ok but just ok"
good,"flexible hours"
good,"You have to be a retail type of person to be able to handle a screwy schedule..... One day you open the next day your closing.....You have to work 50 + hours to make a living..Not being from a retail job before working there,made it very hard to adjust to working on a different schedule every week!"
good,A normal day at work being in the position I'm in consists of driving a company vehicle to different commercial accounts in a prompt and timely fashion to deliver the parts they ordered. What I've learned in the almost two years being there is the different parts of a motor vehicle. Something I was uneducated in before starting. The team members I work with are for the most part very team oriented and very easy to get along with. The only thing I must say I don't like about my current job is the fact that I've been promised promotions and raises twice and the upper management went back on their word.
good,"A typical day is pulling backstock, getting ready for truck, cycle counts, shooting outs. Helping customers whether on the phone or in person. Helping them solve the problems they are having. The hardest part of my job is if I cannot help them or we do not have the part they need. Alot of looking things up on the computer. Stocking shelves making sure store looks presentable."
good,Overall nice and friendly and good environment to work around. Managers are nice
good,Overall I enjoy working here. It has its good and bad days but nothing is perfect. You can also pick up a lot of knowledge in the automotive world and plenty of other skills.
good,"Good starter job, allows for a great opportunity to learn. Upper management is unapproachable."
good,"As a driver, it is best to be delivering parts outside of the store. This is great when it is busy and you are in and out to repair shops. However you are expected to restock pallets of new inventory twice a week which can become very tedious and strenuous on your back. You learn most of the skills needed on the job although a few mandatory trainings are required in the beginning. I really enjoy the people I work with and did not expect the relationships that I found.. Hardest part of the job is being stuck inside endlessly stocking oil or bulk parts and making no delivery runs. Best part of the job is being in a truck on the go or making small talk with the commercial customers who buy from you constantly."
good,its not a bad place its too many rules but i had fun and it very pleasant to work there
good,"Unless you can get into management, there is no fiscal reward. At least at my location, the GM is great and the atmosphere is light. Customers can be difficult, but that is typical in retail. The best part of the job (if you are a car person) is some of the classics and exotics you get to see. Definitely cool."
good,open close nothing special learned nothing special. most enjoyable part of this job was the customers
good,I worked here part time for a few month it was a descent job not much to say about it.
good,"A typical day at Advance includes many meetings and a lot of interaction with other team members.  The team members work well together."
good,advance is a growing business in the automotive parts retail industry. When working in the store it is fast paced and a busy enviroment. Customers come first and the operations are done between customers. Usually there is a small staff of between 9 to 20 emoployees per store depending on sales. advance is a very demanding enviroment.
good,Solving customer problems. Working as a team member. Having the opportunity to help people.
good,"Because of working with Advance Auto Parts, I have learned how to deal with multiple different types of customers, and how to manage a fast pace work environment. I have grown extremely close with my fellow employees, that I would consider them family."
good,"A typical day at the distribution center was constant moving and manual labor, which is something that I enjoyed.  However, management was not up to par.  There were a lot of mistakes made daily, that was not corrected until a later time, leading management to believe that the person who was on the clock actually committed the mistake.  The training could have been better as well.  I was not fully trained, but at one point during my time at the distribution center, I had to train someone who came in maybe a week after I did."
good,"Can get kind of demanding in the summer months because of greater volume of customers, but I loved it."
good,"* Inbound calls"
good,"Overall, Advance Auto Parts is a good place to work. Though if you are new to the automotive industry, there are many things one has to learn about it. One is capable of learning, though all types of customers, questions, and problems arise and sometimes there is not enough help to get everything done the way it should be. There needs to be more associates working in the store. Other than that, Advance Auto Parts sells well and is a good store to shop and work for."
good,learned mechanical skills enjoyed the opportunity to help people fast paced retail environment
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers get the right parts, delivering auto parts to our  customers, inventory management. I learn something new everyday in the work place and when i'am delivering. I have been trained to do my morning paper work, manage our inventory and back-stock, and count down registers. My co-workers get along with me, I'm a nice and hard worker. I can't really think of any part of my job that's too hard for me."
good,staffs are friendly there are a few who are not but other than that its ok
good,regular day learn something new everyday.  the managers are helpful with any questions I ask. my co workers are good example.hardest part of the job is when customers are not satisfied with the results.when customers leave the store happy and satisfied.
good,"•	Learned leadership and how to organize a team."
good,A wonderful place to start a career in retail automotive.  Being new to the industry you'll have a wonderful training experience to get profound knowledge in the business.
good,"A Typical day at advance is normally 12 hours and consists of constant repetitive work. At Advance I learned to receive products into the warehouse, correct lifting procedures,  and how to operate heavy lifting equipment. Management was not professional. The work environment was a great experience also, it taught me the importance of teamwork. Hardest part about working for this company was working in production when there were millions of company mistakes made all of the time which hinders your yearly performance report"
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years and had very little bad to say. I  always had help from the area manager and if things ever needed taken care of, I never had problems working one on one with anyone."
good,Sales driven company. Never a dull moment. The customers and employees keep it interesting.
good,decent company would not even give me an offer when i was offered a better on by autozone so they are cheap.
good,"A typical day includes starting out with stretches, then handling the product and receiving it, shipping it, picking it, or putting it away depending on what department you work in. "
good,"Enjoyable job. A bit low paced, but customer interactions were very fun."
good,"Love my co-workers, don't like the company. No raises, no praises. just make the company more money. I was a closing manager, but gave up the responsibility after three years at the same pay rate."
good,stressful work environment and not much pay. Little chance for advancement
good,i management in this company were better employees would be more satisfied with the job
good,A typical work day was just getting the store ready. I've learned alot about care and how they work and was able to pass that along the public.
good,great overall cast of people that performed tasks in a timely manner
good,The user base is great along with upper management.  The pay is good too.
good,"Flexible hours, cool people to work with.  Really depends on store management though."
good,staff is good but minor tweaks would make this a soild career for anyone interested in automotive feild however pay scale is lacking alot.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening and closing store duties, handling shipments (both in and out) and providing outstanding customer service. As part of management, I did my best to always look out for my team to insure that everything went smooth and to keep up on morale. I had an excellent group of professionals that I was able to have fun with through-out the day while producing results for the store. I enjoyed not only being part of a team within the location, but also a part as the community."
good,I learned a lot about inventory contol and using hand held scanners. Management was pretty good and my co workers were okay
good,Was a great work environment but the pay and benefits are not so great. Hours allotted to store are not consistent either.
good,Fun taking care of customers and building relationships with them.
good,I started as a assistant manager for Advance and worked my way up to become a General store manager. They gave me a good start but did not value me as an employee. The company cares less about their employees and more about the bottom line. If you are single and don't have much a life outside of work this company maybe right for you.
good,"You get to work with and also help lots of people, people that you may not get to encounter in your every day activity. people from all walks of life."
good,"A typical day at work cashing out many customers."
good,"A typial day would be fast paced and hectic as orders come in and you are trying to deliver them in a timely manner. I have learned that you must maintain safety first and farmost. The orders mean nothing if you are not safe on the road.Sometimes, I don't think Management gets it. If you have only one driver working you can only deliver so many orders in a timely manner. You can't make promises that you can't keep. Co-workers are great, trying to share the load as best they can. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is listening to the complaints of the shop owners when order and supllies and parts are not delivered in a timely manner. The most satisfying part of the job is satisfaction of the shop owners in the job that you have done and understanding what you might be up against."
good,Handle customer transactions handle large amounts of cash
good,Receive product from trucks and put them in locations in the warehouse. I learned how to operate many types of forklifts and the different departments. Management was good. Co workers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was unloading trucks that were floor stacked and not palletized. I enjoyed the people and my position.
good,"Open and closeing duties , Work with team members and public and make sure everything ran smooth. Deposits and bank run."
good,"Advanced Auto parts is a good company to work for. However, with having a family, the work schedule took away from my family."
good,advance is good people like to lead about cars. hours good work on weekend.
good,"My co-workers are friendly, I meet all kinds of different people  everyday."
good,"I worked here for a short time, then got laid off and they told me and a few others not to come back because they didn't need us."
good,working for advance was pretty fun there its different problems all the time many people comes and they don't even know what they looking for so it was a pretty good feeling telling them what was wrong and specially coming from a female.
good,"Advance is not the place you want to stay at for very long, the long hours of being a sales manager will take a toll on your personal life and i'm not to sure that the experience garnered by being in a managerial role is truly worth all the time spent away from family and the ridiculously low wages they expect you to survive on."
good,Advanced auto is ok  but the job is more favorable to someone who likes auto mechanics.
good,Good values but not so good in salary increses and upper management support
good,"Customers/associate bond is evident here."
good,Advance wants to be a big fish in the automotive parts business but they lack the staffing and labor support to compete with NAPA and Autozone. 
good,"Very easy, but steady work. I learned to cycle count, do inventory, and use RF Units. "
good,"A typical day at work is usually a busy one getting orders, pulling parts, answering phones or helping customers. More importantly getting the products to the customers delivery driving. I love being outside on the road. Learned new routes and got to meet future customers."
good,Me being a female in a male dominate career was a little hard because customers would seek above me and or wouldn't talk to me. L
good,Advance Auto Parts was a great company. It was hard for being being a female to advance within the company. I started off as a commercial driver with no experience on the computer and taught myself in order to advance. I learned a lot by being hands on and taking the opportunity to learn new things by reading. I loved being able to interact with the customers and earning the respect of not only coworkers but customers as well.
good,"Schedules were a bit hectic with often having 10-13 hour shifts when reaching management yet struggling for hours when in associate status. Fast advancement is possible for this company, note: the extra mile will be noticed. Co-workers are easy to get along with, yet do not often stay professional when professionalism is most critical. Management at the district level is somewhat disorganized and does not communicate well with the store level. Work is fast-paced at most stores so be ready to work hard when the time comes however there is downtime on most days once tasks are completed. Enjoyed the communication with customers and most are quite pleasant to interact with, not so say there was not the occasional unhappy customer but it comes with the retail side of the business.  "
good,"Fun learning environment to help understand the importance of vehicle parts. Management is just like any other job though, if you can take a lot of pressure."
good,"I learn how to do team work and also do inventory."
good,"The local people one works with most of the time become very close, tight knit little community. Upper management changed too often for any real job security or advancement."
good,"Typical day of work would be busy, but it was nice to have good conversations about products and their cars. Management wasnt the best but with good employees we got the job done. Best part of the job was management was never over your back while working."
good,"Opening up and closing the store in a prompt amount of time."
good,Is a highly active job environment from a mental point to a physical as well. 
good,"a lot of heavy lifting."
good,Overall good company to work for.  We had to fill orders that were going to the stores. Everyone tried to meet their quota for the day.  At times it was harder than others.
good,"Learned a lot about car parts, putting away truck stock was sometimes difficult because I did most of it myself. The best part of my day was making my deliveries and making my customers happy."
good,"Selling auto parting, Looking up auto parts, Restocking auto parts, Testing used auto parts"
good,I keep pretty busy here there are plenty of things to do wether its filling or putaway. Alot of make your own decisions and judgements on how to do things more effencently.
good,Plano grams and forklift operations
good,A typical day at work is selling auto parts to customers. Making sure the store is clean and that the shelves are fully stocked. I like my co-workers and management.
good,My reason for leaving is because I moved. But it was a overall good experience.
good,Very strenuous job fast paced and able to think on your toes. I was in charge of the safe and the cash drawers as well as closing the store. The hardest part of the job would have to be remembering all the steps involved on the computer in order to get specific things accomplished in any customer's case.The co-workers were good they all know what their doing. The most enjoyable part of the day would be the smile and hand shake you get from a customer because their day is complete and worry free due to my help.
good,I enjoyed working here. My co workers were hard working and made the job fun.
good,being that I am a keyholder I play a little bigger role than normal. I am in charge or open and closing cash registers as well as opening and closing paper work. I deal with customers on a daily basis. I am also involved in doing planograms throught out the week or whenever needing done.
good,"It was okay. My co-workers were great. The upper management did not know how to give straight answers. This was probably the hardest part of the job. I really liked helping the customers find the thing they need for their cars,"
good,Learn a lot about cars every day
good,"A typical work day involved taking orders from commercial customers, delivering parts, helping walk-in customers. Advance Auto's parts look up system, inventory system, effective retail displays. Management, in general, were poor communicators and not good personnel managers. I had five store manages in one year. Co-workers were team players. The hardest parts of my job were adapting to constant managerial changes and standing on concrete floors for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers."
good,Fast-paced high energy work day. Learned a great deal about inventory management/ logistics. Good people to work with.
good,"Assisting customers, working on a team of well diveresed individuals is very rewarding."
good,Everything is pretty good about working here. The only issue I had was when scheduling became a lot more micromanaged.
good,Every day was a challenge because you have to meet a Standard Point system every day
good,Enjoyed my position in every way possible. Only left to persue Firestone.
good,Kept busy assisting customers in need. Made sure all items in the store were fronted and kept up to par.
good,Working for this company I learned more about cars and how to fix them myself instead of going to someone else.
good,"Advance Auto Parts, Oviedo FL"
good,"I had great co-workers, work stayed steady through out the day."
good,"Its a nice place to work, love the co-workers that are very nice people.."
good,"For my first job in this industry, it is a great setting to learn it."
good,"While I enjoyed working for this company, I wouldn't suggest that someone who is seeking a career seek employment with this company. As with any retail situation, you will not earn enough money to live on."
good,Fun and educational learning how vehicles are put together and what different parts do different things.
good,"Job was great, but held the wrong people responsible for store robbery even though they were off"
good,"The corporation has changed over the past several years. They are trying to get more in line with one particular competitor instead of making their own way and doing it better. Recently, every task has become micromanaged. Love working with my co workers as I hired most of them myself. Enjoyed the job, except for one bad employee."
good,"On a regular day of work I would set shelves and then stock the product on the shelves. Got to travel to different parts of the country. You work one week and off one week, good people to work with. Doing this job I learn how to manage time because we had to be finish with the process in 8 days to be ready for the grand opening."
good,"alot of work not enough time company is really demanding of its employees and really doesn't want to pay for really qualified employees, and no overtime ever"
good,Customer service was a big plus when walking in the door and made sure the customers were happy when leaving the store. Hardest part of the job was having to alot in one day when others would do nothing which a big turn off for me especially when management knew about it.
good,Really AAP isn't too bad of a place to work- I think it really just depends on the district management above you.
good,The delivery of auto parts to local auto parts down a very busy part of town
good,"daily paperwork, waiting on customer, deliver parts to commercial clients, install batteries, wiper blades when needed, work freight, maintain time management"
good,"Co-workers are great to work with, pretty easy going no how to have a little fun and no when to be serious. Can be a little fustrating at times but what job isn't."
good,"picking orders with RF scanner in a fast pace warehouse.I learned the ins and outs of there warehouse ,not just picking ,shipping, packing ."
good,A store that always was busy always had something to do.
good,cool company. more options are always good to have. avg work.
good,Sit in a cubicle in front of a computer all day.
good,"A typical day at work was arriving to work at 8 am every morning and looking for orders that needed to be taken out to shops first thing. I learned not to let others comments get to me, therefore I didn't ever have a problem with my co-workers or management. The hardest part of the job was trying to get parts out in a timely manner and the most enjoyable part was getting to deal with people every day!"
good,"Deliver parts to commerical accounts, promote sales for the month or week. Stock shelves and inventory goods."
good,1. Typical work day
good,pretty laid back atmospere.great if you like solving car related issues and if your good with customer service
good,I can not give an accurate review of Advanced Auto part because it has been 12 years since I worked there. I'm sure a lot has changed. Overall I had a positive experience there. It was a good place to work during High School and college.
good,A typical day at work:making invetory right for the store needs.Learned a lot of new ways to work safe learned more about computers.Managment was helpfull at all times we needed.Co-workers great and very help full.The hardist part of working there is you have good math skills and memorry and I do.The best part of the job was pay day.
good,"Advance Auto parts is a ""Big Picture"" kind of company. Because of it's size the individuality of the stores is no longer a concern. Standardization and business by the numbers is the norm. During my tome with Advance Auto Parts the Stephens City store had four general managers."
good,They need to hire more employees with a vast knowledge in the automotive field. Customers were unhappy having to return parts due to lack of knowledge on the employees part. Needs managers who have management abilities.
good,Enjoyed the management opportunity and learning about the business.
good,Its an okay place to work. Would prefer more hours. But the people are freindly.
good,"Typical day at work was very stressful. Workload was more than one person could do comfortably. Management was different depending on what level within the department. Upper management was very culture oriented, lower management was driven and work environment was extremely pressured. Hardest part of the job was no coaching, only embarrassment by which they assumed inspired motivation. There were good times as the company as a whole worked with different charities and had internal promotions that were fun."
good,"Mismanaged, unprofessional work environment. Employees are not fairly compensated for their efforts."
good,Typical day at work was delivering car parts to shops. Learned the various aspects of the auto industry. Management could improve. Co-workers were helpful and friendly. The most enjoyable part was getting to help others.
good,Good place to work as a part time or full time employee. Managment does a good job being fair to everyone. Provides training to better understand customers needs and what your selling them.
good,"Had many new changes"
good,"Being with the company for 7 years I worked with a lot of people in all positions, the overall quality of the job really depended on who the general manager and district manager was at the time and how corrupt they were."
good,"I loved working there and enjoyed the people I worked with.  Some of the managers treat people better than others, but overall I don't regret working for Advance Auto Parts."
good,"Real awesome place to work at. It’s just they didn’t pay enough for the responsibilities I have. I wish I would have stayed there. Job easy, u can learn everything"
good,"Most of the people working there were great, nice job for someone looking for something simple........................................................"
good,"After working here for a long time I have finally realized they do not care one bit about the employees. The one and only thing they care about is the profit margin/stock price. "
good,"Moderate satisfaction for the period of employment ."
good,"It was fun working for the company itself. Co workers and upper management, not so much. Constructive criticism is one thing, but belittling employees to the point of crying, is a no no."
good,"Energetic, creative, can be slow and steady then change to fast and crazy ."
good,"The money is good if you get on night shift, the only downfall is the management sucks. Its a fast pace work environment, they will push you till you meet ""their goals"". Be prepared to work a lot of overtime!"
good,It is your standard retail job. Just have some knowledge of vehicles. Had some good management at my store. But watch out for sales. Your numbers matter to home office.
good,"Mechanics come and ask for part so knowledge on different parts are required. Basics is very helpful in order to help out the customers. Making sure that giving the right part is critical before selling , matching up part number with the number on the computer is also critical."
good,I like advance but the pay and employee appreciation needs improving. The people are great and the learning experience is better. But that doesn’t change the fact that I can get a better discount as a customer than an employee
good,"Not fast paced but low pay , like most retail jobs there are only a few key positions that will ever get a decent wage. Nit a bad entry level job but wages not high enough to live on."
good,"Not bad for part time gig especially if you are a people person and like to drive a lot. Store employees were great. Corporate on the other hand, not so much."
good,I liked this job because you learned skills and always had something to do. The job always changes and you have different avenues inside the store such as being a delivery driver or inventory stock. You develop regulars that always need car parts and it is nice to be able to help people with their automotive needs because vehicles are one of the main stresses people face.
good,I feel bad for the GM's it is really hard for them to do the job with constant stress of stupid stuff.  They are literally working so hard for their own bosses vacation yet themselves get really nowhere.  Having to deal with the constant stress of job security and DM's down their throat from an guy who is in a DM position but only know business but not actually parts or has been in the field before.  They expect way to much.  Almost kind of like they the head master and you the head slave. I could go on and on about this and what goes on but honestly I had not saw change while I was there and from the people I know that are still there its even worse which i didn't know was possible.  They make people hate their jobs.  I don't know if anyone will take the time to read this but this was honestly the most easiest thing to type all day.
good,"The days were busy for the most part filling orders,and attending to customers.I enjoyed dilivering the parts and conversation get with some of the customers who had commercial accounts with us."
good,This was a great place filled with great people. The pay was not so bad but could have been better the managers were also nice & fair about any situation
good,"pulling parts, taking orders, running cashier if your a counter person. You learn a lot about different auto products. management is terrific, he is firm and reasonable, and i like him as a boss. working with the other employees is great we all get along and help each other. Dealing with customers can be difficult at times and watching for thieves. the people i work with is the most enjoyable."
good,"Selling parts, I've learned a lot about cars, management could use some help, work culture is good, the hardest part of the job is getting customers to sign up for speed perks, and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people."
good,I liked working for this company but the pay rate was not enough to pay for a living. The Managers were good managers easy to get along with and are willing to train employees right.
good,A decent company geared towards towards customer service. The computer system is fairly easy to use and parts are generally easy to find. Training is limited and use a reevaluation.
good,Working for Advance Auto Parts was alright. Work schedule wasn’t too flexible. They are semi family oriented. Management was great before change. Overall a decent company to work for.
good,The company's advancement levels are greater than any company I've been in. I started out as a Team manager and was promoted within a matter of months.
good,"Typical day consists of emailing reports to DM, opening store, pulling orders. Conference calls, meetings almost every week, sales calls 5-10 per week. "
good,ive been doing it part time for 8 years and its ok. you cant live off of a full time pay check alone form advance. its fun and the discounts on parts is the only thing keeping me there.
good,typically some days are really slow and some days are really fast paced. they dont pay alot so dont think youll live good from this company. they dont have many benefits either.
good,Easiest job I have ever had. Have to deal with different kinds of people (personalities). Started the job and was promised starting pay of $9.25. Did not receive that pay until 3 months of working. I then became a key holder and was promised a $.75 raise and after 2-1/2 months still have not received it yet. Poor upper management.
good,"Relaxed place to work. Spend your day selling, stocking and talking car parts. Get a cool car that comes in from time to time and deal with all different types of individuals from day to day."
good,"As a driver, I mostly just delivered to the garages. If I didn't have any deliveries, I helped cashier, stock shelves and clean the store. Not bad, but what I really loved was everyone got along. My managers were awesome and we cracked jokes all day. A few months later, some bad stuff started to go down and it ripped a hole in the place. Upper management completely mishandled the situation and employees started quitting left and right. The atmosphere completely changed. Things were tense and hostile all the time. I still had the garages on my route that were great to deliver to, but everything back at home base was falling completely apart. Then, the tires on the company truck went bad, winter was just around the corner and a bad country song began to play in the back of my head, so... I GTFO. "
good,"the company need more people to close at night other than 2 employee's, it's not safe sometimes. I enjoyed meeting and helping people about their problem and learning info from other people."
good,I enjoyed working part time for company years ago. I came back to work full time and now that company is a corporation its gone downhill. Part quality is down and stocking levels are down. No shifts per say. You work what you are told to work. Sales quotas made the job stressful.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts is a fun and knowledgeable work place. I have learned a lot of things about auto and mechanical parts of cars. Before, working at Advance Auto Parts, I had no knowledge of auto parts. But, with great training and working with other knowledgeable coworkers. I've gotten a better understanding of auto parts. Which helped me be productive in assisting our customers."
good,"They don't have enough hours for me to stay working their. I enjoy working with the people. Stocking was one of the things I like to do. I've learned a lot about different parts of cars, and how parts work."
good,Great Place to work relaxed.
good,This company as a whole didn't pay enough. Communication could have also been better between management and non-management employees. Other than that it is an okay company.
good,"My role was to sale and cross sale merchandise, maintaining the store’s appearance, and assist in the process of making work schedules. I provided great customer service and received reconnection on many occasions for it. I held a key holder (Assistant Manager) position for three of my years with Advance Auto Parts."
good,I have enjoyed my time at the advance corporate office but they have some improvements that could be made. Overall the place is fine and the team members make a community but  we feel undervalued some times. Ask for a lot without much direction or feedback.
good,"The job it self can be pretty nice sometimes and calm, but you can be fired for just having a commercial account not liking you. The pay is going to be the bare minimum they can offer you. You'll never be recognized if your surpass your sales goal, but you'll be constantly reminded when your not. baggers at walmart make more than me and im a closing manager."
good,"nice  work environment,good communication with coworkers,a lot of ways and chances to learn more about advance auto.It is a fast pace work environment."
good,"There greedy they don't really care about the employee how long they've been there or what they know they won't compensate, They don't supply the parts to the stores like they should there short on parts all the time.For what they expect there employees to know and do is embarrassing that Wal Mart and Mac Donald's pay better."
good,"i deliver parts and talked to and helped out in the store and a sales person did stock like every one else did restocked everyday took class,s every day well test everyday open and closed the store cleaned did things to customers cars every day that is about it.Did runs put  gas in the cars and in the Van and took money to the Bank all kinds of things cause i was hired to be a driver and do sale as well.plus taking phone orders plus making orders as well its all in the job so its really past as i will say but not to hard as after you learn there system on how to look things up but all of the worker was very nice and very helpful to me i just more and needed more and sat hours wish is what i am use to,"
good,It is a very dirty warehouse and the put away is unorganized some of the people are friendly no room for advancement lunches went from 1 hr to 30 minutes
good,It is a great place to work but the wage is not very competitive. Sometimes its really fast paced other times it is slow like any other business. The manager is a good and fair person to work for.
good,"Punctuality is a big boost, mutually collaborated with others workers to keep things going smoothly. Delivered Auto Parts from the hub to various  smaller stores around Houston area, registered sales order, staged shelves using pallet jacks. Highly managed by trained personnel, quality assurance, effective work motivation."
good,"A typical day for the retail salesperson is selling auto parts and providing free services to customers which include OBD II scans and battery testing and/or replacement. Coworkers in my experience were helpful however management changed several times. As a part-time worker for them, I can say that it was easy work while, at the same time, it was aggravating when I consider the mediocre wage I was working at."
good,"It’s was alright lots of issues within the store,employees stealing a lot of favoritism and attitudes.We didn’t have a team it seemed like people were trying to work together"
good,under paid and mistreated and also expected to do things like a managers job or a other management job and not properly trained for your task or duties
good,"excellent team culture. learned an awful lot about car parts. Most enjoyable part of this job, seeing a customer content that their vehicle is working well."
good,"Sell parts,help customers,be a team player!  The hardest most challenging part is helping solve problems when the customers needs direction on everything. The best part is solving the problems and helping people."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts with a heavy flow of product. I have learned that everyday is different and things don't happen as you seem.Managent there is fair. I will say they show no favoritism. I am very humble and happy for the opportuiies that they have presented me with. The workplace culture is ok, if I could change one thing about it it would be the attitude in the atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job is the end of the night. Just watching my team work as a team to get the job done excites me and I love it. The hardest part of m job is dealing with the different attitudes."
good,"The current working environment is ever-evolving, with directors, executives, and upper-management turnover high.  A good place to start a career, though"
good,The hardest part about this job is sometimes you and someone else is the only ones in the store . It can be stressful when the phones are ringing and you are the only one in the store . due to the other person is outside doing something
good,"Great place to work from when i started as a part timer, and moved my way up the management chain. There were things to get used to as they were many changes happening at once, but overall a place of work where you can see yourself grow."
good,"I do not wish to write a review about my opinions or experiences at Advance Auto. I do not want to opinionate on my work day, or what I've learned. I had an amazing manager and a great workplace culture."
good,"Started working for this company & absolutely loved it, but when I transferred to the Michigan St. store in Orlando everything changed. I didn't feel at hoe at this store, and things really just went down hill."
good,A day working at Advance can be stressful and fast paced if you loose track of orders and customers or don't receive orders on time. Team work is the key to success in this environment as long as you take care of the customer with service they will come back. I've learned that management at times will tend not to help out as much due to competitive stores. Favorite part of working there is the great benefits that the company offers you. great programs and discounts. The hardest part is dealing with an unhappy customer that was treated differently at another store.
good,busy most of time to take care of customers best you possibly can managers help out to do what they can to make work day go according to daily plans very fast paste environment getting parts to customers quickly as you can getting to work with co workers and customers
good,a typical day at work was helping customers with their vehicle solutions and their needs of automotive parts and their vehicle testing of starters and electrical parts of testing.  I learned how hard their doing inventory parts were to get done on a daily basis.  I learned how difficult stepping up into management was and I was always of learning how difficult being in management was in this company. the hardest part was always trying to do inventory adjustments were to be done.   the most enjoyable part of the job was the prior service knowledge of parts and automotive parts sales prior to coming to work for the company.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know and become a ""family"" with the team members. The worst part of the job was going in and not being aware that you would be working overtime that day. Sometimes you wouldn't be told until 10 minutes before the end of your shift."
good,Advance Auto really only cares about one thing and that is the end of day number. This would be fine but the company does a really poor job of providing the needed support at the store level. This makes your daily tasks and sales extremely frustrating. However the store manager bends over backwards doing whatever he can in his power to make the day for the employees and the store.
good,"Overall this company is pretty good to work for, however there are some upward mobility and pay scale issues to deal with."
good,"started out good, ended bad. I would open and clsoe the store because i was a manager for three years. The company turned on me so now  i am seeking elsewhere"
good,Not a terrible place to work just not my kind of job. Atmosphere was good and positive. Everyone got along pretty well. Only complaint is that no one knew when the shift would end.
good,A good place to start to see if this is the field you want to be in. The wages are not the best for the industry and it takes a lot for them to give a raise.
good,"Typical day on the back line is making orders as they come across the screen, it is expected that the orders are completed in full within five minuets. Simple food prep and cleaning tasks. On the front is taking walkin customers orders and drive through, taking orders to customers, and cleaning tasks."
good,Good company overall to work for. Company is changing to meet the new challenges from competitors. Management is open to listening to ideas. Advancement is limited at higher levels.
good,"I would not go to work here if you are trying to balance a family and make decent money.  Shifts change from open to close, from week to week.  If you are in a position to make a bonus, you will be fighting it out with the other team members for sales and one or two down days will ruin your chance of making your sales per hour.  Lower pay for part time employees makes for less competent coworkers which creates for more stress for the typically one other associate.  Computers are out dated and clunky to work with, also not tied to most vendors making parts acquisition a nightmare."
good,"wasn't a bad place to work just starting out, but there wasn't much of a future for the things that i had planned. its definitely meant for younger people."
good,Not a bad company. As with all big retail business there is never enough payroll to have the people you need. Upper management is not the best and dose not listen to store level management. But overall a pretty good company but managers work a LOT of long hours!!
good,"The company as a whole is a great company, but as in some employee's, every company has their few. Fast paced. Hands on. Hardest part of the day would have been doing cycle counts."
good,"i like my job i love hands on jobs, but this is a company that has merge with another company and they are not sure of what they are doing. advance rewards certain people only so if a store does well they'll pick on commercial or counter person to rewards instead of splitting the reward with the whole store. They talk about team work a lot but they don't reward the whole team."
good,While it's a good place to work with good benefits. The work life balance part can be trying. Overtime is usually a regular thing and cut into your family time. If you can hand that then this job may be for you.
good,"Working day to day at Advanced Auto Parts isn't bad whatsoever. The people are great, its a safe working environment. The days go by fast and its never really too stressful."
good,"My managers were always fantastic, however most of my coworkers were the type who refused to work, meaning that a lot of the work fell on those of us that were. Corporate's policies were illogical and inefficient."
good,I really enjoyed this company it was something new and different for me. But I surely enjoyed the challenges I was faced with on the day to day bases
good,General warehouse worker in the receivin department be prepared to work lots of overtime our department could never keep anyone because of the over time an company standards.
good,Great place to work and Management as well as co workers are very supportive and helpful. It's a great team effort throughout the company and a great job.
good,I learned a lot from the managers of this store. They seem to have a high turnover of G.M. positions. High stress in G.M. positions.
good,Like most retail is helps if you ate into what you are selling. Love cars and lobe to work on them.  Great job but benfits arr bad and pay is as well.
good,"I worked here for about a year, as a parts pro lead so basically I drove deliveries to our commercial accounts. I loved this job, and if a restructuring wouldn't have happened I probably would've retired from it. You gain SO much knowledge on vehicles and I'm female so that is always useful. The mechanics I dealt with felt like fathers to me, so kind and none of them gross or weird, perfect gentlemen. I loved working with my bosses, although they did seem to be treated poorly by higher ups, and all the employees were friendly and so helpful. My hours were great! Full-time, great benefits, 8-5 monday through friday. It was so nice. Unfortunately the position I once held no longer exists. I was also involved in an accident while driving a company car, and even though it wasn't my fault and the other driver was sited, they were very caring, and wanted to give me every opportunity to take time to heal and made my job easier so I could still get paid, but was comfortable in doing so. Loved this place. I would reccommend it to anyone."
good,"Everyday we come in we have a production rate to reach as a team. As an individual I have a productivity rate to reach daily and weekly. I loved the people I worked with, it was a good environment and I enjoyed it. Management was fair majority of the time I can honestly say I have never had a problem with management. The hardest part about the job to me was learning how to clerk for receiving. The reason is there were so many different things you had to do, but much practice and in do time it began to become understandable."
good,I love selling auto parts  and working with my co workers and serving the public. This job has many advancements for its employees . There are also many tools there to educate you on better knowing your products
good,overall its not a bad job to get when you're in school. great way to learn about car parts whilst making a few bucks. manager was a bit of a pushover which made work a pain on occasion
good,"Not much to say, it was a job. Some of the employers were fun to work with, others were lazy but entertaining, and management was not the greatest but not the worst either."
good,"Pay and corporate structure offers virtually no opportunities for advancement. Also has physical demands, but the corporation has no incentive to join a fitness club."
good,everyday at work i learn something new in the parts field. Or I'm helping someone in need with there vehicle................
good,Everyday working at advance was great experience in a fast pace production warehouse. Easy work but time consuming with good pay
good,"Very active all day"
good,The job is fast paced. You will learn more about vehicles and parts then you did before. There is room for advancement if you buy in and learn parts and the systems.
good,"Not a bad place to work, only cons are the meager pay and lack of Advance-ment opportunities."
good,"long days of none stop counting,was not a lot of cross training done to learn new things,not a lot of team work done and was not enough hours given during one week to the next"
good,I was able to learn accountability and responsibility for the work that I did. The team building made all the work that had to be done very enjoyable and you always looked forward to come to work
good,Good managers but they changed they comp program and it almost impossible to make a decent living now but they state they are changing it
good,"A typical day included the closing of the store. Closing duties were the closing of the store, counting of the safe and register and preparing the bank deposit for the next day"
good,"I enjoyed this job less and less as I moved up in the company.  Higher management is clueless to how a store should be ran. Workload for management will cause instand burnout.  I would never reccomend becoming a store manager for this company, but it is a great part time job."
good,Some good people work here but management is stuck in old processes. Need to upgrade systems to better today's aggressive retail commerce world.
good,"Your quality of life as an Advance employee at the store level will depend almost exclusively on your store manager, the self discipline and motivation of your coworkers, and the willingness of your customers to listen to proven information, and to answer basic qualifying questions that allow you to help them."
good,"The pay nor the benefits weren't great but if you need some extra cash or discounts on auto parts, this is a good place to work."
good,I would recommend Advance Auto to anyone who is single or with no young kids.  Work life balance is not there.  The upper management seems to not think twice about asking you to do a 6 day work week
good,"It has its ups and downs at Advance, and typically goes by fast. I furthered my education on vehicles through this job and gain a bunch  friends to start my own little network in the automotive field. Management has change several times but no one has been really difficult to work for. The hardest part about this job is dealing with constant call offs. the best is its employee benefits."
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of me taking the deposite to the bank, reviewing paper work, checking sales from the night before and speaking with my team about their goals and pervious sales. I learned alot about cars and car parts thru traning videos we had to watch. As far as my mangerment team goes. I had a few that were very good leaders and some that I had to lead. The hardest part of my job would be when they would train us to handle things one way and they would do the opposite. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers. And of course seeing my co-workers. We were  like a family away from home."
good,great to work for fast paced work environment with room for advancement. keeping a clean store helping customers and exchanging goods for money keeping great customer service skills
good,"I have worked at AAP for about 3 years and have enjoyed it for the most part.  In my 3 year career here I have worked at 2 different locations and found that, at each of them, the people are great. Management is a complete hit or miss, I wouldn't base much off the slander of management, I've experienced every kind and found that the bad ones can be completely ignored, shut them out do your job and they will most likely be gone before you are...I've experienced this a few times.  IF YOU want advance within this company you can do it very quickly, although at all levels of management at the store level pay horrifically in my opinion...to make a decent income you have to reach the district manager level. THIS JOB WILL REPEAT ITSELF, sometimes it's a good thing but for me it was terribly monotonous the only reason I have stayed with this company is because I receive a very good wage for my position, the work is not hard and it has been a part time college job.  FAIR WARNING: if you cannot deal with incompetent people who believe they deserve everything on gods green earth and think they have been cursed with higher intelligence (which is the exact opposite of the truth) the by all means do not take this job, unless you would like to put your patience through possibly the best test on the planet."
good,"I handled many different situations, but dealing with rude customers was the most.  I had to help with complaints of staff and customers. Some of my  co workers were hard working but some were not."
good,looking up parts and learning several techniques for repairing vehicles from customers meet a lot of really nice people hours could be better manage by workers knowing when they have to work steadied rather then to change every week
good,"It started out as a good work environment but soon started to slip to a hassle to go to work. The manager would fire an employee at a drop of the hat for any indiscretion. They seems more focused on hiring someone off the street, as opposed to keeping talent. I finally had to leave, as I did not agree with the focus the managers had."
good,"Loved my job."
good,"Good hard working environment. Very fast paced and plenty of room to learn/grow. Management is very approachable and open to new ideas/technology. Benefit packages are not comparable to technology based companies; however, for the retail industry it is average at best. Slow to promotions, but eventually they are given. All-and-all the company has been good to work for."
good,Provide the accurate parts for customers and give excellent customer service. I also set up product displays and sale signs on the interior and exterior. Management didn't seem to help with the growth and learning process. My peers were never really clear on what their role was in their positions due to lack of communication from our store manager. The hardest part was getting a clear orders from managers. I did love helping the customers out with their vehicles because when they were happy with the outcome it made me feel good as well.
good,"Advance Auto Parts, Inc. is a strong corporation determined to be #1 in the auto parts field.  There is a strong ""team work"" ethic.  Everyone gets along well."
good,"A good company to work for"
good,"Some days where busier than others, had to deal with difficult customers."
good,"ok place to work. low pay at entry level. customer service is unpredictable, you never know what or who you will have to deal with. most people treat you like your an idiot and are very rude. i love cars and own a drag car so i loved being around other car people. i also have college experience involving auto body repair and automotive technology so i felt right at home. employes were great to work with but the we spent most of our time covering the managers lack of knowledge of cars because he literally had none. pay is low to start not much higher than minimum wage. poor benefits that are not even worth paying for. i would give it an overall 6 out of 10 based entirely off of the rude customers."
good,Although it is a laid back job and easy going for the most part. I find that there is little to no incentive offered to better yourself at your position. Have not received a raise despite being told how great of a job I am doing for them. Working hard and consistently to get hours cut.
good,Learned to stock product and use hand held RF unit .I worked with some great team members and managers in my 6 years . When our slow season came the hardest part was getting enough hours to complete a full shift.
good,Fun and get to meet and learn new things.  Upper management are snakes and will blame you for something that they do to not get in trouble.
good,"Most days very active, I learn how to test Batteries, starters, alternators, how to properly install them and how to be a great inventory analyst. As a manager I loved to work with my team members reaching company goals and have a great competitive attitude for company sales goals. The hardest part as a manager is when you need to cut hours or when you  need to write someone because they did something wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you reach your goals at the end of each week."
good,"Heavy lifting and being on your feet all day is the normal day. Working in the cold or hot or rain.You must answer the phone within 3 rings no matter what you are doing or face a write- up."
good,"I learned a lot about auto parts while working here. Could be fast paced, but overall easy job. The hours could be a little uncertain at times, but overall a good place to work."
good,A typical day at Advance Auto Parts consist of providing fast service to various customers where you get a chance to learn new and exciting things about cars and the parts that keep them going. The management would be great if there was more structure and most of the co-workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers who don't know exactly what  they need but expect for you to know but the enjoyment comes from the laughs and smiles on the faces of the customers that you do make happy on a day to day basis
good,Great experience working with the company. Flexible hours help people going to school. Learn many things from general mechanics to inventory management. Helps communication skills as well as customer service. Typical day is moderate pace of business depending on location. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part is installing battery or helping customers in hot weather. Most enjoyable part is learning many things.
good,went from inventory person to assistant manager taking care of 11 employees
good,Trying to get through the negativity of management. Saying who and I going to fire today just wants people to move on that's not how you run a company.
good,A good place for student to work. Good work environmental. Good pay for mechanics.
good,"Good job part time."
good,"advance is a fast paced work environment, have to be able to think on your feet and multi task, be able to deal with multi people at once, the management of advance is done from the top on down, with the store manager being in charge, the assistant store manager is second, the co workers are in general ok, but also are the hardest to manage with attitudes and thinking the world revolves around them, the most enjoyable part of my job is helping people figure out there problems and getting them the parts they need "
good,i work and go to school. i am a father and need the hours. they work great with students. i have no complains other than too much drama in the work place.
good,I have been in the warehouse field all my life its grt. But I went back to schol to finish my medical start a new career.
good,"assisting customers,i learn how too respect one another opinion.assistant managing an Advance Store was an adventure i'll just say that. the hardest part of the job is putting your all in it and not being apriciated. and the most enjoyable part about the job was the customers..."
good,"I am a solid employee, that works hard and have strong morals and beliefs in work ethic."
good,A good place to work where they promote advancement through learning.
good,"this job headled my scalp my customer service skills, great place to work"
good,"Productive, but not such a fun place to work. Dust level is very high."
good,"Temporary Job, Not good administrative person, the company is ok"
good,"Arriving at 6:30am to usually a packed parking lot, with several customers needing help with their cars. In a typical work day you may help upwards of 40 people. In order to assess their needs you must actually go out to their car and discuss the problems, test batteries, look at tires, etc. You can learn so much in a short period of time, because it is hands on work. Everything you do, you will do on your own, and you will have to train yourself."
good,This was only a seasonal job but I enjoyed what I did. I worked in packing and shipping and loading trucks. Great staff to wor with and i can't say there was anything about the job I didn't enjoy.
good,"Advanced Auto Parts is a great place to work, if you are looking for retail experience. By working at Advanced Auto Parts, the retail experience you gain is 5 times more than any other place. There is so much for you to deal with, and once it becomes second nature other jobs are simple."
good,The store I worked in was enjoyable. The employees where great to work with until upper management (not in store management) was changed. They were able to work with my schedule. I enjoyed helping the customers.
good,Seasonal jobs get the hardest work so if you want to make it long term good you will need to put your time in before you get easy stuff unless your old or a wimpy girl.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. I learned so much and really met some amazing people, people that will come in and the staff will help you and guide you to become something great. There was a lot of joking and playing around which customers really enjoyed when they came in. It wasn’t some boring place where we want you to get your things and leave. We enjoyed if you stayed and had a conversation with us. Or we talk about who’s gonna be the next track champion"
good,Their was always something new to learn. I never knew what new problem a customer was going to have which made everyday a great chance to experience something new.
good,People want to come to work and do nothing.No one is held accountable for lack of productivity. New(transferred) General Manager is allowed to literally sit down behind the register All Day Ling
good,Learn a lot about automotive industry but earn the minimal pay. Management core is fairly solid but buddy system is definitely in effect with the manager hiring process.
good,Management within the company is great up through general store manager.  However the company does not give the store managers the freedom to compensate their workers as they see fit.  All wage increases must be approved by the district manager and corporate.  Stores are routinely understaffed as the company struggles to hold on to decent people due to poor compensation.  If you have the drive you can go fairly far within the company I became a keyholder after just working for Advance for two months.  My direct supervisor has only been with the company for 4 months longer than I have and is the second highest paid person within the store.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, gran trabajo en equipo mucha cooperacion entre companeros. la gerencia es bastante flexible pero exigente. fue una buena experiencia de trabajo"
good,it wouldve been better for me if advancement was available but it definitely gave me experience and knowledge to get further in the automotive industry.
good,"I want to work for an independent shop, I can handle anything, from accounting, to estimates, talking to customers. I just have a good knowledge on vehicles and what you need for any job"
good,"It was nice to help people, hours were bad, however the job was ridiculously easy, sometimes a rush would come providing the job to be busy, sometimes stressful, overall was an alright experience"
good,"If you want to get to learn about cars, customer service, and selling this is a perfect job for you. There will be times where no person will come in for hours at a time and there is time where it’s busy all day long."
good,"Being a driver for advance is simple, easy job. The hardest part for me was picking up  heavy objects. But other then that. It's an okay job. One thing I do not like is doing other people's job, while they get paid more then I do. They get all the credit.  Dont see it fair."
good,They can’t keep their best people. Seems like they have or have had the best person for the positions at one time or another and will not do what it takes to keep them happy. Someone else notices and eventually persuade them to leave a job they didn’t want to but don’t feel they should have to be compensated more or better people hired to work with them. It’s too bad because this is exactly what happens in all the stores in the area I’m in
good,I enjoyed the job but we were woefully understaffed which led to an undermotivated staff who did little to fulfill everyday tasks. The management busted their hump but it was very easy to be burnt out by the experience
good,"My particular store is very laid back but very busy. Inconsistant changes to the hub and its processes. I have never received the same pay as the last hub manager, though I have protested numerous times. Good people here, and thats why Ive stayed."
good,"Over all this is not a bad company, however the constant changes and micro managing in  and from middle management, very high turnover rates and constant understaffing can lead to a stressful work place."
good,"Management does nothing about the people that doesn't work. You have machine operators coming in at 6am and getting to work. Other machine operators come in at 7 and doesn't start to work until after 8. (Selection) If it wasn't for the lazy people it wouldn't be so bad!"
good,"I was a Mobile Parts Pro. A delivery driver for the commercial parts division. A typical day is picking orders for commercial customers and delivering the parts in a timely manner, safely."
good,"Overall its a good place to work. The management is nice also, when it comes to scheduling, but there is a chance to grow. It taught me many skills and made me a stronger"
good,I was part time but I worked at least 3 to 4 days through the weekdays but I worked almost every weekend. It got frustrating having to work every weekend and not being able to get a break and enjoy  Saturday or sunday off
good,I would help customers in finding the parts that they needed in order for customer to be able to repair their automobiles.  I would also stock shelves with merchandise every night.
good,"As a key-holder a lot is expected of you to  do throughout the day. Depending on the store you're located this can be extremely stressful or very relaxed and welcoming. Opening and closing are the simplest task you will have to do. Checking inventory, counting the safe, cash registers, and sometimes training new employees ."
good,"Having never worked in this field mostly dominated by males, it was obvious it is still that way. The company is a good place to work but can be challenging if you are not familiar with the auto parts industry."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a typical retail job with car parts in the mix. It's definitely a good part time job, the hours are flexible and it isn't too demanding."
good,"While I was there, I moved up 3 times.  I like to think that I utilized the skills I already possessed to advance, but they allowed me the chance.  The store had a laid back atmosphere and most of the people were knowledgeable and easy to work with."
good,I enjoyed working there but wasn’t able to advance even though I put in the work and effort. I wasn’t able to make ends meet with the income they offered and they don’t give raises often.
good,The Motoshop division had great potential to be one of the best technical side of Advance. However those who were running the division did not want to get on board with Advance Auto Parts .. so Advance closed the division and moved it where better managers could control operations ... I was sad to see it go.
good,General managers are given the opportunity to make their own decions to run the store. The job is not over tasked like jobs I have had in the past. They do not pay the sales associates enough in my opinion.
good,"The Job alone was easy, I had one of the Best managers in my District. She worked/works at the Getwell store in Memphis, TN. She was the main reason I stayed, Only reason i left was because I figured school would do me justice, since the company kept cutting my hours and not raising my pay."
good,"Great beginner job. You don't have to know anything about cars or parts to work there. Fast-paced, always on the move, customers range from DIY to commercial shops."
good,"a hard worker can advance quickly with some luck, but you won't advance at all with bad luck. management (low level and mid) was very good for me, but i have the very strong feeling that my store is the best run store in the region. the pay stinks until you make upper-low level management. working on the commercial side of things can be stressful as mechanics can be capricious and corporate appears to not take circumstance into account when dealing with complaints from commercial customers. "
good,Advance auto parts is a good place to work for part time or full if you have another source of income or high up in the company. Otherwise the pay is very low
good,"Salesperson at Advance is a pretty easy job. Business is much slower than your average store. However, the manager is most employees' biggest problem."
good,lack of support for the management no direction for the future. Long hour with no reconition to the growth of the people. Training for the new associates lacks
good,Not a bad place to work if your looking to not work or be stuck in fast food. You will meet lots of local auto parts shops owners that may open up other opportunities if you want to work with auto repairs or parts.
good,"Enjoyed learning about the auto retail and wholesale business.Was a challenge to learn over 50.000 parts and the various uses,as well as becoming familiar with Adavance auto parts training and computer catalog and ordering"
good,It was a very good job. very competitive have good benefits. I was comfortable with the pace I got to go a lot of places. It also has good  advancement to move up in rank. I would go back if I could.
good,this is a great opportunity for those seeking to supplement their income. do we really need to fill this segment with additional sentences? I don't think so.
good,"Commercial Parts Professional							"
good,They are laid back and easy to work for there are no one standing over you and everyone  one works together to get whatever the job is done in a timely matter
good,"Most auto parts stores are slow paced and the day is boring. Unless the customers that come in the stores make your day interesting by making conversation and constantly coming into your store to buy parts and inquire about something. That can be rare in some locations. My store manager at the fist location controlled her employees by yelling at them. The second locating I worked at "
good,"whether you are putting away stock or managing the sales counter, both are super chill. management was really laid back, almost too laid back sometimes. work culture was great because everyone shares the same automotive passion. hardest part was dealing with the inconsistent work schedule that was literally never the same each day of each week. enjoyable part was learning new things and giving successful advice on customers projects."
good,"i worked for advance on and off for about 7 years.  i worked for many different stores.  it is like any box store.  sales is their priority, period.  the benefits for full time employees are basic and you must pay for them.  store managers are under powered and payed way more than anyone else.  my experience shows that each store is ran different.  it all seems to depend on whether or not the district manager is any good at their job.  i have seen good and bad store and district managers.    in conclussion,  it's just a regular and basic job that should pay more for all the physical labor required and of course the headache of retail.  commercial was ok."
good,"Great company with a great plan, difficult location. Talent pool, industry competition.  The ability to share customer information from store to store and brand to brand is difficult"
good,When I first started with the company looked forward to going to work! Excellent work environment and friendly competition. Advance  had great customer service and very competitive prices. Advance decided to go public in order to expand its market. The company started to change. Goals for employees and store profits became out of reach do to increased competition. I feel advance could gain a huge portion of the automotive parts industry if they looked back and reviewed what got them there in the first place.
good,Great job culture but the market is slowing in this field.  Due to this advancement opportunity has become impaired.  This was the main reason that I opted for my current position at the time that it was offered.
good,Some co-workers are annoying but that's at every work place! Store manager is very cool and the job is not strenuous. Great benefits for full time employees.
good,I was at advanced for about 3 and a half years and it wasn’t bad at all I just felt that my worth to the company wasn’t shown I knew a lot about the job and didn’t feel like my job title didn’t reflect it.
good,The recruiters worked very hard to ensure their employees were happy in the positions they were placed in. They followed-up regularly with each employee to make sure things were going in the correct direction.
good,"The location where I was had people that made it somewhat difficult to work with.  Can't speak for Advance as a whole, but some people thought they were bigger than what they were, lets just put it at that."
good,Management affects the employees and workplace. Raises dont happen but once in a blue moon. Either you get paid hourly as a sales person or work 50+ hours a week salary. Insurance is pretty good though.
good,"I learned quite a lot at this job.  A typical day consisted of answering phones, running the register, delivering parts, and working on my relationships with businesses."
good,"Culture has become more important than the business."
good,Advance auto parts use to be an amazing place to work. They have grown to replicate the competitors too much and have lost touch with the most important thing that separated them from the competition: taking care of their people.
good,"Advance Auto DC gave me lots of opportunity to learn very important job skills. From operating RF scanners, forklift operation, inventory skills and lots more. All in all, Advance Auto helped me to perform to the best of my abilities."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work, Not great pay. I was able to set a schedule but they do change it sometimes. They are always looking for delivery drivers so if you have a valid drivers license and really need work you should definitely apply here!"
good,"As a manager you work long hours. The hardest part of the job is not given enough hours to have more than 5 or 6 employees at any given time, that is to include commercial and retail."
good,"Fairly good good place to work "
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Advance Auto would be meeting customers.  Each has their own needs and wishes.  Management could use more employees.  A typical day at Advance includes installing batteries and wind shield wipers on customers vehicles.  Most of the employees are good at working together with this and other jobs in and out of the store building.  The hardest part of the job is installing batteries.  Especially in inclement weather.  The most enjoy
good,I love the job but don't like the management of my store. Management doesn't help or do there job. The co - workers are great and basically manage the store on there own. Management barely works to keep the store maintained.
good,"a typical day is fast pace non-stop delivers if your a driver that is Your barely in the store.You get little tips here and there,"
good,Advance auto parts is a job that will beat your body down.. so get a lot of rest and prepare to work because you need to always focused..
good,"A very stream lined staff who knows their duties and functions."
good,"I would deliver car parts to Commercial customers. Help in the store, changing batteries for customers. Help customers find parts they need for their cars. The job was good, the only thing was that the manager had to like you for you to get anywhere with the job. meaning you don't have to work hard."
good,"I worked with the company for years. It wasn't hard work but a lot of work. Nonetheless, I always stayed busy and had a hour long break. I was promoted once and considered for a second promotion within a few months. The opportunity for advancement is there, however you must have an open availability because you never know what hours you will work each week."
good,"Management would work around a schedule"
good,"Although the job was enjoyable, there was a lot of downtime. I prefer to be continuously working so that time goes by a little quicker and this was not the job for that."
good,"The typical day at Advance Auto was troubleshooting common problems such as a dead battery, alternator, or starter. We also helped customers look up parts and found the right tools for their particular job."
good,"Advance is in all honesty an ""ok"" company to work for but i feel as if it has gotten worse every year that goes by, but monetary wise its ok its awesome if you work a lot of overtime, the people there are all great people except senior managment."
good,not a bad place to get experience and learn the ropes of an auto parts store . good learning material from corp. decent software for looking up parts for customers. expanded ability to get parts from outside vendors
good,I learned many new skills helpful to me to join other companies such as how to use a RF scanner and to read order pick tickets on a computer based system. Management was poor due to the size of the shift (4 or 5 managers for 125 employees) and the lack of experience. My co-workers were very productive and fun to work with. Overall it was a good experience and helped me learn entry level skills many warehouse jobs require.
good,"You have good days and bad. Forget everything good you are doing if your sales aren't there to back you up. In store with the team is relaxed, though, and can be a fulfilling environment."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is definitely one of the better part time jobs I have had so far. Great work and life balance. I find great satisfaction in helping DIY and non-DIY customers find exactly what they need with my knowledge on cars. The best part of the job is running into a customer outside of work and they say ""Thank You for your assistance my car has been running since you helped me ."""
good,"Fun and fast paced job. great especially if you enjoy working on cars and helping people solve problems. Customers really look to you for good advice, its a good feeling when they come back and thank you for your help. Team members are typically great people with good attitudes."
good,"Customer service is a requirement for the position of sales associate. Although the store management can vary, overall experiences with general managers is very favorable. Upper management however is more concerned with profits rather than its employees."
good,"Advance Auto Parts was a great place to get more involved in the upkeep of vehicles and also to help customers properly identify the exact parts they might need. Also, having to order things through the system was a great thing to learn."
good,i liked working there i made the mistake which at the time didn't no is was a mistake but i should have good people work there  i did every thing there to cleaning bathrooms to do the schedule for the week and lots of planagrams.
good,in store was good to work with  the people above were not well train or helpful   no won to help in store   let best people go and replaced with lesser people for salaries reasons
good,Was being trained for store manager but store was not producing and meeting goals. I took part in documenting store processes and procedures but store closed and I was laid off.
good,"Started off working in CT stores, then moved to the Norwood, MA location to go to school. Got into work at 2pm and worked until 9pm. Handled customers, pointing them into the right direction to what part they need with the best deal and still getting all of the closing shift tasks done. Good store, good co-workers, by the end of the week the store was stocked, the floor was clean and management was satisfied."
good,"At this company, you will receive a lot of complaints. You MUST be prepared to have a POSITIVE interaction when those customers come in. If you can do that, you WILL succeed! While working for the company, I learned so much about management. It is VERY easy to move up if you work hard and follow the rules. Everyone gets along well and you become close. The compensation for the job you have to do is very low, however there is ample opportunity to move up. The turnover rate is probably somewhere in the middle compared to other automotive retail stores. The benefits are very minimal, if any at all. PT employees are not offered benefits, but can opt to buy dental and eye care insurance. If you work very hard and are just looking to get management experience fairly quickly then you will benefit from this job. If you want an employer who will pay well and offer benefits, then do not apply."
good,ok place to work. just don't get paid for what you do there. a typical day work there consists of not knowing when you get off. my co-workers are ok. they do help you if you need them. the hardest part of the job is not knowing what time you get off if u have a family. the good thing about it is that you only work four days a week.
good,"A typical day at Advance Auto parts was actually an easy productive day serving customers with any automotive need.i Learned a lot about meeting sales goals and customer service is a must! The job was productive and i enjoyed the work very much, but i didn't like that there wasn't room for advancement."
good,Fun and laid back place to work. Great environment and culture of the store.
good,Helping customers with auto problems was my typical day. I learned a lot about cars that I didn't know. Co workers and management was fun to be around. Only downside was the pay.
good,"Most of the time I do enjoy working here."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is not a bad company to work for, pretty hard to beat their health insurance benefits.  Pay really depends on your position, a starting position really doesn't pay well.  Pay advances nicely up the ladder, however, for the responsibilities you take on, it could be much better.  If you work hard, you can move up the ladder with out any college, but it all depends on your store manager, your district leader, and your district demands.  My district is over run with people above me, so I feel stuck, if I were able to relocate tho, I could do so and move up another notch."
good,"Great place to work. Customers are always friendly (most of the time). Management is pretty friendly and understanding. Environment is focused on team work, not competition."
good,it was a busy atmosphere which is nice for me. management not so well. communication and organization wasn't all great. I deliver parts to car shops. and helped customers with their car issues as well. set up planograms.
good,"Typical days at work, Manager Report at 7am and start the opening process the rest of the team report at 7:30am and 8:00am. By 9:30am all the reports has to be done and ready to sales, Manager has sales per hours goals of $100 up to $130 depend on the store sales goals, You need to work in POG, inventory cycle count, and many others thing. Your shift will end at 6pm no negotiable, Wed & Sunday off and you need to close every Friday. Good place to work, depend on the district leader manager will receive developing training."
good,Company as a whole wasn't to great. They don't give much of a raise when the time comes. My co workers were great and very helpful. I learned everything about vehicles while working for advance.
good,Very busy place to work keeps you on your toes. Helping customers and stocking shelves
good,good people and stable company with stores across the united states
good,Arrive at 4am hook up to 52ft trailer do complete pre/trip inspection drive and deliver auto parts to 5 different stores. hardest part of job was backing into outdated docks at stores. Return to yard do post trip inspection between 4 and 5.
good,"Night Manager "
good,A typical work day included Opening the store and preparing it for business. Then i engaged customers and instilled a personal relationship with them to ensure brand loyalty and repeat business. I learned how to deal with customers and how to help them acquire the products they were looking for. Management was generally good with some stability problems. Co-workers were excellent and were very helpful to new employees. The hardest part of the job was using the motor vehicle testing equipment and installing some parts on vehicles which was often complicated by the neglect of the owners.
good,"Assited in store management, commercial sales and instore sales."
good,A typical day was a good day. Everyone made it a point to have a good day.
good,I help customers at the counter and deliver parts to shops also I restock our products. Its only a part time position and there are no benefits not even holiday pay. or sick time.
good,"- My typical day starts off with a brief meeting with my Sales Team around Last Week's Sales Results, potential opportunities with customers, and addressing issues that some of our customers are experiencing. Once I have gathered this information, I visit 10 - 12 automotive repair shops in my district and either push value propositions with our parts and services, or help to resolve any service or delivery issues they may have. I return at the end of the day and brief my Team on my visits. These briefings include solutions that we will provide to our customers as well as coaching my Team on ways to grow our shops."
good,Advance auto parts is a part supplier for retail and commercail.
good,"Good Company to work for, Great benefits package, room to advance internal."
good,Was only part-time position for me pay wasn't that great but the people felt like family. Even now years has passed and I still keep in touch with some of my former employees.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a very flexible place to work, the benefits are available for full time employees after 90 days, they are not that bad in comparison to some companies. Career progression is extremely tough, higher management positions tend to not rotate unlike rival companies. Raises are tough as well, you compete with other employees at your location, sometimes you may not get a raise."
good,A good day at work means the phone is ringing frequently and i'm busy pulling orders and delivering part all over town. I have learned more about auto parts and repair shops. We get along well for the most part here.The hardest part about this job is the slow days when the phone isn't ringing.
good,"Thank job is good but the culture and systems need work, the store itself needs to be updated very old, computers and networks are view slow and makes for a long wait time for customers."
good,"It’s a great environment to work in especially if you have knowledge about cars. I honestly could see improvement within management, they don’t really have great benefits. Other than that it’s an okay place to work."
good,Over all it's a good second job. That's what it was at first then my other job fail to promote me so I decided to part ways with that company. I'm looking for something with fair pay and better benefits and most of all paid time off and vacations.
good,It was my first real job so took me about a week to really get a hold of things. Advance is a decent company for anyone looking for job security and decent pay.
good,"Working for advance auto parr’s was fun, but the pay hourly wasn’t great, I felt like I was doing more than what I deserve to be paid for. I just wish I was paid more than what they gave me hourly."
good,Management was very rude and disrespectful. They disrespected my wife and said some very insulting things toward her. My wife never worked for this company and knows nothing about them. My wife was pregnant so she called when she was going in to the hospital and the manager used this one phone call to harass my wife and insult her and me publicly.
good,If your looking for a part time job that will work around your schedule then it is a pretty good place to be the lower level managers are pretty good above that the DM and above seem to only care about numbers people really don't matter if your looking to make it a career your only chance to stay above the poverty line is to become a manager otherwise the pay is horrible in 3 years I have averaged a mere 8 cent raise a year with 15 cents being the biggest to 0 one year
good,"good place to work,lots of hours, fare pay, clean warehouse, nice work schedule, nice work hours and time off, long weekend, worked 4 10 hour shifts then had 3 day weekend"
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company, but when it comes to being able to provide for your family this job is not for that, it's a job for a teenager or young adult to get a start on a career path of vehicle maintenance and understanding of parts and products used."
good,"I loved working for Advance, I was within one mile from home. The team members were friendly and hardworking. Advance provide great benefits to their full-time employees. When I left the company I had three weeks paid vacation."
good,"Flexible, interesting work space, good people, learned a lot, kept busy, healthy group work environment, understanding of personal problems, overall a good place to work"
good,At advance automotive parts the drivers would need to put away freight and deliver parts to the commercial customers. Sometimes the dynamic would be off between the counter guys and the drivers and poor communication would result in slow delivery times and unneeded stress by all. At times it would slow down and there would be things to get down but the management wouldn't enforce everyone to get things done so others were forced to pickup the slack.
good,"The people were good the management was not treated unfairly got way over production but still was harassed and rode while other people stood in the isles and talked.Good benefits,the hr manager played favorites,not by what you know but who you nose."
good,This is a nice place to work but the pay is very low and you cannot support yourself on the salary let alone a family. The management is nice.  It is good work but the pay is terrible.
good,"I enjoy the variety of duties I have.  Sales, delivery, inventory management, key-holder (open and close store). The pace is fast but the stress is low."
good,I would go in and put the truck merchandise up. I would provide customers with great customer service/ I insatlled batteries when needed. Did counting of the registers at night followe by cleaning up
good,"We would have to change planograms. We would have to serve customers as best as we possibly could. The management is great. The manager at the location I work at is very friendly, helpful, a leader, and a role model."
good,"............the better your chance for advancement.  Advance can be fast paced at times or exceedingly slow depending upon the weather and the season.  Basic store maintenance, stocking shelves, cleaning the store is mandatory for all employees.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there is very little in the way of office politics.  It's s small store.  If you like to sell things you'll do well."
good,"A very relaxed place to work at if you go to school and need a part -time job. Nothing to hard to handle and sometimes it is fun. Typically you would just sell car parts throughout your day. Cleaning was also huge along with checking in inventory, and other easy small tasks."
good,A good place to work if you are single. The work environment was busy and in a controlled atmosphere. I was able to complete my daily schedule with ease.
good,My experience at Advance Auto was a really good one. There wasn't much career advancement because people end to remain in their positions for a long time.
good,Be more focused on the company and not personal situations . Each department should have the right amount working people. Overall not a bad job to work at.
good,"All the people I work with in my store are great. The organization of the company is way beyond what Pep Boys was insofar as professionalism. One big problem is that I was intimated that I would be getting a full time position in short order after I was hired, but that never materialized. Additionally, corporate keeps cutting back the number of hours allocated to the store, so I went from a 35 hour schedule two weeks ago to a 22 hour schedule this week. Not good..."
good,Okworkplace hrs up and down that's why I'm searching employment. I work with a great supervisor and co workers. It is a job that keeps me motivated and gives me great work speed. It is overall a good place to work.
good,"they expect the world from you but only pay you min wage. they also get you with the ""we'll train you so you can get a ASE certificates through us.. FALSE!!! that's a lie from them. worked there for 2.5 years, no training from any management and i was fired for speeding in a work car going 2 mph over the speed limit. joke of a company"
good,"This company has helped me to grow as a person, while providing positive learning experiences and life lessons. The company culture is backbone of this organization. Working for Advance Auto pushed me to become more responsible and knowledgeable when dealing with a diverse set of tasks and customers."
good,"A typical day at work require taking care of in store customers and the customers at the garages. This consisted of finding out what the customer needed and looking up the parts required for the task at hand. I also delivered the parts to the garages. "
good,"The company has terrific values and mission. Unfortunately, these areas friend in which district you work in. Some district managers do not stand by the company's vision."
good,"It's a part of the automotive industry, which is nice, but it is retail, which sucks. You trouble shoot automotive issues and sell the parts related"
good,"I enjoyed working here.... Me personally I did alot of different things . I was inventory, some management, truck unloader, i did planograms and sales. The hardest part was truck unloading because sometimes they put the heavier things on the top and smashed what was on the bottom or they made it to high that was tried carrying heavy things down a ladder."
good,easy going staff very busy but makes the time past fast...decent hours very few requirements to work here all and all there is room for advancement if you work hard...you wont go unnoticed
good,"A typical day at work we interact with many customers who are seeking to either buy or test a part. Even when there are occasions where we have to deal with stubborn customers, we usually use our team work and positive attitude to overcome such situations."
good,"Discussions with customer in order to provide them with the proper parts to fix any issue they are having with their vehicles. Constantly doing Store Walks to make sure store is clean, customers are being helped, and team members are staying on tasks. Work with upset customers in order to make their experience less stressful. Working in Automotive Parts Sales involves consistent training due to evolution of Automobiles."
good,"I worked my way from the ""new guy"" driver to a full-time middle management position and I must say I enjoyed being a part-time driver better. "
good,"It was a fun and busy place to work for, i enjoyed it but wanted something new and not to be stuck somewhere so i moved on in order to find a better job with better benefits"
good,Great Company to work for. The largest Auto Parts Company in North Amerrcia. Carrts more instock parts than anyone else.
good,"Behind the scene operations and paperwork. "
good,The store manager was not very friendly and was hard to get along with. The other employees were a great team and was easy to get along with.
good,Learned to be with people and learn from their on the everyday activities of a vehicle. You'll learn what a do it yourself customer likes to do with a car.  Learn whats to be established through customer service. Enjoyable retail experience.
good,"Great college job, but has limited advancement options once you have become a store manager."
good,Ok part time job could be a ok full time job. Hours aren't the best and the pay is rather low.
good,Cashier
good,"My typical work day would consist of me checking the store numbers to see if we made goal from the previous day.If we did make goal I would move on to my next task but, if we didn't make goal I would review the report to see what we could have done better then I would put together an action plan. I would discuss the plan with my team and we would utilize the plan through out while interacting with customers.I would supervise my team through out the day to make sure they were doing what was accroding to the plan and I would lead by example.I learned how to manage my time and how to get multiple tasks done in a timely mannner without feeling overwhelmed and it also helps when you have a good team because you work together to get the job done.I had great staff.The hardest part of the job was when my boss's father died and I took over the store manager role and I was short staff but,I got through it and got the the task that were required done in a timely manner I had to work a few more hours than usual but my task were done.My most enjoyable part of my job was my staff."
good,good place for a student to school working. you learn plenty of value but you are still worked like a horse. most store atmosphere are good and a few are horrible. not to easy to move up in company but if ou know someone or then you will.
good,Job consists of mostly dealing with the public. Solving their issues by getting them the supplies they need to complete their particular job. Management helps you to learn all aspects of the job to promote advancement.
good,It was great working there. The people are mad all the time until you find what they need their faces changed to a smile. Best if all they keep coming back to you.
good,I've been there longer than a year and I would like to get back into cashiering full time. It's very stressful to put away parts all day. All the rotors and brake pads take a long time to stock and are heavy.
good,"I deal with a variety of parts, Heavy Duty Parts, Car Parts, School Bus Parts and Etc. I also, deal with all the Mechanic Shops Greenville, Ms. The atmosphere is friendly and I work an 8am to 5pm shift Monday through Friday."
good,"I enjoyed working with the crew I began with, unfortunately we had one person ruin it right after our manager took a new position with another company. That's when I knew it was time to leave."
good,Great work place fun environment very respectful workers and management clean bathrooms good food selection in the cafeteria all the departments work hard as a team
good,"Some of the management is great while others play a lot of favoritism. HR is very hard to get in touch with. They were very willing to work with a lot of issues I was having outside of work but when asked if I could switch shifts to try to prevent me from getting terminated I was turned down and terminated 2 weeks later."
good,I work diligently and i did work properly but the fact of the accusation was the only bad thing. They just wanted to let me go. Besides that it was a OK job.
good,"It is a very supportive environment and culture."
good,"Work hard and you will be noticed, learn as much as you can. Don't expect to just collect a pay check, because there are plenty of people who want to work and out there. Slackers never survive in real world do stop complaining and look in the mirror. You can't be rewarded for being lazy and then complain about it. Advice to other GM's get them out of your store and you will make money."
good,The company is very good on training employees about cars and what current information are needed to assist our customers that are in need of vehicle information
good,A typical day is stocking items from truck> delivering orders to commercial clients.I've learned about a variety of different products.The managers are always focused on task at hand.
good,"Like any other job. "
good,They love to give broken promise. District Manager very unfair. Will not have your back. Will leave you for dry.  Don't respect you or recognize your hard work.
good,It had its perks on the management side.  Like any job it had good parts and bad parts.  Other than that I would not like to comment on anything that may hurt my future to better myself.
good,"Enjoyable. Not sure where the company will be in a few years."
good,"good job, they work with your schedule but pay. Benefits are ok, and the people are great. The security is bad though. Need more communication between the bottom and top."
good,Fast paced on the job training  will be multitasking every day management is helpful if you have a great management team hardest part of job is dealing with the weather

good,"Very fast paced and customer focused auto parts retailer."
good,"Overall I think the store functioned well, but most of the time I had run parts to customers (commercial) or helped put truck away, but team mates worked well together, to satisfy customer relations. Always something new to learn at Advance Auto Parts, hands on or behind the counter, definitely a job for the like and knowledge of all kinds of automotive knowledge, Endless."

Keeping store neat and professional in appearance. Keeping up with new Plano-grams and new sales events. Assigning, and receiving duties in order to best implement new Plano-grams and interior/exterior store ads. Training on new customer focus product for the month via corporate provided training. I further learned about customer service, inventory management, automobiles and their parts. Management was flexible, understanding,team oriented, and motivating. Co-workers were easy going. Hardest part of the Job was the lack of connectivity between store computers for retail customers, Plano-grams that changed often while sometimes making little sense once executed. Most enjoyable part of job was culture, and team work."
good,Assisting customers in getting there auto parts. How to operate an auto parts store
good,"It's a great place to work. However, I'm more qualified than what this job requires. I have a degree and would like to use it."
good,"I met very nice people while working there, very helpful and friendly. Not only those who I worked with, but all the others I met in different AA stores."
good,Great job for the pay. Very high paced job. Would not recommend  to some one that didnt want to sweat. The warehouse get very hot and very cold depending on the temperature.
good,"Good hours, learned how to help others,management was small but fair and good,culture was great winning warehouse of the year twice,hardest part was losing customers due to changeovers,I enjoyed my teammates the most because we had a huge job to do each day and we worked hard together but,had fun doing it.i was lucky to have a team who took pride in our work."
good,"Selling car parts takes a knowledge of multiple car systems, especially when trying to troubleshoot for a customer. Employees deserve a higher wage for that knowledge."
good,Work day started at 8am and sometimes would last tell 9pm. Company very easy to work. All stock and computer stock sheets were very organized. Great company to work for.
good,"A great working experience if you are willing to learn, there's a bunch of work to do and minimum sales requirements however theres no commissions so the only incentive to make it is to keep your job."
good,great company and great products to offer the general public. very knowledgeable managers and computer literate people. they are pros at the computer aspect of ordering and moving parts. they know thier Stuff and need to be appreciated..
good,"Advance Auto has been a great company to work for the past five years. There is a lot of potential for advancement on the retail side of things, but as a sales manager not so much."
good,"I learned a lot by delivery parts , I meet a lot of different people that were interesting and were very nice. I also learned about different parts of vehicles. I also learned more about my customer service skills."
good,I pulled auto parts for roughly around 20 stores every day. Very fast paced enviroment which keeps you busy. Management was good to work along with everyday.
good,I have grown to know my customers and enjoy the discussions and friendships that I have made.  Finding out more about auto parts is a big bonus I enjoy.
good,Overall i would say Advance is a good place to work for. Don't expect great pay starting out. The management is also very professional. Discounts on all parts is another great perk of working there.
good,"It was a good job just too many demands of up selling and trying to make people buy stuff that they dont need,  It was always about numbers. I had a really fun team working for me and that is what i loved the most."
good,"Drove machinery, loaded and unloaded trucks, worked with scanners,and I was a trainer. You clean as you go. You pushed brooms, stacked pallets, and emptied trash cans."
good,Fun place to work with a lot of great people and customers. If you love cars youll love this place. Management that trained me was very fun to be around.
good,I learned a lot about time management switching from working at Subway to working a 3rd shift job over night. My co-workers were very supportive when I was struggling learning in any area of my job. The hardest part about my job was balancing time with my family and having to go to work at night. The most enjoyable part was I still got to attend church on Sunday mornings having the weekends off.
good,"OVERALL good company to work for, i learned alot about inventory how to work well wit other associates, i loved my customers!"
good,"In a typical day, I usually help customers with their questions and give them advice on how to maintain and properly fix their cars. Also installing wiper blades and batteries from time to time."

good,"I did enjoy working at this job, I enjoyed the commercial customers as well as the DIY customers. I do believe they could work on who they hire to be store managers."
good,"I lived my job at advance. I grew with the company. All the way from pt time, to general manager in less than 2 years. The bonus was great and had the support of my dm for the most part. This was between 2005 and 2011. Fellow co-workers say that it is not the same workplace as when I was there"
good,Advance auto parts is a company where there is room to progress and become a manger along  side get trained with various machinery. they offer health benefits that suit every employees needs. the production of the company is very fast pace and organized.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts has been a good job to learning alot about car parts, diagnosing vehicles, changing batteries."
good,It’s a steady work please. You can move up  decent if they are seeing how you work. It’s an ok place to work at. Make sure to check your  registers and the stuff that you’re picking out of the order.
good,"Ok place to work, but you get the feeling that they have so many stores and there is not enough talent to go around. Because of this a lot of things fall through the cracks."
good,Other than being the hottest place on earth lol i enjoyed my job the salary was the most ive made and the shifts were decent i would probably still b there but i had a sick grandparent that i had to keep an eye on but overall i would recommend
good,This job is a nice job to have gives you lots of experience. I'm Graduating high school and need a better paying job to support me and my grandparents that are in bad chape.
good,Great company to work for I've met lots of great people working here and I've learned a great deal !  They provide good customer service and usually gives good advice to the customers
good,Very fast paced. At the time of employement it was a great place to work. To many hours at that time in my life. Easy to move up in the company.
good,"It was a great place to work, although i really didn't know anything about cars the job was still fun."
good,"Working with a great group of people helped a lot.I love helping other people.Learned to be patient with customer.I treat people the way I would want to be treated.Alot of heavy lifting sometimes bothered me.The out come would have been,that I managed to help someone that day and felt good about it when they ""thank you"" for all your help"
good,Busy fast paced job automotive inspired get to work on cars to a Sertain limit delivery parts very social job required must have some computer skills to use machines
good,"Fun, serving customers, computer training provided to learn about company, product, and waiting on customers, Management at my location is fair, provide a relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Enjoyable job. A bit low paced, but customer interactions were very fun."
good,gret work place. very nice people.i would recomend anyone to work for advance. fast also friendly service. the best part of the job is that everyone theire are team players.
good,"Overall Advance is a great job.  Great opportunity to meet all the mechanics is the area surrounding your store. Great discount especially since they acquired car quest. Once you have been there a year you get a week's paid vacation. When it comes to advancement with the company it doesn't happen.  All of the district manager and up positions are hired from outside, if you do happen to get promoted with the company it is rare."
good,"My manager was ungrateful and tried too hard to be friends with the worst of our employees. He was untrustworthy and a liar. If it wasn't for him I think that I would be there still today. Advance as a company isn't to blame for my bitterness. ""The company"" was mainly interested in their bottom line and you would be punished if you don't fulfill their expectations. Depending on location it's nearly impossible to meet your personal sales goals."
good,The job was cool and it was fast pace I had a lot to learn in a little time. Management was uneasy they didn’t help after they got the numbers for inventory down they were lazy and rude
good,"I rate the company 4/5 to be fair, but my specific store had a major issue that ruined my career with the company. I had told my uppers that I lost my home and needed to relocate and transfer stores, they thought I was kidding apparently and never addressed it after me bringing it up multiple times for multiple days in a row. They did nothing. I, to this day, have not received termination documents. This was over a year ago."
good,The typical day at work was to serve customers and offer customers services while providing strong motivational suggestions that would help customers.
good,The management was kind of poor. The hours were okay . I mean a job is a job. I was not a fan of the way how you had to push the rewards program on people. Kind of stupid and if you didn't meet your requirements (enough sign ups) you got wrote up. I mean really it ain't my fault.
good,Simple job good for young adults just getting out of highschool or college. Very little room for advancement after key holder position. Benefits and pay are right for the job but not enough for people looking for a permanent job
good,I would help every customer with any problems. I learn more about car parts. The store management was amazing with there employee and customers .The hardest part of the job was when the customer didn't know the part needed and we had to give them the correct part. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people installing battery's and wiper's.
good,"helping people with thier car problems.delivering auto parts to local dealers.unloading weekly parts truck,stocking parts.its a good job,the hardest part is asking for more hours."
good,I loved working as a sales associate in automotive retail. I was one of very few females that had automotive knowledge. I enjoyed going to school and learning everything I know.
good,"The only things that I seriously dislike about this place is that it takes 20-40 minutes to get anywhere for food and the picking manager either has a hard time remembering to get me totes or he don't like me 😂. Plus unless your production numbers are above what's expected, don't expect to get moved anywhere."
good,Very great company to work for. Work environment was decent.  Management in store could have been better due to not being around to help the employees
good,Depending on store location and the GM every store runs a different way. (With the same goal in mind of course) I personally wasnt happy with management and that is why I left but I liked working there
good,The gm on site was to inflicted in drama rather than the advancement of productivity and customer service. Other than that my management experience myself was very well liked I realized I am a leader in having this opertuntity.
good,"I worked for Advance for 28 years and loved my current position within the company, I was informed today after 28 years of service they eliminated my position and was let go. I can still apply within the company for other positions but no other jobs were offered to me."
good,I like the job it’s kist not something I see myself doing for the rest of my life I would like to journey out there and see what else I can find that I like
good,"friendly staff, relaxed environment, employees helped each other, cross training available.  complimentary breakfast occasionally, always available work breaks"
good,Poor store management. Too much like a prison instead of a job. No team work or morale boosting for doing a great job. Too many back stabbers. Company more concerned about the amount of sales you earned the store then about the parts they sold or the customer that bought the parts.
good,not much advancement for older workers. they are not really great to work for . mostly part time with out bebefits . low pay scale . would not recomend them.
good,"Assist customers DIY and Commercial"
good,Management is cutting our hours and making us work odd shifts. I like working with my fellow co workers and customers. Management seems to be of out of sinc.
good,"I love working for this company except for the fact that corporate does not allow its employees to have full time status, and they cut our hours regularly."
good,"Liked the job and the management, coworkers ect. Liked that the company has nice company vehicles to deliver parts."
good,not a career however everyone is very friendly. you can be scheduled based on your needs. the manager is very flexible on scheduling.
good,Advance auto is a good ground building company helps a person succeed  and become a professional employee for the big world it teaches you management and coustmer service.
good,"I am in search of a new job, therefore the work of this particular place is not the best. The individuals that come in are very rude and the store is always a mess."
good,long days learned nothing management is a revolving door of poor decisions. workplace culture is diverse hardest part is the long days and lack of support not enjoyable
good,"Advanced Auto Parts was a good beginner job, Taught the importance of handling each customer with respect and listening to their needs in order to help them in the best way possible. the biggest struggle for an y Advance Auto Parts is the ability to have and maintain proper inventory control as well as a well maintained (neat and orderly) sales floor, or counter tops."
good,"Advance has undergone tremendous changes in upper management."
good,Great place to work if you have a love of cars and would like to share your knowledge with others.Also a great place to work if you are attending school for Automotive.
good,Was alright to work at. But being a girl made it rough. Did not really get the proper training. Had to learn as I went. Working with the public I did enjoy. But being a female I was treated different
good,I started as a part time driver and worked my way up. There is room to grow in this company. Most of my career is with this company. The down fall of this place is upper management comes and goes way to fast. Ive had store managers leave after months of working there.
good,this was a great starter job to get back into the civilian work force and I would suggest anyone who likes automobiles to look into it as a starter job
good,"Good job to start off. Advance has great benefits, room for advancement. Some stores are different than others my store was very slow. The store was not busy at all so it gave a lot of free time and looking for stuff to do."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is going through growing pains. Right now the company is working to be one team. Management is struggling between retail and wholesale business. In two years this maybe a great company to work for, but right now there is a lot of confusion and direction the company is struggling with. Inventory management, product line change overs and fair compensation."
good,"I'm a visual learner, I love to learn new things about cars and with this job i actually learned something new everyday. if i could have grown in the Advance Auto Parts Business i would have. great business but the management is horrible at the pineville Location...I had great employees that also taught me a lot, they never had a problem showing me where things went when Stocking was involved..I also enjoyed meeting new customer, talking to them, helping around the store, and even assisting outside of work. This job taught me a lot in a little bit of time and I'm very Thankful"
good,This does not seem to be a career establishment for me. The company is ok.
good,"a typical day at work  was when store got so busy that manager had to help out on counter. In management you have good days and bad days. your good days is when every thing is going well and all your projects are getting done and the store is making its quoter. bad"
good,"Manager is very supportive, co-workers are a job to work we, customers are sometimes hard to deal with, and it a challenge working there cause sometimes you have to figure out the customers needs."
good,Ability to provide good customer service.Strong communication skills
good,most enjoyable part of the job were the customers
good,It gives me a steady small income to help get through the tight spots.They were willing to give me a try and I have been with them over a year.[ I like the professional or Business world very much..] Right now I am working 37 hours a week earning any where from 600. every 2 weeks to bringing home 288 every 2 weeks. It is based on how many hours you put in.
good,I forgot to add a  core charge to a product and I was not able to return to work until the manager got to the bottom of the issue. They would not tell me anything about what was going on.  So I started looking for another job. Then I was sent a separation notice that said I would not comply with management.
good,I like thejob but the pay is horrible. It is a stress free job I just don't make enough to live. It is good for a college student or a high school graduate
good,"I do like their desire ""not"" to fire practice.   "
good,"It isnt the best but not the worst. There will be times when your having a nice day and having fun with customers and coworkers, but then you'll deal with people who are just dumb or intentionally trying to make you mad and customers telling you what your gonna do for them. Management is great work load is/can be excessive which sometimes is just straight stupid."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a good company just need to treat the employers better, give them a raise and benefits as well."
good,"Competitive, competent people to work with, quality parts, offer use of company vehicle, flexible work schedules, poor communication, weak management."
good,Location I worked at went through 3 managers in a 1 year period before promoting a long time employee to store manager. It was only after most employees in the local stores had quit before they figured out that decent management is the foundation for long term employee loyalty.
good,"Sold auto parts to retail customers and was a parts pro that handled commercial accounts on a daily basis, and maintained them to keep up sales for the company"
good,"while the work demand is fast-paced and sometimes heavy, the constant changing of location and variety of work makes work interesting. Employees are friendly. Management is not always as organized as it should be, but it's not hard to deal with."
good,A typical day is answering the phone and either gathering a quote for a walk in customer or billing a commercial account then finding a delivery driver or delivering the parts yourself. Then stocking and cleaning
good,"I absolutely loved my job at advance auto parts. I loved working in the car part field and would definitely recommend this job to others. However, the management is completely horrible and forced me to leave."
good,don't expect to grow if you try hard they don't care about your opinion or the customer its all about the money and I thought it was about the customers but I was wrong
good,I would go to work Stocking shelves delivering parts on Wednesdays i would unload a Tractor trailer and sort stock and put the stock in the proper place. we also put batteries and wiper blades on cars.
good,The people i worked with were awesome. was not getting hours. was not going anywhere at that place. i learned alot though about cars and how the comany worked.
good,I look forward to going to work.  The customer is always on the top of the list of things to do.  Helping the customer with projects and breakdowns is a fantastic feeling.  This is a retail environment so there are always things to do.  Cleaning and facing to stocking and putting up the incoming truck.
good,this is a typical retail environment that is customer service oriented.  Must be able to handle a fast pace.  also have phone manners and automotive knowledge.
good,The company isn’t as flexible with scheduling like they promise. It’s impossible to get 2 weekend days off per month to be with my wife and kids. Tenured managers are comfortable and aren’t interested in growing the team very much.
good,"Good place to work for the gear head type. If you love cars and people this is a good fit. The commercial business is somewhat of a downer. You have to please everyone even when it can cost you greatly, be careful."
good,"To much miscommunication,and not enough over site of Gms....Alot of changes in the company without anyone saying why,and one hand doesnt know what the other is doing for the most part"
good,"stressful not enough hours other employees, not offering help if needed some customers rude did not like the small company car felt as if I was treated unfairly when I was let go"
good,"A great place to gain automotive aftermarket experience.  Middle management will ALWAYS and ONLY make statements with escape ""clauses"" intact.  Remember, this is an ""at will"" employment company and they prove this by never standing behind any assurances they may give you in the beginning."
good,This is just a job. The only ones that seem to get ahead would be the managers pet. No matter what you do they want mare and pay the same. Drivers have no benefits what so ever. Suppose to be a very important part to the store and company but are treated and paid just the opposite.
good,"enjoyed working for advance auto parts, great customer base, pay was okay, hours were okay,  work life balance was below average, some of upper management show a indifference to race."
good,It was a ok job until the cut a lot of their Asst. Manager jobs. They don't pay enough for the work. The co-workes were great to work with.
good,I enjoyed working at Advance Auto Parts and being challenged with new task for every customer that walked through the door. making delivery runs and interacting with the customers was always a plus.
good,Limited on hiring help for a decent wage. Promotions depend on your relationships with the management above you. The amount oh hours required for store managers is not reflected in pay. The hours used for salary are based on 40 hours but you a required a min of 50 hours a week. The schedule they have managers work is stressful if you want any time with your family or have a hobby.
good,"it is a learning experience on a daily basis.deliver parts;learned how to deal with planograms;management always kidding and teasing around with each other don,t know when they are serious or just kidding around my team mates are a good bunch hardest part is not knowing if manager is serios or not when he says i have a 'warning' and the most enjoyable part is delivering parts to our accounts and building a good repoir with them"
good,"Not a bad place to work, very safe environment, everyone in management is nice and easy to get along with. Not hard work at all. Easy money"
good,"Overall a good place to work, good co workers, and good Manager, all were friendly and nice. The ""floating"" schedule was a nightmare however.  One week you would be off on Monday , next week Friday, next week Tuesday.. and the hours you came in and got off,  changed every day. They called it the perfect schedule. But beware it will OWN your life. You can not plan for any event, or schedule anything until you see the week schedule for the coming week.. it is crazy.  I worked two other part time job\s and this would not work for me. If they ever fix this schedule thing , it overall would be a nice place to work."
good,The days was always busy with delivering parts and sometimes dealing with upset people about their car. The management was ok at my location but he could do better in some areas but other then that he was an ok manager. the co-workers was not just co-workers we was a big family. Always helping one another and work very well as an team. There wasn't anything hard about the job but for the most part i love working at Advance Auto Parts.
good,My typical day at work was very educational. I was excited to go to work everyday and be able to help my customers.
good,My typical day at work was very educational. I was excited to go to work everyday and be able to help my customers.
good,Great place to work for at this locality. The management was very relaxed and flexible. Every one worked very well as a team.
good,came in with one manager by the time i left i was on my 3rd but overall it was a good experience. my coworkers were the best and kept me up to speed with things i might not have understood concerning vehicles and customers
good,"The commercial department was the best place to be in the company.  The staff was fun and easy to work with.  The work environment was relaxed some days, but most of the time it felt like Christmas shopping on black friday. Never a dull moment especially in the field."
good,"Great company to work for. Management can be kind of flaky. Great opportunities for advancement within the company. Start at bottom, do a good job and you can work your way up!"
good,Staffing issues. For the most part they are very easy to work for. But are not willing to compensate for lack of staffing putting a lot on just a couple of people
good,"Okay company to work for, as long as your willing to work a lot. Upper management, outside store level, doesn't seem to really care. Corporate will replace anyone, and not even fast."
good,"Went thru several managers, several who were decent, fair and cared about the employees. Several who should never have been managers and had no idea how to be a leader but were paper pushers."
good,"Nice place to work, the workload is manageable but the pay is lacking for most positions and definitely not enough to live on. Upper management is distant."
good,"A typical day at work is waiting on customers, unloading truck, stocking product."
good,"As a part time employee, there are opportunities that are not afforded to these folks. Part timers don't make holiday pay as the full timers do. Training can only happen on the job site. No remote learning or completing training items. IT leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"A great place to work in the beginning, but in the past couple of years it has gone down hill. I like the people that I work with very much and I like helping the customers."
good,"worked here after college.. cool place to work. .  . .  not a bad job, get to work with good people, laid back auto parts sales, get to talk to popel about cars"
good,"The company is growing and opening new locations.  This givens plenty of opportunity for growth and development.  Going through new setups is always challenging, but I thrive in that environment, so it is a great fit."
good,"As with any Supply and Demand jobs with Supply Chain companies, there are challenges. I wished that AAP would stick to a direction once it has decided to go! By far it was my most aggravating experience."
good,"One thing I appreciate at advance is the cultural diversity, which is important to me.  Over the years, the culture of a family has drastically changed.  It is not nearly as positive of an environment as it once was."
good,This is a good first job. I was with the company for 10 years and received multiple career advancements throughout my tenure. I knew very little about cars when i started and ended up knowing how every piece works.
good,"wait on customers stock shelves clean work area "
good,"My day would consist of contacting my commercial accounts to see if they need anything by 10 am using the 10x10 format , contact 10 accounts by 10 am . I am always learning new things each day , there is never a day that goes by that no one learns something new . I have management experience for over 5 years , including paperwork , payroll , inventory , asn receiving and shipping , cycle counts , planograms , bank deposits . The hardest job of the day would be not being able to help solve a customers needs , but the most enjoyable day  would be to help them get the job done with the right parts at the right time . Customer satisfaction !!"
good,"Deal with customers, fixing there cars for them for free. Get yelled at by guest cause you do not have a part in stock or it is to high priced. Get to learn about cars."
good,it was kind of horrible i really did not want to work there because of the fact that we cant never keep a manager.And what i mean by that is the manager is always leaving to another store and we always had to get another one.
good,Too many people in your personal business. Stressful place to work at. They dont really want to advance people to new positions within the company. Just plainly to many issues working for the company.
good,Working at Advance Auto parts is a great job only if your position is above being a sales person. Lower team members are treated poorly whilst being the roots to keeping the store running.
good,Had to deal with egos of Men who think women dont belong in that environment. Other than that it was a fun place to work. Dont need to  be a rocket scientist to do the job.
good,"Nothing special. Some people that work there don't care about their jobs or their customers. Could be paid better. Overall - decent. No pay raises, worked there for 3 years and never got a raise."
good,Typical day at work consists of customer service. Gained some skills as far as sales wise. Management needs to help a little more to help speed up the process of getting certain things done.
good,Good place to learn the ropes and become familiar with auto parts. Great stepping stone company that was willing to work with my college schedule at the time. Compensation was on the poor side but the experience and knowledge gained on all makes and models was worth the lack of compensation.
good,Working here has though me a lot and I've meet a lot of people how have given me some sound advice that has and will help me in life.
good,"A typical work day at Advance can start off really busy or slow, considering the fact its a part store, its most likely busy. I've learned a good amount of things such as; testing alternators and starters. Checking in and stocking new inventory. Workplace was comfortable for the most part. There isn't no where to sit, but if your busy enough that won't be a problem. The hardest part about the job is remembering where every part goes, and trying to understand what customers need when they don't exactly what they're talking about. The easiest part about the job is cleaning."
good,A typical day is trying your best to make your sales goal and helping people solve the car troubles with great parts ive gained allot of auto part knowledge great coworkers best part of the day is coming in to work and greeting everyone and the hardest is getting email addresses
good,Solid company currently going through growing pains of a large acquisition / integration.  AAP is a good company to work for and performance will get better with time.
good,"I have worked here for 20 years and been promoted several times.  I have enjoyed working here but over the past few years, the entire culture has changed.  The company used to care about their employees but now it does not feel that way. "
good,its been a great place to work. If you want to learn about good customer service and want to gain some good info about cars this is a great learning job.
good,it was starting at store for a preflight which is speak with commercial parts pro and general manager about the commercial business. visit customers for the day and do sales calls based on customers needs.
good,Advance Auto is a leader in the auto parts industry.  I was a commercial delivery driver serving over 50 accounts.  Management was always quick to jump in and lend a hand.  Pay and benefits were low in comparison to other similar jobs.  I enjoyed being part of a good team that worked well together.
good,if they can find management  that can understand team member that will be very good place to work at.....management is some time don't care about the team member it's all about fired team members..
good,"Great ""Car-Guy"" job - Low pay and high expectations. Good employee discounts.  Typical retail contact with all types of people."
good,"A typical day on the job is filled with questions from customers with ailments from there vehicles. Helping customers with things stemming from brakes to Windshield wipers to get them through the tough issues that they might experience with there cars. Working alongside commercial accounts to supply there demand in parts to please there customers is done in high quantities at our location. Working in a HUB store greatly enhances the work load, wit is exciting and empowering. "
good,working for advance auto was great i like helping people but trying to get anywhere in that company is impossible and the pay is horrible
good,Was there for awhile and while I had the capability to do jobs within the company they consistently hired outside of its own employee base. made promises to its employees that rarely ever came about New management at my store had no leadership ability and gave no sense of direction..
good,"I enjoyed my Job until i lost my assistant manager, who was training me to be come an assistant manager. After she left I had to play the roles of General manager, Assistant manager, Commercial Parts Professional, and Retail Parts Professional."
good,"Ran Commercial Counter selling Parts to Shops"
good,"Nice place to work, could be better, sometime like working with high school kids"
good,Working for Advanced Auto Parts has been a okay experience and I have enjoyed learning what I have about cars.
good,When I started i was told there was many chances for upward mobility. I even took a pay reduction in hopes that were true. It was a total farse...I have been there a year and have seen nothing but a jumping of upper management positions. There have been no chances of movement even though there were many positions open. They seem to not hire new people but move them to a new store and hope they do better. LAME
good,It's a retail company so you have a lot of ups and downs depending on sales.
good,stocking cleaning unloading.. searching for parts for customer ordering parts..
good,"Answering customer calls ,"
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with.  Different challenges from day to day. Management was fair and helpful. Hardest part of job was trying to figure out what the customer need , when they didnt know what part it was."
good,"The job it’s self is simple if your willing to learn new things. But the way the individual stores are run are very different when explaining how the company as a whole is depending on which store you work at. I work in one of the Atlanta, GA stores and my store GM is flexible with the hours as long as you let her know ahead of time. But in terms of advancement it’s very hard when it’s much need d.  Been here almost a year and never have we had more than 2 full time managers who used to switch when they close. If neither could do it she would. Plus I dislike the favoritism that goes around but...any job will have that if u have worked with that person for a long time."
good,Great place to work and the job skills u gain while your working there is amazing.great group of people to work with and willing to work with your schedules
good,"I enjoyed my time there learned a lot I wish I could’ve stay a little longer to learn more. "
good,If you don't know anything about cars they provide some training and learning on the job. Others are their to assist when needed and it can get crazy.
good,"I have been with the company for 6 years, I started at 9.28 an hour and have been given a raise to 10.68 over the the 6 year period. My schedule needs fit the job, but i would not recommend this job to someone looking to make a living with this as their only income."
good,"Not a job I would recommend to anyone who doesn’t look forward to moving up. The pay isn’t too awful, overall good job and good people, hours are super flexible and the management is easy to get along with"
good,Overall it was a good place the manager was a good guy until he quit the new manager I will say not so much he has no people skills and likes to talk to other employees about employees
good,Not a bad company if you work in the stores but if your a manager you have no life because you always get put in bad stores to see if you can handle the pressure if fixing the store while training your team
good,"Not a very diverse company and hard to move up and grow. Get to learn a lot about how a big company functions and you get to use a lot of great systems and programs. You will meet a lot of smart people, but overall it is a very corporate culture. Pay is not competitive and benefits were not that great. Get in and learn as much as you can and then go somewhere else that will value you more. HR in the Roanoke office was absolutely horrible- unprofessional and don't really care about promoting diversity or a better work culture."
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts really showed me a lot about cars that I didn’t know about. Even if you have no previous knowledge of car parts, they give you basic training on things such as car batteries, a car’s AC system and much more."
good,Promote more from within. Having more manageable resources with less employees. Repetitive training and push for success. Moreover better wages for entry level position.
good,Upper level management are some what disconnected from the needs of their stores. They mostly communicate through emails and rarely come into the store to see the needs of their workers.
good,"The Only thing i would have changed,would have been the amount of employees we were able to have, because what we had was not enough. The company needs to do further background on people they hire, stop hiring friends of friends based off of word of mouth"
good,Take advantage of people. Low pay for the folks on the front line. Unrealistic expectations. More meetings than time to implement ideas and initiatives.
good,"I had lots of fun working the cardbboard smasher,I also learned to drive a forklift,  and tow motor. I met lots of hard working folks who love their jobs,and got quite fond of a few of them. there is an element of competition on the floor, good workers will find a way to deal with that."
good,The company itself is a good place to work. The job is easy you are inside most of the time.which keeps you out of inclement weather. The problem I see is with some of the managers I've had lacked the training. They come in all ready to take on job not understanding its more than they were prepared for. There is paperwork that has to be done and put away in it's appropriate place.You have to be there on time to set an example for your staff.When there is a problem you need to be able to handle it in a professional manner and not pass it on to someone else to handle.Over all I enjoyed my customers and helping them and meeting all kinds of people.During my employment there I learned a lot about cars and how to properly take care of my own vehicles.
good,I still work here. I moved positions with out a promotion or a raise because the original commercial manager walked out and the accounts wouldn't deal with ant one else. when i asked for a raise i have still been waited a year and 2 months later maybe its because i am a female and the district manager discriminates against those he doesn't approve of but he cant move me because i never miss on sales. other than that the company is a great company to work for.
good,A solid company that could dominate the automotive aftermarket industry.  A lot of admin stuff to keep you detached from what you need to do.  Work life balance is a challenge.
good,"Employees somewhat lack motivation. Upper management cares more about sales goals and numbers than employees and their wellbeing. It is a decent job, but not a career."
good,"a good crew and manager, it is a struggle to get some of the hours back I lost due to health so I need to find other employment. Certain hours of the day are very busy like most DIY stores, commercial at times is very pushy."
good,I don't know if this is how all Advance Auto Parts are but the one I worked at needed better management. There were qualified personnel that should have been given a management position because they were more competent than current management.
good,The work is not too difficult. Mostly delivering parts to commercial customers or assisting DIY walk-ins. Previous automotive knowledge a definite plus as well as the ability to regularly move heavy (up to 50lbs each) parts. Average three days a week constantly moving to sort and deliver commercial orders while also maintaining in-store duties. If you're competent they may ask you to run the commercial desk which can be extremely stressful.
good,"Accurately document and update customer records in the computer system."
good,"On a typical work day, upper management main concern is sales and serving customers. I have learned about different automobile systems and how they work. The management staff is supportive but not very flexible. If you worked in the private sector, then it would be a not so easy transition. The hardest part of the job is not having opportunities for growth. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,".not enough pay for what certain people are expected to do, a lot of favoritism for those who have less responsibilities. Those with certain job titles should all have the same responsibilities."
good,not enough pay but overall a good company . good hours and very close to home with options to relocate if needed. it can be overwhelming due to not enough people on the clock but the store i work at runs really well as a team short staffed or not
good,I loved my job the hours and stress got to me and caused some health problems. I was aloud to return after a emergency surgery. if your can find an advance with good management it is a great place to work and the customers are awesome. bad management or lack of management is their down fall.
good,"Completely depends on management, but chances are you will enjoy working at Advance autoparts. There is a lot of Corporate stipulations and codes that are absolutely ridiculous but that's what happens in a big company with a bunch of talking heads."
good,"Potential to compete with AZ or o'reillys or even Napa "
good,"I enjoyed working at Advance Auto parts,  Great work place very easy going inviorment, Great people.  CO- WORKERS / BOSS WAS AWESOME. If i hadn't relocated i would still be working for rhe company.. 👍"
good,"i delivered parts, made bank deposits, pick up parts from other sources, help customers with any customer service, and answering phones and finding parts"
good,"My managers exercised these daily , evenly across the board. Great place to build knowledge of every year, make, model  ever on the road and all the parts that collaborate and work together and make it function properly. I have learned that mechanics justvarent mechanics they are basically automobile surgeons."
good,"It is an easy job. Before starting, i did not know anything about cars. The catalog is easy to use and it will help you find the parts that the customer needs easily.  Only thing that is bad is that It is so boring when it gets so slow, especially after finishing everything that needs to be done."
good,I was a delivery driver for a parts store. hardest part of the job was the pay wasn't good at all which is to be expected since it is a minimum wage position. most enjoyable part was driving because I love to drive anything.
good,"Working at Advance is great! Every day there is something new, you'll have some customers come in with a rude attitude and you'll have customers come in that have great stories about what they are working on. If you know how cars work and know the function of certain parts then you'll have a great time here."
good,"The company seems more worried about sales and profits than it's people. The culture is not conducive to ideas from the bottom even though it claims empowerment for it employees, (bottom up). More days of work, less time off."
good,a typical day would consist of me delivering parts to commercial customers as well as other store locations. also if there was nothing to deliver i would assist in helping customers inside the store
good,"Advance Auto was a productive workplace, with many responsibilities. Our store had a fun team that was largely cooperative and professional. While there are decent hours, for those of us with family, the in-flexibility of hours was a bit problematic. Our store had flaky management in the sense that store managers were rarely constant and always seemed to be changing. But overall, there was good pay and great customers!"
good,"Fun place to work, management to many in the store at one time."
good,Driving two 10 hour days can be stressful. I like the time in the store helping the customer with their needs. The pay is low for me I’m used to a different type of position. I just want the job to be temporary until I can find another job that is full time Design / Drafter. I would feel more comfortable with a different type of job.
good,"You learn car to install batteries, wiper blades, and what causes certain issues with different vehicles.  Sales are important for management, but there is not a way to stop your sales per hour from falling if you doing inventory, or completing plan-o-grams."
good,Advance is your classic parts store with the knowledgeable parts gurus. The customer base is one formed from years of loyalty with the highest of expectations for quality. The staff remains knowledgeable and skillful in their craft.
good,"My manager was suppose to work 50 hours a week but rarely worked 40. Nothing was his fault everything was a break down of the system. He did not make the system, so no need to enforce it."
good,this place isn't bad in terms of a place to work but it is more suited to a high school student  as there is not many ways to advance nor much opertunity to do so.
good,It was a great place to work for 18 years but the management was going down the drain and it was hard to get hours sometimes. I would have to leave work early a lot because there was nothing to do there.
good,"Advance Auto Parts has been more than fair in accomodating my personal needs such as a physical disability. Employees come and go but if you do your job consistently you won't have any problems. And, the employee discount on parts is nice."
good,Its was good untill the company eliminated my job company wide at all 3500 stores. It was a shocker they did it to raise capital to buy another auto parts to increase foot print with already existing store just change name out front.
good,"I loved it there, always busy. I learned a good bit about car parts. I enjoyed my job. The management was ok. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat."
good,"Decent place of employment. Has its up's and down's. Fast paced, and steady. Changing schedules keep work fresh if you are available to rotate shifts."
good,"Working with customers and light duty on trucks. "
good,"Though i learned a lot during my time here, there were a lot of struggles. It never really felt like i would have the opportunity to grow within the company, as well as the attitude some customers would take on when they realized i was a woman. A boys club a majority of the time, but it was a nice amount of experience to have, to learn more about cars was a good bonus too."
good,Loved the JOB . Loved working on cars. Helping people with their cars. Great work environment . I consider the friends that i worked there with as family now
good,it's a decent job. get to talk cars all day. the worst part is if you have to install a battery in the rain thats about it. other than that the job is cake.
good,"There wasn't much training, and every store seemed to be different in the quality of the managers present.  I would suggest they have more informed managers and some type of universal management training program."
good,"good place to work , i enjoyed the part time position,great working with the other employees.I enjoyed the daily interaction with the regular customers."
good,"since its an auto part store it is a high demand place. customer service is main priority plus keeping the place organized, does not always happen but there is team work."
good,The job is easy as long as you have an advanced knowledge of vehicles. As is typical with most retail jobs you have to deal with difficult customers. The stressful part of the job are the ridiculous expectations of completing a weeks worth of work in one shift while helping customers. This company is in dire need of revision of its goals as a company.
good,I worked for advance twice once in FL and in AL the company used to be very welcoming we had bbq's on weekend to bring in customers. Then it started getting more corporate and focused on forcing more and more sales and numbers. And so many crooked upper management several stores the store manager has gotten arrested or escorted from the building. Before everything started going south the job was amazing and was fun for a while.
good,"Learn plenty about cars, and all about retail. Driver , Deliver parts to customers. Able to lift and carry heavy parts. Get to meet alot of people that have great knowledge on cars."
good,"As CPP, I engaged with commercial customers who run auto shops. They usually knew exactly what parts the needed, so the job was a breeze. I coordinated with drivers and other stores to ensure the customers were serviced expeditiously. However, the pay is so low, you will need a second job."
good,"The Good:"
good,"Not a bad company to work for. The summer & winter battery installation can be a brutal. Pay isn't so good for the # 1 Auto parts dealer in the world. The managers are fair, mostly decent people. It is a good place to work if you love cars."
good,Nice job need some improvement they have not had a stable management department do to so many quiting or getting fired they are very nit picky about every little thing an will put papers on you quick
good,Works well with any school schedule. Day shift night shift made it easy to persue my degree and still be able to work 40 hours per week.
good,"This is a great place to work.  The employees are great and management is great.  Advance Auto Parts is a large company and each store is ran from afar.  Some ideas from up-top are not always welcomed, but its understood.  This store was a wealth of knowledge for me, and I enjoyed it."
good,Was a fun job. Always had a good time working. Management was unsteady and the most enjoyable part was working with the customers.
good,"Lack of hours during the slow months and  the ability to move up with the company was nearly non existent because it was a small franchise. But I have learned a lot and would advice anyone looking to gain customer service, sales and automotive background to look into the company."
good,This was a great place to work the management was always very helpful and always willing and ready to train you. I learned so much about cars and different things from them. My coworkers were the best we made a great team.
good,"Advance Auto, was a great place to work. The company supervisor i had was of the utmost and helpful person i have worked for. I learned how to get the problem a customer was having out of customer by being a buddy or friend.The co-workers i worked with were of the greatest help and fun of any place i ever worked for"
good,The management that I worked for there was progressive and drove the success of the DC.  I retired is the only reason I left.
good,"I enjoyed working with the department and the team members. I liked my job and grew in the 8 yrs I was with the company. I enjoyed working with the contractors. I liked being able to learn new programs, and working with other team members in different distribution centers."
good,"deal with vendors and research"
good,"It's a fun place to work and I am learning a little about cars, I just want to do more with the NASCAR and automotive indrustry. I would like to stay at Advance Auto Parts but I need a better paying job because I am about to move out of my parents house fopr the first time."
good,"Great Compnay, they allow you to blossom. Great people you build a bond. Everyone is so supportive. I love the retail and opportunities."
good,Challenging work environment with an emphasis on helping the customer get all he needed to complete the project. Meeting people and getting to know there needs.
good,"typical work day includes loading and unloading trucks. troubleshooting customer issues and resolving them."
good,The company could compensate better for their employees and especially management. I have learned information on car parts and used managerial skills. The hardest part of the job is taking on a management position and not feeling appreciated in what you do.
good,"Was always busy and fun to be at work"
good,Good company to work for. Except the owner wasn't good at managing money.Take funds out of the business to buy himself a new toy. Or take his girl friend for a weekend getaway to some expensive resort. So in turn there wouldn't be enough money to make payroll some weeks.
good,"Long days, fast paced, management was good, low payroll hours."
good,"My Director is terrific.  He allows the team management to lead the dept and supports our decisions and goals."
good,"Market standards Salary. not too good, not too bad. Good opportunities within the company and you can easily transfer…"
good,"Good business idea poorly executed. Some employees didn't carry their workload. Hardest part was learning the many different ways to order parts from other stores and return policy's,"
good,"Great co- workers, fun work experience, great customers. lack of general managers people skills."
good,Trying to succeed in a male dominated industry. There was work that was geared towards women and work done specfically done by the men. Interested to learn about engines and fuel systems. Not given the chance.
good,typical retail - enjoyed working with people - hated not knowing schedule until last minute.
good,"Actually enjoyed this job, only wish that the hours were consistent, but it is retail and i was the fresh face but overall nice place to work at."
good,"Work part time selling to the D.I.Y., Commercial Accounts, store planograms and inventory control. Good group of people to work with and service oriented"
good,I love the interaction with different people and to help making sure that places got their parts in a timely manner
good,The hardest part of my job was working third shift. That was real challenging because i had never done it and i had a small child at the time
good,The work was easy
good,i had a good time working here if i could i would work here again everyone was friendly when i first started working there and this was my first time working at a warehouse everyone took me under there wing even the manger and showed me the ropes
good,"The work is non stop. We have to meet standards every day which in itself is not hard, but it wears on you after a while. I have learned how to operate two types of industrial trucks here. The management and my co-workers are great but the job is too time consuming with 16+ hours of mandatory overtime each week for up to 3 or 4 weeks at a time."
good,"This was a great company. I was the delivery driver; my day consisted of delivering parts with in 20 miles of the shop. When not on deliveries I helped with unloading trucks, stocking, cleaning and helping at the front desk."
good,"Was a great place to work. that you give everything you could think of giving, then you get fired on the spot for something not even in the handbook, im so glad i gave 3+ years of my life with nothing to show."
good,All in all advance is a good place to work here in crawfordville i think changes trully need to be made with the staff.
good,My phone number is this them children are you going to be in a car with me for tomorrow at home but it was the same as the last one I sent to your email
good,I started work here after a short stint at another autoparts store. I had lots of fun here even though the pay was slightly less. I strived to do better everyday and would have loved to continue if it wasnt for the changing of managers as often as a haircut.
good,Good starter for do-it-yourselfers to know the people.  Logistics could be rethought from the run-of-the mill warehousing operations to maximize efficiencies.  Very good people to understand personal needs.
good,"It’s a good place to work if you’re wanting part time, not much room to move up to full time because it’s a small work environment, not many employees."
good,It is a good place to be. Not very much room to advance to management. Customers have to have patience. The place has atmosphere. Good place to work and learn.
good,"A.A.P. is an awesome company to work for, especially if you're looking for a job that offers quite a bit of overtime. The job (No matter what department you're in) will be fast-paced, which is something I've always looked for in a new job. The management team genuinely cares about their team, and is always willing to help in anyway they can whether it's a personal issue, or work related. Safety is also a HUGE concern to all of us who work here."
good,Needs help with work life balance. They require you to schedule yourself for a MINIMUM of 50 hours per week with meal breaks NOT included in that schedule. That roughly translates to 53-55 hours per week. Be prepared for non stop 60+ hour weeks
good,Love coming in chatting with different ppl and awesome working with auto parts. love  the flexibility and the atmosphere. The co workers are always eager to help if need a hand.
good,"It's always great that I count all the inventory to reduce shrinkage. Customers are relying on me to fix there problems, everyday I get to make smiles on others faces."
good,"Good place to work. Never had an issue, very flexible. Is a great place if you need a part time and are into cars. Decent discount, feel like they could give a bit of a bigger one but overall good place to work."
good,"The first 5 years was great then the staff overthrew my manager by lies and taking advantage of his health. Left for a year to another area, I was fine but the commute versus pay was ridiculous. Came back to my original store and the mgmt cheated me on sales, were fraudulent in return practices. I reported it to DM but it was too late. My position was ended in most stores and it took a year for them to prove and fire all three culprits."
good,"- Took great care of customers providing excellent service to those in need. "
good,"Working here was one of the most rewarding jobs I had in previous years. While learning different automotive parts, I also had experienced trainers who taught closing procedures and management skills."
good,"Who your management is can make a large impact on the experience you have working here, some managers and higher ups can make working here unbearable, however most are not like that."
good,This company is very customer focused. They do all they can to please the customers. The best part of the job is the customers that come in regularly.
good,"Company cuts hrs all the time no overtime no holidays off except for Christmas "
good,Working the years I did at Advance Auto Parts I learned things I never thought I would. it was a place where I grew in many ways both personally and professionally.
good,Very low wages with a very high turn over rate.  There is room for advancement throughout the store and areas if you are deemed management material by one of the district mangers or above.  Good part time position for some extra cash but not a career opportunity in my opinion.
good,Felt like you as an individual can  grow and learn something about vehicles. I felt like they needed advance from with-in the company instead of looking outside of the company.
good,"Things stayed pretty busy to keep you moving, no time to sit and be bored. The pay was very acceptable, and the hours were very reasonable and flexible."
good,"I was a delivery driver at AAP"
good,"I think this is a good place to work but, just need to be more organized and supervised because some workers really do their job but,  some just don’t and just walk around and or pick just easy work to do and seems like no one do anything about it."
good,It’s a great company to work with and you do learn about things you may know already know or didn’t know. It does have its pros and cons. Basically it depends on who you are working with and what the environment is like in the area you work at.
good,I enjoyed working there it was fast paced and I liked working in that environment people were nice and we felt like a team helping each other out. I left for lack of pay and full time
good,Great company to work for. Professionally driven company with high expectation. If you are self motivated and driven for personal success this is the place for you.
good,"They have health insurance, 401k so it’s not a bad place to work if you have no warehouse experience. Was good for me to learn a lot of things. Management was good but other employees were disrespectful to anyone that is new even after 5 months."
good,"Receiving the store truck, preparing callbacks, defects, new returns, cores to be wrapped to go back on truck. Management functions such as purchasing, budgeting, accounting and personnel work, in addition to supervisory duties. Strong knowledge of automotive systems, categories of merchandise, company policies and warranties."
good,Part time delivery driver.  Very low pay for the position and extremely strict  driving rules.  Vehicles are monitored to know your driving habits every second behind the wheel.  Part time work still means 35 hours a week.
good,Advance Auto Parts should have been more in tune to employees needs Advance had no security in place for team members I feel like team members were neverconsider first for jobs they would always hire outside first. Women would be overlooked when promotion time come up .They were just as qualified for the job Advance Auto Parts would project some of the most unreachable sales goals in some stores where the demographics changed.I enjoyed the challenge but lest be realistic. I believe that it takes teamwork in order to build a good team .Meaning help starting from the top in order to be successful.The scheduling the under staffing was a big problem.
good,Fun and laid back atmosphere with good people to work with.I am working part time with flexible hours. Would like to find employment working days through the week with no late hours.
good,In my many years we ha a lot of upper management turnover. This also caused a lot of middle management turnover. Everyone that came in has a new vision.
good,I was ok. Relax place to work. Little to no room for advancement. The pay was low. The manager was very helpful. The training program is very informative.
good,Great place to work and has a good workplace culture. Most days are good and flied with lots of things to do. Some times you don't have time to do everything that is needed to get done but we make due with what we have.
good,Good place to start working in the Automotive industry they reward you for the things you do right and teach you about the things you do wrong great people
good,I've learned a lot about cars from this job that I can use during my daily life. I would reccomend that most people work their front counter at least 6 months.
good,"Great training, great store and middle management, but upper management seemed to lose focus of realistic goals and measures at store level.  Other than that all around great company to work for."
good,"Relatively easy place to work. Fast paced, simple, automotive/retail work. Pay is decent but atmosphere is pretty good. Overall can be a fun place to work"
good,"I started working at Advance Auto Parts in 2015; this was my first job. Within six months, I received my first raise due to exceeding sales goals. Within the first year, I was promoted to manager. My four years within this company has been a complete joy. I enjoy having the ability to come up with plans that help our store exceed sales goals. The most challenging part of the job is also my favorite part as well, solving issues for our commercial customers. By addressing these problems, I have created many lasting relationships that are built on trust."
good,"It has been years since working there but I thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with this company, I was able to learn about management, being a team player and motivater."
good,"Lower level management were beneficial to learning more about automobile parts."
good,"I eoyed my time working with this Company. Made a few friends, and got along wqell with my Coworkers. I had no problem with helping a co-worker out when they needed help."
good,Goid fair managers who push you to exceed your sales goals. Customers are absolutely awesone as they make the job better. You meet all types of individuals as everyone jas a car thatneeds a part or two.
good,Good place to work as a stepping stone to prep you for a more prosperous career. Scheduling is very open. This allowed me to further my education at college.
good,"I started right out of high school and worked there for 5 years. I started out as a part time employee and when i left i was a "
good,"Normal daily store operation"
good,"Would recommend for knowledgeable people. Its fast paces but npt taxing. Its is number orientated. The staff is great. The management is awesome. I enjoy the job, i dont feel as thougbt im compemsated fairly."
good,Great atmoshere to work in. Friendly environment.  I worked there while in high school.  The hours were very flexible.  It was also a very fun place to work
good,"Was an easy job, management while I was there wasn't too great, money wasn't good considering how much the customers actually expect you to know, as if we were mechanics"
good,"this is a great company. it is simple, be at work on time and meet you sales goals in order to keep your employment active. so its entirely up to you if you keep your job"
good,Positive place to worki've been with advance auto parts for three years they try to help you as much as they can for understanding about life situations and they try to help as much as possible they have compassion and understanding with the management it's kind a like a family
good,Advance Auto was a very cool place to work if you enjoy learning about cars and ow things work. I really enjoyed the people I met and the people I worked with.
good,Overall good work place. Get to meet great customers. Helps increase customer service skills as well as parts knowledge. Sometimes stressful dealing with customers and management but team effort and communication is key to successfull work place.
good,"Poor hourly wages, excellent ability to expand your knowledge within the automotive industry, while spending time with like minded individuals who have a passion for cars."
good,"I like the job I just need more hours to be able to pay bills good job for a retired person definitely not a career place , overall the job is a good place to work they co workers are great and if you have questions they are willing to help"
good,"its a change from my last auto parts job, which is why i came to this company, but the management is very rude,unfair, lacks good verbal communication skills, company could pay overtime and reward employees better"
good,"So far, good..just started working for advanced auto. They provided a uniform, work conditions and environment is acceptable, personnel are pleasant, is possible to work extra hours."
good,"Worked here for little over a year. Its an easy job if you know quite a bit about cars and car parts. In the time I worked here I did learn some valuable knowledge. Selling parts is not all you do though, of course you have other things to do like inventory but with all the new rules and changes they're bringing to the company it became more stressful than what it needs to be. Assisting customers is the easy part, but then again its retail, not all customers will be the same or polite."
good,Great job as of the company training but being a General manager you don't have much time off and work to many unpaid hours. I had a great Dm and had no problem with working beside him.
good,I enjoyed my time at Advance. The structure allowed me to advance form sales though district manager and corporate training positions. I would recommend this company for younger people who are driven to succeed and willing to move for promotion. The only negative is they do not value tenured team members and trend to discard them in favor of younger and cheaper
good,Lots of dealing with the public and finding out different things about cars and trucks chance to help people figure out tricky situations easy job not a lot of physical work
good,I would separate parts good and bad and sort the parts back on the shelf in the warehouse.. and we would put all the product back into the system to be either thrown out or go back to the stores.
good,"management like dms,ceos and coos etc,need to come and work in a store for a week then see if they need to send all the lists of things to be done on an hourlyb basis"
good,"typical day at work would vary somedays your busy all day others are very slow, I learned something new every week, very friendly workplace, good management"
good,A nice place to work.  Salary is low so don't expect to have a growing bank account.  Benefits are typical Obama Care that you pay high co-pays.  You're now paying more for healthcare that before Obama Care.
good,"Wish it never moved to Virginia from Nevada.  I got very used to the work and made great relationships with our outside team, our customers and the team company wide.  I would have liked to see the product get to the level I know that it will."
good,"First management position so I can't really say much as to what stood out from the normal. Standard opening closing shifts, we had our schedules a week or so in advance and very seldom had a security issue. Overall I would recommend."
good,I deliver auto parts all day and put away stock. You would learn about auto parts and the systems in a vehicle that make up a car. Workplace is different people from different backgrounds and how well we can get along as a team to get things done. No real hard parts to job when you have others to consult with which is enjoyable to learn from. Nice to meet customers and learn from them as well as show them something also.
good,"Advance Auto Parts was a good place to work and the business was decent. But, the company itself was just terrible. They didn't do anything whenever the stores ask."
good,"As a mananger, advance expects at least 50 hours a week. They also expect managers to work every Friday and Saturday. The training is minimal when you become a manager, and it can become a thankless job. In other roles, I would suggest people work for Advance."
good,Most days a nice place to be.  When the team gets along and enjoys working together the time just passes quickly.  The hardest part of the job is needing a ladder to get parts down.
good,"Advance auto talked a good game, but when it came right down to it they didn't promote from with in they just move current manager around. I learned a lot and they made me a better person for it."
good,Great work environment with ability to learn and teach car repair or diagnosing for customers.  Working with management to build a better career and build a relationship with customers.
good,"It's a great simple job, but unless you go into management, you can't expect to make much. Considering the fact that i was in school when i worked there and only working part-time, the greatest part about the job was the fact that they close at 9. Most part-time jobs are open till 11 or midnight. The worst part of the job was the fact that they offer you a discount for working there, but then turnaround and offer the same discount to anyone who orders their parts online. Felt like a slap in the face."
good,Advance has been a good company to me.  A typical day consist of helping customers find solutions to their problems.  The culture is a customer satisfaction.
good,"I had many jobs, order taking and filling, delivering them and collect accounts at the end of the day.  I stocked shelves, replaced batteries and wipers."
good,"Its been almost 13 years since I worked at this establishment. I enjoyed it a lot of day. I was promoted relatively quickly with a good increase in pay at each level. I never made it past assistant manager because I was fired for something the manager had done on multiple times. I just never said anything because I thought we had each others back. "
good,"Great place to work as long as you know auto parts. and have some knowledge of computers and stocking shelves. You also have to know how to run machines, and install wiper blades."
good,Help customers look for parts over the phone & as they visit in store. You may have to change a few batteries each day depending on the location. Overall not a hard place to work.
good,Advance is a decent place to work. Most stores have fair management and good people working with you. Flexible hours with the ability to move up in status.
good,decent place to work.  good people. good discounts.  flexible hours.  decent benefits.  good for part-time work. management is ok.  I have work for far worst companies
good,Decent store and people. I religiously recommend this place as a customer as well as a former employee for friends looking to get a job. There is rarely any point where I had ridiculous amounts of stress from working here.
good,"They will let you go no matter how good your work is, not a place where you will have a job when you come in and they know you may need help when you can’t get it done all by urself"
good,I loved the work. I had a company vehicle and it was nice to be able to drive about and deliver parts. At the time My daughter developed epilepsy so I had to stay home more.
good,"I picked and pulled parts to deliver to different shops or other stores. I also stocked shelves with new product changed windshield wipers,batteries and also helped customers"
good,"I learned how to multitask, customer service, product information, speaking skills, car management, time assessment, personnel management as well as store opening and closing operations."
good,The company was not bad to work for. But employees had a difficult time balancing between family and work. I felt the with the company you felt like a number rather than a person.
good,"No two days are alike. Each day comes with new and difficult challenges. With new days come new policies, and new rules to govern the business. It is always a new day."
good,fun place to work at you get to learn about lots of new things about cars like all of the parts also sometimes it is fun with actual customers its like working on a project and you are like the main help because you are the one to look up the parts i can say the saddest part of my days were when we didn't have a customers part in stock  to me it was like a fail but always ended up getting the part from ware house or another store
good,Great atmosphere with opportunity to grow. My managers are very helpful and willing to help when needed. Co-workers are also helpful and willing to lend a hand. Look forward to growing with the company.
good,working Here really helped me learn alot about auto parts in general. Great coworkers. it was really just about making the day go by. never a dull moment.
good,"I am a department manger that over see the receiving department, and 43 team member.  Responsible for scheduling of all shipment inbound into the DC.  Documenting all discrepancies from the vendor's.  Recording team members hourly time as well as any personal time they use (sick or Vacation).  We are a strong team orientated company that strides for safety as our #1 goal.  The  most enjoyable aspect of my job is working side by side with my employees getting to learn about them and them teaching me things that make me a stronger manager for the future."
good,Under different leader ship it would be a fantastic job. As long as everyone pulls there weight the job is great. But there are those with in the company whom I sure would know a belt from a hose if they where not told.
good,"Overall my experience with Advance is a positive one, I enjoy educating myself and customers about vehicles. It's probably my favorite part of the job going outside checking out customers vehicles and giving them piece of mind. Parts delivery is another enjoyable aspect of the job, the change of pace; listening to my own music and driving is therapeutic at times. The schedule as a part-timer can vary, in my experience it isn't uncommon for a different schedule every week. One with both opening and closing shifts. All the managers both store and upper level I've met are cool guys to work with, really the only bad thing I can say about the job is the pay. All in all, if you're looking for a good, mostly relaxed job to supplement your income or to work while going to school, this jobs for you."
good,Enjoyed the customer interaction. I like working on vehicles and researching part compatibility for their vehicles. I would work there again if the pay were more.
good,"a great atmosphere, great co-workers to work with, flexible hours,  management works side by side with you at times, on the job learning experience, paid training ,"
good,"all things in consideration not just a job, can grow and learn with company, can be a fun and learning experience, could also be a learning tool for other jobs"
good,"Typical retail establishment.  As a store manager long hours were expected of you. The company was excellent to work for with great benefits, but the staffing model had problems. As a store manager, the level of responsibility was impressive. You were responsible for everything, and that provided a challenge."
good,Being in a supervisory role at that time and with promises of advancement I was asked to work many late hours doing inventory for the higher management. After months of doing these long hours and the higher ups not keeping promises I had to relocate and get away from bad decisions of over working myself and not getting any return.
good,traveled the eastern states for weeks at a time setting up new stores and training employees but got old after a few years and wanted to come home to get married and work in town
good,"Was room for advancement early on. Not so much room to move up now. Most of our Techs have 10+ years with the company. Vacation time starts out at one week per year for first year, two weeks the next, three weeks after seven and finally four weeks after fifteen."
good,"Working for Advance Auto Parts i compare to working for Autozone Auto parts, its very retail DIY oriented.  THey aare attempting to get into the commercial market to compete with the established chains in the area.  They lack the proper supply chain, they are too upper management heavy,and the Regional and district management does nothing to either make nothing better for the counter and store management. They are quick to criticize but offer no raises, no bonus incentives, they have never worked the counter but hand down orders that make no sense and store layout make no sense either..The parts cataloging system,  is incomplete , inconsistent, slow and very counter productive."
good,It was great when I first started. The people where friendly and seemed to be in it to help you advance. I found out quickly that upper management was not there to help you but help themselves. It took me 9 years to make Manager but even then I was given a not so good store. I did meet some great people who were will to help me and I thank them.
good,"Would go back if I was offered a store manager position. Needs to have more classes on how to be a decent manager and make better decisions. Was a fun, good place to work for about 3yrs like the fact that they will last for ASE certificates"
good,"I loved working here, and being able to build clientele, having customers coming to me for help because they trusted me was always great to feel. It was an easy place to learn, and being part of management was great."
good,"Good company to work for, friendly environment and plenty to keep you busy. Overall pleasant company. Just was not a career choice or me for long term."
good,"It is a good job and perfect part time job for someone who can not work full time, It can also turn into a good career if you like retail and the automotive parts industry. I had a great store manager and got along with most of my co workers and even if i didn't get along with a co worker there was never a conflict of any sort because of my belief that the work place is not a place for personal emotions or vendettas. The hardest part of the job is when new people get hired that become your co workers and do not always have the same work ethic as you and gradually become unreliable. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to still be connected to the industry I went to school for and seeing how different shops operate and interact with part suppliers. Another enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with a manager you respect and admire as well as getting to know some of the other co workers that you begin to build a foundation of respect and friendship by working with them on a day to day basis."
good,I loved working for Advance Auto Parts. The management at my location as well as district manager were the worst. Manager was not very bright the DM would screw you iver like they did me. Company as a whole good to work for as long as you have good managemnet and district managers.
good,Working here was a good experience but did not have much room for advancement.  If higher positions became available they always go to outside and hardly ever promote from within.  Pay rate was not worth it.
good,Lack of emphasis on employee and lip service to customer service. The acquisition of CARQUEST has been a bad transition. Delay in becoming one causing customer and employee frustration. Inventory and pricing issues. Economies of scale should allow Advance Auto to be the market setter and is playing second fiddle to Auto Zone.
good,"From running hub, delivering parts, stocking parts, taking out the  garbage, fixing inventory, assisting retail customers when needed ,locating paperwork, scheduling maintenance for the store; sometimes all of it happens at once and you've got to pace yourself to not lose grip."
good,"Theres alot to learn working in an auto parts store, lots of parts and car knowledge needed to work with customers, management was poor at the time due to a lack of a store manager."
good,This is an excellent company to work for. I learned a alot about the parts world while i was there. had a great experience. management was fantastic. The best part of the job was the customers.
good,I liked the job and the people but I left the state so I had to go d a new job for where I was moving to. The people were so nice and welcoming and really showed me what was up!
good,Good place to work at. Paid vacations and sick time only if full time. Pay could be better. Competitive company. Oil prices are too high compared to surrounding stores.
good,"a typical day at advanced depending on the store and manager is good, the company is very under paid but that is what you get for working in retail. other than that it isnt very hard of a job"
good,Very customer oriented and great employee relationships. A typical day would include greeting customers and helping them find parts for their vehicles.
good,"Learned a lot of vehicles and how to trouble shoot problems."
good,"Typical work day of 8-9 hours, along with dealing with customers, inventory, and other job requirements."
good,"I no longer work here but when I did it was a very nice place to work, I learned a lot about cars and people. I would also like the chance to forward the job to other people."
good,"It's a decent job you start out at $10 a hr for days $11 for nights/weekend shift. No ac so it got during the summer. Most people don't advance in the company due to management, supervisor, or assistant being rarely open"
good,"While a typical hub maintains revenue streams from store to store fulfillment, commercial counter sales, internet and retail sales , the importance of inventory integrity was critically essential."
good,"Monitor project progress with Meetings, Email, One on One visits. Prepare budgets, monitor invoices. Meetings with resource managers to line up IT resource schedules for projects"
good,"Overall, not a bad company to work for. Your experience is dependent on your particular store dynamic of course. Overall, I have enjoyed helping customers to find the parts they needed with this company."
good,This is a simple stepping stone to some in the auto industry. Especially for those looking to be parts pro's. People who work here get good experience for moving on to bigger things in the auto parts industry.
good,"busy in and out of store to deliver part to mechanics. helpful customer service. all employees work as stock person. great management, wonderful co-workers."
good,"Very good customer satisfaction rating, good place to work, a lot of good knowledge was taken from this job and helped a lot of customers get the right parts and answer the questions correctly"
good,Large warehouse. A few hundred employees. Very diverse community. Strict attendance policy. Lots of advancement opportunies. Decent benefits. Good company
good,"Customer service, training.  The management was lax but the employees knew their jobs so didnt need to be micro managed. Hardest part of job was trying to get employees to show up for work."
good,They have great benefits and have different varieties of job and positions. They also are always staying busy and productive. They also have different views and opinions of the company.
good,I just feel like it is not the support that I expected with this company reason why I say that is because I could not get any support from my district manager
good,Very fast paced but as long as you had the items in and the equipment was ready a smooth day you would have. The employees were easy to get along with
good,"Advance Auto Parts had a pretty flexible work schedule. I worked 8-5 Monday - Friday,so I personally had a good work/life balance. I worked there 5yrs, but the store permanently closed and relocated out of state."
good,Advance Auto Parts is a good company but doesn't pay their workers very well. It's a lot of things that you have to deal with on a daily basis that coperate doesn't understand. You do have a great chance of meeting amazing and caring people but also be aware that you will have a fairshare of unruly customers. I've learned a lot about cars and car parts. Overall it was a pretty good experience.
good,If you like working parts then this is the place for you although there upper management doesn't seem to be involved in the ways they need to be the system is very easy to learn and there second sourcing for parts is amazing
good,"It was a busy environment. You deal with customers and sometimes it's quite challenging. You learn a lot along the way. If you're a positive person, working here would be worth it."
good,"I haven""t ever worked for a company where it might take twenty years of employment with a company to reach top pay. Then the fact that other similar companies doing the same basic functions that we do start out more than what are top pay is."
good,decent company to work for if your right out of high school or need a job while in college. nice to share experience with customers with their issues on their vehicles.
good,The sales environment is exciting and it's easy to achieve a sense of true accomplishment as you help customers find what they need. I enjoy working there and can see many places where I could advance in a career.
good,"The staff was great to work with and I enjoyed going to work every day. Flexible work schedule, fair wage, and able to learn a lot. Very fast paced environment."
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts taught me so much. Advance was my first job. Being at Advance taught me how to handle difficult customers, that you will not be able to please every customer no matter how hard you try, taught me how to be not only a manager but a leader."
good,"An interesting job where your main job is to get parts for the customers and maintain the store. The company is mostly concerned with the numbers and doesn't invest a lot in their employees. Due to staggering competition, the management is willing to hire anyone as long as they have some automotive experience."
good,Delivery of automotive parts to commercial accounts.  Unloading and stocking two weekly trucks.  Inventory back stock items from truck and pull for shelves.
good,"Team members were great, some inconsistency but overall a good company. Long days work with minimal results. Benefits were good for what they offered."
good,"The day would consist of cleaning and making customers were taking care of. What I learned ,at the company, was there is many different car products and many different products that can be used for the same purpose. The management was not the best but they did have your back. The hardest part about the job would be nothing. The job to me was very easy. The enjoyable part of the job was seeing the crew."
good,Its a interesting job and most of the time you learn something new every day even though customers that come in are bitter and some are not but co workers are easy going and very understandable
good,"OK place to work."
good,"typical fast paced work days"
good,Advance is more scripted than other parts places. certain sales requirements are required in order to gain advancement. Training is sometimes provided to help but not always.
good,"sometimes very long work days. Learned a lot about the automotive industry. Management was horrible couldn't keep one long enough, you have your regular complaints changing batteries, making a customers day."
good,advanced auto parts and batteries is a standard retail job. there is little room to advance because they prefer to hire from outside rather than promote from within the company
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. i learned a lot in my year of employment. the workplace is very laid back and professional. the hardest part of the job would probably be learning all the vehicle parts.
good,was really busy but handable. lie to make and push the team to make daily goals. always motivated for be productive and make the team day by day better.
good,If you have some basic car knowledge then it should come to you pretty easy. The people I worked with made it pretty fun and enjoyable. A lot of the work was also inventory based.
good,I learned a lot about organization and fast but good work in this job. My store went through a change while I worked there and I was able to participate in the reorganization of the store after that change took place.
good,"Daily duties were more physical. Was definitely a great place to keep fit."
good,"employees were really great, management was very nice, able to build relationship with many great customer, learned a lot about the automotive industry"
good,Extremely poor hourly wage for what is required of you.  Learned a lot of valuable knowledge such as inventory and cycle counts as well as general knowledge about vehicles.
good,"Advance / Carquest continues to develop an unsurpassable suite of Business Solutions Services, Maintenance Products, Parts, Tools, Equipment, Product and Technical Training."
good,Nice place to work and fun to help people out with their parts. Good job for  someone who is looking for a few hours and likes to drive parts to garages.
good,Getting to know about Auto parts and components about vehicle and servicing customers on a day by day basis. Somedays  it can be labor intensive but other than that not much is over extensive. Solid management for the most part but she's been currently absent due to injuries but to my knowledge she has returned.
good,"I really enjoyed to work for this company , the people was great and this management was good also only on overnights.  Now they are hard on the calls out i just wish when personal life things happen they weren't that bad about it. You see them more than your family but it was worth it I wish I could go back"
good,pay not good for parts store. not enough parts experence in stores. overall love the parts life and hope too manage a store one day. i moved in december and have been tring to get a transfer and still have not gotten a transfer yet. i now live 31 miles from work .
good,Great opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the work and deal with the industry issues that arise with the wholesale customers.
good,Great pay and benefits. I learned how to operate a business successfully. The hardest part of the job is trying to find a balance between my work and home life. The most enjoyable part was working with my team and customers.
good,"Great experience especially if you enjoy automotive items. Pay seems low for entry level positions causing high retention. Poor store structure causes slashed hours and higher responsibilities as a result: long hours, extra days poor work/ family balance."
good,"Selling auto parts is an interesting job because you may need to assist in diagnosing a customers vehicle, so its kind of like a constant puzzle which i enjoyed very much, very helpful staff."
good,It is always a plus working for a growing company. Within any district level there is always room for advancement within the stores. Paid holidays plus vacation and sick time are nice benefits.
good,I very much enjoyed my time working with this company. I acquired many skills in both stock and retail areas. I learned a lot while I was working for this company. This skill set that I have learned is applicable to many future career opportunities.
good,"This job was a great way to learn parts and doing retail at the same time. I didn't like I had to fight for full time hours at my location but I managed. See a lot of people and get knowledge from customers and co workers. If the benefits and pay were better, I would have stayed. I loved it there."
good,"cars are the most money draining thing on the road,working at Advance I saved a lot of money by training and experience that I still use today on my own cars"
good,"Good job for younger responsible adults. Bonus available at management positions based on making store sales goal and individual sales goal. Tough to advance when some managers want to keep you on their team and not allow you to grow on your own team. Upper management is often out of touch with the day today and only use compiled metrics as measurements for success. Finding the right location, team and schedule can make you very happy within the company."
good,"As a driver, my day consisted of many runs to and from customer shops delivering merchandise. I would also assist in store when needed."
good,"Great part time job, low stress, and flexible. Nice long runs to Mesquite other destinations. Organized and helpful. Nice hour long  lunches. Great for a mom or student."
good,"The company is strong in customer service, great to put customers first. How ever they seem to be following the competition (Internet Access, Reward Program, etc.). "
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a typical Corporate America company.  There have been a lot of changes over the past several years, some good, some not so good.  Most of the people are really nice and good to work with."
good,"fast paced work environment when busy must be tuned in when helping customer get the right part the first time, along with doing so in a timely manner."
good,"Great place to work, I enjoyed my co-workers.  It was a fun environment, I also enjoyed my customers, I just wish it paid more."
good,"My typical day is meeting with business partners and software developers on maintenance and enhancements.  Also managed several IT HR Projects through the SDLC process.  Advance was a good company and believes in team management."
good,Responsible for managing commercial customers in my territory. Working with the store team aid me in building relationships with our customers. I learned to improve my time management skills to create greater success in this role. I enjoyed understanding client's purchase motivators and allowed that to help drive my sales.
good,great part time job that I get to help people get everything to make their repair or service their vehicles. it is a rewarding experience
good,"Fast-paced environment. Willing to allow you to grow, while providing support to your endeavors. Overall, a great place to brush up on automotive knowledge and know-how."
good,"Started out as a fun work environment, while getting everything done properly.  Cycle counts were done on a regular basis.  Most of it was about numbers and inventory, with equal responsibility amoungst coworkers.  In my position, I had the responsibilities of safe, register counting, sales, cleaning and organizing the store.  Now, with rules changing in corporate there are a lot of people being let go or transferring.  I am not willing to transfer and I have a child that I enjoy spending time with that with this job, I am unable to do so because of being so short handed within the company.  I am looking for a job that will allow decent hours to work, and also allow decent time for family.  I am a very family oriented person and working at Advance Auto Parts does not allow me to be as much as I would like."
good,Its a great company to work for but i have a family and need a little more pay and hours in order to succeed in life. The managers is very friend and understanding
good,Perfect place to enjoy working for and being taught how to learn the industry.The hardest part of the job was there wasn't enough time in the day.
good,Best value on automotive parts. Helpful staff. the knowledge of the staff goes above and beyond expectations. Would recommend for anyone entry level or someone looking to further their employment in the automotive world.
good,I enjoyed this position. It required local travel which I liked.  I didn't like when I had to travel out of town because I am a single dad who is raising a 10 year old daughter.
good,great company to work for. great benefits and potential room for advancement and fun environment friendly staff and customs
good,"Company has a combination of legacy burdens as well as solid, forward-looking momentum. Workplace style varies by location.  A great place to work."
good,taking orders making orders cleaning store stocking store cleaning bathrooms cleaning grills cleaning fryers dealing with angry customers all for minimum wage
good,Good staff and flexible schedule. Company gives good info on getting the job done if needed help. not confined to just working one particular position
good,The gentlemen there were eager to teach me where and how parts worked in vehicles. Even though they worked to make their own monthly quota they would help me to make mine as well.
good,"Each day varies, some co-workers are very professional, others not so much. Usually it depends on who you are working with on what kind of day you are going to have."
good,"Physical Demands"
good,"Great Company, has a strong vision. Growing pains currently to work through. Strong focus on the commercial account business and needs."
good,"the job  was decent, yet not very challenging, I like to be challenged at my work place. The staff and I got along well, yet I felt like my skills were not really tested in that field."
good,It was a good job to have for learning auto parts and customer service skills. I also learned how to do inventory and management skills.
good,Polaris is a good place to work. Busy a typical day would be watching the conveyor belt well product was coming done to your line.Making sure product didn't jam line up.
good,"Fast promotion. Heavy on pushing sales in new markets."
good,"Had some great District Leaders, and most of my best friends I worked with within the company. Days can be physically & mentally exhausting, but felt rewarded at the end of a shift. Wish there was a way to have more weekends off with family."
good,"I spend my day driving to "
good,work was fun it was a friendly place very relaxed. The managers new were to draw the line in between work and play. only down side to this was the pay.
good,Easy and a lot of down time. Click like setting of a boys club. Spent most of my day standing around because there was not a lot to do.
good,"Typical day is one day a week on average for 4 hours.  Learned people skills and interaction with customer focus. Management changes often, so learn new management requirements."
good,The day to day routine was always something new. From hunting down parts to replacing batteries to even having to put away parts that came in on the truck. overall the store was always running smoothly.
good,Very easy place to     work but the pay isn't very good.Alot of   the workers become lazy and want to stand behind the counter.The hardest part is dealig with customers who are reluctant to comply.
good,"Fun filled day everyday. Many great people to work with! Great locations, great stores. I learn a great day about leadership skills. Hardest part of the job was opening new stores, but it also was a great experience."
good,The hours were a little harsh but the job was fun at times. It can get tough when employees usually slack all in all the workplace was fair
good,I was responsible for running the operations in the receiving department. I was the manager on 1st and 3rd shift. I also stocked and put away freight as some of my job duties
good,Advance is a great place to get retail experience but to me it is not a career. There just isn't enough money involved to be able to have a family
good,A fun job when I was in high school met a lot of cool people and learned a lot about cars. Management was fair I had a good time coming to work everyday.
good,advance auto parts is a very good company to work for good pay and the company is moving in the right direction with growth and good people
good,Overall great place to work at if you enjoy working and talking bout cars all the time people are great but management os a little slow when it comes to certain requests.
good,"From start to finish you are working on tasks, customers, employees, inventory, etc. "
good,"Review sales reports, check e-mails, call on customers for potential sales and push sale items. I've learned inventory management. Having co-workers that want to work towards the same goals is great but if not, it makes it the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer needs you to find a part for his customer and that request is made and his customer is happy with his service."
good,A positive environment to keep customers coming back into both your store as well as Advance Auto Parts across the country. Workers are free to bring complaints to management and can be reassured that their input will be looked at and problem which occur will be addressed.
good,"•	Maintained close relations with product vendors as well as leading competitors"
good,You can start from the bottom as a part time sales person and be a GM or DL within several years.
good,"learn alot of skills in inventory and management. Budgeting , record keeping, setting displays, working on vehicle such as installing batteries, insatalling headlights, windshield wipers"
good,"A typical day at work involves shipping product, running computers, driving a forklift and help training new employees in the shipping processes."
good,"- Demonstrated excellent customer service"
good,Working for this company was not bad. They always have your back and hey would never allow customers to talk down to you
good,"Typical day: Always busy, Learned: about vehicles and their parts, Management:could have been better, Most Co Workers acted as if the store was theirs, Hardest Part of the Job: dealing with the co-workers and their lack of interest for their jobs, Most Enjoyable Part of my Job: serving all of my commercial account customers and making sure they were happy."
good,"Grap a company car - Reviewing costomers orders - make sure that all parts had the correct P/N - moving to customers - answering all customers questions"
good,staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. store is team oriented
good,Deliver parts and assist customers with commercial and diy.
good,Working here gives you the opportunity to learn so much about cars and helping people with theirs after you've learned a few things makes you feel pretty good just knowing that you were able to help
good,"I was employed by this company and worked with them for 6 months. I took a better job for advancement. The is strong and treat their employees fairly and pay is very good, would not hesitate to go back to work for them."
good,"The store I was at was extremely unorganized and management was few and far between. When I was ""taught"" something, everyone had their own way of doing it so I was always told I was doing it wrong. Higher management(corporate) hardly knew anything and could barely answer questions I had about the store or how to move up. Everyone is very ""out for their self"" around there and will tell you one thing then turn around and pin you for anything just to make them look better. I enjoyed working with a few employees from time to time but overall I would never go back nor recommend any stay there very long! They will claim to pay you well while other auto parts stores laugh at your wages."
good,"worked at Advance for a while, moved up quite fast. managers are willing to move you up in the ranks, as long as you are dedicated and put the effort in."
good,"fun atmosphere, fair management, good benefits."
good,Good company to work for really enjoyed working with my commercial accounts.
good,Good place to work. Offers benefits to full time employees.
good,"overall a good place to work. days start off early in the morning with pulling tickets for customers.  Then we received in merchandise from our replinishment truck, dont have parts on the shelf...you cant sell them.  learned P&L, budgeting, conflict resolution, HR policy and procedures."
good,I enjoyed this job. It was the beginning of my last 2 years. I was low man on the totem pole but enjoyed driving all over town delivering parts. I loved my shops. I just couldn't advance in the store I was in so that was a downfall.
good,Advance Auto distribution is a good place to work if you like to work independently. There is a healthy amount of team work involved but its also necessary to work independently. There is a good management team to lead everyone and overall its a decent place to work.
good,"This job has taught me a lot, from dealing with different kind of cars and their owners. Its fun you never know what to expect. Someone  can come in and you can help them out with a problem that they have had for a while. In those moment you help gratefully that you could just help out."
good,"Great workplace"
good,"On a Typical day I am on that cant just stand still always have to be doing something. Other employees can just stand there and do nothing which my job a little harder! I have talked to my boss about it and not sure if she has said anything to them. I do enjoy working with everyone we all get alone great. I have learned a lot about cars how to take care of them also how to do basic fixing on them. The most enjoyable part of my day is saving money for my customers when they don't see the deal in the flyers and the get almost the same product I sausages this and will save them a lot. they usually go or it! this is only a part time job witch is just not enough for me anymore"
good,"Pay could be better, but it was a fun place to work and the stuff were cool and friendly."
good,As any job. It depends on how your boss it. Can be fun. But don't expect much pay.
good,"The position that I was hired into had changed over the years. I am all  for change if the change is for the good. My position started out with 3 or 4 responsibilities which changed into alot of responsibilities, which was everything but being the GM.  I liked working there because of the customers and I liked helping people. I always seemed to learn something new each day. I think the biggest problem with the company is the employees in the stores are greatly underappreciated."
good,Great work place....Became second assistant manager within 6 weeks
good,hardest part of working in auto part would have to be installing a product for a customer on a bad day. the crew was friendly and very helpful to staff and customers equally. the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and working with all types of cars
good,"Great benefits. relax work environment, hard working people, overall great company to work for."
good,this was good entry job to gain automotive knowledge along with customer service trainning
good,"Customer service, i learned to handle Commercial Accounts as well as collections on these accounts."
good,"I help customers get the correct parts they are looking for while being kind and polite. Install batteries and Wipers for those needing such items. learned how to install batteries and wipers on various vehicles. Everyone is there to help and teach if you don""t know something."
good,Coworkers was nice and so was the customers. Very easy job. I enjoyed management. There wasn't a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,Other team members are very open and willing to assist in any way possible.  We all learn from each other everyday.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a fast-paced and steady job. I learned about automotive parts and products. I learned how to take, track, and account for inventory and reports. My manager was laid back and fun, but professional and all about the customer. Hardest part of the job was stocking the new inventory while assisting the customers also. I truly enjoyed working with and helping my co-workers and customers."
good,"Fun people to work with. Great customers, commercial and D-I-Y"
good,Was constantly challenged to help trouble-shoot different problems and scenarios with automotive issues. Learned a lot about Retail and Corporate operations. Enjoyed being challenged often enough that I would learn more about a topic I already knew quite a bit about. Only bad part was the Part Time work. It's near impossible for a young man to get a good life going working part time pay. Had to leave to find a better opportunity at a true life long career.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts was enjoyable and hard. Helped customers everyday with finding the right part/s for their car that they needed. Test batteries in or out of cars, Alt., Starters. Changed batteries for customers when needed and also wipers. Management and co workers helped when I needed it, helped customers as well. One of the hardest things about working at Advance was learning the parts and where all were located in the computer. Enjoyable part was making customer happy and conversing with ones that wanted to."
good,You can release any stress of the day by playing pool during break and watching tv.
good,"come and set up sales and customer service and solving issue and stocking and prices changes,answer phone calls with customers and if answer is not arrive reference them to another source for answer.check with other co-workers on trying to solve the issue,the hard part of my is being out of stock,or not carrying the parts need by customer.the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to see"
good,"I enjoy working for this company very much, but I would much rather like to have an office job. The management & store operations is quite chaotic a lot of the time, which can make an easy job unnecessarily stressful."
good,I learned how to explain the workings of parts to customers. I enjoyed driving the parts truck and delivering parts.
good,"I learned more about the mechanics of parts and the vehicles. Sales was a great deal to me, stayed competitive with other counter persons. "
good,it was enjoyable; I learned a lot; I was taught a lot of things; the management was okay
good,"Good store overall, communication between employees needs a little work, but they produce good customer service, try to help serve customers needs in a timely manner."
good,Looked up parts for the customer. Went and got the parts as well. Had a chance to interact with the customers and made sure I was giving them the correct part
good,"a typical work day could be pretty stressful, but we get through it. We have goals that have to be met every day, on top of things we have to do to keep the store running. We are always doing inventory, cleaning, helping customers, shipping and recieving trucks, deposits to the bank, ordering parts, and stocking is also a huge part."
good,I loved learning more about the mechanics of a vehicle and i loved helping others who did not know.
good,Had a great boss for this job. Had fun every time I went in to the store. Just a bunch of great people that worked there.
good,High volume of costumers
good,The job was fast paced at time. Duties varied. Management was not the greatest.
good,The group I started working with was great but unfortunatly when your promoted by who you know instead of what you know it all falls apart.
good,"Slowly all the best parts of the ""Team"" orientation that the other manager and myself were being ripped away from us after we've put together a well oiled machine like crew. no matter how much you put into building a team, the elements were transfered without cause/warning or request"
good,Adavance Auto is a nice company to work for and if your part-time your limited to hours if you need more you have to seek them at another location. The customer are really nice and very respectful to you when you help them in what ever part that you can get for them so they can fix their vehicle and get there day started as well.
good,"fun place,good staff,learned alot from them. but its time for a change."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Advance Auto Parts, it was a great stepping stone to gain manager experience. But that being said it is not a ""career"" in my opinion. If you enjoy working on cars, and working in a fast paced work environment, then this is the job for you!"
good,As a parts delivery person I got to intereact and meet new paople daily. I was also in charge of the register and inventory. I stocked shelves and kept the store clean and organized. I learned to take pride in the appearance of yourself and the organization you work for.
good,"In retail sales, most of the day is is helping customers; involving looking up parts or figuring out what wrong with their car. Down time is spent restocking shelves, taking out trash, basic store maintenance."
good,Very demanding job keeping pace with the competition. I love that the job include a lot of different thing and not just the same thing over and over. I have learned that the hard work put in does pay off and if you prove your worth it no company will deny promoting to a more important role.
good,Co-workers were wonderful. Hardest part of job was dealing with HR as they micro-manage everything you do. Most enjoyable part of job was dealing with the public and businesses in the area.
good,Working for a company in which i was given an opportunity without applying formally was a gatifying opportunity. Loved the people i worked with and loved the environment.
good,Its a very productive place you learn and understand about the vehicles.
good,You learn retail sales patterened after most large retail chains. The company is now spliting its focus on commercial as well as retail.
good,"It was fun working there you meet alot of interesting people, but there is also alot of hard work involved."
good,"I really enjoyed driving, And waiting on customers, I enjoyed helping with all the customers needs"
good,Some mgmt. suspect? Good+ overall quality co. w/mgmt. follow up.
good,"overall job itself rewarding, just need to watch who they put in General managers, and district managers positions."
good,Positive work experience. I learned a ton and had great coworkers and managers. Advancement opportunities exist. Fun memories.
good,"Good company, was a joy to provide help/service. A typical day was providing automotive supplies, parts to those in need."
good,My co-workers were great people. I had a great time working there and learning about car parts and able to do something by myself for my car.
good,great place to work but I was looking for work had a job offer from them that was great and i love my time with them but got a better job offer
good,It was a job that made me happy. The worst part is working every weekend and the pay is very low. The hours were long but went by pretty fast. I would go back and work then if it was a Monday through Friday job but it’s not. It’s typical retail when it comes to hours and days.
good,Every job has good and bad. Over all it's good. Details often depend on the manager and the location and customer base. He is also under pressure to meet corporate requirements
good,"Cashier, load and unload all stock, Maintain house keeping inside and out of store. Was able to keep up with sales and insure satisfaction to all customer.Great Having Communication skills due to speaking with customers in person and on a telephone. Best to be mechanical friendly when dealing with customers to secure the right part that the customer desires."
good,"It's difficult to get fired and almost impossible to be promoted.  Most senior positions are filled from outside the company or left open even for months or years until they decide the position is no longer needed."
good,"Help customers find what they need, I learned how to cross reference parts numbers, management is easy going and laid back, you see and meet people from all different walks and traids of life, the hardest par of the job is when you have an unsatisfied customer, and the most enjoyable thing is when you help the customer find what they need."
good,Everyone is friendly and its such an open opportunity job .if I had had a chance to be a manager at any location I would do it with great pride  the best part about working is everyone is friendly and respectful.
good,You need to love driving and working with people to have this job and do well at it. Anyone can do this but to enjoy it and be good at it you have to be happy and like people
good,i actually enjoyed my job with advance while employed there. customer interaction and interaction with my coworkers was pleasant as well. loved my manager too
good,"I wouldn’t suggest it. They pay 13 an hour for people who ride machines & we are underpaid! On top of being underpaid, they want us to work extra hard for them with no bonuses or anything! They are money hungry. I would understand if they were polite to us, but they aren’t!"
good,I feel under educated in the ways of the company but overall good job. I am overall pleased with this job and would recommend it to anyone. I wish that I knew more about the overall company but I guess I will learn. It's the type of place to work if you like to learn things everyday.
good,Pretty steady day between deliveries and stocking shelves. Can be fast paced at times. Great group of co workers and managers at this store. Everybody pitches in to get the job done. It is retail so store is open 7 days a week so you will get some weekend shifts. Overall a good working environment but wages are low and not many bennies for part timers.
good,"It's an easy job with no real challenges but can get pretty busy at times. I liked working here but the pay was too low to make me want to stay. Discounts weren't anything to brag about either. Aside from that, this was a very low stress job."
good,"The company recent start a Flex-space/time initiative to improve employee moral. Decent place to work, communication between levels and department tends to lack as it is such a large company. Your experience is completely dependent on your manager and team like most work environments."
good,"My work there it has been a good experience about vehicles's parts and all related with it... also it has been a good experience with parts inventory, all about parts numbers and putting the truck away practicing different ways to get the truck done the fastest way possible."
good,"Everyday work includes: retail/commercial sales, parts knowledge and suggestions, stocking the display area, inventorying stock, and EOD deposit handling.  I enjoyed helping customers find the right part especially if its not an easy part to find."
good,"Great place to work, Very hard to move up past GM. Company has great ideas but give little time to see them through. Region realignments happen every few years and direction is always changing"
good,"Advance auto is one of the best places I've worked, and if I knew what I know now I would still be with them. Every company has its flaws, but they for sure had fewer."
good,I always had things to do it seemed as if there was always something new everyday .Most of the co workers were easy to work with and the GM management was fair although the district management was something to be desired
good,There’s a meeting every morning before starting the shift where we talk about how many picks we have and how many items we have on the floor to stock.
good,"I loved working at advance, because of my coworkers, the store manager, however, was absolutely terrible, I got hired in at a wage, then minimum wage was raised, and I got bumped up to that, then people started getting hired in after me at a higher pay rate than"
good,I plan on staying with the company but I worked so hard to become a fitness trainer cars is my second passion. but I honestly got a alright shot up at advanced compared to other jobs I've had in the past.
good,"Advance Auto Parts differs depending on the team you work in.  Some teams are more structured and strict, some are more relaxed.  In general, I've found my job to be less hectic than other jobs I've held, and in general my coworkers and managers at Advance have been helpful and pleasant.  "
good,Find what did not get done and what needs done and then do it. While dropping everything instantly to help customers and driving sales numbers. Manage your team and deligate tasks beneficial to everyone.
good,"company is designed around part time work. very little promoting, most of the upper management all all close friends"
good,You would clock in do back stocks while helping customers find what they need. Most of your down time you would be on the computer completing test for your career advancement.
good,"My typical day includes checking in and putting up stock, opening and closing store and a lot of customer service including advice on best products for the customer's needs."
good,A typical day at work for me was rearranging planograms through the whole store. Stocking shelves of all recent car parts and other items and accessories that came in on the delivery truck.
good,The managers and district managers do not stand up for you. Just felt like they were only there for a paychecks and not for the company. Problems would occur within employees and they would act like its not their problem and their only option is to get rid of employees and hire more younger and unexperienced people. They also would hire more part time people instead of hiring less full time.
good,"Dont treat woman the way they should be  some of the guys put the woman down.. over all not a bad business if some of the people had a nice side. The managers are very nice to a point. "
good,"Delivering auto parts was great. Developing that professional relationship with your customers and shop owners really made you feel good. Coworkers were great, almost felt like family. Would definitely recommend as a place to work."
good,Typical day would be answering phones and deliver parts to customers. Restock shelves and cleaning floors. hardest part about the job was alot of lifting heavy parts.
good,You have to deal with stressful days and some with a slow day. Manditory short breaks. Fast paced in all indoor weather conditons. Meet daily standards in different departments.
good,"Some days you will have busy days and some days you will have slow days that you wont have nothing to do. I learned a lot about cars and car parts. I had a good GM that was great. Hardest part of the job was inventory, fun part was truck days"
good,The work environment is good and very educational. The hours suck cause they are not consistent and the pay could be more than what it is. You can grow with the company.
good,"Enjoyed the challenge of helping a customer with a problem using all available information in both printed form and or on the computer.  "
good,"The work was difficult and it can be frustrating to work with people who are not willing to carry their weight, but the managers are friendly and encouraging. If you are a hard worker and don't mind long hours, you will be fine."
good,They don't respect loyalty or hard work and it's very UNrewarding. I've been here for almost 3 years and I do more work than anyone and I don't get anything for it.
good,Great work experience in the field. I would recommend the job for those looking for a career with growth. Advance is always looking to advance those who are willing to put in hard work.
good,"Great people, fun, fast paced, but the pay was terrible. Minimum wage is not enough and the annual raises of ten cents are not enough. The team worked well together, supported each other, great communication."
good,Advance Auto Parts has been a great job for me. However with me finishing up my bachelor's degree there no benefit for me to stay with the company. The career outlook long term is minimal
good,My time with Advance was fine I harbor no negative feelings or opinions of the company they treated me fine I just choice to retire and am looking for part time work .
good,Great work environment to be apart of. You can excel at this job with common sense and knowledge about the industry which makes this a great job. Although they are not as rewarding or compensatory as they could be.
good,overall a ok company but its big corporate. I enjoyed the actual job and the people i worked with some policies were a little harsh. The buyout of carquest was a plus. .........
good,I like all the employees but having good friends don't pay my utility bills.I am only being paid $8.25 an hour .I do anything I'm asked to the best of my ability . I'm not afraid of work.
good,I was night manager I had to do the daily deposits that ment I had to count the registers make sure the balanced and then make the deposit up and take it to the bank.
good,I helped customers find the right parts for people to fix their cars. I also helped put parts away after receiving them from the truck delivery guy. I help installed batteries into the costumers cars.
good,"working for advance auto parts an employe can learn things that they might not know when starting the position. They teach the new comers about cars and what they need to fix the issue for the customer. You can learn a lot about vehicles, such as maintenance supplements to keep your vehicle running until you take it to the shop."
good,Good Place to work If they hire good workers that will know a bit of car knowledge would help as well as a good work crew Managment was to leanant on rules & it didn’t matter what I had to say So I left the company at that moment
good,had reasonably responsive mgmt. but very dated tools to capture and retain market. similar to many of the key players in this market segment profits have been maintained be trimming staff and keeping old infrastructure
good,Fun place to work. Helping customers make me feel better about myself. It can get challenging and stressful sometimes. It requires a lot of work to maintain safe and secure work environment at Advance Auto.
good,typical day at work was a rush rush job.
good,"Good job with good benifits, but the pay is not equal to the work expected, Upper management is inconsistant with a high turnover rate. No run for advancement unless you're willing to relocate"
good,the company cares very little for their employees. they make you take a lunch and take the time out even if you don't take a lunch.My manager though was quite nice
good,I learned a lot at this job. It was my first time as a manager in this type of setting. As a woman it was difficult at time as most people don't respect women in the auto parts industry.
good,"Id recommend advance to someone looking to start out in the automotive field or for an experienced person as a “parts professional”. The environment is friendly while still appropriate and the schedule is flexible. There are multiple opportunities in the company such as driving, parts pros, and management."
good,"I love learning new things and about the different products, parts, vehicles, and the places that we deliver and sell parts to and doing whatever it takes to get the customers the right parts and products they need and making their visit in the store helpful and let them leave satisfied with our help and service"
good,Good company for students to work while in school. flexible with  schedules. you will learn new things about vehicles. You will have fun working here and they are very flexible with school schedules.
good,Good place to work helping customers to get the job done
good,I would return to work there if they had a location near where I now live. I still have the uniforms. I enjoyed the job I did and the main company values followed mine!
good,"It was a good job to start with, but among every other starting jobs, it wasn't going to last forever. Customer service was mandatory, but management wasn't as astounding as everyone would hope to think."
good,"Good company in general. Salary low for managers and expected weekly hours are long. DM can randomly make you work 6-7 days per week at a whim. good benefits, opportunity to advance if you perform well, company cares about its people. Also a great place to learn about cars if your passionate about that. Low stress overall and job is easy. Poor work life balance though."
good,Went through a lot of employees and managers for the time I was there. It made me feel a little discouraged. But I kept good sprites and did the best I could do.
good,"Advance Auto Part is a great work experience if you are love cars "
good,Its a decent job the people are friendly. there is always something new to learn. also teaches me about cars and being more hands on. its slow at times but has it times when its busy. the pay and hours isn't consistent enough to live off of.
good,"I loved working with certain people.  I loved delivering parts and getting to see the customers everyday.  I loved that if I had questions, the parts pros didn't make me feel stupid when answering them."
good,Got very busy in store. Some customers didn’t have any clue on what they needed to fix the problem. You have to be fairly knowledgeable about auto parts
good,"Amazing place to work with, great people to make rhe day go by. Great work experince and knowledge in automotive partes and electronics. Work was great."
good,"The position is rewarding when you can meet the physical demands and when you can find the right part for customers it feels really good to help. On occasion, there is frustration when our hands are tied about the return policy or when we do not have the part available."
good,"Working at advance there are small parts, and there are big parts. Most of the time the bigger parts were not bought but when they were, you had to be fast, with a huge heavy part. Overall, it was a great place to work. I did not receive great pay, but the work was worth what I was making."
good,"this good for a kid just out of high school for a first, its relaxed slow paced and just requires common sense. Don't expect to make alot of money here pay is low even for management."
good,"Great place for a part time job looking to make some money. Not necessarily the best place to make a career out of however somebody looking to work part time while going to school, etc. It does the job."
good,"Advance Auto Parts provides a great job for sales oriented people.  It has a fast pace a lot of the times and can be very competitive.  You have to know what your doing and interact well with your customers or you will never get anywhere.  Hours are very manageable, rarely ever going over 40 per week.  The people are generally fun and relaxed to work with ."
good,Easy to work with. Fast paced. Can get a little stressful when extremely busy and people don't come in to work or not enough people on schedule. Can learn much about automotive and about business. Ethics and morals are good.
good,"While I was there the work was good as I would help customers with auto parts and auto parts help. Was a friendly environment, my co-workers were nice. "
good,I would clock in for work and start unload the truck shipment we had receive that night. After unloading the truck I would then start taking phone calls and helping walking in customers. Why on the phone calls I would look up parts for car in are computer system. I would finish the call and print a invoice and pull the parts to be delivered. if there was no driver at the time I would delivery the parts myself.
good,"This employment was fast past. I was able to learn about cars, car parts, how to trouble shoot a problem for a customer. I also learned how to build planograms for store displays.My customer service skills really evolved at this place of employment. I especially learned how to work with others as a team."
good,"You have a super large company that never has auto parts available for the customers. Too much second sourcing which can be a headache, low wages for regular crew which makes it hard to find quality workers."
good,Buena experiencia para aprender de partes de autos
good,"I enjoyed working there and the manager was willing to work around my schedule at my primary job. I would have made this my primary but he pay is low,"
good,Fun environment. Store manager was awesome to work for. Pay was just above minimum wage. No paid time off or benefits other than store discount. Flexible hours to balance work and social life.
good,It wasn't at all stressful! Management was great!       Everyone treated each other with respect. I was a delivery driver. Although the pay was not much it was a fun place to work  with people who treated each other like family
good,Working as a picker is easy and sometimes fun. The people are decent most the time. If you can avoid the gossip It will be a great and productive work experience.
good,"I was a parts delivery driver, the job was fast paced and upbeat. The manager was great and there is some room to grow within the company if you start out as a counter pro. The hardest part was delivering parts during snowstorms to garages. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my co-workers and getting to drive around to different locations. Not having to work inside all the time was a great perk! I learned far more about automotive systems and categories of merchandise than I thought I ever would."
good,"I've learned a lot from the people at my job. However, at times the place was stressful and the pay was not worth at the trouble. the scheduling was not the best and the manager seemed to ony look out for oneself."
good,"People need car parts.  Advance provides them and works diligently to improve quick availability to what the customer needs.  You won't get rich working in retail, but if you are passionate about cars and customer service, you will always have a job."
good,The work is not hard it's the lack of consideration that they have on the job. No benefits lack of communication. Majority of the employees keep drama going.
good,"The job is easy for an individual that is knowledgeable with auto parts. The pay needs to be looked at for future hires, for the price that is charged for most of the parts that are sold, the company can afford to start employees at a more competitive rate of pay."
good,"Many options on type of work, training on machines sometimes hard to come by. Activities for raising money for JDRF and  United Way, as well as for team member outings. many good people work there."
good,Came into work around 9:30 and I would make sure I had my checklist book to make sure the car I was using was in good enough shape to operate. Then I'd go get my orders and deliver them to the auto shops around town until 5
good,"It was okay. Why am I doing this? I don't work here anymore, and things have prolly changed. It was an okay college job. Sometimes you would see some cool cars."
good,"i love working in the automotive field. this position made it great to work everyday. i have many years knowledge in everything auto, i was able to help people all day long"
good,"Good place to work if you need a job,was flexible while i went to school. Employer's supports an enthusiastic attitude toward colleagues and customers,is courteous, well-mannered and polite, works well with others to create a positive atmosphere for colleagues and customers."
good,"Not enough in store organization, "
good,Great company I just have a growing family. I need a better paying job to provide for my family. I like to collect cars. I own several show cars and attend car shows.
good,if you're into cars this place is great. if you like a challenge the place is great too but corporate is too into the stores to let them increase business and increase sales. the stores in a lot of towns are important to the community so they can increase morale and sales by just doing events or extra discounts for teachers or something like that. corporate seems more willing to follow policy than help people out.
good,If you're a car person you might get frustrated at the sell everything for every job mentality.  Most upper management know nothing of store operations and no car knowledge.
good,I enjoyed my time working for advance. Great work environment I loved the challenges and no two days were ever the same. I loved learning new things about vehicles and enjoyed the team I worked with
good,"If the location is with good on staff is fine with no staff a total different history"
good,A typical day at work was to deliver parts to commercial customers and assist with task and inventory processes in the store. In my time at the company I learned more about vehicle parts and maintenance then I knew before.
good,"A typical day at advance auto is mostly consists of retail customers, stock, plan-o-grams, and inventory. management is ok, but needs to learn to delegate better as well as disapline when needed.  the hardest part of the job is dealing with diverse types of customers. but the most enjoyable part is the team I work with"
good,"Good job, no benefits, not a lot of hours given unless management. Not such a great job if you are a women, you tend to get treated differently by employees and customers."
good,Environment is not bad. You can get flexible hours and the benefits are not bad but you have to pay for them. Atmosphere can be good also. If you want to learn about car parts this is the place to be
good,"Iv been with the company for a very long time. through 3 different name changes. Western Auto, Parts America, and now Advance Auto, all three changes was hard on everyone in some way. However because each store is its own little family, that does make things little better. I just wish a person actually got paid more per hour."
good,"fun work environment, poor compensation. No clear direction for the company, always changing things, but they never work. Always trying to be like the other guys, instead of doing it their way."
good,"This is probably my favorite work place on the list. This was also another retail position. My responsibility included but was not limited to assisting customers with battery changes, other simple replacements, and closing procedures."
good,"Work day includes managing the production of emails, web sites, and social media assets. The pressure is always on to meet deadlines while meeting or exceeding accuracy targets."
good,"Advance Auto Parts helping customers decide whether they want to fix it there selves, take it to a shop or ignore the problem all together. The majority of the customer base is DIY, so you will automatically get some customers who want to try doing everything their selves whether it is some simple such as brakes and rotors to full on engine rebuilds they had no business touching in the first place. Although I do not love the job all the time it is an interesting place to work and i have learned a lot from working there either from my coworkers or my customers. The hardest of the job is just like other retail establishments, the rude nasty angry customer who is just out to ruin your day. Or the customer that has no idea what hes doing and wants you to walk him through every step while you have a line of people in front of you and only 2 people working. Management wise i had a great store manager and assistant manager and they have taught so much and i thank them for it they best part of working there is the knowledge you gain from it. Overall its not a difficult job but sometimes there are difficult people."
good,it is ok to work for learned a lot but not going any where and not being trained like I want to plus doesn't pay well for all the stuff you do looking for a good job that pays well
good,I worked there for several years I liked the environment like family with it problems I was management for 3 years my best hours was the closing fun times
good,delivering parts to commercial customers and DIY retail. I have learned advanced customer service and communication skills. able to work with a diverse and motivated group of people. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the public at times.
good,This was one of the best environments I've worked in. Everyone seemed to be very friendly and open to helping when needed a true team. I was just working two jobs and one had to go unfortunately this job doesn't pay very well at least not for a part timer.
good,You have the opportunity to move up but more than like takes to long and they beat round the bush getting you there or find excuses why your not ready to move up.
good,Open Store start computer systems count drawers fill paper work plan your sales day take customer orders check inventory and stock set up for new inventory planagrams for the end of the day. Clean store front and close store plan your next day sales report
good,There were reasonable work hours and helpful management. Advance Auto Parts is a great place to build and maintain customer service and sales practice.
good,"I've loved most of the people I've worked with in this company from many different stores. My store in particular has probably some of the best crew members I could ask for. There is a certain superior in this area that is really awful, though. I can't say much about it for confidential reasons. Advancement is nearly impossible unless you know a lot about car parts prior to the job as you can't really pick it up a whole lot by simply being around them long enough. If you just want a job to pay the bills and bring in some extra money it's a very good way to go, though."
good,overall great. taking the time to teach people. learn as you go and networking. great job for interaction never a dull moment. I loved the driver part of this job.
good,I learned a lot working at Advanced. They told me a lot cars. Some things I already know and some things I do not know. I recommend this job to anyone starting out with cars.
good,Love working with fellow employees. The job is fun overall.  But I'm looking for more money very simple.  Would like another delivery job in the greater Statesville area.
good,"Loved working here, but the pay was horrible, only made $200 a week full time!! If the pay was signifactly improved, I would still work here, but no matter what I did or how great my performance reviews were, I couldnt make a livable wage. Advance Auto is the walmart or mcdonalds of the auto parts world as far as wages go. "
good,Ok place to work but no growth in pay raises or promotions. I have learn alot about maintaining cars and auto parts. This is retail so you meet some great people.
good,"Room for advancement but it isn't necessarily from hard work, dedication and leadership ability. Policy and procedures are in place for reasons"
good,"Hardest part of this job was putting away heavy inventory, it was basically a good work environment and I liked it. The manager was easy to get along with and I enjoyed the people I met and assisted."
good,Salaried Managers will often have to work 60+ hours per week. Over-time is strictly forbidden and hourly wages are kept to a minimum. Assistant Managers and Key Holders are not paid much better.
good,"All in all Advance Auto Parts was a decent place to work, I enjoyed meeting the customers and delivering parts, I was required to work one weekend a month and their vehicles were in decent working order."
good,Overall working for advance was pretty good until the termination which was over bumping into a rack which was a minor incident but due to me not reporting it lead to termination.I made a mistake of not reporting it because my trainer at the time did so I thought I was in the clear but if I could ever go back in certainly would.
good,"My typical day while at Advance would be to assist any pcard holder with any question or concern of the card. Assist all stores with any charges or review the limits at times of reaching their limits. I would process the upload for each period. When running out of something to do, I would assist the accounts payable dept with anything I could. My co-workers were somewhat non-friendly and while at Advance I was able to start a team building for our department to get everyone involved into getting to know each other. The hardest part was not getting bored."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, all of my coworkers and management were fun to be around and overall just great people. "
good,Its all about customer service. Your main focus must be on customer service. There seems to be a disconnect between the store level and corporate levels.
good,"It's a fair place to work and the pay wasn't too bad. The shipping floor however, makes it hard to have a life outside of work due to you never knew when you were going to get off work."
good,Corp lead organization too big to be run each store the exact way so challenged every day to run without causing violations of company policies to where individual ideas were not focused on
good,"Overall working at Advance has been a good learning experience and a nice stepping stone in furthering my career. There's always something to be doing around the store. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with impatient and/or angry customers. I enjoy the aspect of helping people and learning about different things, whether it be parts, management, customer service, or working hard."
good,"The work environment is pretty chill and relaxing. Like any job, there will questionable customers. Despite that, this is one of the best jobs I've ever had so far."
good,"it is a very fast work place, i learn alot about auto parts. the most enjoyable part about this job was when it it over. my co workers was great and fun to work with"
good,"I love my job.  I love the environment and the people I work with.  Everyone makes you feel welcome, and I enjoy helping people."
good,"It was a very demanding job, but I really enjoyed it and it gave me the opportunity to learn and grow.I worked with a great group of people."
good,I enjoyed working there because I have an extensive background in auto parts and repairs. most of the customers were eager to learn what was needed to complete their project.
good,"Its a good place to work, good benefits. The downside is the pay stinks. Its good for a part time job or someone who is young and doesn't have a lot of bills."
good,Responsibly for marketing time shares and teaching a team of employees how to sell and do presentations. Learn a lot about building teams. Hardest part of job is creating new ways to market time shares. Enjoyable part of job is the diversity of employees which you learn the different ways as to how they use there own creativity to sell.
good,"The job is fairly easy but don't expect to get paid much. There are a lot of things out of your control  and nobody really cares if things get done, but if you just need a job it will do."
good,typical day at work help customers install wipers and batteries i learned stuff about cars some managers were better than the others co-workers answered questions that i had the hardest part was some of the test the most enjoyable part is taking deliveries
good,"Overall Advance is good employer. Presently they are in expansion mode due to acquiring CARQUEST auto parts. The acquisition provides many challenges with regard to store count, location of distribution centers etc."
good,"Great atmosphere. Customers are for the most part fun to help. Its the ""bartender"" job of the auto parts world. Customers will spill every issue with every vehicle with you. Very fun if you enjoy helping people diagnose vehicle issues. Wages, I'm not gonna sugar coat it, they suck. And advancement, probably not gonna happen. You will most likely get a raise or two, however after all the raises you'll still only make a little over minimum wage. McDonalds employees will still make more than you. Management, on the lower level, GM and district, are usually very cool. Upper management, they don't care."
good,i like the job and most of all the folks I worked with and the customers I serviced. I really liked solving the automotive questions and making sure they left with the tools in order to complete the job.
good,"One of the best companies I have ever worked with. Promotions are based on results and capacity to do more. Many people promoted from within the company. Training is poor, but people are willing to help you."
good,I learned a lot working for Advance Auto Parts. I also met a lot of different people. Upper management seemed not to care much about store employees and that there is always someone who will fill your shoes.
good,Fun but challenging with a very helpful management. The management is more than willing to help if you have a question or concern. Tuff at times assisting customers with some of the problems they have but with the help of the workers there we can always come to an answer.
good,The company overall is a good company to work for. The work environment was enjoyable and fun at times. Management was good and was always willing to teach and assist. Most enjoyable part was the company was solid and the crew were screened very well for the prospective positions.
good,"I was a store manager who was ASE certified. Learned much about repairing vehicles. Frequently helped both DIY and commercial customers. Installed batteries and wiper blades. Trained many employees on store procedures and about parts. Did all manager duties including hiring, cash office, training, scheduling, and maintaining store standards."
good,The company was a place for its great work atmosphere and employee independence and challenging. i worked with a lot of great people we have good team work. very fun workplace with great benefits.
good,"Advance Auto Parts has been a place of learning, mentorship, and fun for me over the years. The things I have learned here will not only help me in potential future roles within the organization, but I know I can take what I have used here and apply it anywhere. The chance to network with a few key leaders and knowledgeable people have made me the professional I am today. Wouldn't be where I am without their guidance and support - the community that I love here is what makes this place great."
good,"This is a job to learn, but it is not a job to make a permanent job. Compensation for what is expected is not equal. You can get promoted if you work for it but they will ask a lot out of you, but they do not pay you for it."
good,"I learned that everyday is a different day in Retail. Always on your toes to take care of customers requests and locating hard parts to find locally. Also meeting the scheduling needs of the employees and the store work flow. Maintaining Commercial accounts and the delivery processes involved in this service."
good,I learned a lot working in different companys I gained more experience over the experience I already have and looking for more
good,This was my second opportunity to open a facility.  The dedication to training and safety was outstanding.  It is always exciting and rewarding to be involved in the success of an entirely new work-force.
good,"The job that I had done for them was ok. Running lines at General Mills, being a superviser was fun. The people that worked for me were awesome."
good,Enjoy challenges throughout my work day.  Willing to assist others when needed and gain working knowledge of other areas of the work environment.  Always willing to share knowledge with others.
good,"There used to be a great culture and uplifting spirit at the Roanoke AAP office, but since the move to Raleigh, NC, the spirit has doomed and the morale is down."
good,"enjoyed delivering parts, nice co-workers, learned how to install car batteries and windshield wipers, I enjoyed providing customers with excellent customer service"
good,"Coach my team on daily tasks like inventory processes, greeting and handling customers and other store functions. The store I have serves 30 other AAP store with parts so we are always busy with truck or pulling parts."
good,"After ten years with Advance auto parts. Looking back i see there were soom good an some bad. as you will have in all companies. typical day was getting auto parts out to 68 stores in our region. tracking down mis-shipped parts. Doing what ever it took to take care of the customer. As well as maiking sure parts are ready for pick up inside the warehouse for who ever needs them right away. Three semi trucks a week to replace what gets sold to our stores. Process returns to vendors and our distribution center in lakeland."
good,I had fun working with the people at advance auto parts. I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers. I felt that I helped many customers find the right product for their vehicles.
good,enjoyed meet the other employees. and learning about auto parts that I didn't know
good,Assisting customers training employees operating all equipment.  Working with people.  Hardest part of the job was hours.
good,"I was a cashier, help stock shelves, helped with installing batteries, and wipers. I learned a lot about the personalities of people and how to work with the person. I learned to count the safe, shut the store down and set the store up to open, I got along with all employees and helped out when I was able too. The toughest part of my job was I had to show that I did know something about cars. I loved working with this company. I loved the customers and the coworkers."
good,Typical warehouse work. Many cross training opportunities. Good pay advancement for the first year. As long as you do your work and do it well the days will fly by!
good,"very fast moving ,high demanding customer service job that will ask for more than you may have to offer . they test your problem solving skills to the limit.  multi tasking is a must"
good,I enjoyed this job because it gave me an opportunity to learn new things every day. I also took a great deal of pride knowing that I was able to take the knowledge I obtained and helped the customers.
good,"A typical day is attending meetings and trying to create a healthy work environment. Co-workers are helpful, but turn over rate is extremely high."
good,Large company with a smaller company feel and culture.  Opportunity for growth based on area of expertise.
good,always different customers coming in with various problems/questions/concerns. There is always something new to learn.
good,Fun place to work. Great management that really cares for the employees.
good,the hours are not long but the pay is not that good but it has it peerks
good,great co-workers and an excellent starting ground for someone looking to start in the automotive industry
good,"Average day is fast paced with many different ups and downs, Growing Skills in thinking on my feet and give customers the best service available. Maybe not the best in coverage on scheduling, leaving one or two employees where more are needed. Helping the customers get the service they need and making a connection for that job or for a lifetime in the parts industry."
good,Very demanding job for a then single mother of 3 kids at home..my work week was usually 75 or more hours. The part that I loved the most was my interaction with customers and building relationships with them. I also enjoyed my employees...they were very hard workers and always came to work ready for their shift.
good,You look up parts for customers and install batteries and wiper blades and all kinds of bulbs in the vehicles.  I do cycle counts and planograms and open and mostly close the store every night lately.  Work with some nice people.
good,"Everyday was a different challenge.  Primary goal was overall customer satisfaction.  Waiting on customers finding out what they needed to do their job and suggest items that would make job easier."
good,There are a lot of stresses while working at advance auto parts. The financial compensation is entry level minimum wage. Management was great and most co workers were easy to get a long with.
good,"It was a great experience i learned about cars . The management was okay, some were really uptight but nice at the same time. I adored my team i worked with, we always had each others back with anything like if i didn't know a part or where it was located someone would always help. The most enjoyable part of the job was having such an amazing staff. "
good,The management could be a little better with the scheduling of the workers. The hardest part of the day is when inventory truck comes in and you have to deliver as well as work the inventory.
good,Fast paced environment. Auto repair experience is not necessary. Pleasant co-workers.
good,"To assist customers with puchase, oversee a crew of 6, reports."
good,Working with this group of people was good. They were helpful and understanding which is hard to find in workplaces.Management were a great group of people.We all worked together to get things done as a team we got alot accomplished. The hardest part was working and not being given the option of healthcare
good,It is a good company to work for with a lot of opportunities to be promoted. Pay is not that great.
good,Good place to work if you like dealing with the public and like the automotive industry.
good,"Hours are unpredictable, and experience varies greatly from store to store. I enjoy the people i work with, and I enjoy helping customers. If you've ever had any retail experience, then working here is a breeze."
good,"Training new employees is almost non existent,you are thrown to the wolves and they hope you survive.I do not know about other district managers but he one in our district is a head scratcher. I had been in management and supervision for over 25 years but after 3 years he decided I was not Assistant Manager material but he wanted me to keep doing the work without the title.I went on to become a warehouse manager for another company but the owners health led to him closing the business down luckly I had stayed on Advance Auto parts part time. The store manager is the only reason I am still there she is very honest and needs my work skill and knowledge.I love working with the customers and commercial accounts and working with my co workers for the most part.I have learned a LOT about auto parts and I enjoy our employees discount.I would refer people to work at Advance Auto Parts but would warn them about the training and the favortism on the DM part."
good,I worked at Advanced for almost 3 years. My store is now owned by an independent group with Car Quest. I wish the job paid more. The hours are usually flexibe if you give the manager advanced notice.
good,There is still a ton of work to be done with the company but it has come a long way since I started. Work life balance is better but benefits are lacking and compensation is weak.
good,"Good company, some personnel issues. Fundamentally solid personnel. Good leadership, good work environment, somewhat stress free. I drive from location to location so i get to see all the stores that I deliver to.."
good,The job is busy and easy to do. Makes for good cardio and muscle toning. This job gives you an opportunity to work independently most of the day. Be ready to meet customers request. Customer service is time sensitive and needs special attention.
good,"I learned a lot started without knowing anything and ended up knowing more then I expected "
good,"Great company to work for, most of the employees are very friendly. The customers are great to work with. Overall a good placw to work and provide a decent living for your family."
good,"The pay is a little on the minimum side, but the people are awesome to work with and they do give flexibility in the hours and try to work with you so that you be off with family when needed. Great management support and opportunity to move up in the company if you work to achieve that goal."
good,I loved coming in to work here! You learn so many things and lots of skills that you could use on a daily basis! The crew I had to work with was absolutely fantastic!
good,"Fast passed"
good,I liked working at Advance Auto. We had a team sprit and a good Manager. I wish I could have stayed longer. You need to buy onto the culture of the company to really go anywhere but that's not all bad. There are some issues that will come up but if you take the right steps things usually will work out. Good Luck.
good,"Knowing what to expect at a job is convenient. Schedule is consistent, good and understanding people to work with/for. Job duties shift sometimes and everyone in the store pitches in to help unload new stock, answer phones, deliver parts, and ring customers up, regardless of job title."
good,I enjoyed working along side my coworkers and had great management that recognizes potential for advancement. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with customers that would attempt to scam or steal from the store.
good,most of the coworkers I had worked there due to the management and crew was a family. loved my bosses and made friends. when things weren't busy we stocked shelves or inventory. I was also a parts delivery driver and I delivered parts to other stores or shops.
good,The day goes by quickly in the auto parts department the start of the day tend to last knights shipments a first orders of the day through out the day you clean the store fix shelves help customers deliver.
good,"Good place to work. Immediate manager was great. First District manager was more about getting outside people for manager positions rather than promoting from within, which did not help usually. Also, promoting friends rather than someone who was actually qualified happened way too often, usually resulting in major hub stores not performing to standards that were needed to operate the district efficiently."
good,It’s nothing too special it it was alright. The people were tolerable they were enjoyable things can just feel a little hectic there. It is under new management tho the old management will be missed
good,"Great team at that store, friendly employees and customers, focus is on helping the customers find the correct parts and ensuring an excellent experience that will bring them back the next time"
good,Pay was low but was doing parts delivery and manning the cashier at times. The job was convenient for me at the time. It was close to the house which was great. The day sometimes would drag due to low customer volume but that is normal in a retail store atmosphere.
good,This is a fun workplace with great people just the pay is not the best.  The days requested off i got.  Don't move up in the job very fast.  I love the driving.
good,I really enjoy. working for the company. Everyone was treated with respect and kindness. I enjoyed the fast paced work which made the day go by so fast. The Manager was an awesome boss very understanding when it came to personal situations. If the job didn't downside I wouldn't be looking for another job.
good,"They keep you busy, but time flies when you stay busy. If  a customer calls in an order, then I would  deliver it. If there was idle time, I would stock if needed."
good,Good people and good experience. Pay is low but normal for type of work. Should have intrest in automobiles or you may struggle if asked to do more than drive.
good,Worked hard to get where I am. The team at Advance auto was willing to meet my demands and worked with me through the transition. Training offered and contact with supervisor
good,"Complaints.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at Advance Auto, overall most team members were willing to work collaboratively.  Team members were focused on the higher level corporate goals and working together to accomplish them.  Senior management would recognize employees who went above and beyond to help accomplish the goals."
good,"Very stressful and fast pace working with deadlines to meet for shipping products on a timely manner."
good,"Learned a whole lot of miscellaneous car stuff working here, common problems with specific vehicle brands etc and gained a more indepth understanding of many lesser known automotive parts."
good,"Typical work day - 8hrs"
good,This job is easy but the customers make the job hard. But I like a challenge so that keeps me going. I pick up calls pull parts and also send the drivers on delivery.
good,"Besides the incredibly low pay, there are incentives to sell. This is the job that motivated me to sell the entire car. I doubled or more 'Blue Star' every month, meaning I sold upwards to 4x my goal. There were months where I sold more than my manager as a part timer."
good,No real big issues I need to make more current wage won’t cut it management is fair could be better with working with employees instead of not wanting to get involved advance doesn’t do a good job of keeping good people
good,"Fun place work positive  attitude decent  pay for managers train well and you are not preacuree,,  they could use better higher ups and better tools t"
good,It happens to be one of the best jobs that I had and I certainly want to come back to advanced auto parts. The staff is welcoming and me loving cars made the job a career that I still want to Persue
good,I like working here. It's a good job good people. It's a good environment the pay is ok. Good benefits. Certain parts of management dont show there appreciation to the employees they have.
good,I clock in for the day. I greet and help every customer that walks in or calls. Give the customer my thoughts on certain products or recommendations for further projects. Tender them out.
good,"you have your busy days and your none busy days. Some days are just boring and just standing around. rearrange the store every other week, things werent always in the right place. On busy days we were understaffed so made thing even more hectic."
good,"In general a good experience. Learned a lot about managing a busy and profitable store."
good,If you are just starting out looking for a job to get some experience I would say this is a decent choice. However there is very little room for growth in the company and it pays decently but not enough for what you do.
good,Advance is a great place to work if you want to move up in management of a sales company. The hours arent the best and the stores are open 365 days a year.
good,"I enjoyed driving for this company."
good,You’d work hard and was compensated and recognized for your achievements but there is an A lack of loyalty for the corporate side of the business. Like most businesses they want your complete loyalty but are not doing the same.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts has been a great learning experience for me, not just from an auto parts perspective but retail customer service perspective as well.  The crew and commercial customers build a relationship with you that stays well after the time spent working there.  Most days are busy and you can expect the same work weekly after you learn the ropes of everything.  The only downside is the pay.  After being at Advance for a while you usually earn the trust of the management to perform great task and be given greater responsibilities but this may sometimes feel a little overwhelming when your pay rate does not match the amount of work you are now entrusted with.  Advancement is outlined and sounds achievable but actually is not given the way the system constantly lowers your sales rate regardless of how busy the store is that day or not."
good,sign into rf gun pick up picking order packets and cart to start picking in the correct areas. always make sure production was matching up with our work that needed to be done real easy job.
good,saleman front counter customer helping changing batterydoing planergram unloading truck stocking shelves ansreing phone cleaning floors calling for hub exchanges picking up parts from other store
good,Was not a bad job.  I really enjoyed job itself but the management was terrible. He was never in the store and his personnal life was more important than the store.
good,Is a good job pay is far from Lafayette and you have to work weekends . So you work Wednesday thru Saturday or Sunday thru Wednesday... 10 hrs days if there is no overtime you have 3 days off...
good,it was an ok experience the pay wasn't great but the people weren't terrible but the job was great when there are things to do but it can also be slow at time but there will always be things to be done.
good,Do not have anything real negative to say a lot of the problems that happened with the company is usually because the whole management crew is new to the job so the are learning everything from scratch just like the new employees.
good,It is suggested that someone would have a decent knowledge of car makes and models and at least basics for parts and be willing to install windshield wipers and batteries in cars.
good,enjoyed my time there very fast paced got to know local auto shops. the workplace culture was relaxed the hardest part was making every customer happy
good,"Has more option on parts"
good,Busy answer commercial buisness calls and stocking inventory. Meet sales quota and maintain friendly and professional relationship with commercial accounts. Also help with walk in customers to figure out what they need to repair there vehicles.
good,"For a driven and eager individual, it is possible to advance rapidly at a store-level. Furthering a career outside of a store-level posistion is quite challenging. There are many different avenues to learn different skills and qualities within Advance Auto."
good,"The commercial accounts manager threatened to ""beat me to the floor"" one day and this initiated a general Hoo-Raw - I was scheduled to close the store all that week, so out of respect for the main manager and the other workers, I finished out working the written schedule, and left after a week."
good,Hires externally way too much for management positions when internal employees are more than qualified and have tenure with company. It's extremely excessive and if you're not in the right clique you'll never be promoted even when you're the top 5 in the company out of 700 people in your position. Insane amount of change to the point it's dizzying.
good,"The company has a great reputation and is an industry leader in the auto parts category. Great place to work, good scheduling, great customer service, but the local management is terrible. The job is great, but dreading going to work because a manager wants to harass you isn't something I look forward to."
good,I love my job at Advance however I am not happy with the disability insurance. I filed a claim the third week of April and am still waiting on it to either get approved or rejected. HR has been no help as the disability is through another company. Very disappointed in this part of the benefits.
good,"Spent way to much money on Car Quest company purchase. "
good,It is fast paced work. Constantly busy never stops. Learn a lot. Have to know how to deal with all kinds of people. It can get pretty stressful sometimes.
good," Responsible for solving customer car and parts related problems."
good,Great place to learn about car knowledge. Great place to learn how to work as a team and work with many other work places to gain knowledge of the people your working for.
good,Company was fast paced during the period I was with them. Management was good. As to what it is today I do not know as all the managers I had and most of the employees I managed are now with other companies. The pay was that great for the amount of work a manager was expected to do.
good,"Prepared parts for delivery, processed online orders, how to look up car parts, diverse workplace, management was laid back, but professional, coworkers were nice and reliable"
good,"Solid management.  They have a Mission, a Vision, and Beliefs that inspire a culture of selling and success.  Processes and procedures are in place to provide structure and direction."
good,This job is a good place to work. They take care of their employees and reward positive sales. They offer good benefits and competitive salaries. Only negative is limited advancement opportunities.
good,"Overall, it was a great position working in Advance. Some of the management personnel were a bit lacking though. Pay was great, benefits were great, and the hours were alright. It's unfortunately, nearly impossible to rise in this particular call center unless you ""know someone or are friends with someone"" - which sort-of shoehorns bad leadership because everyone is friendly with one another. I learned a lot about how to fully support a diverse staff of individuals and customers alike and how to adjust to meet every customers needs, and to accommodate other team members."
good,"This is a great place for someone who is just starting out. Working there you learn customer service skills, organizing and inventory upkeep, along with working under pressure. You can make a career out of working there or you can use the experience to prepare you for other opportunities."
good,"Literally the most fun and least fun I have had working was for this company and it all depends on your coworkers and managers. Overall it should be a fun retail job. If your coworkers can check baggage at the door its awesome otherwise its a prison sentence. "
good,"Equally balanced my life between work, and they understood for emergencies. I've worked there for a long time and it continues to progress and get better. Though it does get tiring."
good,"It was good work in that place, good pace,instructions. But the management of the managers was not good, personally i did not like how they treat their employees."
good,As soon as you get comfortable at a location the like to move you. Low pay and want you to go all around to City. Hours are not consistent. No benefits unless you are management. No vacation days or sick days.
good,"Nice place to work, low pay for a part time sales person. Flexible scheduling. Slow sales environment considering its location. The co-workers and management were the best part."
good,"Be prepared to work and grow. Strong company with potential to move up. I was able to learn from a lot of great minds in the supply chain. If you are willing to relocate, you will find plenty of positions available."
good,I go in I get my 3 registers cash drawers put in and get my area ready for the day. I answer calls from garages giving pricing on auto parts and if they want them I bill them out .Then I pull parts and stage them for drivers to deliver.
good,"I liked the work just not the hours, would go to work at 7 at night until sometimes 5 in the morning and it was also freezing cold in the building except for the office areass"
good,I loved my job at advanced but didn’t get the hours I needed and got the run around on why my pay check was being shorted so I quit. But I really enjoyed working with my co workers there. The pay was good but the hours weren’t
good,"Enjoyed being busy,  Ireland rd location.  Frustration,  commercial business week. Market needs new option. I believe o reilly properly positioned. Napa strong. A need for option other than autozone or advance."
good,"I looked forward to helping people solve their problems when they would come into the store, Proud of the service that I gave them, and made sure they got the right part at the right price"
good,"A typical day a Advance could be stressful because if someone calls in then we will be short handed all day, so it takes longer to get all the orders done so we can go home. Management sometimes is unaware of how many people have called in that day. The hardest part of the day is you don't know where you will have to be on any given day. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with people who will work with you as a team."
good,"If you are knowledgeable in cars it is a good retail place to work for and if you know a little bit about cars but not a lot, most of the people there will help you become knowledgeable"
good,continuing to work through the Carquest purchase seems to have bogged down this company and slowed the growth they should be enjoying in a market that is waiting for someone to get it right.
good,"Decent employer, especially if you land at a good store."
good,"Cool job, nice company to work for. Compensation could be better.. Management is excelllent though. Me and my manager got along very well. Just a extra .50 or 1.00 could have kept me around ."
good,Advance is great to work for if you want a part time job with little benefits. Employee discounts are okay and the people you get to work with are so friendly!
good,"It all depends if you work at a small store or the HUB, so each place is different. Not all stores are alike, pay is ok nit the best but ok. Better than fast food"
good,"Advance will teach u people skills an how to be respectful and hard working.a typical day at work u will clock in start ur day by stocking what needs to be full on shelf,clean what need to b touched up,the best part is that u get to meet new people an coworkers all day."
good,"The commercial delivery drivers pick parts from inventory, sort parts picked by delivery zone, interface with the EDB to set delivery pattern, load parts for customers in a particular zone for delivery then drive to the customer and deliver parts where needed."
good,Productive very /fast paced /friendly environment . Good for somebody who is into automotive or trying to begin their career in the automotive business .
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a fast paced place to work.  If you know the automotive business, it can quickly become a comfortable place to be.  Unfortunately, new District Management seem to come from other fields of expertise.  They don't seem to know Auto Parts business at all.  Also just don't seem to be concerned with anything other than numbers.  In this business, we build relationships and those relationships can turn into huge retention of business, thus making up those numbers.  They need to see the whole picture."
good,"Must have open availability to work mornings, noon, evenings and on occasions nights,  Limited number of staff. Positive friendly competitive work environment."
good,I have been working there for 6 months and I have learned quite a bit about cars and how they operate. I noticed that many people know just about as much of cars as I do; which makes the job comfortable. I would keep this job if I were full time and/or if it had better pay.
good,"overall a good place to work"
good,"A Typical day of cashing out and helping customers with parts requests was pretty average, not fast paced or too slow. I learned about the parts that cars need. I learned about different cars and how to order the parts the customers needed for them. The management was good. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was loading the battery rack. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the parts and the parts catalog, learning which cars needed what and how they work."
good,"Very flexible. Decent wage. Also good jobs for retired people as well. "
good,"Advanced Auto was a fantastic job for meeting many other business owners, racers, and car restorers. Not all the people are great but some customers make every shift worth while. You may not rank to any significant position unless you are 21, which means any joe older than 21 will eventually be utilized as your superior and that can be hard to take."
good,The company maintains a good culture with its Team Members. The days are long but you have a good crew to make up for it. There are advancement opportunities.
good,"At Advance Auto Parts I learned so many things and worked with some wonderful people while working in the HR department, it was a great experience helping team members on a daily basis."
good,"On a busy work day my job is pretty fast paced. Im usually out of the store delivering to our commercial customers assisting them with whatever products they need. Whenever I'm in the store I sell products to our walk in customers, recommend items, upset, search our database for customer history etc. Overall, when the job get busy it is fast paced."
good,Very laid back environment. It was fun learning about vehicles every day and communicating with regular customers about their projects and possible future projects for myself.
good,Great place for the car enthusiast to work. Most of the management has worked their way up the ladder so they know the ins and outs of the retail parts business.
good,Very good company to work for. Lots of job opportunities as long as you work hard for them. Management willing to work with your ideas. Company is expanding.
good,"Since AAP acquired CARQUEST, the corporate atmosphere has been in a state of flux -- especially since almost everybody was relocated from Roanoke to Raleigh."
good,"At the distribution warehouse, its a good place to learn different divisions/tasks instead of just staying put in one division the whole time there. Offer different shifts to cater the employee's needs when hired."
good,For a hourly paid job Advance Auto Parts was a decent place to work. The pay was fair and the hours were not bad. The environment was very friendly and relaxed.
good,"Working as a night shift manager, I had a decent amount on my plate. Sometimes customers can bring on a huge hassle, as well as some employees not having the appropriate knowledge to help the customers. However, the structuring is fairly decent and everyone puts an effort forward to help out when needed.Over all not too bad of a job. Only problem I see is the short hour shifts."
good,"Advance Auto parts was a great ""starter job"" for me. I started fresh out of high school and quickly advanced through the ranks at the ""in store"" level. I would have happily stayed with Advance Auto parts and built a career their but once I maxed out at the ""in store"" level. I was met with a lot of false promises about my advancement and future there. I was constantly told I was a valued employee and that they were working on getting me to the next level but for the next two years it seemed that they always had an excuse as to why is wasn't the right time or fit. With a growing family I could no longer stay stagnant and was forced to find employment elsewhere."
good,"Company works well with schedule for hourly employees, not so much with salary. High expectations with low payout most of the time. Insurance rates are high."
good,"Customers here are very hit or miss. If they knew more than you then, get ready to be treated badly. Overall company is very good with training, pay, and work/home balance."
good,coworkers make this job and scanning in inventory is almost like getting presents. wish there was more room for advancement and pay increases through.
good,To be determined at a later date and time at which I will provide a full review for everyone to read..................................................
good,Thisis a very good place to work and get a good start on life. If you are looking to get into management this is the place to start. There are several trianing opportunities to start learning.
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a company that is searching for ways to get to the top of the heap, and does a pretty good job at it in a horribly competitive industry."
good,"new management is overworked under appreciated."
good,Advance Auto Parts is a fun place to work with an easy going atmosphere. There is a diverse range of customers. Skills needed to achieve good customer support are for the most part learned on the job.
good,"Good company to work for with the right crew but when management starts to care less about issues within the store, it impacts everyone else around you then."
good,"No insurance"
good,A great place to work for. It is really fun and not a place to stress all of the time. I is trurly a great job. The only down side is that if you are not management you don't make hardly any money. 3 years solid and $9.24 an hour.
good,"Management is fun as long as you follow the rules, and the work is constantly exciting. The least stressful part of the job is delivery, however."
good,"Great employees to work with, enjoyable experience to help customers with any issues, worries, and or needs, everyday is a new learning experience, fairly laid back company"
good,"Pay is a little low , but i just feel like anyone can work here you can have all the certifications and still get  paid as others who don't, the only way you'll get a raise usually is if your stores doing good, been here six years and make 13.50 as a manager"
good,It was a good job to have for learning auto parts and customer service skills. I also learned how to do inventory and management skills.
good,you have to be a team player to work here fast pace environment where every customer is treated with 1st class service and knowledge . best part is getting our customers the right part to get them going
good,"OK work environment all around. Pay card for paycheck is a bother, but can be changed after lengthy process. Frequent call offs by other employees and management make scheduling meaningless."
good,They don't give they good worker's the benefit of doubt. They have  sale goals too high for there employee.They take too long to hire from temporary to permanent
good,"Fast paced, yet fun environment. Has good benefits, and compensation is above average. Decent leadership, but management has room for improvement in my opinion."
good,"Never know what your going to looking up for customers. "
good,I wouldn't recommend a job wit this company. The company doesn't like to invest money into tier team and equipment. There is no security cameras so when things go missing they don't know who to blame.
good,My location had bad management. Combined positions only one payrate. Sales per hour to high for individual while doing someone else's job. Good discount rate. Bad idea of computer system merger with carquest.
good,"I worked in Raleigh for the corporate head quarters for over 10 years, the people were great, made working there very easy. After Advance took over the merger was a very challenging time. Two large companies coming together was made difficult by not having enough direction on how to accomplish some tasks. But overall I learned a lot working there."
good,"I had a great job and was promised promotions, but they never came or got pulled away at the last second. All in all, i would work there again, but it was not a career opportunity for me."
good,Nice place to work at. But if asked to advance to a manager position beware. do not move to another location or open other stores because there will not a place for you to go back to when you are done.
good,Over my six years at Advance Auto parts I have learned a lot about the retail industry the automotive industry. I have learned how to manage time better. The management has usually been easy to get along with and work with.
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts as a driver is a good job, they offer flexible schedules and really care about their employees."
good,"As a Mobile Parts Pro, I take pride in my job. The toughest part of my job is dealing with the elements such as icy roads, heavy rain,and fog. Lifting heavy parts can be a challenge as well. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is the sense of accomplishment i get when I make a delivery in a fast and timely manner; a lot of mechanics depend on me, and i've developed a relationship with every one of them."
good,Reviewing previous days results.  Setting goals for the day.  Speaking with as many customers as possible.  In depth knowledge of retail.  Great co-workers.  Love interactions with Team Members and District leader.
good,This company was a great company at one time. You enjoyed going to work. It has now expected more for less. After the carquest buy out it has went straight to the gutter. I can only go up from here.
good,If the opponuntity persents itself again i would probably consider working for them again . I would love to help other people help themselves
good,"If you want to devote your career to a strong sales culture this is the place for you. Get ready, Sixty days after you start for Advance you are going to be judged by your sales. All your sales will be recorded and if you do well, you will be rewarded. If not your chances for advancement are more difficult."
good,Overseeing the day to day operations of a retail automotive aftermarket store. Supportive management with some growth opportunities
good,Advance Auto Parts is a great place to work and make friends while doing what you love when it comes to helping the general public make their cars better.
good,Fun place to work with friendly co-workers management is supportive and will help you develop not only as an assoicate but as a person
good,"The job was not difficult and the employees were well chosen. Overall, it was a productive place to work. However, the first general manager that hired me was rude to employees and customers. When she was assigned to a new store, she took over half of our employees with her and did not hire anyone else. We were severely under staffed and many of us went weeks or months without lunches or days off. The company did not give us a new general manager for several months, which left only regular employees running the store. Once a new general manager arrived, it was someone that did not know anything about the job and almost lost us commercial business. It still took the company until two months later to give us new employees. The business began to pick up and get better before I left to focus on school."
good,"Enjoyable position with responsibility to manage sales call schedule to best fit your time and target requirements. Recent acquisition of another auto parts supplier causing difficulties for management to make rational decisions on supply chain, product labeling and personnel placement."
good,Great place to work!  Excellent Store Manager!  Learned many new things & enjoyed it very much.  Did many deliveries & aided many customers.
good,"when I get to work I check and see what orders need to be delivered. if any I get the invoice, pull the part and deliver to the mechanic shops"
good,"As an assistant manager we are responsible for personnel, parts inventory, scheduling, payroll, deposits and customer satisfaction. You are required to take test weekly to stay current on equipment and customer needs. Standing on your feed all day (10 Hours), dealing with unruly customers and late employees makes your job hard."
good,"Typically on a day to day basis, you could expect to walk in the door, and clocking in, and jumping strait in the water. Very fast paced environment, I have learned more aspects about retail at this location as well as any different aspects of management here than anywhere else I have worked. My coworkers were pretty friendly, very optimistic, results driven, and very courteous and professional to customers which was a definite plus for our store as most stores in the area I have noticed did not have these same attributes with their staff, The hardest part of the job at times for me was being short handed at times, which was essentially something I had no control over. The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to go the extra mile for a customer and acknowledging their emphasis of recognition for helping them."
good,Really enjoyed helping customers with the unique problems and classics.  Pay could be better as it is still way below the national income average even at the General Managers level.
good,My typical work day is 8 to 8.5 hours including a 1 hour lunch break. I've learned a lot about cars from other co-workers and customers who've come in to purchase parts over the time I've worked for the company which has come in handy in daily life and on the job. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers and coworkers in a civil manner however I feel that is something I have come to excel in overtime in my experience in the retail job world. The most enjoyable part is probably learning something new everyday.
good,"I typical day at work walk in open up the drawers and count the safe."
good,Overall a great opportunity for learning in a fast paced environment with constantly evolving expectations and initiatives. Must be a self starter and motivated to become more proficient and develop new strategies with little managerial involvement. Meeting or exceeding sales and profit goals drive all action.
good,"Keep clean and well organized  my area with the products for the customers. I feel satisfied  doing  my work  especially helping  the customers with they needs. I enjoy works with others, but  most of the time I worked alone  focus on my duties. The hardest part of the job was when the company announced that  the store  in Aguadilla Puerto Rico will close and transfer me to another store far from my home but at that time it was impossible to me accept  . After that     I've been trying to get back to work  in the store again  with no result.The most enjoyable part of the job: see customers happy"
good,"The job primarily consisted of picking up material in the stores and delivering to auto repair shops in the area.  Since we are not the only supplier in the area, a good working relaionship with our customers is very important.  I strive to be friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and deliver quickly and with the correct parts."
good,"good job, but the pay for an educated college individual is'nt recognized."
good,We manufactured metal roofing materials and parts pretty good atmosphere and I also learned shipping and receiving methods and packing and loading Trucks with a forklift
good,I  learned great deal in three months about cars and since it was temporary work I had to put more hours at my regular job since it was the peak season after three months of work at Advance.
good,"•	Responsible for working with the General Manager to lead the store team and grow the retail business in conformity with the company’s 4 key strategies and 3 core values "
good,"Pretty fast paced days, I learned that most customers want and need to be led through the process of purchasing the correct parts to complete thier task at hand. The management staff was pretty lean, but dependable, and eager to learn. The hardest part of the job was being careful to not step on my uplying managers toes while trying to go to the next level. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, and gaining thier trust by providing the knowledge needed for them to complete thier tasks at hand."
good,"I absolutely love cars and the automotive industry, on top of being able to help other people with my knowledge. The ONLY thing I wish I could change is the pay, sadly it's not enough to support my family."
good,"Company has good benefits, and a controlled atmosphere. Really enjoyed the way inventory was controlled."
good,"Advance was a great job to have, we were treated well, the work environment was nice, management was well trained."
good,"On a typical day I would greet customers, answer phones, run the register, look-up and order parts, help customers with any questions and installing parts on their vehicle (windshield wipers, batteries, etc.) download faults from vehicles, clean and close the store. I worked here part time, it was really fun, and a change of atmosphere for me. The hardest part of the job was learning to use the scanner machine and decipher what the codes meant so I could convey the correct information to the customer. The most enjoyable part was learning about the merchandise and helping customers make the best choice for them."
good,"Typical day is busy, hardly time for breaks for me as manager. I learned everything it entail to be in management. In management you have to be sharp. I have those qualities of being fair, sharp, and smart. The co-workers are excellent to work with as long as everyone is on the same page to do the right thing. The hardest part of my job is having to fire people, but that's a part of my job. The most enjoyable part is when everything is running smoothly and everyone is working together. Overall very good company to work for if you're looking for advancement. I advanced from shipping/receiving trainer to manager."
good,Great boss to work for. Always catered to your schedule. Sometimes would pull 16 hr days.
good,The typical day is normal very happy and ready to work. I learned many things about car that I was taught at home.Management was great no problem when it came to talk to the customers and show new people about the things around the store.Wow my co-workers were great I had fun with them at work when i needed them they will help me no matter what. The hardest part about the job was getting parts in English to Spanish. Now the most important thing about it was that the parts where need to be right for what the customer needed.
good,"Working here was like survival of the fittest, because the manager had to like you and you had to be on his good side to het good hours."
good,"Easy place to work.  I Learned a lot about car parts and customer service.  Management was fair and knowledgeable.  You spend most of the time behind a counter, dealing with customers as they walk in the door.  Co workers are usually easy to get along with.  The best part of the job is learning about car parts."
good,"as a supervisor, it seemed as though every couple months, they ""updated our system"" and we'd have even more paper work to file, and more e-mails to send... I didnt understand how we were suppose to be so productive with tasks if we couldnt get away from the computers with the internet running slower than dial up (at every store) "
good,It is a good place to work. I have learned alot from working with this company; such as correct names of certain car parts.
good,"No proper training guidance from managers on store computer system and measurement of job knowledge, although on line training is scheduled, no products seminar is being conducted, making it sometimes difficult to answer some customer questions on the product."
good,"Great company, Good people. Evolving IT. I enjoyed working here."
good,"My sales territory consisted of 13 Advance Auto Part Stores.  Each day I would travel to one of my stores to conduct sales calls with their commercial accounts.  I would first visit the store and complete a commercial review with the general manager and the commercial parts pro.  After discussion and review, I would make 10-12 sales calls to their commercial accounts, selling service capabilities, parts, tools, and shop equipment. After completing my sales calls, I would then visit the store again to complete a verbal recap with the store team.  Upon returning to the office, I would update salesforce.com with the notes from each sales call."
good,High end company with a great team enviorment.I was in charge of the complete day to day operations.
good,Opening or closing store I waited on customers  looked up parts finished sale  put up new merchandise did special orders some inventory readings
good,Enjoyed workplace. Learned a lot about many different vehicles.
good,"Working in a parts store you have all kinds of people some being very funny. Management, well I'm not sure where to start. Within the two and a half years I worked there I honestly lost count of how many managers we went through. Some of them were great, some of them were not, some of them were to passive on things. My co-workers were a riot, I loved coming to work and seeing them. The hardest part would have to be that they toyed with me about a management position, I trained for the position two seperate times. I enjoyed my customers and my co-workers the most"
good,"A place to build your skill in sales and customer service, With high volume calls from potential customers and to our important customers to deliver parts to their shop in an accurate and liable time. The most important part of the job is hitting our goals in dollars per transaction and hour per transaction. Everyday you meet customers with unique characteristics and its a very enjoyable place to work"
good,"Very productive,always had jobs to do very challenging at times but by us being the team we were we always found a way to get things by in perspective. Thats one thing I can say about our team we weren't just tm""s we were more like family."
good,"Shift started at 6:30 AM. Forman meetings and the machine you were running that day. Gather parts you needed for the day. Started working, if one of the other perpon on the line needed help with stocking parts on of us would help. Hardest part of job some heavy parts. I enjoy being there for the enjoyment of meeting and working with others, and doing the jobs I signed up to do."
good,"The job was a decent job, I just had a bad manager he didn't know how to talk to people, he would yell at employees and at customers. So in my eyes he was not the ideal manager."
good,A typical day is making sure that the customers are happy at the when they leave the store. When we are slow on customers then I go through a checklist of task that have to be completed by the end of the day. To use a scan gun to make sure what the computer says we have is what we have on the shelf. For both commercial and retail customers it is important that what the computer says we have in the store we actually have on hand. Then the rest of the list is making sure everything is in the right place or organize according to store needs.scheduled
good,A typical day at work is helping customers pulling Automotive parts and sometimes explaining them.
good,"I go into work early each day to ensure that other employees have work available when they arrive. I have learned many things about WMS and ways to help supervise the employees. My management is encouraging and wants me to do the best that I can do. My co-workers respect me in what I do and I respect them for the hard work that they do each day. The hardest part of my job is, there really is no hard part. I enjoy being able to manage the work and our department. I enjoy taking charge and having the responsiblity."
good,"A typical day is full of challenges and learning opportunities. I learned a lot about warehousing and logistics. It is a great place to get your logistics career started or revived. The management team is typical to most large companies. If you are used to family businesses this is not the place for you. If you are used to politics in a big company then you may like it here as the vast majority of folks are held accountable for their actions and there is very little finger pointing and CYA that goes on unlike most big companies. Co-workers are great for the most part. If you like a fast paced environment you will like it here. Everyone works the same speed and things get done fast. Even the IT guys are great to work with. How many companies can say that? The hardest part is also the speed, the work/life balances is heavily skewed to work. I was on the road 85% of the time at one point. The most enjoyable part is the people. I cannot stress enough how great the people at the distribution centers are."
good,"Strong Management, Business to Business sales. Running store operations."
good,has high company standards towards customers service and employees.
good,"Flexible schedule,  great learning experience. Room for advancement. I only worked part time as this was my secondary job. Pay rate is biggest downfall working for this company."
good,"It is a job that gives one to learn about the job and is trained to have a good job. They help you astound to take another chance. Good culture."
good,"I hate im not there anymore."
good,"Advance is really a great company, they just don't pay as much as they should as their pay doesn't match the job/career they want you to do. This is in most companies anyway. I just feel they should reward top performers and their help a bit more."
good,"I like the unpredictable issues that arise with each customer that come in , plus the discount I get on parts, and the hours I can adjust from week to week."
good,"As an overall employer, I enjoyed the work. There were good employees and bad employees, as it is everywhere else. Upper level management did recognize good employees, but advancement in the workplace wasn't always the most fair or feasible."
good,"The people that I work with are knowledgeable and easy to get along with. Corporate policies, specifically regarding the customer rewards program, often make it hard for employees to satisfy the customers. Besides that, enjoyable and easy job."
good,"AAP has been very flexible with my work and school schedule. The position is pretty straightforward, there's a few unorthodox situations but other than that pretty ordinary"
good,Learned about the trade in doing outside sales and taking care of accounts/customer. Most enjoyable part of my job is selling equipment for shops which help them grow their business
good,Would make a great saftey manager or recruiter to retention of good employees. As i stated i have done everything from background checks to drug testing.  Would prefer saftey
good,"I liked the job,  My manager was good to me. I had good co workers, we made the days good.  The job was really fun.  I got to meet alot of different people."
good,You work lots of changing hours and shifts dealt with customers that thought you should know everything about their cars which isn't possible.  As manager can get asked come in on off day at any moment
good,"Good place to start a career as a part time employee, take classes and help on the road to becoming ASE level literate in car parts and some repair.  Part time can be migrated to full time as openings are available if the candidate is willing to change store locations and be available when an opportunity comes."
good,"Good place to work at, good people, fun atmosphere. Only real annoying part was having to deal with rude customers, or people who spoke no English, and or stole."
good,I learned alot by being employed by Advance Auto Parts. I was able to use critical thinking skills and learned alot about vehicles and their many parts.
good,Working for advance auto parts was exciting and educational. I knew a lot about vehicles and parts but working for advance auto parts taught me so much more.
good,Great if you enjoy being a part of the car community. Informative training. Gained valuable experience along the way. Not the best compensation for your time.
good,"Progression is slow. They rather hire outside the company than promote from within. Also their compensation is below average. There is room for advancement, but it takes a very long time to move up."
good,"Part-time Parts Delivery Driver:"
good,"It is a nice,  clean place to work in.The managers respect you and aren't to hard to work with. The hours are great and the benefits are ok , what needs to be better is the pay."
good,I had a great experience at Advance Auto. I do wish there were more opportunities for growth though. I would have stayed with the company to this day if the growth were available.
good,It started out great just had a few difficulties with management they were somewhat bias I was uncomfortable but I like the job it was a step toward the job that I'm in right now
good,A fun group of people with great people skill and a motivation to help others. The management was awesome there was never any issues sorting out opinions and each person seemed happy.
good,The manager they have there was thrown into the job. She was not trained properly. The company has a hard with letting the managers actually hire the correct people for the job. As well as always having the managers trying to stay in the office and not help on the sales floor.
good,Love it here. Way bigger and better than oreilly auto parts. Was accepted into the group. Training was real easy because I already had almost 6 years of experience under my belt.
good,"I worked in 17 stores in 8 different states across a 15 year period. If you're willing to relocate, it's easy to move up the ladder quickly.  Good training through intranet courses in store."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is on the right track to grow, and be the leader in the aftermarket.  If you work towards that goal, you will do well here.  Overall compensation package is competitive in the industry."
good,"I had a great manager. Work life balance was good. Pay was a little lower than similar jobs in the area."
good,"Advance auto parts is a good place to work in, it calm and they take care of its employees, the only bad thing about advance auto parts"
good,It was a fun job good for students needing extra cash. I recommend prior vehicle experience and be able to identify specific parts. Spanish is a plus and 50 cent pay raise.
good,"A typical day at work involves pulling parts orders from warehouse/store stock, delivering to customers such as repair shops and car dealerships, and interacting with representatives at customer locations; on a typical day I also usually stock parts in the warehouse and on the sales floor."
good,"I personally loved my job at Advance and I'm more than likely would have stayed or would even think of going back. The only thing that pushed me away was I needed more hours and more money on my paychecks. I enjoyed working there, the people are easy to work with it's definitely like a family."
good,"A typical day at work was keeping up with the inventory, making sure that all customers are taken care of in a timely fashion, and always promoting sales for the store."
good,"Great company to work for. Good benefits and Human Resources is easy to get to. Employees are nice and upper management as well. You receive a lot of hours, pay is okay. Very fast paced environment."
good,it was great to work with such an awesome team I had a great experience working with advance. I learned new  and better thing the time I was there. I want to thank advance for the opportunity for working with them. thank you
good,I enjoyed working here. I am just not able to anymore due to the requirements necessary for the job such as lifting very heavy items. I dealt with customers regularly. Managed inventory and daily shipping and receiving.
good,"A typical day at work can range from anything about having to help a customer do a Brake pad job to finding a obscure rare and random item that needs a special part number."
good,"Becoming actual ""full-time "" is a joke. So after 1.5 years and being in managment I still didnt get paid holidays even though I worked 40 hours every week."
good,Working at advance auto parts has been experience that I will treasure for a long time.  I feel though due to corporate policy the lack of advancement and the pay rate are the biggest issues' I deal with. that's why I must pursue other interest. this company was a good start but I can't afford to become stagnant .  I enjoy everyone  at work. Its nothing personal just business.
good,I immensely enjoyed my time working there. I would work there again given the opportunity.  I had to move that's the only reason I had to leave there.
good,It is a company where in addition to sales you can help people to solve the problems of their vehicles (battery change) without them having to make any additional payment.
good,"Management needs to look who they are moving up, also company needs to improve huge changes on everything. Starting off here and showing your worth is def. Well worth it and shows you great leadership skills. Good stepping stone for anyone that wants to start in a warehouse setting."
good,"When I was working there, we had days that were fun and went by fast no matter the situation. I really miss it and would go back but they just don't work you enough hours."
good,great job nice employees. great training in the work place. upper management as far as district manager are not as great but is a great job. great customers and staff stick together for the most part
good,I was able to learn how to help customers and deal with the public. I was able to meet new people and assist them in finding parts for there car boat lawn mower and tractor.
good,"I had no experience whatsoever when I commenced this job. l have learned so much, not just from work, but from the customers as well. It has helped shaped my character and given me the experience to strength my customer service skills."
good,This job teaches you a good deal about cars if you don’t already. I had fun meeting new people and learning new things. The work can be relaxed but fast paced. Can be stressful at times.
good,Advance auto parts was a nice place to work. It had some unusual hours though. Could of had some better experienced workers. Very little family time while working there.
good,"My typical day at advance auto parts changes daily depending what the customer questions are and need. "
good,"Can be a fun team environment, assisting customers with automotive parts.  Pushing sales takes the fun away but that is expected working in retail.  I gained automotive knowledge during my time at Advance Auto."
good,I do not wish to review this company. My time there was good and I had a lot of fun working for them. The team atmosphere in our store was great and the manager was good.
good,"Advance Auto Parts believes in a high level of customer service. Any complaints I have are typical of all retail giants. Overall, it's a good company."
good,My time with Advance Auto was amazing. We were challenged everyday to hit our sales goal and praised when we hit it. The work was sometimes labor intensive but it made me feel like I accomplished throughout the day.
good,"I am only working here part time as it pay $9.00 per hour."
good,"Typical day was having pre route meeting with store personel."
good,The pay rate was really low.  There was no option for part time people to receive commissions. It is easy to find a job paying more money with less work and less stress.
good,Great sourcing ability to meet the needs of DIY and DIFM Customers.  Managers own the business and are encouraged to make sure that both they and their team take care of the Customer.
good,"When you love everyone you work with, there is never a bad day. There are the faults in management but I don’t dread coming to work. Great learning experience!"
good,"Fast pace. high punctuality, great attention to details,safety awareness."
good,This company has is opportunities just like any other. Great family environment and great support to the stores.. There is good communication from Regional and Divisional team.
good,"I mainly dealt in inventory maintenance, and low level customer assistance. My coworkers were all knowledgable and very willing to share what they had learned. My only issue was that I worked there for three years, and never had the opportunity to go anywhere, and I'm very sure I could have. Turns out, when you win awards for you manager, he wants to keep you around."
good,Advance is a great place to work at i you plan on never moving up the ladder in your store. Most of the positions that open up are undesirable due to location or co-workers.
good,Great job security for little pay. Employees are just a number. They are more concerned with customers and not the employees so if someone comes in and treats you bad they don't care
good,"Auto parts business is on a downward spiral. So get ready for managers to be like SALE!SALE!SALE! you butt off. The stores went from having all car parts to now accessories to make your car look good. I think the younger generation just isn't interested in repairing their cars to save money or maybe its the mark up on the prices since I worked the industry. How can an auto battery that is made of just plastic, lead, and acid cost around 200 dollars! Tube of gasket sealer 10 dollars! one 13mm wrench 9 dollars! Crazy !  It's E-bay for me. On top of all that it's not even half the quality the stuff was 15 yrs ago."
good,"i enjoyed my time in the warehouse. given the chance i'd work there again. management just hadn't stepped in the situation when they should have, which i understand they were worried about what feed back they would get for stepping into the type of situation it was at the time."
good,"daily tasking and inventory control"
good,I have been employed by several different auto parts retail companies. Advance by far is the greatest when it comes to employees and flexibility. The pay is the best and the opportunities are endless when you want them.i have come across some of the most knowledgeable employees in the business and most are willing to disperse of their knowledge as needed. If one is going into automotive retail this is the place to be.
good,"I was responsible for ensuring that the correct parts were pulled for delivery to our commercial customers, then deliver the parts in a timely manner. Ask if there were any returns and if so, fill out the paper work to document the return.."
good,"Advance Auto Parts - my employment in the e-services division has been a fulfilling experience."
good,"Work was typically slow, except when delivering to commercial accounts. I learned a lot about automotive car parts and different vehicles. Management always treated me fairly. Hardest part was when the days were slow, they seemed to go by slower. Most enjoyable part was working with great coworkers and getting to work in an automotive store."
good,The company gives opportunity to advance with hard work and dedication.  Good customer service is most important. Learning regular customers names means a lot to one and keeps them returning and word spreads of the good service they receive.
good,"There's nothing to special about working for Advance Auto Parts. Its a retail based job that demands a general understanding of automotive systems. "
good,greet  help and sales is part of the job. but most important understand and finding the right parts for customers. not everyone know what they are coming in for. its a good place to work if you know a lot about cars parts and other accessories .
good,It was a great experience and the managers were very good wit hands on teaching and the certification was a great step plus the overtime was helpful to adding balance to your life and they were very understanding to family emergency
good,The most enjoyable part of Advance Auto's support center was the free coffee and a closely knit workplace culture which emphasized ownership and accountability. I enjoyed my time there and would have continued with the company if there had been better benefits or wages for  contracted workers.
good,"At Advance we focus on serving our customers to the best of our abilities. We drive sales around our rewards program SPEED PERKS. And we complete brand, parts, and AAP operations training to ensure an excellent customer experience."
good,There was a steady source of help and support when needed cross training and open dialogue given for a strong working environment where success and enjoyable work can coexist
good,Helped in customer service and worked to make sure the store was in optimal order. Put away stock. Co-workers always willing to lend a hand in time of need.
good,"If you love automotive, it is a great place to be, however if you don't know automotive or anything about tools(for example someone comes in looking for say a pair of ""dogs"" if you don't know those are the vise grip plyers with the adjustible head then you shouldn't be there) . Some days were busy and some days not so much. the days that were busy weren't too busy, if you knew what you were doing then everything went smoothly. On days that its not busy you find yourself doing the same thing at least 3 times an hour just to be doing something. You can get extra hours a lot if you're willing to drive to another store, I helped at other store usually 1 extra day a week on average, of course they always ask you first. I believe the company would attract more customers if they had a catchy jingle lie auto zone or the other automotive stores."
good,"Very fast pace and Lots of Heavy lifting,love working with the other driver at times it can be very chaotic because you have no real training you have to figure things out on your own"
good,For the most part the company employees worked well together and helped each other with solving problems. The hardest part of the job was satisfying customers when parts were not available.Over time they began to restrict any type of pay raise and made comments about some employees getting paid to much.
good,"You will learn a lot about cars, and meet interesting people every day.It's a great place to work, management will train you on the store operations. The culture is sometimes hectic on busy days,"
good,A place where you would learn a lot about the automotive business and grow as a team member. Will definitely make you pull your hair out sometimes but overall good place to work.
good,"good place to start out working, learning the cash register.  Good work environment to learn to talk and interact with customers and there wants and needs.Pay is not very good if you aren't in management."
good,"We had to install batteries, windshield wipers, checked batteries and alternators. We stocked from delivery and back stock. We did inventory and delivered parts."
good,Leaned alot and help with my schooling! I leaned names of the parts . They were very flex with my hours so I could attend school. Also if they need a counter guy at another school they would call me.
good,Good place to work with great people and challenges. The leadership allowed me to take the department where I felt it needed to go. We built an awesome world class team
good,"great place to work really bad management place is going down hill that being said really liked the regular customers that stopped in.  "
good,Great place to work. Very supportive and open communication. Opportunities are available and encouraged. They care about the team members and want them to succeed as well.
good,mangers at my store were very friendly and they would help teach you things about the job and were very willing to help their employees out with whatever
good,"Great environment, awesome location close to everything. Serve, Meet & Greet customers to get the best parts & customer service available. It's a must for people to come in see for themselves."
good,"I enjoy the business, very professional and easy to communicate. EVERYTHING and everyone was on point with what they were doing and knowledge of product"
good,"Most co-workers are mature in age and attitude. They are very willing to help their fellow co-workers. Management respects employees, while ensuring job is done accurately and correctly. Best part of the job is a relaxed atmosphere, where employees seem to feel comfortable being themselves. The hardest part of the job is dealing with construction on the freeways while making deliveries. This, however is something that can't be avoided."
good,it is a very great place to work some days were very stressful but it was great there and a very friendly environment to work in and management is vety understanding if you have a family
good,Overall it was a fun place to work but i was wanting a change from the retail industry and that is why I left. You work with a very diverse customer base from the novice automobile owner to the master certified technician.
good,I would drive a forklift to get anything we was need to ship out of the warehouse. i learned how to drive different types of forklifts and use RF scanners. My manager and i got alone well together and everyone that worked there was kind.
good,"Great customers. I increased my knowledge of car parts and how to do auto repairs. Good place to work. The hardest part of the job was the focus on sales goals, seeing as how we are not paid on commission. With those goals and the focus on them, I felt there was no real teamwork."
good,"With the right leadership in place, Advance can be a great place to work. Sometimes they don't get it right on the leadership. The hours aren't bad. they are like any other retailer. The work is only as hard as leadership makes it. The best part is the people."
good,great company to work for fast pace job dealing with automotive parts installing battery's and helping customers find what they need fun staff and good management
good,The company has a major Cultural change it has embarked upon.  If completed it will finish as an Industry leader.  Exciting things are happening and will continue over the next several years.
good,"Employees are 'Team Members' and organized into typical corporate departments and sub-teams. The Roanoke office has a vendor operated café for breakfast and lunch. There is a large open area for company wide meetings, to walk/exercise and ping pong tables. Workplace culture is to 'serve the customer' who can either be external or internal people/entities. We move forward by collaborating as one team and champion inclusion by embracing diversity of people, thoughts and skills to deliver results."
good,Great job with good benfits. I learned alot there about cars and retail. Started as normal team member then key holder then mover to as retail sales manager. Down side no set schedule and dealing with rude people.
good,Working at Advance you learned how to work with people and there daily issues they have with there vehicles. Management and the work environment was the best part of the job.
good,What I love is Advance Auto Parts is a family orienated company. A typical day is logging in at 8:00am take inbound calls and log out at 4:30pm
good,"Customer service skills"
good,"Its a great place to work     ..but my commute is extreme..     One and a half hours there and back .    that's three hours of commuting each day.and the winter weather adds more time to my drive..                      "
good,Advance is a great company to work for sometime you may work 7 days striaght without a day off and still dont get 40th hours. Thats because the store its staff right. But good benefits decent pay dont like the fact that commerical customer get better discount them the team members
good,"Your typical day at AAP revolves around customers. You will primarily be customer facing and will spend a lot of time talking to, helping, advising and checking out customers. When you are not customer facing you will be stocking, training, resetting planograms, counting inventory, cleaning and other duties assigned by store management."
good,"Your day at Advanced Auto Parts starts fairly early. You are responsible for stocking shelves, unloading trucks, organizing and updating the store, along with satisfying customer needs."
good,"Great Management team in place. Hourly Team Members really work hard and as efficient as possible. Work is not hard, just fast paced, makes the days / weeks go by fast. "
good,"Ability to run your store with out much interference from upper management. Able to hire, train and develop your own team. Able to write schedule a schedule that allows you to spend time with your family."
good,I enjoy working here and have advanced very quickly. There seems to be a lot of empty promises though between what the General Manager wants and what the District Manager decides.
good,On a typical day it may be busy. Quiet often there is a daily challenge. Something that you really have to solve. It makes you think. It makes you learn. Forces you to strive to advance yourself. The crew is usually a pleasure to work with. Most days it's more like hanging out with a bunch of friends as opposed to a day at work.
good,"Advance is a great place to work if your a car guy, you get to experience a lot of different types of people and different cars, really good place to work"
good,"fun and educational place to work depending on co workers. "
good,everyday is competive everyone is friendly constant team work hardest part is when delivery is slow. the customers are our main goal to keep satisfied. the manager is understanding and great. the district manager is understanding in every way possible.
good,"Great company with benefits. if you enjoy the automotive industry, this will be the perfect fit for you. You must also be customer friendly. Training is very hands on. The company will train you well"
good,A typical day at work at AAP is  working your  emails and answering phones calls from Team members with questions about their leaves or Benefits questions. This job has educate me about Benefits and Leave of absent laws according to states laws. I don't believe there is a hard part about this job. This job is easy if you manage your time right. I believe the most enjoyable part about this job is my coworker. They make you feel like family.
good,"A day with hard work, is a bit tiring , working 8 hours or more ."
good,I have learned a lot working their. I have had to work many different job which I love to do. If they where not taking my weekend shift away I would not be looking for another job. I loved working 3 days a week 12 hour days.
good,"Great work environment that demands highly organized individuals who are great with people and focus on customer satisfaction. Workdays can be busy due to large rushes of customers on certain days but as long as co-workers work together and understand what they are dealing with everything runs smooth. Working with management showed me mostly that communication is key and without it the job can fall apart, but in this company everyone is pretty much working toward the same goal so its not difficult just have to be a people person"
good,"I quit O'Reilly Auto Parts to move, and got a job at Advance Auto Parts. I MUCH more enjoyed the workplace and job morale at O'Reilly's. Advance has great 'local' management, but it seems as if the higher executives are not in touch with their company. The system is outdated, the store is run down, and the general employee morale is low."
good,"Management could be better, Promotions are eligible for anyone that qualifies. Customer service is a big part when working here. You get a chance to learn about cars even if you have no idea about them when you are first hired."
good,"It wasn't long before I was promoted to Assistant General Manager (within 2 months).  I preformed well under the circumstances and wanted nothing more than to continue to motivate those under me to better themselves, as well as better myself."
good,"I like the position, and the idea of dealing with customers in Advance Auto Parts.  The environment is a very fast paced, and demands detail whenever you're focusing on the customer's needs."
good,A typical day at work is very busy and productive. I've learned many things from this place of business such as the value of work ethic. I have learned not to take a heavy work load for granted. I am also very appreciative of the management. They are the most understanding when it comes to personal endeavors. I love my co- workers without them the day would't go by as smooth as it does. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've completed your job task for the day.
good,Fun environment in the store. Absolutely no job security. You can fourteen years with the company and then within a minute someone can walk in and you are let go without any warning or opportunity to remain with the company. Overall within the store employees there is a good relationship but with outer management there is strict wall.
good,Helped set up and open the store. Was offered an assistant managers position but wasn't able to accept it. Enjoyed working with everyone there. Very little turn over in the first 2 years.
good,The company have good manager support. Its all about making sure the employee and customer are satisfy. It have a equal balance on fairness in this company and don't let politics get involved. It is a place to personally grow and develop great skills.
good,"A typical day would be providing the best customer service possible while completing tasks such as store appearance, inventory maintenance, as well as training fellow team members in proper procedure. If you find ways of improving yourself it is recognized and moving through the management ranks is very possible. The hardest part of the job is the flip flop scheduling of retail but, this is to be expected. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing relationships with your customers and creating repeat business."
good,"My typical day as an Admin was everything but. Administrative Assistants have a busy day from the minute they step in the door to the minute they clock out. But I wouldn't have it any other way. You learn to manage it all and you end up with a sense of accomplishment and pride. I had the Best Boss I have ever had at a job anywhere. He was dedicated, professional and most of all he cared about people. "
good,"Good company to work for with opportunities for advancement and career/personal growth. A company with a culture of putting the customer first but focused on delivering sales results. Can feel like the company changes direction from time to time, but focused on long term growth. Sometimes can feel a bit micromanaged from upper levels with numerous reports and assesments"
good,Regardless of how the day was going the General Manager is always willing to go above and beyond to help his employees. Overall great experience
good,A normal day consists of an 11 hour shift with an hour lunch. I have developed a great sense of confidence dealing with customers on a daily basis. I have made improvements on interviewing and candidate searching. The most rewarding part of my position is the freedom that is given to its general managers to be able to effectively run and develop our business.
good,working as a team is a good thing because everyone gets along ad also the trucks leave at the time there supposed to leave at
good,"enjoy talking with customers "
good,day at work learning experience learned how to prepare cars theres some good management the coworkers are fun to work with the hardest part is writing a schedule most i like about job is different things everyday.
good,Great company with great advancement opportunities. Management team can be rough and ignorant. Needs to reevaluate higher management team. Job is what you make it.
good,"Typical day at Work:"
good,"Opening tasks include pulling overstock, preparing registers and computer systems, unlocking the doors, and getting in the ""zone"""
good,"Though sometimes I feel as if Management is concerned on running one side of the business at times and doesn't seem to care about the problems you're currently facing. The balance between different positions always seems to work out for the better. Most coworkers are eager to help you learn and help you advance where applicable. I can't say I'm a fan of the scheduling, however I am part time so I don't get much say in that department. Working on the weekly inventory can be monotonous at times but isn't really that bad and I love working with the customers I have coming in on a slow, but daily basis."
good,"Good first job. Taught me how to work with the public and apply my mechanical knowledge at the same time. If you succeed and give your best, advancement options are possible. Hard to get a full-time position however, and the pay is not adequate enough to make a living from."
good,Work with a group of people you hope turns into a TEAM. Sell auto parts and discuss with customer their project. Put product away in a timely fashion. Monthly Ad Sets. Count money in drawers and safe. Open\Close store.
good,"Learning more every day, expect to have my own store soon.  Staff is supportive and we work together as a team."
good,Good company but extremely over managed.Advancement is difficult unless you are a yes man. The key here is not to voice your opinions or ideas. Make them think they thought of it.
good,"A typical day at work starts off opening the store and making sure all funds are accurate.  Going over metrics for understanding sales, shrink, comp...Laying out game plan on tasks small and large, daily, weekly, and monthly.  Assigning tasks and following up with each individual not only for tasks, but other metrics each are supposed to do.  Creating action plan if things are not happening.  Understanding and helping employee learn and grow.  While all of this is happening, taking care of my own goals, tasks, and responsibilities, as well as helping customers the best I can.  We help customers all day while managing to fit the tasks in.  Customer service is my main function all day.  Overseeing the store and making sure everyone is completely satisfied.  However there are some cons who take advantage of big corporations.  I am excellent at drawing that fine line in growing business."
good,"you learn a lot in this company, share many experience with customers , and sharing knolege.."
good,Great oportunities. good people. not much in the way of advancement
good,"a typical day at Advance was usually good, parts delivery was the greatest part of my day due to the commercial customer base."
good,"The workplace is a fun environment, there is always something to do whether its front facing the store, doing back stock or just straightening up the shelves we stay busy. my co-workers are fun to be around and very helpful because i don't know much about cars. "
good,Co-workers were great to be around. With a 15% commission on all our sells made in that pay pried.
good,"daily tasks include following assistant managers task list, assisting customers in a timely manor, managing register money and safe petty cash. supervising staff , ensure staff follow up on assigned tasks"
good,"Working for Advance Auto Parts was a very enjoyable job. As the General Manager, you are responsible for EVERYTHING that is, and happens, in the store. The job itself, managing an auto parts store, was very fun and rewarding. This was especially true when you and your team beat sales goals and targets from previous years. Also, the store team can become a ""family"" when things are done right.  Upper management in my area had no clue what they were doing and did not help me to succeed. It was more of an add-on task and micro-manage mentality it seemed from upper management, instead of a store focused and goal oriented mentality. They need to let the people that they chose for each position do their job and not micro manage on everything, especially when they have no idea about each store atmosphere and team. Compensation is lacking, at best, except for when you are firm about asking for more pay. They will budge, but not without a fight. Management are REQUIRED to work 50 hrs/week, but pay is still based on a 40 hour work week. Just a little way to take advantage of the manager and get them to work for less. Overall, Advance Auto Parts was a great place to work when upper management was not involved. Helping customers solve their automotive problems and becoming part of the store team are very fulfilling."
good,Daily contact with all Commercial Customers to increase sales and continue customer communication. Manage all out going deliveries and delivery personnel for efficient delivery schedule.  Customer service and communication is key to providing and meeting customer expectations. Team work with co workers and delivery personnel is required to be successful in building customers and a company. Daily challenges are trying to fulfill customer time frames with on time delivery of parts. It is always a pleasure when customers ask for me by name and wait until I am available to assist them with request. Customer service is my main goal. Personal friendships have grown out of my desire to fulfill customers requirements for their business and personal needs for parts. I desire to continue learning and taking the challenge of new tasks. Experience is the best teacher in every arena of life and I am still in the game to win.
good,"in the mid-west, there is no hurry to do anything, and I am coming from a more fast environment."
good,"While my job can be challenging, I have enjoyed the face pace family environment at AAP."
good,Room to help you grow in understanding of auto parts and care.
good,"The company truly does care about their employees, but does not give pay raises often, and getting to be a high turnover rate for employees seeking better compensation and not being able to move up in the corporation"
good,I actually enjoyed working for Advanced Auto. I was able to put my bilingual ability to use on a daily basis. I was able to lead my team and at the same work with my team to achieve the goal which was making sure our customer received the best customer service.
good,"not very competitive on pay"
good,"Advance is moving from being a medium sized company to being a large company; the largest, in fact, in its industry. In the process there's very little wiggle room for the average employee and any chance for HR or upper management to do the shabby thing is not overlooked."
good,"I have been an employee at Advance Auto Parts (AAA) for three years.  A typical day for me at AAA includes working in a team environment, assisting customers on the sales floor and installing car parts when applicable. During my time at AAA, I have had the opportunity to take on and learn management responsibilities.  As a key holder I balanced the cash registers daily, counted the money in the safe and recorded it on a bank deposit form, helped to manage a team of 4 to 5, and assisted customers with returns and exchanges.  The management team at AAA makes sure their team members are treated fairly and that everyone works in a safe environment.  My co-workers at AAA are also very helpful and we all work together as a team to get things accomplished. The hardest part of my job is installing car parts in harsh weather conditions. However, on the other hand, I love cars and the best part of working at AAA for me is seeing and learning about all the different makes and models of cars."
good,"A typical day started with setting up totes and big boxes for different stores we had to pull car parts for. The rest of that day consist of pulling those parts and separating them to the different stores. Or I spent the whole day taking UPS orders and packing &processing the orders for pick up."
good,There are few if any typical days . I  have learned a lot about Inventory management and loss control. There is a huge amount of turn over. I have a hard time with co-workers whom would rather smoke and text than answer the phone and help customers. I really like helping people figure out what is wrong with there vehicle and what is required to repair it.
good,"This is a great starting point to gather experience, but once you learn what you need to, move on!"
good,The job is mostly just part-time unless your a manager. Many options in the job. Very flexible schedule. great place.
good,"The company is under revision again, they are slowly moving back to the main objective of the ORIGINAL Advance. Customer service and parts availability."
good,overall a good experience to work face to face with customer loved it. not good pay 
good,This was a great work place I learned all about cars and the parts how they work and where they are located on cars.
good,I have enjoyed my time with Advance Auto Parts but looking to take my talents to another company.
good,its a good place to work. I enjoy the challenges I am faced with every day. Upper management is fair.
good,"Every day was different. I would go in and find out what what I would be doing that day. Some days I would unload trucks, and others, I would receive parts in using an rf scanner and put the parts in the proper locations. I learned how to use a scanner to keep track of inventory. The management usuallyleft us alone to do our jobs. I got along with all my coworkers."
good,"A typical day included answering a multi line phone system, assisting walk in customers with part searches and orders, and delivery of parts to various maintainance shops. Excellent and fun group of employees to work with."
good,"I started as a pt cashier and moved up to ASM in under 4 years. There is lots of room for advancement, and their training is very effective. You might just make a career out of it."
good,"great place to work. got transferred without notice and had planned a vacation i got engaged on so had to quit. great people friendly, decent pay"
good,Not a good balance between Personal and work. Hours expected to work without compensation were unreasonable.
good,I deliver parts to garages and sell to DIY customers. I also do plan-o-grams and do stock related tasks.
good,"With inventory management issues, store sales to track, orders to be picked and delivered, there is always a full day expected. Management was moved around to accommodate store needs. Co-workers made work day fun. Hardest part of the job was not being able to help the individual stores like I wanted. The most enjoyable part was the people"
good,i help customer with problems with there vehicles. I learned how to deal with people with attitude. My manager didn't know how to do his job. I enjoyed working with my co-worker we was like family. There wasn't really a hard part of the job. making my customer smile and helping them with what they needed
good,working for advance auto and learing how the company works was a great experience.
good,Advance Auto Parts is a company that I love. Being able to help persons with their problems on a daily basis is what the job is about.
good,"I have a passion for working with cars, parts, engines or anything to do with automobiles."
good,"good part time job,works around important personal issues."
good,typical day at work delivering parts to different Companys and Businesses and also filling out the nessesary papper work. i learned how to be more perfessional at filling out paperwork and signing off. i learned the different towns and streets and how to get around to them learn alot from different partners it makes me want to work harder i had great managers that i worked with couldnt be better .my co workers was like family i love working with them they mad me love my job i use to go to work on my days off.the hardest part of the job was the rush hour but you learn to get through it.the most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and the regular Customers that got to know you for coming to the store they treat you so nice and with respect. sometimes they even as for you thats how great of a worker u become.
good,Great Work Experience
good,"Typically come in and assess store, customer flow. Work on any backstock/inventory replenishment. Once a month help with signage changeover for new promotions. Start of every week review upcoming planogram changes and any pricing that may have dropped and needs to be completed on salesfloor. Assist customers with their automotive needs, both professional and commercial customers. Back Up driver, deliver parts as needed to support the business."
good,"great management, flexible and understanding, good advancement options. industry is on the downfall with online competition, and compensation for management positions is nowhere near it should be, compared to the amount of issues and responsibilities that are assigned to you."
good,Great place to work. I really had no complaints other than corporate putting too much pressure on customers with upsales. Other than that no complaints.
good,"Everything, from front desk to behind the scenes, answering calls, managing drivers where they need to go to deliver parts. Setting up the time schedule, watching sales, reviewing budgets. Reports given to DM on daily basis."
good,I work long workdays. 60 hours plus. As a new gm the store is understaffed. On it is hard to find time off. I need to find a position that will help me balance my home and work life.
good,"Typically, the days were slow and peaceful. Sometimes you had a rush of customers. Very few times did we have an unruly or unreasonable customer. If you're looking for a good work environment. I would personally recommend them."
good,"Move parts in an expiditious manner from Point A to Point B. Good job for someone with a break in resume, killing time between moves, or old people who are bored."
good,Smooth and easy workdays. Learned a lot about car parts. Management was fair and helpful. The other employees were nice and helpful as well. Overall a nice work place.
good,"Plenty of room to grow with the company,  your knowledge of parts help customers find what they need the first time to do the job correctly. Team work is very important.  It takes everyone to run the store. So if someone calls out that puts a lot on everyone else. Our main focus is to help customers and not keep them waiting."
good,La parte más difícil del trabajo es algunas cosas suelen ser pesadas
good,"Good place to work, my manager is easy going. The other guys are fun to be around. Relaxing atmosphere when times are slow. Fast paced when busy. Store driver is out delivering parts most of the time, day goes fairly quick.Only downfall is the pay. I'm considered part time therefore I don't get paid holidays,vacation,or sick leave. I make $10.00 an hour and work 40 hours a week.Have my weekends off. Nobody gets overtime. If scheduled to work Saturdays you get the following Monday off and come in @ 9:00 am the rest of the week. However I work Mon. thru Fri 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. Top pay for full time I believe is around $16.00 per hour with benefits. Even at that rate balancing income and benefits would be difficult (unaffordable). I like the job just need more pay. Is a great supplemental job for retirees,as we have 2 drivers who work 4 hours a day."
good,"It is a good place to work. Driving is easy especially for older workers. If you do your job right no problem, if you make mistakes you are written up."
good,Enjoying helpin people solve problems minor to major with there cars and parts. Enjoying working with others. Learn new info about differnt cars and components everyday
good,"Simple job if you are willing to pay attention. Nothing changes much each day, so it's pretty consistent. Pay is decent, and the work is very physical."
good,"Every one was always friendly, positive work ethics, everyone always got along, manager was always respectful and equal with all work, flexable work schedule."
good,Great people to work with. They could use a little higher compensation for their hourly employees but a great work environment with very knowledgeable people!
good,"Good place to work, friendly environment, we stayed busy but not stressed."
good,"I love working there cause my boss is a good , friendly , and he works with me ony schedule .  I love to Smile , be friendly , get along with everyone .you have to have great customer service to work with the public."
good,positive environment to work at. Good pay and very good schedule. The management is very knowledgeable and always willing to teach employees new things.
good,After carquest closed down. I was able to keep my job with advanced auto parts. There I learn more about becoming a manger and having the store in order.
good,I love working for Advance Auto Parts. It's fun and  fast moving. Great people. I had to move and no available positions in my job title near my home.
good,Worked 3  months hired as a driver  probably spent  3 hours total driving. Did not like counter work. Great manager and awesome crew. Just did not get to do what I was hired for.
good,"The job is fun, hours are flexible, but the pay is lacking. Their 401k is very good and it  can grow quickly, if you can manage to max out the company match."
good,It’s a really great business to advance in. Opportunities come and are offered to employees first before the public. Can always learn something new working here.
good,"Advance Auto parts has been a dependable low paying job that I could count on for many years. There were always opportunities for advancement. No matter what my life situation was advance auto parts offered so much flexibility. Although advance has never been a competitive paying job for my multitasking skills, I could always count on them for a job. Which is quite difficult"
good,Very busy and fast paced. Mandatory overtime. Always on your feet. No time for error and always have to be consistent and fast in the position. Short training.
good,"Fun and beneficial place to work, Great rate and benefits. Just learn to say no to some requests by managers or they can and some will take advantage of you. Great team atmosphere."
good,"I had a great time working for Advance, it was all around a very good, low stress experience. Everyone was willing to help you learn if you didn't know how to do something and it was definitely helpful if you want to learn about cars."
good,"Good people, good environment to work in. Need to lower the the AC degrees from 76 degrees to 70 degrees. When your employees sweat all the time not good."
good,"Plenty of opportunities to advance in the company. Training and development is always ongoing, everyday is a learning experience. Hours are flexible. Q"
good,"My typical day  was to prepare the store for the business day ensure all staff was in place to assist the customers. I learned how to open new stores,"
good,"Love where I work...the diversity of customers from your neighborhood mechanic to the little old lady down the street. "
good,"easy work days"
good,The team provided a good working environment. They encouraged a culture of inclusion and diversity. The job was rewarding in helping the customers and seeing the growth of team members.
good,"I felt at home when I was at work. I loved going every day that I was scheduled. The pay wasn’t great for all that I had to do. Nonetheless, I enjoyed working there. I wish I couldn’t have stayed or transferred."
good,I love my job at advance! It has helped me learn a lot about automotives and has given me tons of experience and knowledge to pass along! Every young man should at least give advance (or any part store) a try!
good,"Very quick paced environment, began actively processing and delivering orders even before completing training. I was comfortable because I had the knowledge of auto parts and specific repair requirements."
good,I Liked working with the Team Members . the company it self do not pay enough too much favoritism within the company. And the manager that is there always makes the black people do all the work while the whites stand around and watch TV on their phones all day
good,"This job was very good for advancement opportunities.  I started as a delivery driver and ended up in the management team.  I learned about management while I was there as I was moving up.  Only downside is you train as you go and they do not have a lot of time in order for you to do the testing modules.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes trying to help a customer and there are a limited number of computers and all of them currently being used.  Also, having to explain to customers that we did not do certain service such as opening key remotes, certain battery installs, installing light bulbs, etc.  I have seen a few dissatisfied customers due to not being able to do these tasks, and especially with the key remote not being able to look up the battery sizing, and google would provide multiple different options so they remote would have to be opened in order to get the battery size.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.  Being able to serve them and make them laugh as well would make my day.  Management was rough at the beginning of my start at Advance.  I went through a total of five managers and was on the sixth in my five years with the company.  The management team was strong once I had a manager for more then a year."
good,this was a good place to grow for any position even if you didn't know cars. I was able to gain a lot of experience I the customer service and B2B relations as well.
good,"I worked part time,  fun, friendly associates.  Interesting, fast paced variety of tasks. Good friends and people.  Challenged to improve my skills.  I was given oppertunity to help people."

good,"Loved the job,enjoyed the customers. I would still work there if I had been given full time house, however wasn't given enough hours to pay my bills. I had open availability but would only be scheduled 18-23 hours a week."
good,its a good place to work  customer  service  and gives  training on products  so  you can help customer better and   gain  realtionship with  mechanics
good,"pulling parts, answering phone,keeping shelves stocked and neat. customer service. management was ideal got along with staff great. hardest part of job dealing with the thieves that come in late hours. Most enjoyable part was giving the right parts to help people get there vehicle's back running."
good,"This was a good store to work at"
good,"Overall, Advance Auto Parts is a good company to work for. Starting compensation isn't very competitive with other retail outlets. Advancement can be difficult depending on the location you are in. Having a solid team in your store makes the difference, providing a good work environment."
good,"Good place to work. Good benefits but it was too slow of a work place for me. I enjoyed my time with AAP"
good,"Left to do your work, not bothered to much by the boss. Management always make sure I have everything I need to do the job. Job related equipment was in good condition, so it made it  good to do the job."

good,"A typical work day consisted of reviewing orders managing drivers and routes,receiving orders and answering phones on front counter. I learned to be accurate in taking orders,the hardest part was standing all day and motivating the drivers to work and not waste time. All and all it was a fun environment ."
good,Advanced auto parts is a good company to work with. Soecially if you wabt to learn retail. I learned how to dea with costumers in a more effective and calm way.
good,Working at advance was a face paced environment .. I delivered parts to local dealerships and mechanic shops. Overall the job was okay but just wasn’t enough money!
good,The place is fun and relaxing to work in. It's easy and fun atmosphere to work in. The manager is an ok manager that works with his people when they have family emergencies or just need some time off.
good,Good overall workplace had a tendency to become stagnet because of such a large corporate organization that it moved very slowly. My supervisor offer me a large range of making my own decisions so I was able to succeed.
good,Fast paced job. Great 1st shift supervisor in shipping. Friendly and helpful team. Structured job plan at the start of the shift. Some days are longer than others. Average 45-50 per week
good,"What made this job so great was my co workers. Absolutely amazing to work with we were able to work as a team and restock , clean, change floor sets very fast."
good,This was a good place to work and fun most of the time. It was a pretty relaxed job even as a manger. However it is hard to get employees to work when most of the people they hire are young.
good,"A typical work day for me was doing a three man job not knowing that I was supposed to be working in one area. I learned my job quickly and in the process obtained my forklift license. My supervisors that I had were fine. The hardest part of my job was when I was forced to work someone shift and still had to be back at work in the next few hours or my job was threatened. Also, employees that were there before me took my kindness, motivation, and determination for weakness. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know others that were fair and impartial who did not mind sharing their skills with me. I thank God for the pros and cons of this job; because, he matured me into the man I am today. I am looking for greater."
good,My typical day involves taking deliveries and helping customers. I am generally pleased. Management is good for the most part but can be skewed at times.
good,"Opportunity to advance based on performance but it helps to know and communicate well with next level supervisor. "
good,I loved working for them the pay isn't great but it's a very relaxed atmosphere they promote from within I was made a key holder after a few months of working for them
good,Given this is my first warehouse job I think it’s not that bad work is hard but not impossible patience is key on power equipment management could be better but since the warehouse is more than a year old I guess it’s ok
good,I came in as a temp and moved all the way up to management. Lots of potential for training and personal advancement if you desire. I love the 4 day work week.
good,a typical day at work is fast paced and DIY oriented. what I learned was the mechanical functions of automobiles and how they work with each other. management was for the most part always on duty and on stand by to assist if help is needed. the workplace culture is highly focused on customer satisfaction. the hardest part of the job is having to be on your feet all day. the most enjoyable part of the job is having the satisfaction of helping customers
good,"I spend the day going through so many directions, Inspiring my team to serve our customers everyday which in turn helps our growth in our market. We have a good time day in and day out, even during high traffic times. I have learned more about caring for the customers with Advance Auto Parts. I believe in taking care of the team as well,"
good,"This was a good part-time job toward the end of college.  I enjoyed the management and my co-workers.  I left to make a little more money, but other than that it was an overall good experience."
good,When a company have an employee that have work with them over 5 years that should worth something. Hard workers she be something to the company. They need to pay more.
good,"I loved waking up every morning to go to work there awesome co-workers, theybonly bad thing is management and not highly trained supervisors they just like to take the role. Your in ur own section picking your products and it’s fun."
good,Its a great place to work but for my specific role the pay is terrible. as a key holder i would have expected to make at least 10 an hour but thats not the case
good,I have learned quite a bit of different skills and knowledge in inventory procedures. They also have good work ethics and always big on safety. Working as a team is highly pushed at Advance also.
good,This company values it's employees ideas and offers potential for internal advancements. Advance Auto Parts also offers competitive benefits and pay for full time employees.
good,"most days are the same as any other days.  but there are a few days out of a month thats different from other days.  typical day of work is helping walk in customers find the correct parts that they need, and if not possible, then point them in the right direction.  team work comes a long way when needed but with advance auto parts being an easy work environment, you're capable of doing most things on your own.  management is great.  mostly flexible with schedules that you need adjusted.  hardest part of the job is just tackling on a slow day of work.  and most enjoyable part of advance auto parts is finishing the day knowing you had a very productive day."
good,"Busy at times, some times its cut throat depending on who is working with you. But the company I enjoyed working for. I would definitely work there again. Enjoyed the customers most of all."
good,Working enviroment was nice learned alot about the job management was great to work with and the culture was very impressive the hardest part of the job was the driving locations and the best part of the job was the up lifting envirorment
good,I would clock in at work. See what orders i have to seen out. Talk to the GM to see what is the goal today. See what thing around the store that we need to get done
good,"The supervisors are very knowledgeable. There is extensive training, so you're prepared. Typical politics within the administrative positions.

good,"Met new people, learned a lot about where parts go and how to look them up in the system. Really enjoyed getting discounts on parts and the staffing was awesome."
good,"Advance Auto is a good company overall. There are a lot of ways to move up with the company, if you know what you're doing. They don't just promote anybody. You have to work hard to get where you want to go."
good,Advance teaches me how to work on my own projects by showing me how to do my job better. Management cares about my personal problems and accomplishments and helps to encourage all goals. my regular customers come to me for any questions they have which is fun but can also be the hardest part.
good,"My store has a crew that's been together for a long time, so things run well. The manager knows the industry and the store."

good,I learned how to install wiper blades and car batteries. The employees were very kind and they helped me with any problems i had. Managment there was good as well.
good,People are nice to work with. Managers for the most parts are nice. District managers can be difficult to work with sometimes. Customers for the most part are cool. Some can be difficult to work with.
good,I enjoyed the customer appreciation you would most likely deal with the same people day in day out so you establish a bond. the company just didn't pay their employees enough.

Have to be able to work in a warehouse type environment that isn't climate controlled and fast paced.

Some people don't seem to care at the lower level but definitely a good place to work and a place to advance your career if that is something you want to do.
good,A typical day at work started with a start-up meeting with all departments to review productivity and expectations. I learned how to get along with a myriad of personality types. The hardest part of the job was keeping up production when short-staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace and meeting new people and the opportunity to learn new things.

I am grateful to them for working with me as my mother was terminally ill.  The co-workers were helpful, and the job was low stress."

good,"Advance Auto Parts is a great company to be a part of if you enjoy the automotive industry and the people within it. Each day presents something new for you to learn and gain experience from. The management of the company in the higher level is great but management between stores greatly varies. Some stores will have great managers and others will have poor managers. The workplace culture is usually very upbeat and energetic and employees are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is coming up with fixes to problems with minimal information and resources. The most enjoyable part of the job is the contact with so many ""car"" people and people within the automotive industry."
good,"I provide customers with parts and repair knowledge. I learned a lot about vehicle repair and parts, therefore I am also able to further assist our customers. I enjoy working with the customers and our team."

good,"Advance Auto Parts took me out of my comfort zone. Females learn how to perform car details.  I learn how to put windshield wipers, change batteries, and put oil in cars.  Management was great, one store the management was unfair but in all, great.  The culture, beautiful down to the kids that visit the store with parents. The hardest was putting in the battery and the most enjoyable were learning how to do as the guys."

good,"A typical day at work is to plan first with all the Team Managers how strong we are going to finish our operation counting first safety for all our team."
good,"The work was as I expected, having already spent over 8 years in this business.  Morale was not a problem with respect to other employees; the General Manager however did whatever she could to bring down the morale.  The GM showed favoritism and it didn't matter who knew it.  The GM is the primary reason that I left Advance."
good,"Its great being able to interact with customers, and to shock them with the knowledge you have about their vehicle. The training in this company is very helpful and covers all the basis of learning a vehicle so you can properly help each customer. Everyday new problems arise but thankful, with us working together as a team, we get them solved."

Most employees are smiling and laughing, were all human and make errors and learn to work with good and bad days. learning is an everyday event, between teaching others or having someone teach me something new."
good,"A typical day includes many different things. From receiving to replenishment to picking to pack out, one has the opportunity to work in any department as well as one applied for. One also has the opportunity to advance their skills with RF devices as well as computer skills."

good,"On a typical day at work it was truely a fun atmosphere, I learned that its always a good day when you work at Advance with great co- workers. This place is very diverse and good managers.

good,big in customer service. limited on autoparts. help desk hard to Understand. commercial credit is hard for commercial customer to get approved. very friendy
good,"If you're not a hard, fast worker. This is not a place for you. You are always busy doing anything and everything that needs to be done. Sometimes if you're finished, you don't get to leave early, you go help other departments catch up."

good,"Pay is low, the work is relatively simple, you will be installing wipers and batteries pretty regularly, parts delivery is an enjoyable task overall, you will be expected to handle both in store and commercial customers. Advance is an overall good experience for someone getting into sales and I would recommend it for someone who is interested in the automotive field. Lots of time speaking to mechanics and getting to know them, they prefer you to be ASE certified but will make exceptions."
good,"Arrive at job and may immediately have a run for a mechanic needing parts."
good,It is a great place to begin if you have an interest in the automotive field. You get the chance to learn and have car parts in your hands and visually see what you're selling to the customer.

Ability to be in front of many clients in the Business side of the business.  Management was strong but sometimes to many different agendas for focus.  I learned that positive leadership and understanding the needs of the team always helped more than individual effort.

Management was easy to get along with and very helpful. All my co-workers were friendly and very dependable. The hardest part of the job was when customers asked questions that i couldn't answer. But the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying all the customers"
good,very high sales requirements that consistently increase to near impossible levels.  they may require pushing of products that are unnecessary.
good,it's a nice place to work.the people I work with are easy to work with & very nice people.  I have a lot of fun during working hours.   A lot of the younger guys ask me for help being that I've been in the business for over 30 years.  It's nice helping them out & teaching them.
good,"Typical days would consist of helping customers find the right part for there project. A benefit from working on the front-line is the knowledge customers brought, when looking for a specific part. I got a chance to learn from them as much as I learned from upper management."

good,"I worked here for 3 years.  I really liked it and learned a lot.  But, there is no room to advance. (No pun intended).  Co-workers were great.  Management was good."

good,I enjoyed working at Advanced Auto Parts. I learned how to quickly and efficiently locate parts for customers. The hardest part of the job for me was talking on the phone. I have bad hearing so it was difficult for me to interpret what was said to me. My co-workers and managers were really friendly and helped me whenever it was needed. I enjoyed the pace of the workday.

good,A typical work day consisted of inventory work and scanning in returns and claims. I learned many things including car knowledge which I have an associates degree in and learning from my customers. Management was helpful in letting me learn within my job and grow as I could. Co workers were helpful in teaching me the systems. The hardest part was being a female in a predominantly male genre field. The most enjoyable part was delivering parts and working with my customers. Being told that I have more knowledge then I am given credit for.

good,"As a Fortune 500 company, Advance Auto Parts offers many things that other places do not. Throughout my 8 years there, I witnessed this company grow in many different ways including its organization, new product innovations, as well as its marketing techniques.

Growth income in the company results from sales and there were a lot of opportunities to meet personal achievement vs. overall performance goals as a store, but together we were a team."

good,"Enjoyed this job but hours sometimes drop.As with any job, business is how you get your hours"
good,selling automotive parts to individual and commercial customers. help customers find the parts and equipment needed to get the job done and fixed.
good,"Enter and everyone greets you with a genuine smile."
good,"Little to no room for advancement, hardly even full time. Pay is minimal, but job does not demand much. Very easy going company, Good family feeling amongst store employees. Good if looking for a manageable way to boost your income."
good,"Delivered parts to local companys, cashier, and stocked shelfs"
good,"I enjoyed being with the people that I worked with."
good,"i would clock in and check order status. pick and order and location and sign out. make delivery and return to repeat process. when there were no orders i would run the registers and answer phone to assist customers, or put up stray items or back stock"
good,"I started out when it was Western Auto, then on to Parts America and finally ended with Advance. I enjoyed my time there, but felt I was not going anywhere and they did not have your back when it came to company policies."
good,"I really like working there, my co-workers are the best you couldent ask for better. The hardest part of the job was dealing with madd custamers. I learned alot form advance such as how to look the parts up, deliver them and how dedicated advance is to service there custamers. Managemet was the best i ever saw, they did there jobs and they made it fun."
good,advance is an awesome place to work. reliable and flexible scheduling with great benefits.
good,"This is a great company and the co-workers and management are great to work for. The bad part is that this is retail and when sales are down, hours go down."
good,"A typical day at Advance Auto Parts was to provide excellent customer service to every walk-in and phone-in customer to gaurantee their return for more sales, delegating daily operations, completing all paperwork, inspections of delivery visits, and tracking commercial sales. The hardest part of the job was lack of communication as our general manager was always out of the store and unable to reach. My co-workers were some of the greatest people I have worked with. I enjoyed not only helping our customers but educatiing them on how to save money by showing and comparing prices, specials on ads."
good,"I have worked in many positions with the company. Rpp,Cpp, Rsp,key holder,assistant manager. I also was able to transfer to different stores in the country. Last year I worked in Virginia, Nebraska and now Texas."
good,Qualifacations and want I did on adaily basis is on the reume..
good,"Kept busy Delivery of automotive parts to Commerical Customers retail sales, stock shelves on saturdays."
good,"I am the ""face"" of Advance Auto Parts. I deal with Commercial Accounts on a day-to-day basis. I have learned to anticipate what our customers need and am able to fill that need."
good,"this was my first experience using computers, so i gained some much-needed experience there. I worked with men mostly, which was like having more brothers. They helped me learn the parts business, which includes using catalogs, helping customers with auto needs, stocking shelves, maintaining safety and cleanliness standards, installing windshield wipers, testing batteries,etc.. the first two weeks were hard, otherwise it was just a matter of listening to the customers carefully so i could assist them efficiently."
good,deliverd car parts to different commercial accounts handled customers throught the day in best ways possible stocked shelves and kept store neat and clean as requierd
good,"Advance is a great place to work and provides many opportunities to grow within the company as long as you stay patient and realize promotions take quite a bit of time to happen. I would put Advance high on the technology list as they tend to use some outdated practices and methods. Yet, they are very open to suggestions and the work environment feels very youthful and energetic."
good,"Being at the store can be fine depending on the other employees. I had 2 district managers and both were only out for themselves. Advancement is tough unless you brown nose, someone quits/fired, or retires. Half the time for upper management however, people are brought in from other companies instead of moving up employees trained and ready to take on the task."
good,"This place was the best, my boss was a great guy always did his best to go above and beyond the call of duty."
good,"The Advance Auto Parts Merchandise Team was a great experience,I enjoy traveling nationwide setting up stores and meeting different people and learining new things each day; Team work was one of my favoritew attributes because i enjoy helping others especially if i have a skill they would like to learn from me I'll be happy to assist someone to show them not only my dedication to them but to the company as well."
good,"A typical day included helping both retail diy and commercial / shop customers, managing retail employees, managing inventory, ordering all freight orders."
good,"Advance has a strong focus on customer service and, by and large, our customers appreciate how hard we try. For people without a strong automotive background (like me) the learning curve is steep, but associates tend to be very supportive and understand that 'everyone's gotta learn."" Things get hectic from time to time with phones and walk-in customers, but the action is kinda fun."
good,This is a great leaning experience for any motivational individual with endless endeavors within the mechanical field.
good,"I worked for Advance for over nine years. I had the opportunity to manage three stores. Advance provided great training, bonus opportunity, freedom to make decisions with in assigned responsibilities, and attracted a steady stream of customers. Advance challenged managers to build store traffic through merchandising and training staff on sales techniques."
good,I learned how to deal with customers and work as a team. The store i worked at was great and fun employees to work with. The only thing about this job is the pay is not that great for the amount of responsibility. It is easy to move up fast if you are responsible and dedicated to your work.
good,Being able to help customers and making sure they are able to find the parts they need for their vehicle is a great part of the job. I was able to learn how to change a car battery.
good,Good place enjoyed my time here expanded my knowledge on cars and maintenance of cars all around a great place to work at and also enjoyed working with the staff there
good,"Me asignaban tareas de inventario que me gustaba mucho realizar, lo que hacia de mi trabajo un empleo dinámico y de aprendizaje en la misma empresa."
good,I was a parts delivery person. The employees were very help full  getting me adjusted to the new job. Training of store parts and procedures including locations in stock room .  Delivery to customer locations and procedures for returns of core and wrong or parts not needed. I liked the satisfaction of making customers HAPPY.
good,"I was trained promptly and properly directly by the GM and as a result, I was quickly promoted to key holder/assistant manager. Hours were flexible and customers were satisfied and the majority of them were loyal Advance patrons."
good,Hard work pays off in that warehouse when it busy. The money is good as well the benefit is great. A typical day can be hard and busy also. the management can be hard in time
good,Management focused on the needs of employees. Great work environment.  Good customer service. Learned a lot from working there. I would recommend them too thers.
good,I loved working there. Not a very stressful place to work. I would recommend anybody to apply there. Just overall good place to work.  Co workers are good.and supportive if you still need help finding parts.
good,Each day you learn something different from the various customers about cars and car parts.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.  The hardest part of the job is there is no heat in the winter.
good,The place had an overall relaxing atmosphere but there was very poor communication between the staff and the managers. Flexible hours but often could not get 40 hours per week.
good,"At Advance Auto Parts i learned how to meet sales goals and help customers with what they needed. I enjoyed everything about that job, i love cars and helping people get the parts they wanted made me happy."
good,good work life balance and good benefits. 40 hour weeks and monthly training and you can track your sales to make sure you are on track for the month.
good,"Good company to work for. Pay is ok. Scheduling is flexible. Most customers are polite, and team members are friendly. Commercial customers are the best to deal with in my opinion."
good,Estable y con posibilidades de crecimiento si tienes ganas de salir adelante
good,I wish they were able to schedule me full time after the new year but that wasn't the case.  I gained knowledge of my specific car (and others) and now feel comfortable doing basic repairs.
good,There is one female there who feels the need to attack any other female who is attractive. She is very short and thinks she knows everything. Just walk away.
good,"Good company to work for. Mangment is good pay is good "

good,"This was a great experience over the 2 years I worked in several different locations, the down side was it is mainly part time, but it worked out during the time I was in college."
good,Always Learning something new. The Commercial business is a great place to learn Logistics and selling culture. The business to business relationships are the foundation of Advance.
good,My managers were very flexible with my schedule. They have a good salary. They were happy to teach me new things I didn't know about. They would communicate when something upset them
good,i started when it first opened so was just getting everything going and could be pretty rough and a lot of long hours but al  the workers were great and we made it as fun as possible.
good,"I loved being given the extra challenges and responsibilities as a manager there,  I felt more independent and confident leading a team there, took my skills from autozone and applied to my position of management here at advance auto"
good,Good place to work fir a part-time job. Coworkers for the most part were great to work with. Manager was excellent at his job and always attended to your needs at work.
good,Tips: always ask the right questions the first time and ask for the vin number if customer doesn't know anything about there vehicle and be very helpful.
good,I loved working for Advance. I got a great discount and met many great mechanics and learned a lot more about cars and parts than prior to working at Advance. Great learning experiance
good,I’ve worked at many parts stores. Out of them all Advance is my favorite. Very helpful and have gave me the opportunity I’ve wanted since I started in parts business
good,I came to the company from a very stressful job.  I have enjoyed my time here and love the work. General knowledge of vehicles helps but they do train you to know more and will help you get certified after a certain time with the company.
good,"8 to 4 Monday thru Friday picking up parts from a. Warehouse an delivering to customers, deliver Parts from the store also to automotive shops keep me so busy sometimes I don't take a lunch."

good,"Busy from the time you start till the time you leave. High pressure sales role, but very rewarding if you are successful. the key here is honesty and persistence. Amazing training to further your sales and professional career."
good,This was a great employer to me for many years. My only real complaint was compensation and lack of opportunity to move up within the company. Co-workers were pleasant and I enjoyed working with most all of them and management wasn't bad either. I genuinely miss working for this employer and looking back wish I would have stayed.
good,somedays are better than others the job can be very stressful some days and he work is easy its very hot in the warehouse no fans or other breeze coming through
good,"Hours were great, my manager and other staff always worked with me if I needed to be off or to switch a day or time! The balance of work and life was great. Pay for sure could be better but did make an ok wage for the area."
good,Working Culture is good and very fun. Team is good with good helping hands during issues. Technologies using in the company are up to date which helps boost up our career
good,Great atmosphere if your looking for fast paced work. You have sales goals. You need to be semi knowledgeable about vehicles. You must have a flexible schedule.
good,I would go back in a heart beet they was Ana amazing company to work for the managers are all understanding they are always there for help if your new
good,It has been a good learning experience I have learned a lot about cars and parts and the selling side of the business I have also learned about installing batteries windshield wipers and the difference in them and certainly vehicles
good,"Theres a definite disconnect between corporate and the real world, that's where the RVP and DM make our stores (in our market) successful. The ""one size fits all"" approach doesn't always fit all 5500 locations. We can run our stores our way, while still complying with company policy and procedures, sometimes this is very challenging. My biggest frustration is the company's staffing restrictions causing difficulties finding and retaining qualified employees. Advancing past the store level is also very difficult. Its seems that you become ""pigeon-hole'd"" when upper management does not want to lose a high performing GM from a successful location, fearing a loss of business if they leave."
good,"stock shelves, assist customers, pull parts, deliver to commercial accounts, count inventory, front and face store, complete planograms. keep store clean and professional"
good,"Un dia de trabajo es un dia normal con sus virtudes y desaciertos. Lo gratificante es sentir que el ambiente laboral nos permite servirle informaciones y darles satisfacción a nuestros clientes con una buena atención. La direccion de nuestra gerencia nos alaga con entrenamientos permanentes y prácticos para capacitarnos con la finalidad de estar calificado para dar un buen servicio. En nuestro trabajo contamos con todo fácil de hacer y de aprender con interés, y entusiasmos podemos lograr nuestros objetivos. Lo que más nos gusta de nuestro trabajo es dar un buen servicio y estar un crecimiento intelectual permanente, ya que el conocimiento es poder."
good,"I enjoy working there but I would like a full time job and have benefits and paid holidays and vacation time"
good,"Advanced Auto Parts is a quick paced environment that demands attention to detail and some critical thinking when purchasing a new part isn't the only issue a customer has. Like any new place of employment it takes time to learn the systems in place. Once that is done, I settled into a routine and found i could complete my work with ease."
good,"I worked part time for 4 years.. I worked with and for some great people during that time.. pay could have been better, but their were opertunities to advance."
good,Good job I loved working there and helping people with their car issues. If you love cars this is a great job. You get a hands on on cars and things you need to learn about your car.
good,"As a part time employee, the hours were fairly flexible everyone had their strengths and weakness. We tried to pair up as that we complimented each other.  Duties were pretty straight forward.  Company offered on line training to help increase your proficiency helping customers."
good,I do not have any opinion in the matter of Advance Auto Parts. I enjoyed working with the people there.  Outside of that I will welcome a face to face discussion of Advance Auto Parts.
good,A great place to work. They work with you & not against you. The company is willing to help you with any problem you have. The work is interesting & diversified. The whole staff works as a team.
good,"Its a great part time job i would consider for a retiree or a student, i wouldn't consider this a good full time job for anyone that's looking for a career"
good,"While Advance has it's fair share of corporate tendencies(sales, units per transaction) the priority is always the customers. Every department from commercial to inventory, is set to give the customers the best and quickest auto parts experience."
good,"It was a part time job, with a very positive atmosphere!  All employees were friendly and help full. Training was great and plenty of incentives for competitive sales!"
good,"very customer oriented ...learning how to deal with a customer is sometimes trying but is always rewarding ..hardest part of the job is not being able to help every customers need ,,but the most enjoyable part is when the customer comes back and looks for you specifically"
good,Fun work environment. Employees strive to have fun. Employees are knowledgeable and experienced at their job. Employees have a willingness to go the extra mile to help their customers.
good,"My typical day will start anytime between 12-2 and work till close, which right now is 8 PM, Summer time is 9pm, normally Wednesday through sunday. I learned so much about parts and managing my team. I love my job but the hours I work are preventing me from doing anything with family. I have a senior and a freshman in high school and I'm missing out on all their after school activities."
good,Very flexible work environment. growth potential from within. clean sales environment. very knowledgable staff members. fantastic repoire with customers
good,"Working for this company I had the opportunity to learn how to change my tire, battery, wiper blades and test starters. It was a challenge, but with the help of my fellow coworkers and training I really enjoyed working at Advance Auto Parts. The hardest part was lifting heavy items, but there were team members to assist each other which made it manageable."
good,My experience at Advance Auto Parts /Carquest was great...... I was with company for over 24 years and I learned a lot and grew both professionally and personally.
good,Thinking back. This was pretty fun minus the terrible pay. You got to meet tons of shop owners who worked on cars all day. And sometimes you would talk to them and get to know them and see the project cars they were working on. I think a job in community like that might be fulfilling to some degree. But it wont pay the bills.
good,great place to work at. they train on all positions. they have a good training program. and they come by your store to make sure that training continues
good,It was a great place to work with plenty of friendly people. I learned a lot about the job from the supervisors and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to finish every task.
good,"If you catch on to things quickly and work hard at what you do there will always be room to advance your career. I learned leadership skills, how to manage a business and how to develop a sales culture. A typical day involves providing excellent customer service. You also need to make sure you have the product that customers need as well as a clean, neat, well stocked and organized store for customers to shop. Taking ownership of your business is a key to becoming successful."
good,"It has been great 6+ yrs, but like many other corporate companies they don't take care of their people. They could do better by supporting there stores in bringing in inventory and more hours for stores to operate correctly."
good,"I had worked part time for this company, as a driver and a counter salesman, for over 6 years. I really enjoyed this company and the people I worked with and the customers I helped on a daily basis."
good,The pay was not sufficient as compared to the cost of living in this area and the insurance was outrageous.  I loved the work environment and the job as well.  I miss waiting in my customers but until they raise the pay or provide an affordable insurance it’s just not realistic.
good,the work hours are great for someone who's looking for part-time. managers always work with your schedule. paid time off for holidays. great place n general
good,have good discount lack of HR communication and very easy job to do as you follow the book because customer might try to take advantage of you instead of going to a mechanic
good,"A lot of knowledge about car parts and learned more about differences on some products, fluids and special parts, took me more than little time to place each item on the shelf no more coments for now. Thank You"
good,My experience at Advance Auto Parts have been great. We treat all customers as family. If you love cars and want to learn about parts this will be a great opportunity for you.
good,"Great job culture."
good,Working here was one of my better jobs. I was sales personnel that worked on the retail side of things. I did slowly get into the commercial side of the business before I left. It was a great place to work because most of the coworkers were bearable and it was great to get regular customers coming in. The night shift was bad about gossiping and stirring the pot though.
good,"I really enjoyed working with Advance Auto Parts. The people were very helpful, and i got a chance to learn, and experience new things while working there. Great place to work."
good,It's a fun environment I enjoy the people I work with and they have great structure as a company. It's always a learning environment.  There is always something to keep you busy.
good,"Get the rewards you deserve. Fast."
good,This is a great company to work for. The benefits are not the best for medical but super awesome dental and vision coverage. Employee hours are always cut towards the end of the year like most companies.
good,I learned a lot about car maintenance. And signs to look for to help out the customer. I can change a battery in 5 minutes. And wiper blades quicker than that
good,my experience working there was interesting and a learning experience. I was able to meet new people and assist them when needed.  I was able to network and get to know new people.  I was able to get discounts on car parts which was extremely helpful to me.
good,"Advance Auto Parts in Crystal River, FL is a great place to work. A typical day is helping customers with their needs. If you don't know the answer, someone you work with probably does and they are all willing to share their knowledge. There really isn't anything too hard about this job."
good,They provide you with training to become proficient as a profession in the business.  Fun place to work if you love helping people and solve everyday problems.
good,"Easy to work with customers, fun employees and management can be reasonable as long as you meet expectations. Get to meet great customers and a great way to practice your people skills."
good,"•	Lead personnel in inspecting, loading and shipping of thousands of cargo and personnel parachutes over a 4-month period. "
good,"Honestly, if the pay was better, I would have continued working there. Unfortunately, there wasn't much room for growth and management was not up to par."
good,"Most of the people who come in and out are loyal customers, however, there are a few exceptions. Some of the customers can be rude. But I enjoyed the job, the managers and co-workers were nice and all of them were good people to be around. I never once felt threatened by any of them, or a customer for that matter. It was a very chill and easy to work in atmosphere, I would work there again."
good,"good days and bad days.."
good,why do i have to review every single job that I worked at. THis is a pretty stupid system. Do not post this for obvious reasons lol blah blah blah blah
good,Great place to work with great people. they gave me every opportunity that one could ask for. provided me with a lot of knowledge. i would work for them again in the future.
good,had to work mandatory overtime all the time if needed its every 2 week pay they teach and show everything from edge rider center rider high lows great pros benefits located in enfield
good,A typical day at work consisted of counting various different locations and materials throughout the warehouse. I learned that people at Advance Auto Parts were friendly and easy going people but were also very competitive at there jobs. I would recommend anyone to work for this company who is in this field of work.
good,"A good place to work part-time, they should promote more from inside, and increase the minimum wage for a part-time employee to maintain their workforce."
good,the job itself was easy fun and had some of the best workers there we all got along and we got are work done and hit are sales goals. it was a hands on job anybody can do it.
good,"its a good working environment also and good compensation as well.advance auto parts is my 1st job here in usa because i came from philippines and im just new here in usa its a good thing that the advance auto parts became my 1st company to work with and i just experience a new working environment, new friends,new working environment and also different types of person too."
good,"Great people with like minds, they hire mostly part time people, but the people who are full time take there jobs pretty seriously, very organized with helpful training."
good,Enjoyed working there because i loved to work on cars and was able to help people that weren't always knowledgeable with cars find the right parts for their vehicle
good,"If you can get your foot in the door, AAP is a good place to start building your customer service skills. The location and management of your particular branch may offer several places to work at if you find you don't mesh with a particular one."
good,"some days were slow, but normally busy"
good,working at advance is by far not easy if you are not open to learning but once u gain the experience its great. I have been an employee for three years for the amount of effort I put into my job I think I could be making more than I am but I guess that's apart of working in retail.
good,"I have been with the company for some time now and I am happy to say that I am an employee of that store.  The company as a whole may have their faults but with the right team and the right leader, your time there can and will be satisfying and fulfilling.  The pay is yuck and the hours are ""flexible"" but normally not in your favor, but it is a job!  Make the best of it!  Can't ask for a better boss, works his rear end (can't swear apparently) off to make sure the job getst done and the store thrives.  Not much opportunity for growth with the company unless a person in the position you want to grow into leaves.  Overall,  if the pay was better I would confidently say that I wouldn't give up this job for anything else.  I like it here.  PS:  Company controlled Climate Control is the WORST :)"
good,I really do not have anything to say. Really good place to work if you are a college student. Really could not live off of the salary that was offered.
good,Advance auto was a fast paced. I had to pay close attention to details and numbers. Advanced Auto put safety first.  There was good communication from management.
good,"Work hard, and delivered parts daily, did returns and inventory daily, and took care of customers when needed, and assisted Manager in his daily job. and help out others on the computers. A vary product day."
good,I was very happy with the people and atmosphere. They saw and utilized my strengths. Would love to still be working with this great group of people if I didn't have to relocate.
good,I love for Advance. I work with a great group of people. We get along great laugh and joke with each other. A laid back environment when allowed but the job gets done when need be
good,Advanced auto parts is about having a good attitude and patients with customers the hardest part of this job is when customer dont even know what they want themselves.
good,They will train you IF you truly want the training! Easy and very laid back! A;; they ask is you come to work on-time and as scheduled and Safety is there TOP priority!
good,"this was a pretty cool job because I got to learn about different things as far as cars and part and I loved each and everything about this job , I would go back if it pays more"
good,"Delivered parts to Albany, Schenectady and Saratoga counties safely and in a certain time frame. coworkers were good people. Owner was a strict business man and very serious."
good,Reviewing sales opportunities. Had the time to hone management skills with education provided outside the company. Culture was fun and energetic. Lots of travel from home. Writing and producing training for the store personnel.
good,"Working here was  a good first step into sales and retail. I enjoyed learning more about about cars, and help people understand their own vehicle. If you want to get into this field this is the job for you."
good,"my day begin with prayer before entering the building . both for customers and team member,  I would than processed in preparing the business to received  customers   complete all pre opening"
good,"i had been in the business 25+ years, so i was often the master question answer.it was my jod to try and help the new people to learn about automotlve systems.it was often fast paced. but sometime what we called fiest or fammon."
good,The only thing I didn't like about the job was the pay. If they paid more I would have stayed. The environment was fun and the people that worked there were always friendly
good,this company runs a tight ship. they are team oriented. hardest part of this job is dealing with the upset custoers. the most enjoyable part of this job is helping the customers get what they need and making sure they are happy
good,This is a nice company. Its been awhile since I was there so I really am not sure of the current state of affairs with the company.   I had great people working for me.
good,Advance offers a fun place to work while offering the right tools to grow one's self. Very easy to grow in and get promoted. Always something new to learn each day.
good,"Wonderful place to work, underpaid, and great experience. Putting up stock, taking care of phone customers, and taking case of walk in customers. Very basic line of work if you do or don't know anything about cars."
good,"Typical day at work: (Slow Day): Front face the store, clean the store where it's dirty, before company decided to hire people to do planograms we had to do them on a regular basis, watch for customers."
good,i loved working here the two years i was here we were close like family and always had fun working together and getting what we needed done. would love to work here again if pay was equal to the quality job you did.
good,"Great experience with multiple learning opportunities"
good,A day at work was always something different.Helping people solve their automobile problems. I have always enjoyed working on cars when i had a place to do it.
good,Good place to work and they take care of their employees.  I believe they need to provide more support to their mid-level manager to perform at a higher level.
good,"I learned a lot about vehicles, their parts and how to talk to the good old boy mechanic. If I wasn't helping customers in the store, I was delivering parts to shops. I was in training for the Parts Pro so that I could work on the weekends as the Parts pro Specialist. Everyone worked together to help each other out. The manager was willing to work around my college classes. The hardest part of my day was driving through all of the crazy traffic to deliver parts to out commercial customers. Most of the associates from this tore have become managers of other stores. The only reason why I am still not working there is because we had to move due to the military."
good,My day starts with pulling 45 or more special orders in an hour and 1/2. Learn  something about customer service and parts daily. Management is great.
good,"Show up timely,  do your best, take the training modules offered. Take care of your customers and keep management in the loop of customer concerns. Its a good company to work for."
good,"i enjoyed working at Advance Auto parts, the people are great to work with, the environment is a fun place to work. the only downsides are the compensation (just minimum wage), and the store manager would bring their home life to work with them; a lot of times this would make it hard to work for her."
good,"keeps you busy always have something needing to be don't or someone to help out, parts needing put away or stocked. as well as re setting the store and cleaning"
good,"I was working here as a driver, while in school studying Criminal Justice. I enjoyed my job here, and it's a good job to make money while going to college."
good,Decent job to work many  late hours depending on your store but its all around a good place to work at if you are into cars and want a job at retail..
good,"1 stock parts in front room"
good,Atypical day at work is in the morning; I made sure the cars we drove were clean and ready to go. There was nothing hard about the job. The management was great.
good,It's really not hard work I enjoyed it I love meeting new people my wasn't to hard I would not mind going back it's the heat I had to get use to inside the plant
good,You are allowed to have conversations if you need to.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the comradery of the team I worked with.The work was fast paced but the people were always helpful.
good,This place will definitely heighten your knowledge of all the different component that go into building and keeping a automobile up and running. Plus the customer interaction for the most part is simply amazing.
good,"It can be stressful at times , for example:there are times when you have to look up parts for customers in the store and answer the phone at the same time, then go outside to test batteries or read a check engine light for a customer.... in the pouring rain....or it's 10 degrees and snowing. bottom line: cars don't always break down when its nice outside. "
good,"The job is very relaxed. You must make your percentages. Also, there is a relaxed dress code, so no need to worry about dressing to impress. Take your time and do it right."
good,alot of potential with advance auto parts. Many store have good managemet from what I saw. a little under rated. Better products than auto zone. one can build a future.
good,if you are looking at working your way up into management Advance Auto Parts is not a bad place to do so. is also a good place to learn how to operate a cash drawer and get down the basics of customer service.
good,It was a decent job to have. Good coworkers and management is not too bad. Many different departments so many different tasks to learn. Opportunities to move to other distribution centers as well.
good,I always started at 3pm when I arrived there would be truck to put away and stock the shelves I would do that until I had to do a delivery. I learned how to scan in the parts that would come off the truck so we could stock them. the management was really good there as never any problem with management. There wasn't really any hard parts with my job title. The most enjoyable part of the job as always seeing the costumers happy with their purchase.
good,"The job is easy to pickup if you know nothing about cars. It's really about the customer service."
good,One of my first serious jobs was at this place. I enjoy anything having to do with cars so it was a great experience. I would go back and become a driver at advance in the future.
good,"Busy, good discounts,  no steady schedule. Good company but looking for a career.  Good learning experience, fun to work here because it's always busy"
good,Good place to work but must be a hard worker.This is a fast paced business and not for those that just want to sit back and not willing to put in 100%.
good,Typical Day at Advance Auto is Pretty Relaxed. More customer based and no hassle. You learn a lot from customers as well as your fellow team members. Overall great place to learn

good,"I enjoy the co-workers also the customers. The workload was not overbearing like most jobs, and they work with my school schedule. I would advise anyone who is trying to rebuild a car or fix up a vehicle to try and work for the company. It is well worth it in the end."
good,"I started as a driver delivering parts to commercial accounts. I then became at that time a inventory specialist. Position doesn't exist now. But being in control of inventory was stressful, because people who steal made me angry cause of the amount of theft in this particular store was high and when I would suggest solutions it would get shot down. Corporate makes the rules I would hear. Because I was working two jobs one paid more than the other I chose more money."
good,"Advance Auto parts offers fair pay, benefits, and offers a relax and generally good work environment. However is lacking in room for advancement beyond the $50,000 a year range, I consider this job a good place to start and gain experience  in the Automotive field."
good,Advance Auto Parts is a fast paced environment to work in. The recent acquisition of Car Quest has moved that pace even further. The opportunity to develop as a manager and grow with the company is there.
good,It's a good working environment. I like delivering parts to the commercial automotive shops. I've been learning a lot about vehicle since I've stayed working there.
good,"Good management, good working conditions and good benefits.  Not much room for advancement once you've done your job.  As a retail company, the pay is minimal for most."
good,It's good place to work and they have allot of opportunities to grow in the company the pay is ok it could be better based on the experience of the employ

good,Good place to work if coming in as a General Manager. New Employees have low pay rate scale. Must develop and motivate employees. Not enough hours given out to store to support work load. Great opportunites to move up with in company.
good,awesome place to work. i recomend go anyone looking to expand car knowledge. i love the enviroment and the people at the workplace. i would give it a good rating.
good,"Pre-operation check of vehicles, Review and inventory orders and set deliveries."
good,A large company with a lot of challenges. (Integration between many business areas.) Possibly too many levels of Management. Changes continually. Pays well for the area. (Roanoke)
good,The management was always there with a open door policy. Great work environment. Great room for advancement in the company with competitive pay rates.
good,this was in retrospect not such a bad job the work was not that hard the pay was better than the first job I had perhaps I should have stayed there to late now
good,As a part time job it was great. It seemed to me at the time everyone that was full time enjoyed what they did. They also knew a lot about cars. I did this as a part time postion.
good,I love working with people and workers .I also enjoy hands on assisting customers and helping them if I can . It was a really easy job that involved driving witch I love and hands on
good,"Just like title states. Fun job overall, not too difficult, strict sales goals and can be hectic/busy at times. Get used to being expected to know EVERYTHING about cars and people asking you to diagnose their vehicle issues, even over the phone."
good,"I learned a lot about auto parts.  I really enjoyed my job here.  The hardest part of the job was getting along with the one Manager.  He let me go, when he shouldn't have.  I will explain during interview."
good,picking parts dropping them off i learned how to operate a center ride pallet jack management was great they were helpful culture was great hardest part was long hours  most enjoyable part was no much walking
good,My typical day AAP is that I go in do what needed be done and get it done with no problems and half of the time I always back the team up helping them.
good,"Responsible for training staff on sales, setting ads, inventory control, planograms cycle counts and made bank deposits. While there I helped the store to become #1 in customer service in the company."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Staff was great, management was also very good. I got to learn a lot of different things about cars. The hardest part of the job was the peak busy hours of the day and trying to get to every customer."
good,Opening up in the morning getting set for the day assigning tasks to make sure the customers the satisfaction they need. There is nothing hard about the job. the most enjoyment i get out of the job is to see the enjoyment on the customers when they are provided with what they need plus more.
good,Would recommend to work there.  They have very friendly management and they will tech you. Plus  you learn a lot about cars and car parts so you can do your own work on your car.
good,Advance Auto Parts is a fun an interesting place to work. They keep you on your toes and allow you to continue to learn knew things each day that you go to work.
good,"Very enjoyable work environment, company offers a lot of advancement,District manager cared about her employees. The management training program was excellent."

good,"If you like cars and people Advance is a good fit. It is a fast pace environment for the most part, and advancement is possible. Always room for learning."
good,I have a knowledge for parts and working on vehicles. Advanced allowed me to use my knowledge and earn a paycheck. It also allowed me to work and help with the public.
good,"Its a good company to work for. Great people in management. Good benefits and employee discounts. Good hours, and very family oriented. Works with your schedule."
good,Advance Auto Parts was a good place to work. I always had good managers to work with. I moved on to other opportunities but I have friends that stayed dedicated and moved from the parts counter into management so it can be done with loyalty and hard work. The pay was near minimum wage on the retail counter but as a car guy it sure beats working at McDonalds! In commercial sales the pay was more reasonable.
good,"Advance Auto Parts was physically and mentally demanding. The warehouse was staggeringly hot in the summer and very cold in winter times. Although the conditions were challenging I brought my best effort to the table. I sweat, bled and sacrificed my health and time with my family and fiance for that company."
good,"I loved my jobs which included but not limited to commercial sales, delivery, inventory specialist, retail parts pro.  Company needs more employees per shift."
good,advance auto parts is a nice place to work but the pay isnt there the customers are great and everyone that comes in are regulars there is alot of communication a good work environment but you dont get paid enough for all you do.
good,This job is fairly easy but very competitive since you have to maintain a rate per hour. Pay has increased and is now very competitive with other jobs in this field.
good,"I enjoy a job day that is filled with enough work. I've learned that if there is enough work in a work day, time seems to fly by and much gets accomplished. Work place culture is important when everyone knows their job and what is required of them. The hardest part of a job is when people know what is required of them and shrug their responsibilities. When that happens, it tends to create a culture of resentment towards that person and sometimes management. The most important part of a day at work, is accomplishing tasks."
good,"I've been here for almost 13 years and I enjoy my co-workers and management team we are one big family. When I first arrived here December 2004 I couldn't believe the care that advance always put family first their motto is"" if the family is happy the teammate is happy"" and that means he or she can perform at a high level. not only that the company takes every teammate out for their birthdays and associates out for there anniversary dates annually. This company really shows they care not by saying it but showing each and every day."
good,more into the driving and delivering parts to the customers and getting a customer and business relationship bond going where they feel like your the best not only for the prices but the quality.
good,Day to day is almost the same when it comes to assisting customers with solving issues with their vehicles. It makes a good day when the issues are actually resolved.
good,Team oriented workplace with friendly individuals. Very focused on sales goals and employee performance. Good opportunities for advancement and promotion.
good,"I really enjoyed working for AAP, helping people is what I enjoyed most. Sometimes you get a difficult customer and you have to try and get win/win outcome."
good,"Loved working there great workers and managers start work at 5pmwork till 3am help the truck load of new items to work and scan them in."
good,"Open and close store,daily deposits,, inventory, commercial ordering and delivering parts. Managing personnel, plangrams, shortages and outages, and had a use of a rf gun."
good,i enjoyed my career at advanced auto. problems with management led me to leave but other than that it is a fantastic place to wok. i would highly recomend it
good,Low paying job but opportunity for fast advancement up to a point.  Car knowledge is a must for this job no faking it. Plenty of friendly management and a lot of management started at the store level. Not many outsiders in the business.
good,typical day is to come in and view daily jobs that need to be taken care of and what I need to get done as a manager / the hardest part of my job was when other employees wouldn't show up or come in late and I had to cover them too - excellent management people willing to go the extra mile to benefit you and their company - I became manager on duty in less than 40 days and retail parts pro manager in about 4 months
good,I enjoy going to work every day and love working with the people that I was with working for my supervisor was an awesome person when we did a good job she would show her appreciation to us
good,"Loved the job and enjoyed working with people and the project cars they would be working on. But a store that does over 300,00.00 a month can afford to pay the employees more than 9.75 an hour."
good,"I learned so much working here. I came in there with no experience with cars at all, and left with knowing a lot. The mangers and employees there taught me so much."

good,Good environment. Very professional. Several opportunities for advancement. Employees are very well trained and are treated fairly. Management is extremely supportive
good,Good place to work but hard on the body lifting heavy parts. Good place to advance if you will do the job and are able to lift the parts. also must be able to work the weekends and nights.
good,Advance is a great organization to continue your career growth.  It is not known to be a corporate environment conducive to new talent fresh from college but to utilize talent sought from other large corporations.
good,lot of movement such as parts places and diagrams.management was ok. the culture was ok there issues but went over it. the hardest part of the job is making a customer happy

good,"It is a nice place to work at depending on who you work with.  Wouldn't recommend it as a primary source of income, but looking for a part time job then doesn't get better then Advance Auto Parts."
good,The company has its perks. It has a high turnover rate with its employees. Good benefits and good 401K package. It is a big company that leadership could be improved. Many high executives positions have changed recently.
good,I love working here.  The company cares about their employees.  The benefits as a full time employee are some if the best I have ever worked for.  Upper management can be questionable at times but overall good.
good,"While being a driver my job title wasnt limited. I also helped customers(with the register and on the sales floor), answered phones, stocked the shelves. Helped unload a weekly truck."

good,Solid place to work management does a great job in making sure their employees are taken care off and they are reasonable when it comes to making request. Not to hard to learn their system at the register and the uniformity of the sales floor and parts area makes doing your job easier.
good,Team work was a plus. When not busy you would have to jump in and help whenever was needed. Not only your job but through out the store. Team work a plus.
good,Loved the management and the people i worked with. I worked the counter until i got a call for a delivery. Easy enough routes and they provided reliable and safe vehicles.
good,"Best to know a bit about mechanical, electrical and fluid components of cars and trucks.  Most of the activity is to help the customers with their problems and accurately find the solution."

good,Overall I enjoy working for advance good place easy work days it's my part time I i am  greatly interested in the job I learn alot from working with this company
good,The company used performance based reviews to motivate employees but sometimes asked too much of their staff. Other than that the atmosphere was awesome for anybody who likes getting under the hood and problem solving.

good,Required to do a lot at one time and achieve sales goal as well as keeping the store presentable. My co-workers make it fun while at the same time doing our work. You get rude customers pretty often but we are taught on how to handle that. The manager is amazing. She knows her job very well and could move up a lot higher in position but wanted to come back to her original store where she started. She has our back in the way of when we ask for a day off she gives it to us and her team has her back in always achieving her standards at the store as well as covering shifts that are needed to be coverd

I learned how to maintain my vehicle and understand when to service my vehicle. Management was knowledgeable in training people on the job.

Everyday I learned something new, whether its changing a battery or finding out what the customer really needs by just a few words. Management was great, everyone was very understanding and treated the staff accordingly. My co-workers were the best to ever work with. My hardest part of my job was clocking out and leaving everyday. I never wanted to leave, I was always there. The most enjoyable part of my job was the connection I was able to build with each and every customer that walked through those doors, we were a family at Advance Auto Parts."

good,Typical day would start of with several parts deliveries and in between stocking auto parts in their usual place. We receive the truck twice a week so it would give us plenty to do.

The management team provides great leadership and my co-workers are like family.

Management was great, always worked around my school schedule and was really supportive. My co-workers made the job fun and the atmosphere of the place was more like a bobbie not a job so it was enjoyable.

good,Warehouse work. Overall good work condition and people to work with.
good,Good Company to work for a really flexible schedule. Always good to build your customer relation skills.
good,Typical day at Advance putting away car part pieces that has been process to come back in the warehouse. I have learned that if be productive and stay productive you come out successful. Management isn't the best because when it comes to delivering messages to employee's messages aren't always conveyed as clear. The hard part about the job was being a team everyone plays a part but it makes it hard to do the work when everyone isn't serious about the job. The most enjoyable part about the jobs were the thanks you dinners that are giving when they show appreciation.
good,"Overall a great expereince, enjoyed most customers, but if had a terrible one company didn't back you or defend you. The dollar was more important than the employee. I enjoyed the energy in that store and always being able to keep busy. Most co-workers great to work with."

good,it a great place to work u have fun and get the job done i like it her they just dont pay enough for the work u do
good,Working at Advance Auto Parts is fun and fair all in one. The opportunity to train in store was the biggest plus. The benefits are A1. Helping customers meet their needs is the most satisfying.
good,"In my current situation, scheduling off days for doctor's appointments, etc. are easy,  my boss seems to understand how important it is. I have a pretty decent work group and the environment isn't the best but it's not really bad either. The biggest thing is knowing working with the public can be difficult especially if the customers are irritable when they come in the store."
good,"A typical day at Advance Auto Parts as an employee, I would have to make sure the isles are maintained clean and organized. My workspace behind the counter was up to standard in cleanliness and have all my Tools I need in order to complete my job. I would help the customer in understanding their problem and finding the solution and/or part needed to complete the job."
good,I have learned a lot in the past year. There are many areas that have improved on my knowledge and understanding of dealing with people and knowledge of automotive parts.
good,"Working at Advance had me move up fast, from being just a cashier to a key hold and now being a retail parts pro/management, got me think that I could move up in managing at any company."
good,Help customers find out what they need for the vehicles and how to get it. I learned something almost everyday about cars and I think that it was very beneficial for me. Great coworkers and managers who made it fun and exciting to go to work.
good,Fast pace retail environment. Wages are fair. Not too much room for advancement unless you are looking to go outside of the store level and into upper management.
good,Allowed me to Branch out in a new field and learn a new area. The training was outstanding and they were very willing to work with me in areas that were new to me to qualify me for the experience
good,"Working for Advance is great place to work. Management is well prepare and always willing to listen and help. The company pays accordingly to the local minimum wage law, but I think they should pay a little higher since the cost of living is higher in this area."
good,"Has its stressful moments, but it also has some fun times. You can also meet some awesome people with awsome cars. They work with schedules very well if this is a second job or like me you were in school until 4pm. And schedules were posted a week ahead of time."
good,Good company but some of the management in the stores are very unprofessional and not fair and do not treat their employees respectful! The corporate office is good but in stores not so good!
good,First I had to be trained to drive the forklift to get my license after a week being there... Stayed in a department for 6 months that got moved over to another one and I got out of one of my fears working there and it was hike...
good,Things were great their little slow for the pace that I was used to keeping up to but overall great people I would go back if offered the same position again
good,I loved working at advance the only problem is no maternity leave pay and if the manager gets mad at you they cut your hours an eventually you have no job
good,Advance is a great place to work. employees are there to ensure you get the right parts the first time. If you’re looking for customers service experience this is a great place to work.
good,"Fun place to work, flexible working hours, good place to manage work life balance. Management was supportive.Good opportunities to explore and learn new Technologies."
good,"Help cash customers out, but I mainly would wait for phone calls to take parts to the shops that they needed,  I would normally take more than one part to one shop. And I actually would have fun doing it cuz it would make time fly wen ur out driving to shops"
good,Just about everyone that works here is fun to be around and very knowledgeable/helpful when there's a question you have. You have enough time to grasp the basics before they put you to work. I had fun working here!
good,"It was fast paced, on your feet all day. Learned how to handle customers not know what they wanted, Customers that got a little unruly due to buying a part and it not fixing the issue, Customers that were repeat and new customers. The management was very great when I first started, then when management changed after a couple year into it. I had issues with doing my job and also having to do the managers job as well. I loved the job the only difficult part I found was dealing with the outside upper management when they would come and visit the store. The customers and the other employees were the best part of the job by far!"
good,"My time in Advance was only about a year, but I found the work environment to be quiet laid back. Although it was laid back, it was still very productive, Working in retail, it is fairly obvious that assisting customers and making sales are the biggest parts, but from time to time, things slow down. This doesn't mean that everyone just did nothing. Things would get slow at times, but this would mean that we would have time to clean and attend to inventory, or do some stocking of the shelves."
good,"Started as a salesman, worked my way to a key holding Manager, and currently a Retail Parts Pro. I open and close the entire Store. I like the fact that we are able to interact with customers. I learned a lot by delivering parts to our Commercial Shops. You get to learn there needs, you can look around while in there shop and offer sale items."
good,Big company alot of room for advancement. Very fast pace place to work. I enjoyed my time there because of the friendly staff and client base. Although it does take a while to move up the ladder.
good,"Steady customer traffic with new questions and situations at every moment. Managing walk in and commercial customers, delivering parts to shops and receiving ordered parts 5 times a day. Well resourced company on information and second source items, makes it easy to learn something new everyday. Interacting with young and older co-workers with many different back grounds. Hardest part of the job is customer service depending on the situation. The most enjoyable part is the human interaction with co-workers, commercial shops, and building your regular customers."
good,normally an 8 hour shift unless an empoyee could not make it in.  open or closing the store. counting the tills and making deposits.  completing opening or closing the store..   dealing with customers.  stocking inventory.  helping other employees..                                    ordering parts and delivering them with there computer system.           my boss at advanced was awesome.  i really enjoyed working for her. she is a great person and we are still friends today.                     hardest part of the job was working out in the cold installing batteries.        the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with what they needed  and working with the other employees.
good,Certain jobs and areas are fun to do but some management isn’t fun to work under. Some work ethics isn’t fair to others. It’s a great place to learn machine operative skills as well.
good,I love helping customers. I love making sure the customer has everything to get the job done right the first time and in the event Mr. Customer is returning it would be for another reason.
good,"Aside from the fact that no one checks up after the few losers that can’t seem to do their job, it’s a good place to be"
good,nice people and professional.Great place to work  and opportunity to advance in your career. The have fun Fridays every week that seem to build all the employees up and let you work as a team even with other departments.
good,"Let me tell you about my days at Advance Auto Parts. It was very nice .I learned how  to drive the sit down forklift. I also did inventory control work.  The management was dealing with so many people that had to tell us what to do  at one  time .  My opinion on the workplace culture is that people had different personalities &different attitudes to deal with .  The hardest part of the job is that everyone didn't like to come together to keep the building clean . "
good,"I enjoyed doing my job and the Commercial Customers. Good company car, for deliveries. The reason I left, was because of the NEW Corporate Policy change in Jan 2014."
good,A typical day at work would be full of experience. The things I learned were some parts that I didn’t not know about. Management at advanced auto parts was good because if you didn’t know something they’ll help you out.
good,fast pace hard working. It is a very good company to work for. Management and security is very good. Not a stressful place but could and my be at certain times of the month.
good,Advance Auto Parts its a company that wheel help you learn and grow as a professional worker and it helps understand how to help customer that are in need of money or help.
good,I really enjoyed working for advance auto parts. I really feel like it was the job that set me up for success in everyday life not just in a work environment
good,"Advance Auto Parts gives you the opportunity to learn a lot about the automotive world. Working with a fun crew, great management, and a good environment makes the job fun and go by with ease. Helping customers solve their problems, and finding solutions to help them is always a fun challenge that changes with every person that walks into the door. One downside to the company is that it lacks security against theft or crimes. Most stores don’t have basic security in the event that a crime could take place, or a life could be threatened."
good,"Always a fun place to work especially if you enjoy cars. Management is fantastic, they work with your availability. Wages are fair and there is room for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Advance Auto Parts, my manager was great always willing to help train and provide support as needed with out being pushy. Advance is a large company, with a cooperate structure if your willing to go places they can help get you there you may need to relocate to accomplish this but the company does seem to want to higher from with in first. They look at best practices and work to include them in to the company structure."
good,the people there were diligent and supportive my managers helped me every step of the way and i hope i can work with that company again. I recomend advanced auto parts
good,within a year and a half I was moved from part time to being a store manager and turning the store that I took over around so that it was making a profit.
good,"I did not know how to pop the hood of a car when I applied for this job but because they offer so much training, I can do maintenance on my own vehicle now. You don't have to know a lot about cars to start a career here because you will be well trained. I was encouraged a few times while working here to apply for promotions but refrained to stay focused on school. Work environment was fun. Always enjoyed the look on men's faces when I offered to install the battery in their Ford F250's! I was part time but heard that paid vacations were a plus."
good,I like advance auto parts as a company. The work environment is awesome. There just wasn’t enough opportunities for me to me move up in the company. I feel like I am as high I can go bring at the store that I am at.
good,"open store or commercial dept, count down cash drawers, finish up paperwork. check in freight, get over night parts ready for delivery. call customers and offer specials take part orders and stocking orders. look up parts and get them pulled. work place could get very busy at times but had plenty of help from my commercial drivers. hardest part was  not  having enough hours devoted to commercial drivers to get deliveries out  on time. enjoyed working with the garages and mechanics, lifetime friendships. commercial drivers were the back bone and enjoyed working with them."
good,"P.O.S"
good,Advance auto parts is a great place to work for in the automotive business but I personally believe that hourly pay isn't enough for what the job is .
good,Helping your fellow team members is the key to success and also the key to helping customers get in and out with the correct items they were looking for
good,Fun place to work and learn keeps you on your a game and the team is always driving for success always have good sales every month witch is good small take to get the customer talking and to let them know we are looking out for them
good,Its a good palce they took me in and started teaching me everything i need to know bout cars ..great teachers amd co-workers. Delivery driver is a good job because time goes by fast and u can easly know what parts is needed for customer cars.
good,"Mostly pleasant customers. As with any job there are the ""exceptional"" people. Every day is a new day to learn something that makes you a little smarter than yesterday"
good,"Great place to work, room to advance with growth in the company. too much disassociation with corporate to store level, but ultimately very competitive place to work."
good,A typical day at work consists of dealing with fast paced commercial customers and assisting DIY customers while always thinking of the upsell. Can either be dead for hours or back to back customers.
good,part time job to cover some expenses. as my main job doesn't cut it for my pay. just trying to find a career that I can get by with just one job again. overall its a great job and I have fun there working with the crew just need to go to one job again.
good,"Early workday usually there all day. Does take up most of your time through out the week. Learn something new everyday. Management is awesome, work attendance lacks."
good,Open the store in the morning and wait for the customers to start coming in. Take care of all of the customers needs during the day and at the end you will close the store.
good,i advanced to a key holder position in one month. the job was not stressful at all. there are so many opportunity to advance in the company you just have to be able to want it.
good,"if you don't know anything about a vehicle, this is the best place to start. You're always having to look up parts that you have never ever heard of, but that where you put your patients to use."
good,Some manager are just there to collect a paycheck since they are salary. If they are the down-to-earth kind of people then it should be a good place to work at.
good,"Takes care of employees.  If worked an extra Saturday brought in lunch for the crew."
good,In Life I always say you get out of work what you put in.  I climbed the ranks and achieved some the highest accolades with my time at Advance Auto Parts.  The culture rewards those that are hard working and ready to step into new roles that will result in personal growth as well as professional growth.
good,"Having done two rounds of employment with this company, I have nothing bad to say.  Management is there every step of the way, whether it is day to day challenges, building the team up, or spending time one on one with an employee, pushing them to the next level - absolutely great management culture for sure."
good,"Great workplace, good environment, and good choices for management. In store work flow is quite simple, not a very demanding job. Advancement opportunities are great and numerous."
good,"~Ordering parts for customers and seeing their look on their face when you show them the problem or have the right part (because being a girl is hard in a part store)"
good,Advance is full of knowledgeable parts professionals that will do everything they can to get you what you need. The drivers are exceptional when it comes to getting the parts you need to the shop you are so you get back to doing what you were doing. The management is fair with everybody and does not play favorites.
good,I enjoyed working for Advance Auto but wanted to move to a higher role that just wasn't available in the area. I would recommend this company to anyone from a recent highschool graduate to a seasoned sales person.
good,"I worked at a location in CT, in 2009, it was a decent job, rearranging parts shelves, cashing customers out, and the occasional know it all would come in and start a debate with an employee. I worked with decent people, but workforce reduction and company cuts resulted in me not working there anymore. I would work there again, and have been offered positions there over the years from being a regular customer, but other employment has superseded."
good,"Good place to work for if your in the management category.  If you a  regular employee, it isnt a career job because it'll take long to advance. Other than that I love to meet new people daily."
good,"i was with them for 9 years, ran the commercial and built a good solid relationship with my customers, only reason i left was i wanted to run my own store, team we had was great to work with."
good,"Had to meet a sales goal, I learned a lot about cars, my manager was very nice and understanding, not being able to satisfy the customer and have what they needed, just being there!"
good,Overall good place to work. Upper management not as professional in certain situations. Lower and upper management should work in harmony and not just be a dictatorship from upper management with intimidation tendencies.
good,"Good learning experience; working with customers who need your help, it feels good when you know you've genuinely helped someone"
good,"A typical day at work ranges anywhere from laid back to busy as crazy. The work is not difficult, Quite frankly I enjoy working with people. The supervisors are cool people and tend to make it quite obvious that they are just ordinary people that they are there to work but are not corporate robots. They are willing to help you as an employee just as much, if not more than the ordinary customer. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be the advanced multitasking when business gets really busy. However at the end of the day its nice to know that you did everything you did to try to help a customer find exactly what they need at an affordable price."
good,Management is very helpful and advancement is available to those who make an effort.  Flexible working hours when needed.   Overall a very good place to work.
good,"a typical day at work can be very busy, what i learn at this company is time management and organization, team work, and problem solving. Management is very ferm with there employees and expect time and dedication at there workplace, the hardest part at this job can be customers that are very hard to understand guidelines and expectations, but can be fix most of the time. the most enjoyable part of the job is being happy to work with staff that loves each other as a big family."
good,a typical day would b delivering parts on time and to make sure its what they need and to have it prepared and ready to make long drives for 10 hrs a day
good,You work 11 hours a day 5 days a week.There is not a lot of home life with that. I have learned more about helping employees grow with this job than in any prior jobs I have had. Co-workers were phenomenal and a pleasure to work with. Hardest part of the job was the amount of tasks to accomplish with the little labor hours per week they gave. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and employees be successful with the company!
good,"Good job overall.  Sometimes requires long hours."
good,"Good relations with co-workers, close to home, flexibility to study. Good place as a first job. Great managers and training."
good,I had a good time working in Advance auto parts i got to build a one on one relationship with my customers which made working fun and exciting.
good,"Great work environment."
good,A typical day is very in and out. Learned more about cars such as repairs and how a vehicle works in and out. Management where I work is a balance of work and fun.
good,Managed all operations from inventory to staffing and scheduling team members. Taught team members how to grow the business through customer service and attention to detail.
good,Good environment with good co-workers. Fair amount of work involved. Great costumer base. A business that will continue to grow.
good,"This is a fun place to work, with excellent opportunities to move up to management.  Most enjoyable part is working with the managers, my colleagues, and learning from each of them.  I love the advancement potential, but they do need to pay their employees more, and ensure that they have the proper hours to keep employees satisfied.  Overall, great place to work, especially if you want to move up fast, and have a career, not just a job.  I also enjoy how the manager do not make their employees feel like they are not appreciated."
good,"handled all inventory transactions. maintain a clean facility. stock shelves assist customers, cashier, inform customers warranties, benefits, and help customers become more parts knowledgeable"
good,"Many opportunities to learn from very knowledgeable manager about car parts and work.  We have a great staff of team members that get along well.  Must be able to multi task, very busy customer atmosphere and lots of outdoor tests/tasks to be conducted.  This is sometimes unpleasant in the extreme heat and cold months."
good,Working as part of the team to bring good quality merchandise to the public providing all basic care needs was a wonderful experience.
good,Typical day lots of clients that need their problems solve some you when some you loose but most of all they all leave satisfied and with a peace of mind.
good,My passion is in the automotive field.  I've been around show cars with my grandfather and uncle all my life.  But was always learning something new.
good,"Information Systems professional with over 30 years in the industry.  Extensive knowledge of manufacturing, retail and distribution systems. Experience in a wide range of applications and hardware.  Strong background in analysis and re-engineering of processes.  Skilled at conflict resolution(both at the associate and client level), Project Management expertise and cross-functional team building.

You travel from site to site with a team of 2 other merchandisers and you will be away from home for about a week at a time."
good,"Great place to work at everyday was different and you learn a lot about cars, coworkers were great and VERY flexible hours"
good,"Taking phone calls and walk in customers all day is generally how the day runs. It depends if you are on the retail side or the commercial and title on how the day is fully. There are many things to learn on both sides. Retail is just that, you learn everything there is to know on retail and work as you would in any other except you deal with the automotive world. You learn on both sides all the names of all the parts and slang terms for them as well. Just because an item is called one thing doesn't mean it is not referred to as another. You literally have to be a thesaurus on automotive knowledge. Team members in this industry all generally have a passion, in some sense, for cars. There are your classic rivalries on the American muscle and import battles. One of the hardest parts is getting everything for every vehicle all the time. There are a lot of items that have been made obsolete or have been discontinued. Finding these hard parts feels like a long quest into the darkest reaches of the Internet. It is time consuming and frustrating coming up empty handed. When that moment comes that you have found the right part and the customer is filled with shock and awe, you know right then that it was worth it. It doesn't even matter if they bought the item or not. The most enjoyable part is having your repeat customers. Not for the reason that you sold them the wrong part, no, the ones that come to you cause you help them every time and lead them in the right direction. These are the ones that lighten up your bad days."
good,its a good job to help you start your knowledge in sales and customer service in the auto parts business.
good,easy work great people to work with dealing with bad attuite costumer

good,Good working environment. I loved my manager he was very fair. I was able to advance.
good,"I learned a lot there , and management was amazing , coworkers were nice and helpful ."
good,I typical day for my position would be to clock in on your cashier and to ring up all products for customers. Greet them with a smile and to also give them great customer service for satisfaction.
good,A typical day there was go to work on time and start selling car parts and selling  to commercial accounts.  The advancement was quick.  I went from parts seller to second assistant manager in 3 months.  I did openings and closings.  The other manager and coworkers were great except for the normal drama but all of us were like family and talked.  I had to leave my position because I shattered discs in my back and I had back surgery and my doctor said I couldn't work in that kind of field anymore because of all the heavy lifting.  But my body was strong enough I would like to think I would still be there.
good,"Good place to work, with the the exception of the swing hours, and being open all the time"
good,"Overall my employment with Advance was great. Within a few month or working there I had worked my way up to assistant manager. Employees were great, the pay was fair. I was able to have every other weekend off to spend time with my family."
good,I liked working at Advance Auto Parts! My boss was great! She was fun to be around and yet the stuff got done what needed to get done.
good,"Being the only girl at that location it was hard to move into lower level management, but I did it. Hardest part was being a woman in a man's world. I enjoyed proving that I could handle myself in a tough situation. I typically would either open or close the store on a daily basis, and assist customers in their needs in between answering phones."
good,I liked my job here but its just too hot in the summer!! Management really trys to work with you should some unforseen situation come up. They are very safety conscious but the steel toed shoes did a # on my feet.

good,"Advance has always been a great, very culture minded company to work for. The company can take you as far as you're willing to go. Competitive workplace"
good,"This job can be for anybody who wants entry level, or just love answering phone calls, make deliveries, search parts or help customers find other options. Knowledge of using the Apex system (point of sale as well) is not that hard to learn. My general manager gave me good first impression, but his persona made him impatient at times - but he does his job and help when needed. One month will be easier for you to transition after the next. You won't be the best in a month - unless you are a fast learner and have good memory. The hard part is working in an automotive retail environment and learning about how certain parts are located and what they do. Most of our store's customers are commercial and retail. I signed up to be a counter parts sales person, but I become a driver half of the week. It is a rotated schedule, some weekends I works, some weekday I will have one off. Manager is very flexible working with your schedule - especially when a situations arise or you have a doctors appointment. Observe your hiring manager or general manager."
good,"Great environment to work in along with great leadership."
good,"Pays isn’t the best , but the management is great , and the environment is fun . The management trains , and sets you up for success . Mostly the culture of advance is what has really won me over . Great company"
good,"Management was great and actually cared about its employees. Although the strict higher ups that did not allow overtime for most all employees, the were enough hours to go around.  If you want to work you could."
good,Advance Auto Parts has helped me improve my communication skills with employees and customers. I've been able to organize myself better and manage my time better.
good,Management were flexible with my college schedules. Very good place for part-time work. Advancement opportunities are not very abundant. If you're going to school still and just need some money this job is perfect.
good,The team is small enough that everyone knows each other on a personal level and many of the commercial accounts that we deal with are like a second family to us.
good,"The best thing I learned from my years with Advance Auto Parts was how to wow someone. Helping someone and given you’re all to go out of the way even when it wasn’t  necessary and then share it with your team members and even customers to create a chain reaction that starts all over with the next person."
good,learned a lot about vehicles and customer service during my employment. also gained skills using card readers and cash handling. along with knowledge on setting up displays.

good,was a very relaxed atmosphere had a small work crew and we all knew what needed to be done to make the day run smoothly but we were all able to work at our own pace
good,Coworkers were great to work with. Customers are usually easy to work. Working as a delivery driver is a very simple job since all you're dealing with is getting the part from your store and delivering it to the commercial customers address.

good,A good place to work if you enjoy customer service and cars. Delivery driver is fairly low stress and the day goes by quickly. Pay is decent but won't cover everything unless you're full time.
good,Great job with lots of room for advancement. Needs a little work in the management department above general manager but it has good benefits and nice people to work with.
good,I learned much more about automotive repair since beginning there. Learning from more experienced co-workers and customers really made me better at my job. The compensation started out being low but got better in recent years to where I was being paid above what other competitors were willing to offer me.
good,"Advance auto parts is not only a place where we helped people, fix their cars. We educate the customers on their vehicles as well. If you want to become a mechanic as well, advance auto is a great place to start at entry level as well."
good,My overall experience was great learned alot of parts and what causes the problems.  Great environment friendly coworkers and customers. Also good with mandatory lunch breaks
good,"I enjoyed working for the company because it gives you retail and department store experience on a small scale unlike an overwhelming department store. You work with a crew of three to five people at a time depending on the pace of day. This makes getting to know your coworkers on a personal level."
good,"one of the best jobs I've had to this day, especially if you like cars.  I didn't know really anything about cars until I started this job my knowledge increased significantly. Its hard to move up but when you do it well worth it."
good,"It's tough to get past the low entry level wage, but if you can tough it out until some advancement opportunities arise, it can be worth it. There is a decent living to be earned here but you've often got to work some unreal hours to achieve it. Good job for a young man or woman with not too many responsibilities in life."
good,I had a great time with the company! You really have to have a passion for the automotive industry!if you do then you'll love it here! Auto experience helps a lot in this business.
good,"Loved interacting with most customers. Sending them out smiling and appreciative was very satisfying.The day usually started at noon,clocked in and checked sales for the day, checked emails for shipping issues or updates, checked to see if any backstock needed moving, checking inventory for quantity and pricing. Take care of retail and commercial customers as required, Deliver parts as required, Ensure clean up was complete. Insure the registers, safe and deposits were ready for the next day.

good,I learned plenty about vehicles while working at advanced auto parts. There was nothing hard about this job. I had to many things my manager is supposed to do using the PDA with his numbers which he'd get in trouble for if corporate knew about it.
good,Great company to work for but to be successful you must have an interest in automobiles and a willingness to learn.  Those with outgoing personalities will excel and being able to multitask is vital.

good,"•	Manage RVP’s busy schedule and independently schedule appointments and conference calls with proper balance for daily tasks."

good,"Had to enjoy multitasking ."
good,"Great Job  if you like working on cars. If you like helping customers, showing leadership this is a job for you. If you have a family and you are the head of household, trying to juggle working especially a Management Position its hard. I did it for 8yrs hardest thing ever. Family Orientated to a degree. PT /FT non Managerial Position"
good,"a typical day would include stocking shelves, performing inventory checks, helping customers find parts for their vehicles and offering advice on different repair jobs. I was able to learn a lot from my own customers some of them who had been working on cars for years. My co-workers were great and we were a very tight knit group. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to talk to customers about something thats a big hobby of mine."
good,Has great expirence with them loved orking for advance auto parts
good,Every day is always something new. My job is never mundane. Always learn something new everyday. You must be able to deal with change as you will learn new processes and procedures quite often..
good,Worked with domestic and international carriers to negotiate rates and contracts.  Responsible for delivery vehicles domiciled at the stores and couriers who serviced the stores multiple times per day.
good,work was simple and was planed the day before every thing there has in order but because it was a big company there is no balance so every store you walked in every one did there work there own way

good,Would help out with customers and help maintain keeping the store organized. There were times where I would need help trying to find car products or just identifying a product and my coworkers were there to teach me or help me out.
good,"Advance is a great place to work.  It is a great environment, my coworkers and manager and I are like a little car parts family. There is a very good balance between work and personal life. There is a very enjoyable workplace culture.  It is a very casual and fun environment."
good,Have had the pleasure to work there for many years. Always put the team first. Room for advanment .working hard does pay off. Open door policy is good.
good,The job was great. I helped build relationships with customers that kept them coming back. Only thing was that the new distract manager wanted freah faces in the store & tried everything to get rid of employees.

good,"Great job culture."
good,"Typical work day starts slow for the first 30 minutes (Depending on the day of the week). After that the day picks up in waves. There are many rushes or waves of people but if you know your part and everyone plays their part in the store, things work out very well. This is also an environment that you have to enjoy and know something about or it could envelope you. Overall, I love this place and the fast paced workforce that it brings"
good,"A fast paced environment, comfortable workplace with friendly people. Good benefits. One meeting every week concerning safety, activity, and productivity. Management is good as well."
good,"Good company, flexible hours. Family oriented."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is a great place to work. I’d advise you to have a second job if you are supporting a family most likely simply because you won’t get more than about 20 hours on average. They will train you, so don’t worry about not being competent."

good,I've been at advance for 7 years and it's been a great experience and bumpy roller coaster. I've had the same manager for the last 5 years until he left and went to another D.C.

good,First shirt was the best time flew bye.The pay was nice too.Training on the forklifts was the hardest if you wasn't trained by the right one and i liked the arm screeners.
good,An excellent entry-level job for those willing to learn about vehicular basics. A lot can be learned from working this position; it may assist one in maintaining their vehicle. Yet there are not many opportunities for advancement beyond store level without proper certification.
good,During the time that I worked here I`ve  got to experience a different and easy going work place. Advance Auto had a simple system  that was easy to understand and a work place that always made you feel welcome. We always greeted every customer with a smile and the proper greeting of the day.
good,"Most employees are knowledgeable"
good,"It was a okay career, it paid the bills. The work environment was great. The  benefits where horrible. The raises are generous in logistics, not retail."

good,"Fun challenging work environment with great full time benefits."
good,"I was recruited from my last job at Autozone, to come work management at Advance Auto. I was hired as a RPP, which would be like their third manager in line. Within a year I was promoted to assistant manager. I would either come in and open the store, or work later and close up the store. The job is %100 customer service, whether over the phone or in person. The company is a great company, they treat their employees great, and with bonuses and commissions, it make it even better, However, now being married and having children, the changing random 45-50 hours a week are getting overwhelming. I love my company, but I am looking for something more steady."

good,The company pays well for the level of skill you have. Management is always looking for input and new ideas. Only real issue was the 2nd shift life style.
good,"Very great place to work for.  Team members were very easy to get along with, and I was compensated fairly for my time there.  Had I not graduated and moved, I would have stayed there."

good,"I really enjoyed this job had to relocate due to moving out of town, but it was a great job. Great pay, great people, great times. Learned so much about cars"
good,"One of my favorite jobs.  I learned so much, and made some many friends through customers, and coworkers.  I can tell you all kinds of things about cars.  When i first started i didn't know anything about cars.  Now i can do my own repairs.  If i had to say a flaw was customers who didn't know what they were talking about, but would tell you that you were wrong, or if something was broke on their car its the companies fault that its broke. I had some rough nights, and you can meet some ""shady"" people.  the work environment was great.  We were a team, and everyone helped everyone.  My GM was a great mentor, and i took his advice to other jobs and have had great success."
good,Hot but we got the job done while still working as a team until the job was completed.I really enjoyed the job and the people.

good,i learned all my parts which helped me very much in becoming a tech
good,"the location that I work at seems to be a sinking ship. There isn't a way that you can move up at this location because they don't have enough business. When you try to relocate to another location, they are not available to take you. Might as well move on to something else and just quit this location."
good,When I first started with the company it was good but then after working there awhile and management kept switching hands things got worse! My GM was awesome it was the DM that was the issue. If you're thinking about working for the company I would only go part time!
good,The job wasn't so bad. There were alot of great people. Alot to learn. Alot of wisdom there. Just like any other job you have bad apples. Overall company is not bad but they dont value good employees
good,Not a good work environment.  No training.  No directions.  Did not enjoy my time there
good,Great way to help others and recommend the right parts that are needed.
good,Work place and customers were great but managment was very poor in attitude and poor behavior torwards customers and employees. The managment does not train there new employees.
good,a great place to work pay could be more to keep up with the cost of living. Really need stronger management. hardest part of leaving.Location hazlehurst not to far from home.
good,"The job is pretty easy, the customers is why your there. Manager is not a good one, will fire for no reason, doesn't give enough hours, lies about everything it's a good company, if you work for the right boss."
good,"No room for promotion's or advancement within the company. Good work place but not if you want a career.,.............................................."
good,"getting all your parts together so you could  deliver them.You learned a lot about car parts.I got to see  a lot  of what management does ,I got tom see how co-workers with you as a team.The hardest part about the is how you make it. The most enjoyable part  is when  you make you customers happy that got them the right parts for there car."
good,Usually end up working 60-70 hours per week with no extra compensation.
good,I was told upon getting the job the car knowledge was not needed.   I knew some stuff about cars but not everything.  I was quickly let go after asking management for simple help.
good,Working for Advance Auto Parts had it's ups and downs but overall the employees I was able to work with are very good people.  I never had any difficult times working here as the hours do not overwork you and the duties at hand were not grueling activities.  I did enjoy the on hand learning about the automotive business.  Being able to interact with different customers everyday really helped me expand my knowledge and experience for dealing with various situations.  One of the more difficult tasks that has to be completed at Advance is putting away merchandise when the truck comes in.  It was very easy to understand the cash handling system and management duties which I constantly tried to learn new ways to further my advancement potential.  I was also able to learn more about myself as I was given more responsibility/tasks that I found I am able to do way more and I have a motivated drive to make myself better everyday.
good,"didnt like how the manager made people feel, but other than that the customers were amazing and i loved helping people find what they needed"
good,"Enjoyed working with people, also like the team oriented workplace it was. Was a fun workplace to be working for.Just not a good place for growth in pay."

good,"Busy lot interesting things to do.  Friendly, and people were easy to get along with.  Regret leaving for better career opportunities.  Company definitely invested President Trump's corporate tax cut into IT systems geared toward the employee.  Positive work experience all the way around."

good,"Store 5655 in Powder Springs GA has a manager who likes to create a hostile environment for everyone who works there. This manager also favors certain individuals. If your not in the ""circle"" you get stomped on, picked on, constantly abused in front of customers and co-workers. The company is great, but, do not expect to like your job at this location!"
good,"I would clock in and start helping customers with there needs such as looking up parts for there car, looking up codes, charging batteries. My co-workers made the day go by just fine they helped a great deal with information far as training and helping others now when the manager up and quit because he was about to get caught up for stealing then the store fell apart because every week they sent a manager every week from a different store to see if they wanted to be the store manager it was crazy they had it so unorganized with the hours and everything it was a hot mess so i had to leave."
good,"Schedule employees to staff store for optimum customer service, continue to monitor sales against payroll and control the flow of inventory"
good,"very good part time job, has alright benifits, not a career job i would refer. Has a great work environment and work with good people, also helps people skills and communication skills."
good,Advance Auto is a great place to work. A typical day consists of talking to customers both in person and on the phone. i enjoy working at a fast pace and being able to use the knowledge i have of automobiles and help customers get the correct parts they need
good,I did not enjoy my time at AAP and found the culture to be non-suitable for   a working parent.  I did not find the work-life balalnce I was seeking when I joined up.
good,Every day presents new challenges to make our sales goals and provide excellent customer service. Whether fully staffed or not we make it happen everyday.
good,It was a nice place to work at. It’s vey high paced and you have to be quick on your feet. Which is nice because the time goes by so quick. I would definitely consider working for them again in the future!!!!
good,"Fast paced and fun, place to work. Opportunity to grow and learn if you are into auto parts and working with people. I love the hands part of the job. Installing batteries and helping people save money."
good,"I loved the people that I worked for at Advance. They were willing to work with you and it became like a family atmosphere. The only draw back for working there is that the company is not willing to pay the people what they are worth. But that can be said for most corporations these days. "
good,"It was a fun place to work with great people to work around. Sometimes Stressful, but it was worth it. I learned a lot when it came to the different people that came into the store, as well as the different parts that people needed."
good,was hired at job for delivery person and counter worker. of course stocking shelves was a part of it to was supposed to be full time but just got 24 hours a week and that didn't pay my bills had to get better job
good,awesome place to work just wish they would keep there promise they did not. had awesome managers at both locations I worked at and they worked with my schedule
good,"Log on to the computer, clock in, drive and deliver parts. Do paperwork and planograms. Deliver more parts. Go to the hub store to pick up more parts."
good,Was a ok place to work sometimes. The manager at the time was a major problem to work. Very in-fair and difficult to deal with. Learned a lot about cars and parts.
good,"At Advance Auto Parts, there is no such thing as a typical day. Every day has it's own changes and surprises. One day could involve many deliveries from the moment the store opens until it closes. Another day could involve no deliveries at all but helping plenty of customers in the store or even possibly putting up stock."
good,"I would come in check my area to check assignments execute those task , assist customers with all there automotive problems or questions about increasing the life and  speed of a vehicle. I also performed installations of wipers and batteries."
good,If they can get some decent managers in there. I'd do some part time work for them. Nothing bad to say.
good,Co-Workers like to gossip and do not help at all but if you yourself do your work everything should be fine and you would get along terribly well with our supervisors.
good,"Enjoyable work place, and the people are great. However advancing your career can take years, part time workers are still part time after years of working here"
good,I have learned to work with a few different computer systems.  The car parts industry is ever changing as new vehicles are made.  We have had several different managers at my location which sometimes makes it difficult. But all in all its an ok place to work
good,"I was a driver for a year. I was in two locations in that one year. My first store was great when we first opened, very busy but as time passed it got slow. I asked for more hours and was transferred to a busier store. At this second store everything was great. Super busy more hours. The co workers are wonderful. I only left because I needed to dedicate more time to school."
good,each customer is different and making them happy at the end of the day or good information to help them out to get on the road again to bright the day for them
good,The work was good but there was not enough hours to make full time when I was hired for full time and the schedule was never right lunch breaks was never put in place and they was always granted late rather busy or not
good,delivery parts /put stock away help customers and what ever had to be done knowing what to do first .learning different things from the manger right ways from wrong .
good,High volume of customers but easy job. You will have to be able to stock heavy parts and climb ladders with the parts. Newbies will work a lot of nights and weekends
good,Learned tons. District manager sucks and passes the suck on to team members. Creates a culture of mistrust and confusion but can be a great job in spite of him.
good,"Fickle scheduling, employee discount is a joke when anyone that has ever worked for a WD knows that 10% over cost is industry standard. Customers buy better with a coupon than we do with our employee discount. Games played buy upper management."
good,I enjoyed helping people find what they needed to keep them on the road and on to more important things.In closing I'm looking forward to continuing doing this type of work just at a different place.
good,"Great environment, fun to work for. Co-workers are all very helpful and friendly. Good learning experience.  Great place to work but pay is too low for your works worth."
good,"At my job I have learned to deal with all types of Individuals. I have learned to manage money, maintain a store and all the assets in the store. I have learned to open the store as well as being accountable for all the money in the store."
good,"As a store commercial manager work was always really busy I always made sure to grow all store sales. I managed many tasks at once, and manage to always improve the store."
good,"good place to work for. good ppl ,bad thing is only 40 hrs or less."
good,"Getting any parts that were overnighted to our store put on our customers part order location. Answering commercial clients calls for parts for automobiles for them,pulling the parts & delivering them the proper part in a prompt timely manner. As quickly as possible.Stocking parts in their proper place & location on our shelves when our delivery truck came in with our stock, in between answering phone serving customers, and Deliveries of the parts.We had a great Team oriented work environment with all of our co-workers/Employs at our store.The hardest part of the job was trying to find a part if it had been put in the wrong location or was missing from the store shelf all together, and trying to multi-task with several distractions at the same time but still do your job to the best of your ability and do it correctly.Working with great co-workers as a team to get our jobs done right, while also having fun while doing so at times during our work day.Was great job even during the multi-tasking moments."
good,"I have worked at several jobs in management. But Advance Auto Parts stands out because if you ask for the training , they will make sure you get it. As a retail parts pro manager I have learned different aspects of inventory, customer service, clerical, employee interactions. Inventory I learned cycle counting , acceptance of inventory truck, outages. Customer service : learning how to deal with all kinds of diverse customers is an experience. Returns , on the phone with online customer service to resolve customer issues. Clerical : deliver deposits to the bank, make change for registers, count safe twice a day, make schedule for employees of the store."

good,"A friendly place to work in the auto parts industry and some good people to work with as well! They had great benefits for employees to inspire them to work for the company and do better to meet the goals for the day. My daily routine at work was to sort the inventory fill orders, stock  the shelves and make delivers as they came in."
good,That the company works with you and that the company is a great company to move up in. It’s great company you get to meet all kinds of culture while you working
good,I don’t appreciate how i was treated by this company all i ever did was do the work and not complain but when others didn’t want to do the work i would have to if i was being harassed nothing work happen by it no matter who i told. None of their rules are true and no matter how many people came in to work stumbling and not sober they wouldn’t care if they drive machines Which is not right.
good,"They work you to the bone for little pay.  They dont care about you, they have poor benefits.  I just wouldn't recommend anyone working for them.  Simple as that."
good,Great place to grow! Promotion from within and always able to make your job enjoyable. Also provide skills that will provide success at advance auto or any other aspect in life.
good,It was an easy going job. Disnt require skills or too much knowledge on automobiles. Fast paced environment always will have something to keep you busy.

good,"Having a job that I love and working for a great company inspired me to figure out what makes a company a great place to work. After doing some research and speaking to various employees of companies that were recipients of the “Best Places To Work” awards, four elements came up repeatedly. Here are four of the things to look for when looking for a great place to work"
good,Amazing company. My previous employer was very helpful and understanding. The computer software was very poor. The pay was decent for the work you do.
good,Anyone who wants to develop themselves and rise to different levels and go up in chain. Training received is very effective in performing job especially with the right team and management in right positions
good,Great place to work. Many opportunities to continue your education in parts sales. Management work together and are very supportive of employees. pay is okay
good,I learned a lot about car parts while working on the job. It was a fun working environment and everyone treated you like family. I had no clue about car parts when I started working there but after you get the hang of how things are run there you learn more than you thought you could about car parts.
good,Great place for great things to overcome for a company where you meet all types of people and situations i encountered and accomplished a honorable name.
good,"Very flexible hours , each department work load varies. Some are extremely busy while others are not. The company has a good work  and home balance. Overall great place to work"
good,If you like cars as well as helping people then this is a steady and fun job. If you like thinking out of the box and know how to solve problems and can work it out in your head then it will help a whole lot.
good,Sale car parts all day answer the phone make sure the customer is getting everything they need and if it’s not in store we order it. The job is real easy it’s not a lot of work to do. Everyone is real nice and out goin

good,Good place to work. You get to help alot of people and do what you like and you cant beat that. I would definitely work there again. Would recommend to anyone as well.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work but could use improvement. Favoritism is way too obvious and detrimental. Hours were given based on friendship and not work commitment, attitude, and overall ability."
good,basic customer service job if youve worked at any customer service job this wont be much different though customers will ocassionally ask about car problems but their training helps with that
good,It was a good job I had a chance to learn how to drive the stock pickers & learn more about the company I really appreciate the chance to work with them
good,I worked at the one on Winton Road and the environment was very chill and the employees welcome you with open arms and if you ever are in doubt about something they make sure they are there to help
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Great work environment. The people and the customers are very polite and the work police is very good for the employees to stay safe.
good,Advance Auto DIY stores need more training. Everything is pretty common sense. By far as me saying DIY stores need more training I mean they should learn the same thing commercial stores know.

good,Productive working environment
good,I loved it there. It was amazing meeting new people and being able to help them with what they needed. I needed to make a job switch for more money or else I would've stayed there
good,"This was a great place to gain experience in a number of different areas, and hone in your skills. There are no two days alike, and you will always have new challenges."
good,"The people that worked there were good co-workers and nice people.  Filled out orders, picked them, and either saved them for pick-up or delivered them."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Advance Auto. It was a great experience."
good,"Typical work day could consists of anything from working the register, to stocking, to installing batteries all day. You learn SO much at this job its quite unbelievable. Unparalled Management and the job was almost always enjoyable."
good,very nice great and I like it. There is a lot to learn there. The coworkers are very nice and generous. Good place to learn about cars. and the automotive parts
good,"If you are a car guy or gal it will definitely make your life a lot easier.  I knew nothing about cars when I started, so it was kind of stressful when people asked you about something you didn't know about"
good,"Enjoyed all my time at work,  and the great pay I was earning.  Overtime was always mandatory and normally was not a problem. Not much time for family but definitely enough income to support them."
good,Working here was great for me because of the people I worked with. The job was sometimes crazy but I learned a whole lot and had lots of fun working there. If you're a female there are some gender bias from customers but the men I worked with treated me like their little sister so they were very protective even of my feelings.

good,"very enjoyable job, they give you alot of parts training and gain knowledge while working, most stores had 6 people working so shifts were always easy"
good,"I enjoyed the customer service mindset this company expected from its employees, driving to meet daily, weekly and monthly goals challenges the employees to push to meet or exceed expected goals.."
good,"Enjoyed working with advance auto parts warehouse"
good,They provide very little hours with even smaller pay. They want you to go above and beyond but don't give you the pay or hours you deserve. Poor management.
good,Dealing with the .public was both challenging and rewarding at the same time. being able to evaluate customer traffic and staff the store was great experience for controlling labor costs
good,the job itself wasn't bad but the people I worked with weren't the best. only 2 of the people I worked with I was able to get along with everyone else seen different from me cause I was a girl.
good,Deal with commercial customers and retail customers. Opened and closed the store including counting money for daily deposits. Trained new employees and managed inventory.
good,"loved working their, fun place to work at, learn a lot about cars, a lot, job isn't that difficult , they don't put a lot of pressure on you to make it overwhelming"

good,"I've worked at many different locations, and each one was a great experience.  You'll learn a lot about automotive parts just from talking to retail and commercial customers."
good,You will learn a lot about cars and parts. You do not have to have a huge knowledge of cars or parts just a basic understanding and a willingness to learn
good,make sure whatever the car company got all their parts they needed for their store. if the company needed more i would go back and get everything situated.
good,I enjoy my typical day of work interacting with customers. It's never the same. My crew of co-workers I work with are an amazing bunch.
good,"Sales "
good,"Good team work environment, everyone works together communicate to each other which is a extreme factor in a work environment"
good,Advance Auto Parts was a huge experience for me. I actually liked to learn how to install batteries and look up different car parts. What I loved most about the job was communicating with the customers and installing batteries.

good,"Great experience, working with a team who truly cares about customer satisfaction and have a great knowledge of the automotive industry."
good,it a very interesting place to work because you learn a lot of things about cars and you end up using it on your daily life. also you get to help nice people especially mechanics that in the future they would help you.
good,"I love my job, enjoy being busy and productive on a daily basis. I am not afraid to work above and beyond.Enjoy all aspects of this job and my co-workers"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with many different people in many different areas and learning all the different types of jobs there are within a warehouse.
good,"A typical day of work consists of ringing up customer cleaning the store and making sure everything is stocked. You work with a range of different customers. Some are DIYers and some are commercial. As long as you you have a level head and aren't afraid of standing all day, the job is pretty easy."
good,Learned alot about cars and how to put certin part together on the cars. This job also requuired us to do diagnostic on the car from the dash board. This is no where near a boring job.

good,It was a very chill environment to work in and the people are very focus on work. I was working unsupervised be I still new that I had to get the job done.
good,"stocked auto parts, and sold them as well the the people needing to fix their cars. worked with a great group of people, i still talk to them all the time. along with the coustomers to."
good,I started as a sales person and was promoted to a part-time manager within a month. I was still in high school so this was pretty great. The pay was ok. The customers are harder to deal with here because they must bring you the correct information and if they are wrong you will sell them the wrong part then they want to make a fuss about it. Some of the co- workers are terrible while others are great. Managment was about the same. I left due to them hiring someone to be a manager position that I wanted and he knew nothing of cars. The most enjoyable part was helping people fix their cars and provide solutions.
good,Advance Auto was a great place to work. There was always something new to learn. I would recommend anyone who loves the automotive to work there they have tons of skills training to help you learn all you need to about cars.

good,Great place to learn more about automobiles and the parts that go into them!

good,My supervisors were great ladies to work for.  The co-workers became like family.  Stayed busy and was made to feel as though I was an important part of the department.  Was given many other duties than what was in the job itself.  I was always chosen to be the one to do the training for new employees.  I learned all of my A/P experience from this company.
good,I enjoyed working at Advance Auto Parts. Simple fact that I am a female working around car parts. Co workers  made it easy to learn and also everyone got along well. The benefits are nice only if you are Full time but the discounts for being on Advance Auto team are even better.
good,Great job to have. employees helped out by showing me the ins and outs of the company.
good,"loved the people aand all that came with the job, the higher ups are a little removed from what goes on in the store under paid is the name of the game with them but you can go up in the company"
good,"Starting off as a parts counter person, I got to know the customers in the area and develop my own client base. Held three different titles including parts counter, commercial sale, the assistant manager.  I really did enjoy the job especially the customers.  All my co-workers were great and they all we missed when I left."
good,The typical day was to come in prep store server customers and do some sampling.Learned how to make preztels. The managment was excellent when i was there but they recently got new mangment. The co-workers were great people work with most of the time. The hardest part of the job is cooking the preztels the most enjoyable part is creating your own preztels.

good,great place to work when trying to get into the mechanic field
good,"you have your ups and downs but you have to keep working hard"
good,t advance auto you do not have a co worker you have a friend. It was so close knit. I made life lasting friendships their. Learning about cars and how to fix things really gives you a bonding time.. there is nothing better than being around other people who can teach you things
good,"Loved the job, had great coworkers and most became good friends. My typical day usually consisted of making sure the store was in order and there were no changes to the store, helping customers both personal and commercial. The only hard part of the job was just like any other job. When you start off you are unfamiliar with how things work. My favorite part of the job was dealing with cars and being around the people I worked with."

good,"Deliver parts to several business."
good,come in see what had to be done.the manger was fun but made sure you did your work.some of the workers was fun and some was not. some was lazy they did not want to work just wanted to get paid for not a thing.the most enjoyable part of thee job was when we all would joke around with each other and the customers
good,Helping customers over the phone was fun. Having the satisfaction of knowing that u help someone over the phone feels great.
good,"The best part I loved about working there were the free lunches, getting to learn about all car parts and how to take care of your vehicle, and maintain your car."
good,"Our Values: "
good,The job is good because it gives you different scenarios each day but some policies set bt the company are bologna.
good,I enjoyed working here people of the people i worked with and learned alot about vehicles.
good,"At this job I learned the real meaning of multi-tasking. The day is full of interesting people, tasks, phone calls, and co-workers. The most enjoyable part about this job is, although your tasks are repetitive no one day is like the other."
good,"Fun place to work, customers and coworkers and fairly nice and the coworkers are very helpful with anything. With hard work you can definitely move up in this company it just takes time. Hours are reasonable at Monday-Saturday 8am-9pm and Sunday 9am-8pm."
good,"A typical day at work was exciting , I love helping customers ,doing planograms , everyday task . I love reviews with my staff , making them better workers , the hard part was leaving which was for the best ."
good,"The culture at AAP was amazing. Customers always came first, and we were given much latitude in our decisions to insure a great customer experience.

My coworkers from Advance are still my best friends."
good,"great to work for, all Asst Mngr's turnover is about 3 yrs, we had 2, both laid off withing the same month..no reason given by corporate."
good,Loved the Automotive merchandising. Customers
good,When you first go in you look at your to do list and then you are suppose to start on it while at the same time wait on customers and also answer the telephone on the second ring. I guess the hardest part is when someone comes in and they will ask for something and they don't know what it is called they will say that thing located under that thing. But I usually figure it out. I love working with all of my coworkers. Everyone is very nice.
good,Customer Service is the key to making it in this business. I have learned managerial skill and techniques to help me move for with in the company
good,"A typical day was full of new faces puzzled until resolved by a customer sales rep or I helped. Tons of agendas being met in a shift. Learned so much from the mechanical aspect of knowiing parts. To the manger side of things were being cautious of payroll, sales, inventory, and micro-manging my commercial/wholesale department made sales and gained relationships. My co-workers were great dedicated and loyal. The difficult aspect of the job was keeping smile on my face with a unhappy camper. The reward of seeing any customer with joy and seeing them come again was most enjoyable."
good,The manager is open minded and very cordial. He's willing to work with his team. The team is helpful to one another and conduct business with a professional and fun loving attitude.

I stay upbeat and positive no matter what the situation. I enjoy helping people become successful. I have high expectations on myself and I expect others around me to be the same way. I take pride in my work and do what it takes to satisfy a customer. Customer Service is my top priority."
good,"I enjoyed my position with this company, there was rarely downtime. There were a lot of return customers so it was nice to work there. I learned a lot and was able to apply that knowledge outside of work as well."
good,"great people to work with, easy to get into a work flow. wish the pay were higher and I probably would have stayed at the job. try it out you might like it."
good,"This was a great job with my schooling hours. I worked as much as possible to keep a steady flow of money coming In as a college student, which was roughly 20 hours a week, if not less."
good,I loved this job. Very much a cohesive team to work with. We were like family. Everyone played there part. I had a great repore with our customers. I enjoyed the fast pace.
good,Would highly recommend advance auto parts! It is laid back as well a great learning experience for any one wanting to learn more about their vehicles.
good,it was a good job! people make everything bad. if they would concentrate on their job and not personal business this job would be ideal. I think you have to pick certain stores
good,3 managers within 6 months not stable super vision ... everything constantly changing. Customers are funny and rude but the the good ones you help or even give advice to are always great full! Knew a lot starting there and it’s just hard to show what you know to someone new every few months
good,counter person answer the phones look up parts for people off the street and the commercial accounts and sometimes make a deliveries to the shops. also put truck away and did returns and exchanges for customers
good,"Advanced auto parts is great job to work at if your into vehicles and their make up , it’s a very informative job that can introduce you to a great understanding about cars and how to deal with them , the management was great , the team was great ,the customers were happy and thankful "
good,"would not be as busy as I thought as I thought we should be. customers would only come in sparatickly  at times all through the day. I've learned more about the automotive industry being customer based and friendly. The General Manager was the best part of working the store his good, polite, very patient attitude towards everyone what makes the best part of working at that store everyday."
good,"decent place to work if you can manage enraged consumers. Sometimes customers are angry about having to pay to fix their car or cant figure it out so you have to be able to stay calm and troubleshoot for them. Overall good place to work, had the best manager ever."
good,If you like working on cars or helping people then you will like this Job. It is very busy and there is always a lot to do.  I have had no issues with the management.
good,We all worked together to make the store look clean and organize we took care of each other it was a really fun place to work even though it was no good benefits
good,"It is a place where you wend for yourself. you have a certain amount to do a day and you can get off when the work is complete. it is a fair business but it is not a job to grow at, your there cause you absolute need work."
good,Being a key carrier making 9.34 a hour don't work that well for the additional tasks. But over all a nice place to work. Co workers are good. The really isn't any hard part of the job.
good,"The job is simple and fun to do. The customer service part was not as bad as expected. The shifts are not bad, but didn't work well for me and my family."
good,Pretty good  in terms of work. Trustworthy people and a great learning environment . Dosent pay great.  Flexible hours and competitive wages. Ok benifits.
good,"I enjoy working here. A typical day at work would consist of assisting retail and commercial customers. Delivering, loading and unloading parts to local customer and updating customers on new products."
good,"great place to work but its just a starter job, not much room to move up in the company, especially if you don't thoroughly enjoy sales and the jobs associated with sales"
good,"Good company to work for, good work life balance, but lacking job security.  Short term compensation is good but mid and long term compensation isn't there."
good,It was fast paced always moving they are really friendly place to work the gm is really nice and the woman over the MPP part is a very  Good at he job
good,This job is a great job for anyone who is only wanting a part-time job or for a student just wanting some extra spending money.
good,"fun, fast paced, and very educational, customers are great and easy going."
good,"Customer service, deliveries, learning more about the company."
good,was a very fast place to work and time went by fast.was a great place to use my skills in auto to help others with my knowledge
good,I learned a lot about auto parts as well as my way around new areas.
good,"A typical day at advance was mostly in and out the store threw out the store,weather its installing headlights, installing a battery,or just helping customers figure out the problem their having car.i learned alot more about cars after a few months with at advance auto parts such as the motor components,brake hardware,tune-up parts,and oil changing.the co-workers was great,easy to get alone with,easy going and very helpful.the hardest part of the job i would say was changing a battery of a R.V. overall i really did enjoy working here the best part was the service and dealing with different customer."
good,"All I know it was a good place to work. I like working on cars being round cars, and also like the advantage of getting the discount on parts. I would still be working at the one in Waukesha Wisconsin. I got moved to Arizona."
good,I enjoy the atmosphere it was a clean place to work and easy applications on computer to help customers culturally we were very diverse learned a lot about car parts a regular day was team meeting early in the morning breakfast corporate functions so tell BBQs
good,"As long as you did your job with a positive attitude while maintaining company policies every day was smooth. Having automotive knowledge was helpful, however training was provided."
good,"It like any other job has it good and bad, Night shift is a shift that work together we grow as a family. We believe in teamwork make the dream work. Then you also have the ones that are lazy or feel they don't have to do much to get by."
good,"A typical day entailed to work as a cashier a few hours until the orders were ready for delivery or pickup. I preferred being the delivery driver, in and out. If that didn't take all day then I would come back to help in whatever needed to be done at the store, cashier, sweeping, mopping and or stocking. My manager was easy to work with, very flexible."
good,"I work for Advanced Auto parts for almost 9 years.I start as a sales person then I movie to drive.I really a join working for them.We also put truck up.Help customers installing there wiper,battery and check there engine light.We do are best to have our customers happy and make them came back to shop with as."
good,"I loved working at Advance Auto, I love working with all of the employees, all of them were great! nice and helpful to me. I want to come back their but i can not pay rent lights water and food working there. I am single and have noone to pay my bills but me. Every thing Sam asked of me i did, he would call me in on a short notice and i would come in. I drove 45 min to come to work each day. Please if you won't awesome employees you should pay so people can afford to live. I want to come back to advance auto, but i can't even work a second job with the hours and days i worked. Come on now, it is in human to work your employees and they can't even live. I feel in order to work for Advance Auto you have to be married, or homeless, cost of living is very high so you need to at least pay your good employees 15.00 dollars and hour in order to reduce your high turn over. you spend a lot of money on training and your employees don't stay 6 months. Please call me back into your stores and give me a cost of living salary i can live in a home not on the street. The average rent in Raleigh area is 750.00 a month. Thank you so much for your time. God Bless."
good,The days tend to start out fast but slow down as the day goes on. Daily tasks are tedious but you get used to them. the managers there listen to you about your personal life and are willing to schedule you flexibly.
good,most of the employees are easy to work with and teach you how to succeed in the company. if you apply yourself you can advance in the company. only down side is the lack of a somewhat consistent schedule which can make planning things in your off time hard.
good,I loved this job but my home life was in shambles because schedual is never condistant. It's a great place to work if you have the availability to schedual your home life around it.
good,Horrible pay. No advancement. Good manager. Horrible district manager. Not enough training. High turnover rate. 30 thirty minutes for lunches. Very stressful job
good,I enjoyed working here and the manager is awesome. I got treated very well in this company and I would definitely suggest people to work here.I learned so much about car parts.I can use my knowledge to fix my own car.
good,"I came in clocked in, cleaned around the area I would be working at. I unloaded stock from the truck, I scanned and bar coded item by item, placing the sick either on the front area of the store in shells or on back stock, if a customer called needing a part I would look for it in the computer, find what shelf hey it and take to customer, also would have to return old or un used parts back to the store for a customer.i was always on the go, it made your time go by really fast, you are always doing something. I loved my role their, but I had this for f-150 and it was kinda hard going from the speed on my truck to their time cars, but I got ding  for speeding on a delivery and I should have either been paying better attention or used cruise control. It was my fault I messed that job up. I have to say from that experience, not really knowing I speed a little when I drive at all, put things in perspective for me and I now stay right on the limit allowed."
good,"training lasts for maybe a week then your on your own,  I studied all parts and how they work to provide the best outcome for my customers. I love to be able to hear my customers problems and be the one who fixes it."
good,"Great place but some store managers are those who simply use the system instead of caring for the business. This causes for those that care to over work or burn out and leave. Aside that with a caring team the company itself is great, truly care for those that truley work, those who complain are those that are the lazy who were cut or fires for being lazy."
good,Advance is a great place to work but it is not for everyone. Ex. Working quarters are very hot and humid. But it is an overall good place to work for.
good,I really enjoy working for advance its a great company.  I'm just looking to better myself and make a few extra dollars in the process.  Its a great place to work for all races and genders.  Never a dull moment and always learning something new.
good,Worked there for a number of years all it took was one employee who didn't like you to tear you career apart. Now I have to start all over again and find something new. Also the company is in a restructuring mode so advancement opportunity is very low.
good,"I love working there, learning different thing that I didn't know of, learning new skills, interacting with an wide variety of clients. You can always ask for help with putting an item on your car. like an windshield wiper, which is something that's free for all paying customers, other servicer includes, checking our battery and free of charging it just make sure that you bring it in for them, testing of starters also. They does have a great team of knowledge there. They do work well with the community, also does community functions like appreciation bbq-s . there's no  discriminations at this place, Our fields manger Jeff is such an azz, he doesn't care about our well being at all. Teaching those that looking to know and learn more knowledge in the auto field. the Compensation/Benefits are great if you can pay for them. Just an overall to the entire community is an great an awesome deal with the customers. knowing that I'm coming to work is great, it's not the safest place, but it's work. A day at was is mostly GREAT, and then it's down time that you still have to keep yourself busy and keeping count clean. Sometimes leaving when I can do more for others, knowing that they do need help"
good,"Good place to work, many opportunities for growth. The employees could be pushed to do better. There are some long hours involved quit because I relocateed."
good,"good work environment"
good,"A typical day at work offers non-stop opportunities from start to finish."
good,The company is great they are supportive of their employees. They support continuing your education. The pay is good. Hours are great. And you get to help people and meet a different people.
good,"Advance has been a wonderful company to work for for many different reasons, mostly the camaraderie and teamwork while within the workplace. My duty is to assist customers find automotive parts and answers that may be directed toward their vehicle and possible issues. On a daily basis we will usually assist at least 20 or more customers one on one a piece between my co workers and myself; it takes a lot of patience and great person to person interaction."
good,was told would get moved to better store when inventory was done and came out good and it did but the manager did not live up to his promise. and i had to go.
good,I enjoy meeting and interacting with people that come into the store. the employees work as a team. Like working with the customers and helping them to find the issue that is wrong with their car
good,"I loved working here, the money is not all that great but the staff was very friendly and helpful. The work was not all that hard just fast pace at times"
good,I love it when we are busy and always have something to do its great we did just open so it will pick up I feel if there was some sort of check list of things to do daily there would be more of a chance of staying busy
good,Fun productive environment. I learned a lot about car parts and I always had someone willing to teach me. It was a very enjoyable job.
good,Really taught me that the atmosphere of the job really depends on the make-up of the team. I learned a lot of leadership skills through this job and to take stand for what I believe in. There were many opportunities for me to actually put into action the ideas that I had for the advancement of the work environment.
good,The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to keep up with truck we would get so busy that it would be difficult to put our products on the floor we were to little staffed to do truck and front counter
good,I really did like working there and enjoyed the work environment but with the position I was in as far as pay it was maxed out and I could not move up.
good,"At advance you will move to base management easily as long as you show up for work and are not a moron. However, store management or higher is impossible unless you know all of the dl's and kiss butt."
good,I am a part time employee and this is great that they work with my school schedule the people I work with are super nice and willing to help at any moment. I don't know much about cars and being a female it's even harder but these guys are super towards me. It's hard being on my feet but love the store I work for.
good,I felt as though working with this company allows me to expand my knowledge in warehouse work with the various chutes and departments packages go through.
good,"The job isn't too demanding, which leaves room for fun and adjustments. Co-workers get along great, we are one big family. very friendly environment."
good,"Customer service, inventory, banking, hiring are all responsibilities of the job.  Responsible for planograms and daily cleaning."
good,"I am in the Mobile Parts Pro Department. I deliver parts to our local mechanics. I also assist customers in finding the right part for whatever project they may be working on.  I get along with everyone I work with and the management, they are pretty much amazing.  The hardest part of the job, is not making enough income.  The most enjoyable part, meeting new people."
good,"Good place to work, always something to do, great customers and employees to deal with, always fun and enjoyable to work my shift."
good,I was part of management so it was a little difficult because I had much more responsibility and had more work to do but it was a good company
good,"Enjoyed everything and I believe I was a great Manager, I kept everything in order and definitely fulfilled my potential"
good,"Fulfilling the customer's need is the most important part of my position at Advance Auto parts. In the process of assisting customers I've become familiar with nearly all automotive parts. The hardest part of working at Advance is the ""pay for performance"", and the opportunity of advancement."
good,Big negative they hire from outside instead of promote within
good,Being with Advance has shown me work ethics and has giving me a great experience with what customer care means. Making my goals every week and tasks that my manager requires me doing and for me to exceed myself has been very pleasant since I am very motivated in advancing myself in the automotive field. Being with Advance Auto Parts has just been a very enjoyable experience.
good,"A typical work day includes, assisting customers with finding the correct parts for their vehicles, cleaning the store, organizing and maintaining inventory. Management does a excellent job with managing time and giving out appropriate tasks to all employees as well as high expectation from each of them. I have learned that how you manage your time is very important in a fast pace working environment, needing to make sure that all your tasks are completed by the end of the day while still conducting business with the customers in the store. Co-workers are enjoyable to work with as everyone gets along well and it is a well rounded working environment."
good,This was my first job after graduated college.  I enjoyed working there.  I lost my job 3 1/2 years later along with 8 others in my department.
good,"I worked for three different stores as an assistant manager, but i got wrongfully fired and lied upon all cause of the GM Steven Ester was buddy buddy with the commercial parts pro Jeremy Call and he wanted my position, needless to say i was targeted and discriminated against by this people but as far as the company is great one to work for."
good,"I enjoy this establishment as far as job would go. They are team oriented, responsible, and fun. Advance is very creative when it comes to thinking up new ways to satisfy the customer. However, depending on your store location, the amount of sales you obtain,and overall performance of your management team, there is little room to advance your career."
good,"Worked as Sales Clerk and with the Commercial Accounts, along with Customer Service in Diagnosing Automotive related issues."
good,"On a typical day I would report to team talk for communications. After team talk I would go checkout an rf scan gun, go to my assigned equipment and perform a safety check. When my safety check is done I make sure I sign off on my safety checklist. I learned how to deal with many different personalities, how to work smart and not hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers who like for people to pickup their slack. The most enjoyable part is selection. I love selection it's an exercise. The best thing about this job was overtime!!!! Overall I loved Advance Auto Parts I just had a problem with a member of management. She was fine until she was promoted. She turned on us to get rid of the old fruit. "
good,"Wonderful work environment,learned how to take car  of my car"
good,Good place to work. Learned a lot. Ok management. Co-workers are great. Job is easy. Best part of job is moving up in the company. 
good,love it here--great location short commute great bunch of co-workers-very understanding management
good,Start leaning about Auto Parts Business. Control inventory in hub store. Attending retail and commercial customers.
good,Gotta have patients to beable to drive a bus load of students. A lot of opportunities for summer work too.
good,"Rang up customer’s auto parts took money, checks, credit cards and"
good,working with commercial accounts and growing our business together.
good,I was a driver and i learned about all the auto shops. managment was good co workers was good to work with management was good and the hardest part just learning all the pistions of the shops the most enjoyable part i got to no all the auto shopes and when i went to get my car fixed they was nice and i love'ed that they would fit me in to get my car worked on if they were booked.
good,"I picked this job because I have at least 20 years of experience in the business industry. Before working for this company I was able to supervise employees, I was involved in sales, distribution, marketing and advertising, production and much more. i really value my time at the jobs that I have been able to work with."
good,"Working for Advance wasn't the best and isn't the worst job Ive ever held."
good,"i love working in this place , giving customer an excellent customer service . have very flexible schedule . work for this company in two different town."
good,It was a good place to work team members fellow employees DIY customers made my day today great only problem I had was with the boss of my boss apparently he doesn't respect family emergency so when I had an emergency move and couldn't work there any longer you would not transfer me and said I can no longer work for the company anywhere in this us so that is the failure their part because I made them money I reach three times my weekly and monthly goals  not sure exactly why they wouldn't want to keep that within the company was a failure on their part because I made them money and
good,"Easy Going Job. Just Do your work and you will be fine. work is not hard at all, be friendly and nice to customers. Parts sell them self because people know what they need when they come in"
good,"I enjoyed being employeed with Advance Auto until the District Manager moved me from the store I worked so hard to build.  It takes time to build relationships with Commercial customers.  In building those relationships, I was very successful.  Therefore, the District Manager transferred me to underachieving stores to help build the Commercial Department.  These moves were very frustrating."
good,Liked working with employees and customers. Enjoyed the work and knowledge I learned while with the company. Definitely walked away with alot more knowledge about all types of vehicles.
good,It was ok working here! I definitely miss working for the company and I got to move up within the company fairly quickly. I was able to advance and know that my job was securee
good,"Good place to work, middle management is changing on a regular basis, so it's hard to follow procedures. Over all the more you know about the business the easier it would be."
good,A good place to work for but the pay is not that great for the things you have to do...Being a sales associate and making deliveries is not worth the pay they offer..
good,"When I started working for advanced at first I didn’t expect to get hired because I didn’t know much about cars, but the training that I got from my coworkers really helped me understand almost everything in a matter of 3 weeks. I loved workin there"
good,a good place to work and learn about cars friendly staff good parts always a pleasure working with good people and recieving the best quality parts one can get
good,Everyday consisted in delivering all auto parts to the correct auto shops and bring any cores back to the store. When there was no deliveries I had to be at front in the computer taking care of customers with their needs and if there was no customers I had to take care of the delivery of our products and put them on the shelfs.
good,Advance Auto was a great place to work. Friendly staff and management made it easier to work. Customer service was very good. Having music playing during the shift was nice to listen to as you worked. The pay was not really up to par but you an advance as you go.
good,It's been a while since I worked there so I do not recall a lot. I drove parts to other stores/shops and I loved it! It was my first job doing anything like that. The co-workers were always willing to help you when you needed it! It was very organized too.
good,job was part time and great along with an amazing store manager all though the pay lacks which is why i only recommend par time. good for high school kids interested in cars.
good,Advance Auto Parts was one of my favorite jobs I enjoyed learning new things about car parts due to my dad is a mechanic and I love learning new things about cars so Avance Auto Parts was a great experience for me
good,"Fast paced, sometimes stressful environment. Attending to the needs of customers that often did not know what they actually needed to repair their car. My automotive technical background was very helpful in attempting to solve mechanical problems for my customers."
good,"I held many hats. Driver, retail salesperson, commercial salesperson, closing manager. I think they get good people but the wage isn’t high enough to stay."
good,"The job is so easy, customers come in or call the store phone, you find out what they need and give them a price and an availability. Selling parts to people who are coming in intending to buy parts is a piece of cake, The pay is terrible, outside of management they only offer minimum wage with no real way of moving up the ladder."
good,Love to to work with different customers. Therefore i love to deal with auto parts. I grew up with mechanics in my family and to have a passion for cars.
good,"I enjoyed the company except for the sales rate that was required to keep a position. Makes for a competitive work place but we are all there for the customers, not ourselves."
good,this was one of my favorite jobs I loved working here it gives you the chance to meet new people and make new friends and I learned many new skills. I also learned many things about vehicles.
good,Fun place to work and I learned a lot. I transferred from one store to another when going to college and the transition was easy and painless and re-acclimating was not hard at all. Advance always hires good people
good,"Nice place to work, Management is knowledgeable and very flexible . Discounts for employees, training available. Pay is fair for the work performed. Team oriented."
good,The environment here is really relaxed. The people that work here are really helpful and know what they are talking about. Learn a lot when dealing with different problems with costumer’s car problems.
good,People are great and good for a part time job. It's takes time to move up but great company. The position is pretty simple they don't kill and they will teach you properly if needed to learn something new. Overall the job is a great position!
good,"Good work and culture"
good,"I loved working for AAP.  I enjoyed a great team, a great culture, and great leadership. The only reason I left was that the Bloomington office was rumored to be closed (it eventually was) and the only option was moving to Roanoke (which is a nice town, bu my family is in MN)"
good,"i only work there 1 day a week it is a very good learning experience,management is very friendly and helpful willing to work with you and help you, there  are no real hard parts of the job"
good,"A great place to work! Fun people, great customers (most of the time) and a DM that understands what we are trying to do. I liked it there and it was a tuff choice to leave."
good,management didnt work or take care of lower ranking employees always left work and never closed the store always up to lower on the ranking
good,"A very busy daily work pace, the store leave management was good, the District Manager was Former Military Officer, and attempted to run the retail store like a military standards, which really doesn't mix. As far as the workplace culture, is within the industry standards, the hardest part of the day was on Truck day, and getting all the new stock put out on the shelves and wait on customers and answer the phone calls. The most enjoyable part of my job, was when I was able to get out from the counter and delivery parts to the local repair shops."
good,Not a bad place to work for.  Just have to put in some long hours.  Upper management is what the problem is and lays.  not much help from upper management.
good,High volume sales in a competitive atmosphere. Lots of opportunity for growth in a teamwork driven company. Lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"I Loved almost everything about this job except the inexhaustible supply of paperwork involved. My co-workers were fun and often humorous. In this job, I learned as much about cars as I knew as well as developing top notch customer service skills."
good,"delivered part to auto shops in a shop truck in a timely manner learned about different parts, Did a lot of stocking and inventory"
good,I would suggest working for Advance to anyone needing work.  It's a good company to work with in the automotive industry.
good,"The upper management has change the core of the company from what the company started out as.Back in 2009 ,upper management changed the way the company was being run."
good,"Loved working here, they work hard at keeping you educated."
good,My first job. Very insightful. If your passion is cars defientley the place to start as a part time or full time.. Great First job
good,When I started at Advance Auto Parts I knew nothing about the automotive industry and now there are so many thing that I have learn due to the staff there being willing to help me and teach me how to do the job to the best of my abilities.
good,"First person in building, walk sales floor and backroom making sure is ready for business, if it was not next step would be to be documented and have a sit down with employees. Another morning task was to read prior day reports, such as sales for DIY and Commercial, returns, inventory reports, shrink , review individual team member performance and when available P&L (Profit & Loss) Report. Open and verify all registers as well as both safes, make a daily plan for team members, review all e-mails. As soon as team members start to arrive, speak with each one and communicate plan for the day. Commercial Manager and I speak for a few minutes regarding his 10X10 calls to make for the day, also make sure he and drivers are aware of sale promotions going on. Most of rest of the day take care of our Customer and Make The Day. "
good,I learned how to look up parts and find them in the store. The hardest part was that I knew nothing about cars but the great guys that I worked with were so patient with me and walked me through everything!
good,"The only thing about this store is its not together the invenory is messed up and the employees always complain and always have something bad to say, ive been there for not too long and already am looking, they gave me a full time postion and cut my hours and just gave me 4 a day hours even though im still full time. its fun to work there some days when every ones working together and happy"
good,working is very relaxing.i always find myself learning  more and more about different cars and different parts.
good,I worked here while I attended nursing school and they worked around my schooling!
good,"I delivered parts to mechanics and dealerships. I learned a lot about cars. I learned how to install batteries and replace wipers and bulbs. I also learned how to test alternator, starters and batteries.Management was bogus at times. My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part was men not wanting to talk to me because I am a woman. I met a lot of good people while delivering parts."
good,good place to work just wasnt  paying enough money wasnt working enough hours to provide for my family had to go with a company that was offering more hours and money
good,"I delivered and pick up parts, assist customers putting up stock as well as assiting managers with given duties. I learned to enjoy each co-worker work very well with them as a team. What i enjoy most bout the job is that im always pushed to my limits and succeed altho many men feel itsa mans jobs. "
good,"I was able to advance to assistant manager in training even while being a woman in a man's world. Lower management is easy and helpful, upper management is harder to deal with."
good,"Clocking in, getting store ready for the day.. getting the deposit ready and any morning paperwork done. I learned alot from this company. They are patient as long as you are willing to learn. They help when needed. Co-workers was like my family...I will keep them all dear to heart. The hardest part of the job was when someone didn't communicate something,. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the people, regulars. and of course my co workers"

good,"I loved working there! Good people, learning on the jobs, career advancements, and your always on the go. Some days are fast paced others are slow. Very productive, never have one set task. You have to be a team player."
good,Working for this company allowed me to continue working and training to become an ASE certified Parts Specialist. I greatly appreciate the mentorship that the staff and management gave during my time here. I would recommend this company to anyone who wants to work in an automotive industry and learn the skills to advance their career.
good,"There are grumpy and dissatisfied customers that come in, but they are always taken care of and the employees do their best to help the customer work through their problem. some customers come in under the impression that we are mechanics which is not the truth at all, only in some cases."
good,"Hard to advance, pay was long.. flexible schedule, easy job. You do not need any knowledge of automotive or parts to get a job in advance auto..m awesome discount program for employees."
good,"Typically a day as a retail salesperson with Advance Auto Parts consists of a mixture of fronting/facing the shelves, putting up inventory, running cash registers, and installing batteries/wiper blades. Free installations are incredibly popular at a place like this though Advance has taken some measures to assure that employees are not forced to do difficult installations in the parking lot. They also provide video training on the various automotive systems for anyone that is not already knowledgeable."
good,I liked working there because it got me out of the house and it enabled me to help with the grand kids. After retirement it gave me something special to feel goog about
good,"A typical day is very fast-paced. Whether putting away shipment, assisting customers, or delivering parts to commercial clients, it is a constantly moving environment."
good,I loved working for the Advance company in 3 different stores and 3 different positions each with its own set of skills needed. I like the fast pace of retail sales but also enjoyed the solitude of driving a delivery vehicle.
good,"Advanced Auto Parts was a good learning experience into the world of automotive, and due to the fact we had a lot of professional shops that would come in a purchase automotive parts. As time goes on you become familiar with the parts and even get a understanding about how they work and what they are used for."
good,Good pay descent benefits a little unorganized and a lot of mandatory overtime. You get a raise every 90 days the first year. Must be quick and its hot in the summer but if you stick with it the pay is worth it
good,I loved working here !!!! And would go back anytime !!!! It was a great place to work and even great customers coming in. I also enjoyed helping people find out the problems they were having and the right parts that they needed.
good,"Overall it is a good job has its ups and downs like most jobs. They work with your schedule, and the pay is decent for a sales type position or a part time driver. Overall I pretty good place to work for."
good,Great place to work. they just need to pay their employees more. for a company that boosts the biggest aftermarket auto parts retailer in north america they sure dont pay it and it reflects on their turn over
good,Being a female made it more challenging because I had to prove I knew what the customer was talking about and I was knowledgeable as well. Besides that I loved it! My co-workers and management were awesome. I was part time so I didn't get any benefits. My pay rate sucked
good,I loved working there. Really enjoyed learning all the new things I did learn when I worked there. Great customer service. The General Manager was one of the best I've ever had as well.

good,"learn as you go, no experience needed. fairly close delivery radius, hour lunch for shifts over 6 hours. some down time but always something to do, like stocking or cleaning"
good,The working environment was pretty good. The staff were easy to get along with and the management was really nice. They were very accommodating and helped me get the kind of schedule I wanted.
good,"I have been affiliated with the company for almost 20 years. They are team oriented, always there for the employees. Good training, good communication."
good,"Typical retail setting, if you work hard you can be successful.  You sometimes have to be patient to work your way up through the corporation, however if you are willing to work and sometimes move stores you can be successful.  Typical day is fast paced and you need to be somewhat mechanically inclined to be successful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people fix their vehicles."
good,"stressful day, employee fooling around, no one took responsability for there actions. no respect for other. im talking about the time i worked there. staff has change in 12 years."
good,"I loved working with Advance! got to deliver parts to commercial accounts, deal with the everyday public and educate people that just didnt know what they was doing b/c they simply didnt know."

The employees worked as a team to get things done in a timely manner and could answer any questions customers had.
good,Was a great place to work in always happy people got along with almost everyone boss' thought they were better then others so that's the bad thing but other then that it was great.

good,"We have a large team with a vast knowledge of everything automotive. with the knowledge that i obtained from this job i'm well equipped to help out customers, which is the most satisfying feeling that you can get in this job.

good,"Great place to work for. You learn your trade very quickly, but you need a good amount of automotive knowledge before hand.

good,get to see nice and learn about how they work and also learn how to repair them
good,"Sales, stocking, shipping and receiving, payroll, scheduling, safe count, overtime, customer service, and plan-o-grams. Working for this company has been a great experience though some of the upper hands could use some more training on policy. Unlawfully letting someone go is not good terms for a company as a whole. I would return to the company with no questions asked. The team I worked with was just that a team. The pay was good and the hours were hard but well worth the aches and pains after a long day. Seeing a smile on my customers face always pushed me harder and made me work wiser. I learned a great deal working here and want to thank those who believed in a young woman and her knowledge."

good,"Managers were great, but far and few in between. If you wanted to excel and move up, you could. Depending on the location you may end up having some rude individuals."
good,I would still be working there if I didn't move to another city. It was one of the best jobs I've had overall. I would definitely recommend the job to someone.
good,I love working here the company help you out a lot. They push you to be better at work. And they care about there employees. Advanced is really great place to bee.

good,"Unlike some of the stories from other locations, the store I worked at housed all car people. From the delivery drivers to the manager- we all liked the automotive industry and were good at what we did."
good,"The bosses aren't the best at what they do, but overall it is a great company to work for! You get a discount on parts for your own vehicle and the only part that sucks is if you work nights there usually is only 2 people on."
good,"This place is cool for college kids and older baby boomers. And lower level living expenses. You learn about cars too."
good,A typical day at work was very fast pace. I liked my job because it kept me busy and if you know me I like fast pace work. Management was really good at understanding and being fair. The hardest part of the job was when associates didn't come to work.
good,I had a wonderful time at advanced auto Parts. I wish I could have made the income worthy of the job. If I could get that I would be back there in a minute. The benefit package needs to available all year long not just a tiny window annually.
good,"I retired from Millercoors, wanted work to keep busy until I receive my retirement age. Millercoors continues to carry my medical insurance until 65.

good,"Overall the company was a great company to work for if you wasn't a manager. They tend to expect too much out the managers and not compensate them. For example, there was several weeks that I would work with no days off and it being a 15 hour days and fully understood that was part of the job requirements and was not trouble by that factor, the thing is that I had to cut some hours back at my store and in doing so this caused me to have to fill the slots and the company would not allow me to hire anyone else to fill the slot."
good,"I enjoyed working in the automobile industry and learning more and more about all vehicles. I already knew how to work on cars, but i learned more working at advance auto."
good,It was my first auto related job out of college . i worked what ever hours offered . pay was minimum but not bad for starting out. People were friendly manager at the time was a all around good guy .
good,"Welcome to retail, default auto statement about anything that happens on any given retail day. GM's work 50 hours a week minimum, they have zero control over hours dropped to distribute to the teams."
good,Great place to work and a great environment. Very flexible with your availability and willing to work around your personal issues. Manager is very informative about job description and to better your self in auto parts sales and service.
good,Fun place to work.Everyday is different. New challenges everyday. Great people to work with. Great place to not only learn but help those in need at the same time.
good,"Work with a great staff, knowledgeable people.  However low pay for the work done.  Duties include delivering parts and assisting retail with customer support."
good,Being a girl who knew only a small amount about cars I left knowing way more about cars and was confident enough to use what I had learned to fix my own to family’s cars.
good,advance is a very nice place to work but they need to train some of there mangers  how to handle   things and not to target  people  excellent benefits   paid vacation paid holidays  very clean
good,"> Good place to work"
good,"Always had plenty to do there, I had opportunity to advance but with working at Wakefield I was making more/better money at the time. Management was great and so were some of the associates."
good,"Started as a Manager Trainee. took the 5th worst store in the Company to profitability in 9 Months.  Promoted to Manage / General Manager, opened brand new store in Bridgewater, MA  Transferred to a higher volume store, fifty miles away from home, ended up leaving due to this."
good,Very hands on with customers in helping them find the right parts for their vehicles.  Was fulfilling to assist them.  Also enjoyed delivering parts to other stores.
good,Caring Team Members and management that work together.  Fun atmosphere.   Good changes.  Most everyone treats each other with respect and has fun place to work
good,"Allowed to manage store using your personality , and company guidelines."
good,This is a great company to work for I have learned a lot since I start there. Very helpful when serving customers. The commercial side of Advance really goes above and beyond to help mechanics find what they need at the lowest price.
good,"This empIoyer really supports all of its team members. I enjoy working for this company, the pay is good and the benefits are descent however, I don't like this location."
good,"Employees at Advanced Auto Parts are responsible for keeping the store clean and organized, stocking shelves, etc. However, everything else is second to customer care. The phone should be answered within two rings and whenever someone walks in the doors, employees are instructed to stop everything else, unless waiting on another customer, and, at least, greet the customer. "
good,If you know car parts and can use a computer and numeric storage systems it will be an easy job. You have to know how to deal with people. and do basic car repairs.
good,"Great environment. I loved to help people. I had a chance to work with auto parts all day. Even if I had a bad day coming into work, I would leave work feeling accomplished."
good,"At advance the best thing was always learning. Be it from coworkers or customers, you learned new things everyday. Management was always typically easygoing."
good,"For me working here was great i was working with a great team had a great GM, the work load is fair depending on how many parts that need to be delivered"
good,"Great work environment, great management team, customers are local and recurring. Could use a more competitive pay scale for part-time help, but overall full time employees seem happy"
good,"Good place to work, energetic and fast paced. Fellow employees are fun to work with and it is a team effort. Only downfall is raises are slim to none and advancement isn't always available."
good,The experience was great all the people around me were great! I also really liked doing all the store's inventory. The responsibility was something I liked. For me the more the merrier! Then when I was made assistant manager in training and inventory specialist the challenge was great and I embraced it.
good,"Management was decent, like any other job there are good and bad people.Coworkers were outstanding everyone did there job above standard, it really helps to have a well balanced culture of team members. Everyone was like family and that really says something."
good,advance auto is a ok work place. the employee discount is about the best this the job offer the pay is horrible for what you have to go threw. you have to deal with irate customer the most enjoyable part of the job is when your clocking out to go home for the day.
good,I enjoy very much working at Advance auto parts. I have grown very close to my team and managers. I have worked in three locatons for Advance Auto Parts and loved the Company more and more.
good,"A basic day at work consistedof customers needing there battery checked or tested,checking engine light diagnostics, custodian work. the hardest part of the job was going in the rain trying to change a battery.i really enjoyed helping the customers find the car part they needed and conversing with them."
good,"Challenging, rewarding, and learning work environment. I have great co workers. Very calm environment. But you have to have a pretty good understanding of car parts and how they all working together. you dont have to diagnose cars but customers do expect you to give them answers."
good,"great benefits and insurance "
good,It is a good job if your into cars and enjoy helping customers with their problems. Low pay and hours being cut is only downside.
good,"I have been with Advance for over 3 years now.  I love the environment and all of my co-workers.  I have developed wonderful business relationships and know most of the store's customers by name.  I love the great atmosphere and being able to work with customers on a one on one basis.  The hardest part of my job is the extremely fast paced environment however, multi-tasking is one of my strong points. The most enjoyable part of my job is having fun with my co-workers and taking care of the customers."
good,"Flexible schedule, great co workers.  Only complaint is that inventory shipments sometimes come in damaged.  Moved up in company quickly, good room for growth."
good,I liked working for this company. I moved away from the area and had to quit my position. It was a busy store. Lots of good employees.
good,I was a commercial parts pro and liked all the tasks for my job and not having to deal with the general public anymore. I got to handle the commercial accounts
good,I enjoyed working for Advance Auto. It was a fun and busy environment. Be prepared for a fast pace job if you apply. I would recommend it.
good,My day starts off with a budget or sales meeting to let my team know the goals for the day. If anyone has something to add i listen. I alway want them to greet each customer with a smile and enjoy what we are here for and that to make every one want to make a return visit. I enjoy meeting people every day and making them happy.
good,I came to work with a smile on my face everyday.  I loved this job people would come in with car problems and it made me happy to know that I could help them with that.
good,Company is great to work for. Moving up in the company is quite hard. They prefer to hire outside in.There is also a high turn over rating at advance.
good,Great company to work for company is growing fast and big lots of oppertunity to grow company promotes within. Depending on store loacation typical work day can range from slow pace to very fast pace co workers are good the hardest part is learning to balance work and normal life
good,"Working at Advance Auto Parts was a blast, I was not really in the store that much because I was mostly delivering parts to commercial shops. I remember this one shop I went to everyday. This head mechanic always looked so serious but had humor when you got to know him. It might of been dry humor but it was humor. The co-workers were great to be around and would help if need be."
good,"Advance Auto Parts is can be enjoyable with the right atmosphere.  My personal experience would be challenging but rewarding.  every day brings a new challenge, and you do not always beat those challenges, but when you do it is very rewarding. Managing the store i met a lot of interesting people.  team members, customers, and upper management.  overall the good out weighs the bad."
good,"Advance Auto Parts was one of the best places I work for, this place was a real friendly place to work at no type of coworker dislike and hours were amazing."
good,"We work hard but we have fun while we are doing it.  The people are nice and you meet new people all the time.  The hardest part about the job is lifting the heavy products...but, just ask for help!"
good,New management good things coming. Speed perks program is saving people money every day. The days can be long but great customer interaction
good,"Strong management support and positive co workers. Politics got in the way at times, but overall a great place to work!."
good,Great Company. Great Company to make a start. Was promoted through the ranks. Very Team oriented company. Very eager to extend my future in sales.

good,Great One on One Training very nice atmosphere every body is very knowledgeable and makes feel at home even though your in a office setting.
good,"Advance is a very good company to work for over all. I love being able to interact with customers on a daily basis and be around car parts. I receive a high level of satisfaction from helping customers find the correct parts for their vehicles. Most days we are very busy which is something I love since I believe I thrive in a fast paced work environment. Management seems to have some troubles getting state to state transfers done though, which can be frustrating."
good,I love working here because of my passion for helping others and besides the fact i love my supervisors and co-workers they are like family.
good,great place to work friendly employees and management. I learned a lot about the automotive industry. I created a variety of connections with customers and employees
good,"I would consider my immediate supervisor one of the best leaders I have ever worked for. I learned quite a bit under his guidance. Advancement with AAP, I would not consider to be the best. "
good,Advanced auto part taught me alot within the time i worked learning how to deal with different types of tools and helping customers solve different problems was the most exciting part about my job .
good,"This was a great place to work, i greatly enjoyed my co-workers and the customers i interacted with on a daily basis. The environment was always friendly and inviting, and the people I worked with always tried to do there best to make sure customers were happy with our products and our services."
good,The best part was helping people save money and show them how to do it yourself.  This help build my client base and my customers knew that I would sale them the part the needed.

good,"typical day includes answering phones, waiting on customers, and putting away any new shipments that come in."

good,"a typical day at advance was a great experience where customers always have a question as to what and why and how do certain parts function, the managment was great and very understanding with employees and great interaction with customers"
good,"Would change oil, tires and repair other issues with vehciles"
good,i loved working here only downfall is the lack of ability to more up in this company
good,"When I first started At Advance Auto Parts I  didnt know much about cars. It was like a new language to me hard to learn.After being there for a whole week I felt like I was working for a month. I learned how to change wiper blades a battery , suspension parts names, working a computer a little more better. I also became a more active person working here everyone was friendly they made me feel as if it was another home. I was a driver so the day went by pretty fast . Also it never was boring to me cause i always kept myself busy.Though I might say at the beginning i was scared not knowing what customers were askling for ,but i would bug everyone until I got the part right.I built good customer service here, I miss my everyday customers they were friendly. Sometimes we had angry customers and at the end it was a matter of staying calm until the customer realizes theyre arguing with a worker that is innocent. I recommend working here its a fun enviroment and you learn alot of productive stuff. It was very organized."
good,"Great place to work, great managers employees and team member. i would recomend working here to anyone in the roanoke valley"
good,"1. their was some long hot days at times we were short handed but the job was always done."
good,Hard working environment with competitive programs. Learned communication skills and up-selling talents.
good,"I learn a lot about automobiles and how to deal with difficult customers (males generally don't like to purchase car parts from a female). It's slow/steady pace is easy to adjust to. I have 2 salespeople under me, and I close the store on most nights, rarely ever opening. The hardest part is to keep everyone satisfied...there are lots of nicknames for certain tools and parts that I am unaware of; therefore, I may try to sell the wrong part sometimes. I am still learning."
good,you sell parts to a lot of culturally diverse people you get to learn more than what you did before getting the job. you sit there and try to understand the people talking to you and help them decide which part that they need and you rec.ommend stuff that they would need in order to help finish the job
good,They have the best managment you could possibly want to work for. If I am able to relocate and stay within the company that will be great!
good,Advance was a good oportinty to learn. They did a good job of teaching and growing their people. They did have a few people in upper management who seemed to throw their weight around though.
good,"A typical day at advance auto parts is a good experience and a chance to learn something new all the time. On a regular basis, team members learn more and more about vehicles from the customers and management. The co-workers at advance auto parts are friendly and team oriented. The hardest part of the job is keeping every customer completely satisfied during rushes. Customers don't like waiting in line or on the phone and it can be overwhelming trying to satisfy everyone all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you did the best you could to help someone in need and seeing that customer satisfied."
good,Good job if retail is your thing.
good,have tought me not to trust everybody you work with. On the other hand love their company
good,I enjoyed going to work each and every day. The customers were a joy to see and my co-workers were amazing people. It was a sad day when I left.
good,"An ever changing learning environment, fostering interpersonal interaction, stressing safety, knowledge, and customer service. Variable tasks and willing management make it a wonderful place to work"
good,Good hours pay and coworkers. My managers are very understanding and caring. Very happy working here. Great benefits. 401k health insurance vision dental vacation and sick time available.
good,I was retired and hired on as a Part-Time parts delivery driver in their commercial department at minimum wage which was satisfactory for me.  The only negative I would say is that they transferred store managers in and out often.  While I was employed I worked in the same store for 5 different managers (1 manager two different times.)  It's good company with a solid business plan.
good,The job is simple and customer service based. You will have your good customer and bad as with any related job. The company has a lot of room for advancement and is a joy to work for as long as you enjoy your fellow employees.
good,Can't wait to move to the next bigger and better things hopefully working with the manger at 13 and ryan I can better myself to become a manger further down the line
good,"A typical day includes many meetings, conversations with team members and collaboration on upcoming projects. The hardest part of the job is when team members refuse to share the workload. I enjoy working with the developers, stakeholders and Management team; helping them gather requirements to provide a quality product for the Business."
good,"In the beginning it was stressful because I was unfamiliar with automobile parts and accessories.  Management , online courses and coworkers really helped out a lot. Customers were also very understanding. After all I enjoyed my work"

good,A stranger came among us with the determination to shut down the department I worked in at that time. We were a great team and a family.  I would have stay with Advance Auto until retirement.
good,Loved the job. I worked in the  bastrop Louisiana one when it opened. Great employees as well as the job just didnt get paid very much. Got 40 hrs a week but no overtime. But that being said if I could and they paid better I go back
good,A nice place to work at.  You will become very knowledgeable regarding car knowledge. Pay could be better. Clean enviorment. flexable hours. You will learn to install batteries and windshield wipers.
good,"A typical day would consist of assisting customers with car appliance needs. We would answer phone calls, change out batteries, empty freight (new merch), clean the store"
good,If you need work life balance this is the place to go.  The Manager of this store is very understanding and very assisting in diagnostics to all customers. Only downside to working here are the attitudes of some customers.
good,a typical day at work was like any other day I go to our moring meeting an our manger do ill over all performance for the team an then we work get our work que qn then we would do our stretches exerises for 10 mins then we go to work.
good,Somedays were busy and some were slow. I learned how many job situations you could be in .I believe the hardest part was dealing with customers who didn't want to give you significant time to help them out. the best part was seeing smiles on customers faces .
good,A typical day would include checking your orders picking your parts delivering parts to correct locations handling money maintaining vehicle and cashiering and stocking.
good,This was my absolute favorite job ever. I left on good terms and would love to go back. You learn so much about cars and truck and so many other things.
good,"I have made some of my closest friends working here, it fun fast paced and an all around fun place to work! Most every employee is dedicated and hard working"
good,"My typical day at work starts off with doing face front in moment i walk into the store until I clocked in for the day, In 10 months myself and team members look out for one another and assist in training when asked. I have learned so much daily while assisting costumer with their search for car parts. I have become more knowledgeable with various car diagnosis and I can help myself with my own vehicle."
good,In four years i went from an order picker to the department clerk. Some of the managers in there actually give you a chance to move up in the department. It was a true learning experience. I left there with some life changing lessons.
good,"when working with parts, you really get to know everything and with the love of helping people, it feels good to get what they need and if you can't you are on a mission to getting them their items"
good,"AAP was a fun place to work, they had events with games and food often, co-workers are friendly, environment was relaxed, but very high call volume and limited breaks made it stressful. Pay rate was great, weekly pay for contractors I really enjoyed that. All around great place to work."
good,Slow pace when it comes to deal with customers who are not acknowledged in vehicles or even know what vehicle they're driving Fast Pace stock day where reorganized and restock the shelves
good,I really enjoy my job and my co-workers. I have learned a lot and i am able to apply what i have learned to my personal live as well as educating others.
good,Loved working here and helping people and learning about cars and car parts. Boss was decent people were awesome. Wish i could work there again but not enough pay to support family
good,A typical work day was planned around the customers and peak times of business. I learned a lot about automobiles and the fast pace changes that take place every year with technology and vehicles. The hardest part of the job was the long hours in a management position. The most enjoyable part was working with a team that flowed well together.
good,"manager is very easy going "
good,"Opened at 7am with commercial business cranking,once the store opened at 8 the fun began.  The list of duties was put out and the team began knocking out the list which consisted of cycle counts, back stock,  outs, stocking, taking care of the customers. We all installed batteries and wiper blades for the customers"
good,Good nice people's don't min helping people's out with there work if anyone need help fun people's to be around we have big potluck everybody bring food we all just have a good time like a family
good,"I’ve enjoyed the people who work for AAP at all of the different locations I’ve worked for, they made going to work fun, and the customers are fun to deal with as well."
good,A steady workplace with lots of knowledge in the Car Parts industry has a solid foundation of what the customer needs in repair or ordinary supplies for your any vehicle and helps in any parts available online or what they have at other stores a solid company to work for.
good,"Great place to with people who are knowledgeable it their craft. Atypical day is involved with interacting with customers with helping them find the right parts they need for the vehicles they are working on. they management is very helpful in working with employees to find the car part if they have questions. the hardest part about the job is keeping up with the evolving technology that is changing the way vehicles work, that in turn is also the most enjoyable part of the job too."
good,"Advance was something different and interesting since I like cars."
good,"Worked for them for about 9 months. They were a decent company to work for, good co- workers. Boss was a great teacher.He was very intelliegent person."
good,"I made deliveries to the commercial customers when they called, I picked up any wrong parts that were delivered, and made good relationships with the customers that I delivered to."
good,Great part time job and my manager was one of the best I have ever had. He was extremely fair and great to work for. The company lacked the ability to pay me a fair wage for what I was worth.
good,"I have to say that they really believe in giving you room to grow.  The opportunity is there but most of the time it requires relocation, which wasn't an option for me at the time."
good,I loved delivering parts at Advance and getting to know all the customers as well as the great people I worked with. It was just part time and I needed full time doing something that paid better.
good,"Lots of customer walkin's DIY customers are the best and I can say I enjoyed that part, pain in the rear ( can't say the A__ word ha ha ha system flagged it )  commercial accounts many don't pay and are cut throat drunks. You have to always be polite to these un educated HS dropouts and thugs, but walk in customers usually awesome."
good,"Advance Auto Parts was a great company to work for. The Store manager and District Manager developed a great relationship with their workers, along with several other workers from other store. They made you feel appreciated. The pay and hours could've been better, but the store performance wasn't where it needed to be."
good,the people who work there are helpful to the new people who are hired. they are very knowledgeable and respectful. they can be competitive for accounts that are with the company for big sales.

good,"A good place to work, busy all day, never boring."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and productive with knew information on vehicles being introduced every single day. Management is very cooperative and has introduced me to quite a number of benefits while being a parts professional. My coworkers and I have fun at work, making it a fun and productive place as we try and keep everything balanced. Our motto is work smarter not harder. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who don't understand what they have been told and think that they are above the system when in truth they are not. Keeping up a pleasant attitude while dealing with such customers is hard as they are stubborn. The most enjoyable part of my job is bonding with customers and making sure everything is to their satisfaction."
good,"There were 100 to 200 customers daily which required professinal experance about cars, and the ability to gain the customer trust by saleing them the right part the first time, so good customer sometimes are not a given so there were many meeting before the store open and guidline for the employees to follow."
good,sales to diy and commercial customer. enjoy the interactions. working conditions great. manager willing to work with employees. company benifits are good.
good,I worked first shift and typically we have to make sure we get our job done so that the second and third shift so not have a hinderance in their work process. I learned to work together as a team and as one unit to achieve an overall goal. The hardest part of the job would have been when there are missing products that were supped to have been sent in from the other warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know how much better we are doing than expected goals and from other warehouses in the area.
good,Typical day starts off with unloading truck and putting up DIY and hard parts. If you are a driver you have to go out and inspect your vehicle from your checkoff list after that you help with side duties or register until you get a delivery or pick up call.
good,Good place to work at all the guys are very cool to work for and are very easy to get along with and are very cooperative. They will work around everything to help anyone out.
good,"My manager was great and the work was fun. The people I worked with were awesome as well, but it didn't pay enough sadly. It seems like every time you find a job you love, it doesn't pay enough to survive working there."

good,This Company is a great place to work especially if one wishes to advance in the company. I have been employed with Advance for some time now and they are a very flexible company in which allows for personal growth as well as company growth.
good,You know honestly I can't tell you a single thing wrong with when I worked for the company. I rather enjoyed driving around town to deliver parts to the various business's. The store manager was very flexible and worked with you through harsh times.
good,I loved my boss and my co-workers very much. Overall great place to work and they do know how to take care of there employees. They provided us with a vehicle and a gas card so we didn't have to use the money out of our pockets.

good,"A typical day at Advance Auto Parts would be clocking in and checking the task board. Once I've checked what my task is for the day, I began to complete the task. Working at Advance I have learned to better my communication skills with customers. "
good,"I've only been at Advance Auto Parts for a little over 3 months but I love it. It's a nice work environment and a place with great teamwork. Our GM is always helping us to do better with the work we do and lets us know where we need to improve. I like having a sales goal each day to work towards and enjoy being a driver now as well. I've learned about vehicles work and enjoy the training program that they have to help me learn more about vehicles whenever I do more training. The hardest part of my job, however, is the when I have a lack in knowledge and am trying to help a customer find the right part that he/she needs but all of my fellow employees and managers help me whenever I get stuck on something."
good,"Great place to work and your knowledge of cars will grew , days go by fast long as you are working, management is great and are a big help willinng to teach you everything they know, co workers are a major help as well, hardest part of job is learning the computer system, and I most enjoy is being able to detect a problem that I didnt have knowledge of before."

good,Time for tasks in between customers. Solving inventories with diligent counts. Better part availability and service to the customers for DIY and DIFM.
good,"great management to work for, fun, fast paced friendly environment."
good,Get satisfaction from helping commercial and walk-in customers.  Drive to commercial customers locations; deliver and generally come straight back to the store.  It's all in what you're getting from the job not necessarily what the company gives you.  My store manager has given me the schedule that works for me so I'm satisfied since I'm semi-retired and work on other ventures.  I've learned a lot more about car parts after working here.
good,Company allowed you the freedom to do whatever was necessary to build your business.  My DM and Regional VP were extremely supportive of all goals I set to increase sales.
good,I enjoyed working here as there was something new to do everyday and something new to learn. The management staff was top notch and I was always busy which I like to be.

good,"Busy days full of work and challenges "

good,I handled phone calls and walk in customers to assist with finding the part or parts they needed. I delivered parts to commercial customers.
good,i really enjoyed working at advance auto parts. The manager of my shift had poor managment skills she showed favoritism.  the hardest part of this jon is staying humble. the enjoyable part of this job was having fun coworkers to help you get through the day.
good,"Hardest part of the job is that many customers expect you to know everything there is about a vehicle. Other than that, a rather nice place to work."
good,The most enjoyable part about working at advance is that you get to work with costumers trouble shoot probable causes. The management works with you to insure that you get proper training and if at any time your unfamiliar about a certain product they take the time to explain to it to the costumer as well as the employee.
good,I had a great team working for advance auto and the management were awesome. I put the time in and they always recognized hard working employees and never did me wrong at all.

You had to look up parts for customers on the computer, and sometimes had to check batteries for the customers and change their  windshield wipers. I enjoyed the people I worked for. I didn't like the fact I only got 20 hours a week, and by the end of the month they let me go cause of lack of work."
good,"the hardest part of my job was leaving my job behind and not being able to be promoted within my store, i truly enjoyed working with everyone.  I truly enjoyed my job."

I learn a lot about cars and satifying my customers,and business itself. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help the customer cause We might not have the part instock, or We don't carry it and they need it now. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing that smile on the customer face when they come back the second time. and making comp."
good,"Operating cash register, answering phone and assist customers to locate the parts they want. Unloading shipments and putting all items in backstock. Stocking front shelves and batteries. Manager was excellent and treated employees very well. Best part of job was talking with regulars and helping find the right parts. The hardest part of the job was physically placing heavy parts on shelves, stocking brake rotors and batteries."

The general manager was pleasantly surprised when I asked him to show me the proper use of the battery/charging system testing machine on a car belonging to a customer for whom English was a second language.

Huge focus on growing sales and driving metrics

Training was good but on delivery employees could use a little more. It didnt take but about a day or two literally though for me to catch on. It was easy for me to learn and pick up really quick.
good,good place overall to work somethings could be handled differently but good place sell your parts and everything is ok i liked it i worked there for three years
good,Advance Auto Parts taught me all the basic things about cars. It showed me how to diagnose them and lets me know when there's a problem what exactly to do to fix them.
good,"A typical day of work includes the delivery of auto parts to commercial customers,conducting of cash/credit transactions to regular customers, and the installation of batteries and diagnosing DTC codes. I have learned new routes, a brand new parts system, the commercial side of the operation, and improved my customer service skills. Management is open-door, and very approachable; the workplace culture is easy because of this. The difficult part of the job is handling multiple calls while on the road with commercial customers; multitasking is a must. The enjoyable part of the job is solving my customer's problem, whether it be with a commercial order, or diagnosing a problem with a customer's vehicle."

My store's management has been great and they work with you, i.e. if you need a day off or if you have any troubles. Our customers are great, haven't had really any bad customers."
good,A typical day at work could be laid back or stressful. It was all in how you took it. My co workers were great. The life work balance was a little tough but manageable. The hardest part was trying to get the batteries installed in bad weather it was tough but we made it work! It is over all a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed all my co-workers and got along very well with them.  I also enjoyed all my commercial account customers and got to know them well.  I still keep in contact with them because it was an enjoyable job. A typical day for me was making sure my commercial customers were aware of any new products we had and that their orders were filled and delivered at the time promised, due to this being one of the biggest needs that a garage has.  I maintained the stock room and planograms, promotions, and training new employees.  I owned a garage previously to this job, which was why I took the position.  I closed my garage due to my divorce.  But used the experience I knew to help my commercial customers to the best of my knowledge.  Management was fair in all aspects and helpful when needed.  I learned a new Point of Sale system while there that was very helpful to me.  And I loved the customers, because most of them were repeat customers and it was almost like family."
good,One of the best companies I could ever work for. Very consistent with standard working schedule. You know when work. A typical day of hard labor but also exhausting.  Loved the experience

I enjoyed this job because I love working with the public. I was promoted from salesperson to manager within my first month. I worked extraordinarily hard for this promotion. The hardest part of the job was persuading people to buy the better product. I enjoyed it the most because it was occasionally a challenge that I could overcome"
good,"I really like working here, I was one of the Assistant Managers and work flexible hours. I would either have of open or close the store. we had two day off a week and would not find out what they were until the schedule was post on Sunday unless you ask for that day off. The people I worked with was great and I really did not want to leave; meeting all the customers and doing the logistics for the in processing and returning parts was good. It was a great job while meeting new people and helping then with their vehicle needs."
good,Your work is evaluated fairly and advancement is there for those that want it. Good perks and a great car culture to learn from.
good,"The staff and everyone there was very helpful with my development, I've learned a lot and am glad to have had a chance to learn something new, and was pleased that my hard work was rewarded with a promotion, if there were Advanced Auto Parts on the west coast I would of transferred."
good,"I barely knew how to change a car battery when I started. When I left, and I only left to accept a job overseas, I was able to completely rebuild my Camaro. The management team was great. Awesome supervisors and mentors. I sold car parts, but I learned to diagnose problems, figure out which part was best, and you'd be surprised how changing someone's wipers in the rain can make their day. My co-workers were fun. We cut up and had a good time and still got the job done."

The only thing is that we have certain co-workers that get away with alot of things not doing anything but messing with there cell phones i have spoke to my manager and never did nothing about. I feel like it was not fair to the other co-workers. the hardest part is when you bust your self at work and never get notice. The most enjoyable part is when i sit back and see the work that i accomplished."
good,"Arrive about 6:30am process daily paperwork, Plan the days work load. Open the store at 7:30am Accomplish daily tasks between waiting on customers and answering the phones. Maintain balance of waiting on customers in the store and the ones calling on the phone.

I knew nothing about the automotive industry.With the help of Advance's great training program, I have learned more than most. Over the years, I have been through a couple horrible and great managers. Advance is great about giving people chances and getting rid of people who don't want to be part of a winning culture. I have been in my position a little over a year now and even though it might get tough, I would not change it for the world. My team is like family and we all treat each other as such. Half of my team has at least 10 years or more tenure. The only reason I could see anyone not loving this company is if they don't care for people and or they just don't like working. I get some customers are ugly at times but all we can do is try to help. There are bad customers everywhere you go. You just have to chose which industry you would like to serve them in. Some of my staff came from AutoZone and O'Reilly's, and I can tell you in this industry, Advance Auto Parts is the place to be! Fast and Friendly! This company is so wonderful, my husband wants to join our team! (True Story) Customer Service is our best part!"

good,really enjoy working with people and working with my hands and on cars. I'm a people person and I never meet a stranger. so working with the public is a very good place for me to be. the hardest part of the job is when you really have no clue about what the customer is talking about and being a female in a male dominated world
good,"Great place to work the was very rewarding "
good,"I loved working with Advance,  when I started with the company there was not but a few women working for the company and now they are more than I can count.
