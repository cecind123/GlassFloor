rating,review
bad,Was there 9 months before I had been told what my job expectations even were. Manager canceled every single 1x1 meeting we were supposed to have except for the one where I was fired.
bad,No help from management. I had 7 managers within my first 6 months of working there. I slipped through the cracks and received no help and little training.
bad,"was miss treated and not taken care of. I was not taken seriously, nor did they listen to any of my suggestions. I dealt with multiple issues while working for them"
bad,Did not like. No support from corporate.  Nothing was as promised.  Things/policy changed after I started and it applied to me. Not employee friendly at all.
bad,"I no longer work there. Management stinks. They leave you hanging out to dry."
bad,"At least in the IT space, the leadership was very poor and very confused.  Last boss consistently screwed up and then sacrificed her subordinates to save face.  Most of the middle management didn't have a clue, which contributed to a lot of very hard work for minimal value."
bad,"This company should be outlawed. They are a pump and dump everyone into expensive variable annuities. No market training at all. You pay them for everything. They want you to beg, borrow, steal from your friends and family into variable annuities and life insurance."
bad,They appear to be *Christian* but allow age discrimination on several levels.  Not Christian to their employees.  But back is still bleeding from the stab wounds.
bad,I want to change how I help people and decided I did not  want to be in sales anylonger.
bad,"A faith based company that is NOT what they say they are. The company should be different. They are not different, they are the same. This is disingenuous."
bad,"worked 27 years for Aid Association for Lutherans and Thrivent Financial,  AAL was a special organization only disadvantage was commision sales but paid least in industry upfront with best trailers.  Not long after the merger to create Thrivent change in compensation was made to pay more of front and less trailers eventually getting ride of residuals altogether.  Should have left then.  Finally changed compensation geared towards top producers and multiple agent offices and cut my territory from 1400 to less than 400 clients by time I retired from them"
bad,"The mission is to ""help Christians be wise with money so they can live and give generously."" Sounds exciting, right?!?!  Then they say they do ""comprehensive planning.""  In actuality, Thrivent is just as shrewd of an insurance company as any other.  The company is incredibly focused on ""putting"" people in annuities and permanent insurance products.  This should be illegal... Finally, you will be selling these products to your friends and family.  When you run out of friends and family to sell to, then you will be in the awkward position of knowing you burned your relationships to sell some crumby insurance products.  Your day to day is cold calling people to sell them insurance under the guise of Christianity.  None of the staff is active in a  church community."
bad,Brooksource promises you the world but doesn't produce much of anything except a bunch of lies. Stay away from Brooksource if you want to get into consulting there are plenty of other companies that are much better.
bad,"Non-retaliation policy exists but is not executed.  HR does not help when there is a management problem.  Loved the job, passive aggressive mentality."
bad,"Such a joke  Preach Christianity culture and doing the right thing.  Does just the opposite.  Change direction and compensation almost daily.  Horrible leadership, also changes daily.  No wonder they've had zero growth and have been shrinking for years."
bad,In a major reduction mode “eliminating” positions right and left. The moral is at an all time low. Working here is depressing and there is zero leadership.
bad,"Working for Thrivent is VERY competitive and not the good kind.  You study for your exams and dream of the unlimited possibilities of endless earning potential.  They send you to their home office for a week of nonstop training from breakfast to bedtime.  They teach you NOTHING about giving financial advice.  You heard that right, nothing,  The week of training is all sales training.  Practicing scripts.  You have to figure out the advice part on your own (IE: giving half of your sales to whoever sits in the meeting with you, even though you're brand new and need the money to start your business.  See how this starts?), and it is complicated when they push you to only sell Thrivent products.  They have sales goals and put you up against everybody in your RFO(your region) and email everyone your sales numbers out in a huge Excel spreadsheet every week so that you can compare how you're doing to everyone else and feel terrible that so many people are doing better than you.  "
bad,I reported my boss for dishonest dealing. He told me he didn't have clients they were employees and their job was to pay for both his houses and his yacht. I later found out I was the 3rd person that had worked in his office that had documented and exposed his dishonest dealings. They waited 6 months and then let me go. What a great Christian organization.
bad,The experience I have gained is immeasurable however the treatment I received while at the company left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Depending on the temp agency your pay could be outrageous.
bad,"Thrivent Financial has new senior leadership this year, and this year is a year of downsizing. Now is not a good time to be looking to join Thrivent Financial organization."
bad,"Micro managed, do not take feedback from from the front line on changes needed or made, set unobtainable standards without proper training, critiqued and criticized with no suggestions for improvement."
bad,"Thrivent is a decent place to work when it comes to work/life balance.  However, for anyone aspiring to a better career, put those aspirations aside.  There is zero upwards progression as change is feared.  Additionally, current managers who are doing their job poorly and sometimes create a hostile work environment, are allowed to stay in their position because the company is resistant to change."
bad,The hardest part of the job was prospecting for new clients. They wanted you to be always-on and always trying to sell even when just hanging out with friends and that made for an extremely stressful work environment and hardly any work/life balance. Would not recommend if you have a family that you want to spend time with.
bad,"Micro Management by manager nobody trusted.  Manager could take away your job, all clients and income based on how he felt that day.  16 years of work gone in a flash by micro managing general agent.  Claimed to be a Christian company with morals, but they did not treat employees with the same Christian attitude. Numerous Reps take advantage of the Christian trust and then put clients in the highest commission products for the Representatives pocket ignoring the clients needs.  Several representatives were discovered to be stealing from clients which the company covered up and did not hold them responsible to avoid damage of the reputation of the ""Christian company"", and they went on to work with other companies after termination with nothing on their file to prevent them from working in the industry.  They then would put on the NASD and Insurance reporting false information to avoid investigation by the regulatory agency.  You cannot trust this company as an employee or as a client."
bad,This was a disappointing employer as I felt I was not properly informed about the role or the compensation structure in the interview process.  My role was straight commissions which is challenging and I did not like it at all.  I would have liked to have the opportunity for benefits and retirement savings.  The people at Thrivent were very kind and thoughtful and the culture was friendly.
bad,Moral is very low due to a lack of transparency from management. Jobs are often eliminated and reasons are unclear.  Job performance doesn’t seem to factor in to reorg decisions.
bad,Having worked there for a number of years have seen a lot of talent go out the door.  Opportunities for promotion are very rare and with the structure of most depts there is just nowhere to go but laterally.
bad,Setting appointments for investors and clients. I learned how to use a computer better and acquire better telecommunication skills. Management wasn't the best but they were there when I needed help.
bad,"A typical workday can vary depending on your title but as a Registered Representative you will need to work long days and hours in the beginning or you will not be able to meet quotas. Management can be inexperienced and too distant to know how to help you best serve your clients. Also, for the Wealth Management side, there is little help as most of the management has been selling only insurance for years and are unable to meet the clients specific needs with the best products designed for each individual portfolio. The only advantage would be for a Christian insurance rep, or in special situations a Christian in whom is a new rep just needing to get licensed, to onboard with an official Christian company. The overall company still tries to abide by Christian principles but probably not as organized with the culture they want to see and the reality truly seen within the management and reps."
bad,"Thrivent's objective is to expand their number of clients.  The approach had been to try to motivate their sales force through incentives, and when that wasn't working out well enough they changed their compensation model to better reflect the company goal.  If you want to get paid by this company, you have to reach your sales goals: new benefit members AND substantial volumes of NEW money being brought under the company's management.  If you don't do both to their standards, you will barely get compensated for the business you do bring in and you will most likely find yourself unemployed before long."
bad,"Structure/organization changes, workload not distributed evenly throughout department, too much forced focus on buzzwords of the moment (diversity & inclusion, agile, scrum)."
bad,"Mutual funds went to 'S' shares and didn't pay to sell them. We were being docked in pay each year, I feel we were tricked into going into the new pay system with the allure of more money only to find out the grids were replaced with much higher numbers."
bad,"I worked in a support function not the main business of insurance and investment business so we were not considered key partners to their success in most cases. The managers of those areas routinely by-passed our support. In turn our direct management did little to support us so the office environment was not the best."
bad,"Answer phones from members and provide them either quotes on loans/partial surrender. Advised them on what they have as far as life insurance and get them to a financial representative if they need to make any huge changes. Took payments, researched anything the customer wanted researched."
bad,"The work can be rewarding but it takes years to build the clientele.  For personal reasons, I did not stay with it long enough to achieve success.  It was a great learning experience and I believe I am still benefitting personally from what I learned about financial management."
bad,"I joined this organization with zero knowledge about financial planning. I learned quickly, excelled and always exceeded expectations. When I decided to look for other opportunities within the same lines of my experience and qualifications within the organization, they refused me simply because I am darker skinned and have accent."
bad,"But then they stopped hiring needed people for the past 2 years, then came the closed door meeting, non-disclosure agreements, sold Minneapolis HQ building, executive parking lot, employee parking lot, and then another 1/4 block lot they owned.  Downsized from a 1/2-block, 16-story building to a 1/4-block, 8-story building, and laid off over 400+ people with 10- and especially 20+ years of experience to save money.  They are lawyering up, not too many other professionals hired lately."
bad,"As a Financial Advisor, Thrivent wants you to work from your natural market, i.e. your friends and family. It's very difficult to get started as a new person with no experience. Basically no financial help is offered and it's fully commissioned based. Good luck if you choose this career."
good,"then you get nothing.  100% commission, they don't help after you've sold to your natural market.  They try to cover their vulture-like sales strategy with a guise of religion and charity; don't be fooled"
good,"I enjoyed learning and doing the actual work - but constant communications and miscommunications with uninformed business people as well as bureaucratic red tape really slowed down the process and hindered my enjoyment. Management was also constantly shifting and as such, it was often unclear of who I was reporting to. The work itself was good, but the job as a whole was in an uncomfortable flux."
good,"I do not feel the need to provide a review of Thrivent Financial at this time.  But the field is requiring 150 characters before I'm able to move on, so I need to write something in here."
good,"This industry is tough. Thrivent talks a little bit different game than most, but ultimately you do the exact same thing trying to build your book as if you were with Northwestern Mutual, Prudential, Mass Mutual, etc. Unless you have a handful of high net worth clients who are excited to work with you right away, you will need a minimum of 3-5 years to start feeling a consistent income. Many people have left six figure jobs to try and fail as financial advisors. The management team comes across as positive, but we know they too are struggling to meet rigorous goals.  There is no real in-between. You will either flame out, or you will be wildly successful. (70/30 chances)"
good,At first the job was enjoyable as it grew people changed.  At first I really liked the people but as time went on things changed.  The job could be very slow and mostly I worked by myself which I was OK with.  There were no benefits and the hours I worked went from full time to part time then back to full time.  That was hard.
good,New Business had a 1 day standard for all work
good,"Assembled packets, organized and maintained filing room to keep documentation current.  Maintained client's files and important paperwork. Kept all client information confidential."
good,"Use to be a top notch company, but over the last year it is about expense reduction.  Hiring moved away from most qualified to it has just be someone to fill diversification.  Not the company I started with and hence I left."
good,A lot of change constantly which is good but seems like upper management is not sure which direction they should be going.  This causes a lot of wasted time and money.
good,"Salaries are definitely not keeping up with the cost of living. The  increase in health insurance premiums each year completely negates the standard 2-3% wage increase that the vast majority of employees receive, and in the long run, you are bringing home less money each year.  Also, long-term tenured employees are not compensated well, as when brand new employees start, they are often making as much, sometimes more, than an employee who's been there for 20 years. (Another perfect example of the low & stagnant wages.)"
good,"Self-paced, opportunity. Independent Contract with full control over own schedule. Support in the field is talked about, but seemingly challenging to connect with other reps."
good,"Independent agents managed by the company. May be a Christian company but .... you can be ridiculed daily if you're not Lutheran. Management offers to assist you be a success, but do nothing."
good,"Thrivent is a wonderful company to work with and for. In my opinion, their investment offerings are unrivaled, and the service from their representatives outpaces all competition."
good,"Mainly we delivered mail throughout the huge complex, and then packed up outgoing mail to go to different locations. Management was okay. I had great co-workers who were willing to help out whenever needed. Enjoyed being able to go throughout the building and meet alot of other employees."
good,The office holds a very professional work environment. Advisors can expect to continually be working on their sales pipeline as well as creating and maintaining networking relationships in order to continue to excel in their business.
good,"In my personal experience, my manager had a personal vendetta against me and refused to move me up when I deserved it. I was the only person kept on the entry-level position and wound up training new employees for advancement for a year while they wouldn't advance my position at all. While working here, I felt like a number. I'm glad that I left. There were a few great people I would recommend working for at Thrivent but overall it was a bad experience with a hostile work environment."
good,"Thrivent's culture is changing, and not in a good way.  The company is an amazing company for what they do in the community, but they no longer value employees who have dedicated a much of their career to them.  Changes to their workspace, benefits, and structure have most employees wondering where the company is heading."
good,Management are good. Supervisor is nice and helpful. Room to grow. Challenging but manageable. Agile environment. Room for learning and developing skills.
good,"Christian organization seeking to help it's members be wise with money, inspire generosity and strengthen communities."
good,Worked with great co-workers. Management in my department was inadequate in my mind. Hardest part of the job is all the metrics you need to meet to be promoted.
good,There's a clear division between those who are active in the Lutheran church and those of us who grew up Lutheran but are no longer active. It was a passive aggressive workplace that spoke of religious values but people would backstab the moment they left a meeting room.
good,"Many long tenured employees"
good,"Great benefits, mediocre pay, typical workplace politics when it comes to promotions. Company focuses on too many small items instead of the big pictures."
good,This place is nice place to work and people are nice. The work environment is pretty lead back and I enjoyed working there.  But Employees get paid less compared to the market.
good,"The company is solid. It's mission and purpose is great. It can be highly lucrative if you work hard, overcome objections, and stay persistent. However, for me, seeing peers at other firms get better compensation for the same cases just became deflating."
good,"This company is a great place if you have a family. If you are starting your career, however, I recommend other places. The work culture consisted mostly of older folk; I did not get much exposure to other young professionals."
good,"Typical great day at work - finding and meeting with folks interested in their financial future.  Difficulty?  One-person office."
good,"The company is very religion focused which makes it hard for people of outside faith to find and ""in"" within the community you are in. Other than that they were great to me and offered great training!"
good,"I learned a lot and am grateful for the opportunity. I gained proficiency in Microsoft Outlook, Office, Excel and Salesforce. I was able to organize events and meet with clients in a fun atmosphere."
good,"Insurance you either Love it or Hate it. With Financial Investment as a plus. Busy work environment.Very detailed work. Lots of confidentiality involved. Will be fingerprinted twice, and have 2 back ground checks. Online insurance studying to prepare the individual for the state exams for licensing."
good,"Thrivent is a good employer.  The team you are on will have a big impact on your experience.  There is a big push going to Agile project methodology, which you will have to judge whether that would be good fit for the position you are interested in."
good,"You spend your day seeking individuals to market Thrivent Financial products and services to friends, family and centers of influence."
good,"Good company to work for. Undervalued as an employee being an OP. No insurance or benefit. Being that they are a financial advising company they should have insurance for their employees, but technically the FR's hire the OP's is how they get away with it. As generous as they claim to be they should provide insurance and benefits to OP's."
good,Alchemy creates a great software to help the food industry.
good,"Thrivent is a non-profit, a relatively unique position within the financial services sector.  It was an enjoyable experience working there and it was interesting to gain more industry exposure."
good,"The Financial Associate is a good role if you are young with no kids or have a lot of savings.  They do not give you a base for very long, and the training is not very good."
good,I got to work from home which was nice. Co-workers were awesome to work with. Management was good and was there for me through some medical issues. Hardest part of the jobs was when you get that call that no matter how hard you try to help it is not good enough but then you get that call that makes you realize why you do the job you do and the per joy in the member/FRs voice. I have learned a lot with Thrivent from listening to take on different products to help more members/FRs.
good,Thrivent Financial is a good organization to work for because they have knowledgeable staff about insurance and money management plans. Sometimes the days can be long because of the tasks that need to be completed for all of the clients. It would be helpful to have background knowledge of the industry.
good,"a little to political, but that is how healthcare organizations are."
good,Great products. Very competitive fees/expenses. Decent compensation.
good,"Had a blast during training, then once you are on your own it becomes very difficult. The company itself is amazing, but the management can be hard to get along with at times."
good,"I loved my experience working as an intern for Thrivent Financial.  Everyone is extremely nice and wants what is best for you.  The only reason I chose not to go back is because I felt like the technology was a bit outdated and wanted to learn newer skills.  It also takes a while to advance without that much of a pay bump, and work moves slow causing things to not get done that quickly. They are also in a big transition trying to implement Agile."
good,"For a Christian Faith Based Organization, it has a lot of work to improve up that notion.  Your Supervisors and trainers are nice to your face but so back stab you to others when your not around.  They can be condescending and constantly hold your job over your head.  Benefits could use some improvement and pay and compensation really need to be evaluated.  The cost of living between the headquarters city of Appleton Wisconsin and Minneapolis Minnesota which is down from that are considerably different and not evenly balanced.  Affirmative Action plays too much in the hiring and promotion.  Training and advancement is not easy depending on the Supervisor and whether or not they like you in the first place.  One thing is said to you but another is actually done.  Shifts are not consistent and your shifts change way to frequent and you cannot establish a good sleep pattern when it comes to you shift being changed on you.  Too much Whishy Washy behavior among the supervision.."
good,"You need to put in 50+ hours a week for years in order to truly make a living at this.  The company is great and will support you, however, it is commission only."
good,"This industry overall is a challenging one as often those who enter are unaware of how much it will cost them.  The numbers are not clear and it was definitely not clear that not only would my first years of compensation need to be paid back but that they were able to deduct it as wage when in fact is was only a loan.  So not only did I have to pay rent in a space that they provided and had rules of use, but that they had a hand in my commissions and then I also had to pay them back for the commission paid in the first couple of years and pay taxes on it.  In the end, I left as I did not see a financial benefit and then if I did yield a profit, the business would never be mine as I was a captive agent and the customer base ultimately belonged to the Thrivent Managing Partner.  So I went off on my own."
good,If you are young being a financial professional is tough work. It isn't for everyone. Measure your own abilities to sell as well as network. If you can't do these you will fail.
good,"The positives out weight the negatives at Thrivent, though career advancement outside of field sales is not clearly defined. The Company lacks making capital investments in the targeted markets in order to support the sales staff. Ie. Designated business locations, brick and mortar branches. Marketing is limited and sales support is sub par. Teamwork is promoted and community engagement activities are common place. Difficult to access the company's longevity and long term success at delivering financial services, not only insurance, to individuals of all faiths. The company's value proposition is empowering though, it falls short on the execution of the task at hand. Building a successful business requires partnership, time, money and hard work. It takes longer than two years in order to meet the annual sales quotas."
good,"The co-workers are great for the most part; most are collaborative and helpful.  The management is different.  While not across the board, the area I worked in ruled by fear and intimidation.  "
good,Very enlightening environment of helping others increase their financial and personal goals. Great family atmosphere. The lack of ability to advance is a major hurdle for field representatives.
good,A typical work day involved dealing with customers and there their current portfolios.  
good,"My colleagues are wonderful! I enjoy local and regional professionals as well as help from the field support team in Wisconsin. "
good,"I contracted here for 3 months, working in human resources. Great team of competent people. Good work and life balance too. Always busy due to 7,000 employees."
good,A good place to work. Very supportive staff and very kind people. It is a good opportunity if you can take over the book of somebody about to retire. I appreciate the time I have spent thered
good,"Thrivent Financial has a great environment and people to work with. A lot of easy to work with and enjoyable coworkers. The Appleton building is beautiful outside, only down side is the cafe lacks good food and any food place is at least a 10 min drive away."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Thrivent - I spent most of it focused on InfoSec and applications. Focused on how to improve software security, just starting that effort."
good,"Great Company benefits! Welcoming atmosphere overall.  Flexible work schedules available, employee business resource groups."
good,This company sticks to its mission and values. In an industry that is watered down and so easy to find unethical practices. Thrivent works out of trust and understanding.
good,"The best company I have worked for so far. Good amount of PTO, but in the call centers it can be hard to get the days off that you want. They take their metrics very seriously, but I didn't feel that any of the goals were terribly hard to meet. Wonderful that they provided telecommuting as an option, but it seriously takes away from your options for advancement."
good,"Company, benefits and overall culture are good.However, there are some subpar managers in the fold. "
good,Job can be very stressful and although the described culture is to coach and allow you to grow I  found I was not given the type of of coaching to advance that I requested. I felt as though I was being held at my current position for no reason.
good,"Provided lots of learning on the job. Ability to learn as you grow. "
good,"My internship with Thrivent Financial was a good experience. Not only was I exposed to the work it takes to produce a marketing campaign, I was also exposed working in a corporate environment conducting cross team projects."
good,I worked for a great Thrivent Professional that took his job and clients seriously. Working as an office professional I made a lot of cold calls and follow up calls to existing clients.
good,"A great company to work for! "
good,"Downsizing past 2-years in sales support. Fiesta looking for insurance reps. "
good,Enjoy working one on one with your clients to fully meet there financial needs.
good,"Thrivent is a solid financial services organization driven by faith-based values, serving the Christian market.  Its products and services are consistent with a diversified financial services organization.  It provides a high degree of work/life balance for its employees."
good,"I used a fiche machine to review old contract slides.  These slides needed to be manually read and reviewed to be entered in the computer database.  Working with two computer screens as well here.  The most frustrating part of the job is that we were required to view so many slideds/contracts per day.  This took away from accuracy and made me feel rushed to meet the quota.  Some contracts took more attention than others."
good, 
good,I was impressed with all of the advisors I met with Thrivent.  They are truly invested in the financial well-being of their clients.
good,"I loved this job and this company! Fast pace, good benefits and wonderful team mates!"
good,"I had many good years working at Thrivent Financial / AAl. They have great benefits for their employees. Unfortunately, it is hard for advancement."
good,Good people to work with. Great organizational mission. Organization does a good job in promoting and supporting a work life balance. Fair compensation and time off opportunities.
good,"Solid company that stands behind their mission statement.  Great culture and supportive atmosphere.  Helpful programs"
good,Great place to work.  Currently transforming.  Not sure what future company will look like.  Benefits are being taken away and made more in line with other companies.  Digital presence is weak.  May hurt future growth.
good,"Worked part time evening and low stress , making out bound calls , low key, had good training , good crew to work with, convenient location , nice building,"
good,"Thrivent is a great company. As with any job, it's not perfect. I enjoyed the time I spent there. Lots of great people and I enjoy the good work Thrivent does."
good,Getting ready to move into a brand new building.  Lots of things going on in preparation for the transition. Change is hard for a lot of people there because a lot of things don't change often.
good,"Its hard to live on 100% commission. Trying to get someone to commit to an appointment , alot of cold calling, and traveling to homes you don't know the customers."
good,Thrivent is made up of a large group of significant quality people.  There was flexibility to instill new best practices.  The company contributed significantly to your business knowledge growth through conferences and regular teleconferences.
good,"It was a good chance to learn a lot about the company. "
good,"There are many really great people working here who believe in the mission of the company.  If you work in one of the two corporate headquarters, the dining centers are really great."
good,"They have a good work life balance expectation, they provide nice perks for employees such as employee appreciation events."
good,"I work by myself most days.  I do a lot of computer work, answer phones, file, prepare and follow up on appointments that the rep has done.  I enjoy working on my own but have difficulty accomplishing what I need to when I am asked to take care of my boss' children while I am working."
good,"Beautiful campus, great cafeteria.  Work teams could vary from challenging to awesome.  Lots of variety in the work and manhy opportunities to move around within the company."
good,"Worked at Thrivent for 10 years - polite, supportive work environment with enough lateral/upward job movement to keep one busy if so inclined but it certainly depends on your manager."
good,You need to be teamed up with another vet to learn the ins and outs. Be prepared for commission only pay with 1099's. Work life balance is up to you but plan on working a lot of hours to be successful including evenings and weekends. The financial industry is a struggling industry to work in
good,"It's a great company as many of the employees have been here longer than I have been alive, but that will also cause employment issues in the near future as people retire.  It would be nice to see more equality in pay for all employees"
good,Great company that does great things with the money they bring in. That being said I feel a little misled with taking on the job I did. I was told I would be a Financial associate but was under the impression I would be given a book of business to sustain myself. Instead I was reliant upon my own contacts to attempt to convince them to use Thrivent as their Financial Services company.
good,"No coment at this time"
good,"Thrivent is a good company, howeever they will let people sit in the same job for literally years. It takes a lot of personal motivation to move around, and up."
good,"Spend most of the time working with clients to help them achieve their goals and address their financial concerns. "
good,"Though the pay was small and the benefits are lacking, the place was great. The people were welcoming and helpful. The culture is wonderful."
good,I do not like being a telemarketer and spending so much time on the phone begging people to listen to our presentation. I feel very comfortable with their financial management and their integrity is impressive.
good,"This is probably one of the best financial services companies to work for.  They genuinely care about members and give hundreds of thousands of dollars back to the community every year.  "
good,"Questionable management decisions is the only negative.  Thrivent gives back to the community and for the most part, treats employees well.  The salary is probably above average overall.  However senior engineers are probably paid under the median range."
good,"Thrivent Financial is a great place to work if you are looking for work-life balance, a flexible work schedules, and decent benefits. The mission of the organization is to 'help people be wise with money and live generously' - they live the mission on a day to day basis."
good,Call on new and existing Thrivent customers and sell Life Insurance and financial products.  Pay was commission only based on sales and no base compensation.  Support for agents was weak and made it difficult including dated compliance rules.
good,Nice place to work. Great mission. Helping people with their finances and inspiring people to live with generosity.  High expectations for performance and help to achieve those expectations.
good,"It was rewarding helping clients when they had a need. By using the""advisory process"" I could help clients meet there financial goals and help them avoid road blocks that could harm them financialy."
good,"Working at at Thrivent was a happy, healthy environment. Admittedly, I, along with my coworkers, felt like burdens, calling members who were unaware of our company, or did not want to speak to us. Either way, someone has to make those phone calls, right?"
good,The benefit packages are one of the best in the area however the gross payment amount is way under average by as much as 40%. Do not work here as a contractor as the culture towards contractors is not a good part of the work environment.
good,I would recommend Thrivent to anyone wanting to make investments. As an employee  thought they did a good job of providing continuing education. They truly believe you must do what's right for the client.
good,"Thrivent was a wonderful place to work for, the co-workers were some of the funnest people to work through the good times and the bad times. Management was proactive in continuing training and would set time aside if someone need a little more help. The hardest part of the job was finding new people and compensation.

good,Great company with great values. Must be ready for a independent contractor role and have a large network of people to call on. Must be ready to go get it and create a new network of people.
good,My time at Thrivent was great. I unfortunately was hired on into a start-up inside of the parent company Thrivent Financial and it didn't take off. I loved working for Thrivent and would recommend this company to everyone.
good,"Thrivent Financial for Lutherans was a great place to work. I worked in the Life Insurance Interaction Center and was given the option to learn many different skill sets."
good,"Very supportive company that values their employees and works harder to help their employees advance to help make Thrivent even better! 4 weeks vaca to start out with, great benes, however life insurance is on the leaner side as they want you to purchase it."
good,"Good experience, I would have stayed longer if they had work for me.  It was a little difficult to get things done as security is very tightly controlled and has to be set up for every project."
good,"The culture at Thrivent is absolutely amazing. Their work life balance is superb. Due to their overarching philosophy, compensation is significantly lower than the national average in the IT field. They sacrifice pay for benefits and ""work life balance"""
good,The work experience is very rewarding to help a client or family achieve their life goals with confidence while providing security for family protection through thoughtful and educated financial planning.
good,"The people at the company are great, management can be spotty in certain areas. Overall, Thrivent Financial is a nice place to work. I enjoyed the daily tasks."
good,"I greatly improved my networking skills during my time in this role. "
good,"Great company to work for, if you can find a position you're not working directly for a representative as they have complete say over your earnings, benefits, etc.  They tend to be very short with the generosity to their employees while advising their clients to ""live generously"""
good,It was the best office environment of my career. The people were always supportive and we all held each other accountable. Office meetings were always positive and managers made everyone feel welcome. The work is hard but a supportive group around you makes all the difference.
good,the biggest challenge was to walk clients through the process of the application(Mostly elders). Everyone is nice and understanding. The job itself was fast during certain season
good,This place is amazing with their view on life and the reason behind their company. They are generous and willing to help anyone and answer all kind of questions.
good,One of the greatest company I have ever work with I am just thankful of the opportunity given to work with Thrivent Financial. I will always support this company
good,Thrivent was really great to all its interns and was a really great experience. The only thing is that they make it seem like they will hire all of their interns and in the end they only hired a few out of the 80 total interns that they had.
good,This company is amazing in mission and service. For the Christian minded investor there is no other forum to consider.  Company values are extraordinary and commitment to Integrity and Ethics are the highest of standards.  The company continues to perform year over year as one of the world's most Ethical companies.

good,"Thrivent Financial is a well established company with financial reps who work for the good of their clients best interest. We practice managers help balance their day to day operations in the office and set client events, track accounts all so our reps can use their time, meeting with and creating that special relationship and getting to know each client on a personal level. This is what makes our clients happy because we then can help with their future investing/retirements needs as best possible.

I have learned a new HR system that I have not previously worked with. My manager is awesome and includes all her employees including the contractors in all aspects of the business. My co-workers are fun and always very helpful. The hardest part of my job is knowing that eventually it will end as I am a contract employee. The most enjoyable is when I get to help solve someone's else's problem.
good,"I was a student leader as part of a program put on by Thrivent Financial called Money Revolution. I would host events on my college campus to educate students about financial independence and management. Every Summer Thrivent would fly me out to their headquarters in Minnesota to meet with my bosses who were located at corporate, learn from some of the executives and participate in a leadership retreat at their corporate resort."

good,Mainframe Cobol/JCL/Db2/Sas/Vsam . Thrivent FInacial is Insurance and Investment Bank.
good,"Thrivent offers a very pleasant work environment. The people are friendly and eager to help. Management appeared cohesive and focused on issues supporting future goals and direction. Often times the biggest challenge was uncovering pertinent company history to support gaining closure on an outstanding security audit issue. Overall, the project was successfully completed."
good,Making a personal difference in the lives of others through a variety of financial products.
good,"I was totally in charge of my own schedule, as I was a one man home office.  I made my own phone calls, set my own appointments, and set up my own events to engage and interest prospects.  My success was totally up to me, but I had no one to show me the ropes, as I had no prior experience in sales or financial services.  Marketing and prospecting were the hardest parts of the job for me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people secure their financial present and future. Thrivent's motto is ""combining faith and finances for good."""
good,Flexible schedule and personal freedom.  Meeting and working with clients is very gratifying.  Thrivent has excellent products and corporate support personnel.
good,This was an excellent place to work. Having a kitchen right in the building was wonderful because then you didn't always have to remember to bring your lunch in. The managers were wonderful and allowed us to switch up our hours if needed and to always have family come first.
good,Thrivent is a fraternal organization that works closely with the member/owners giving them the opportunity to live generous lives. They have programs for people to feel good about helping others by giving of their time and talents.

good,"I loved everything about the job receptionist-deposit oper.  Made deposits, balance, batch out, enjoyed talking to members and loved making visitors feel welcome."
good,"Worked in brand new division with new business development. Started using Agile to learn, pivot, deliver quickly. Company culture was extremely friendly."
good,"Since I was only working a temp position, I didn't have any room for advancement and my pay was quite low. What made up for that was the manager I had and the way our department was run. I would have liked to have stayed working in that department on a full time basis."
good,"I like working here, but, feel that my talents are NOT being adequately used. Very flexible work hours and the folks are a joy to work with.  Very awesome as it is a Christian faith based company."
good,"Thrivent Financial is growing! As we continue to expand into the broader Christian community, Thrivent Financial seeks candidates to join our team of financial advisors throughout Central Minnesota Region!"
good,"In my position I would make outbound calls each day to hundreds of Thrivent's members and clients with various objectives such as setting appointments for product reviews and invitations to educational workshops. I learned about developing personal brand image and professional written and verbal communication. I also sharpened my record keeping with MS Excel, Word and Access. My coworkers came from a wide range of backgrounds, but had one thing in common, being that they were friendly, outgoing and people oriented. The hardest part of the job was learning to let negative feedback from customers roll off my back. Often customers would be upset with representatives at their local field office and would take their frustration out on the callers who contacted them on the behalf of their local representative. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving the customer a positive experience; taking an outbound call and making it into something the customer was glad to have received."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you are helping other Christians with their finances.  The workplace culture is relaxed and kind.  A typical day for an Office Professional is preparing files and documents for advisors meetings with clients.  Following up on correspondence and actions.  My boss is the best.  Kind and gracious.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at Thrivent. It was varied and kept the day interesting.  I began to feel like family to all of the clients we had.
good,Co-workers were great to work with and knowledgeable. Thrivent allows paid volunteer and are big on giving back to the community - Feed My Starving Children is done on-site. Ability to work remote when needed made the work life balance lifestyle ideal.
good,"Great company, great values. High paced, demanding but keeps you on your toes."
good,Great culture and company to work for. Just didn’t feel my experience and expertise match what I got paid. I did far more than I got paid for. Bank was very under staffed
good,I worked there for 15 years and I wouldn't stay at an employer unless I was happy.  If you love what you do an feel valued there isn't any thing that is hard.  I loved what I did & left to start a family.
good,"Typical daytime office job. Customer service, calling, appointment making, helping Agents with financial and insurance policies. Managed supplies, meeting calendar,etc."
good,"Thrivent Financial has an excellent company culture. Thrivent Financial is a values driven and customer centric company. "
good,I enjoyed working at Thrivent Financial and would continue to work there but my position was eliminated.  It is an excellent place to work with good benefits.
good,Thrivent Financial is a great place to work. My only advise before you start is be passionate about networking and working with Insurance and financial products.
good,My experience so far at Thrivent Financial has been great. My Managers and Co-Workers are awesome. Everybody is very friendly and they try to challenge you. That's what makes Thrivent great. You always feel like you are bettering yourself and others when you walk through those doors.
good,"Thrivent as a company is awesome to work for, their benefits are amazing, and if you have health problems, or someone in your family, they will work with you. That being said, it is incredibly stressful depending on your department. If you are on the phones, you do have several people listening to your calls for Quality Assurance, and you are graded. Advancement is not easy. and you have to be very sure of what you do. You are working with a lot of money on a daily basis. Management is pretty typical with any other workplace, you have your good ones and your bad ones."
good,"Last manager was not supportive in growing.  Kept me from going back to school that would enable me to position myself elsewhere in the company.  And when they downsized, I was then let go as I didn't have a degree (had already proved my ability by taking LOMA, but she wouldn't approve going back for an associate degree in accounting)."
good,"Thrivent is a very well-run company, with a great culture.  They encourage outside volunteer time, offer many opportunities for advancement and training, and I would highly recommend Thrivent to any job seeker."
good,"Great people, and great culture.  I worked in the Financial Reporting department, the pace often changes depending on the time of the year.  Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the change of pace.  But it had a relaxed atmosphere if your getting your work done."
good,Basically self employed. It was a sales job and it was up to the individual to get appointments and make sales.
good,"Working as part of the Thrivent North Oaks group team is very fulfilling and has provided me with valuable professional skills. The team is small and good at interpersonal and proessional communication. There is a lot of emphasis on work-life balance and great flexibility with scheduling, as long as an expected absence or schedule change is communicated ahead of time. The clients are wonderful and easy to talk to, and it's a joy to work in a small office where you get to know many of the clients by name/face over time. The most challenging part of the job is staying on top of your tasks - there is a very efficient and tightly-organized office workflow that requires close attention to detail from every member of the team. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the clients and being able to see the entire advising process from start to finish."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Thrivent and was saddened to be laid off as part of their field restructuring recently. However, I am a firm believer in the strategy behind their mission and objective! I worked remotely with occasional travel and had the best leadership team."
good,"As a financial representative in Thrivent you spend a large portion of your time calling clients or prospects to meet and run them through what they know as a ""connect"" where they introduce the company and the benefits of becoming a member and how the advisor can help guide them towards financial security. Based on client needs and wants you sell them Thrivent products (most likely life insurance if your starting off) and get paid on the commission of those sales."
good,"Thrivent is a terrific company to work for, with mid western values and a stellar reputation in the financial field. The tempo is more laid back than a traditional insurance/financial company. God is central to everything they do, which is crucial to the Christians that work there."
good,"Many financial services companies say they're unique. But only Thrivent Financial blends faith, finances and generosity. We want to help people develop new relationships with money, so they can use it to strengthen families, churches and communities."
good,"the key is you need to be aware that you are self-employed.  As a one-person office, you have all the responsibilities and requirements for FINRA you as well as all of the cost of marketing and office space.    A lot of good people but not an easy job to support a family unless you are a very high production.    Restricted to be full time and no outside business.   I would recommend if you have the ability to have a spouse who can support your family or no income needs for a time to establish your business."
good,"I was an unpaid intern working for my father at the company and even thought it was heavy (listening to people's stories, dealing with death of clients or their family etc.) overall the environment is so faith-based that everyone is able to support one another through trying times. Kind co-workers and a nice and quiet environment to get your work done in."
good,"Great opportunity if you are on a good team in a good location. The financial planning world is highly regulated and the compensation is being compressed. That being the case, Thrivent is a great company if you can find the local right group to team up with."
good,"Thrivent is an awesome place to work if you do not mind a commission pay check. The company overall, is one of the best companies out there. It is a fortune 500 company with the ethics and values of your everyday small town business."
good,It was a wonderful opportunity to serve others. No day was typical which was a great way to learn new skills.
good,Great company to work for with lots of local flexibility.   The reps in Rapid City are amazing and especially Cal is a delight. The company really cares about fixing back.
good,"The corporate culture here is very relaxed, everyone within my team was amazing to work with. Hours are flexible and micromanagement is no-existent at Thrivent."
good,They were always very flexible to work around your schedule and made it very easy to take time off.  The coworkers as well as customers were extremely friendly.

The job is a commission's based position and the potential for income is basically unlimited depending on your ability in Sales."

good,"Great work/life balance, wonderful people and company culture! I would love to work for Thrivent again in the future and I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who is interested."

good,It's nice working for a Christian based organization where God is at the forefront of the company. It's nice working for a company that values the employees.
good,"Loved working here, they legitimately care about their clients and their employees. Only interested in leaving because I hate working for commissions. Nothing bad to say about them as a firm or as people."
good,Great place that brings together faith and finances. Fantastic work life balance and benefits.  Slow growth and few opportunities for advancement in higher level positions.
good,"I do a lot of the middle man work for the Financial Reps at Thrivent Financial by getting work from them to the Home Office, as well as being the gate keeper to clients who come in and meet with the FRs."

good,I worked as an intern for Thrivent.  Thrivent has an incredible emerging intern summer program that brings together students from all departments.  My managers were excellent at communicating their goals for me and providing information to help me learn.  One of my favorite parts of the internship was the opportunity to speak with senior leaders in a variety of areas to learn more about the company.
good,"Great company, great people. Generally open to changes and very welcoming. Management has also been very visible in efforts to support staff. Leaders are not micro managers and allow staff to be responsible and accountable for their own tasks."
good,As a commissioned based independent contractor the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with clients and assisting them with financial products vital to their family's future financial security.  Became friends with many clients.  Compensation was directly related to the amount an quality of the effort put forth.  No limit of potential income.
good,"I love working with Thrivent! Once you are hired as a corporate employee, the difference is night and day. It's great to work with a company that cares for their members and employees so much!!"
good,"Productive environment, good work /life balance, great culture that supports their member driven faith based giving philosophy. There is advancement opportunity, but can take time to get to some departments due to the longevity of careers for those who often chose not to retire. Depending on position, can be very manual in processing jobs; as they are still taking years to sunset outdated programs."
good,"Flexible scheduling. Strong values. Volunteer work. Event planning and presentations. Paperwork and accuracy checks for daily work, along with client meeting scheduling and assistance."
good,"I learned a lot at this investment firm. I hadn't had much experience with investing or talking with customers about their financial options. I performed office duties as well such as: filing, computer data management, operating office equipment and customer service."
good,"it was a pleasure to work for Thrivent. If i would have stayed in California I would have still been employed at Thrivent. The staff was great but the company needs a better training program, as well as a lead generating source for new agents."
good,"Everyone works as a team to accomplish daily goals.  I enjoyed finding new solutions to problems, and the team setting was great!"

good,"Best place to work. I never wanted my employment to end there but the owner retired. An amazing boss and created a fun, relaxed work environment for others."
