rating,review
bad,"Has no idea how to allocate resources, tons of politics, nobody wants to help newcomers. Slow-paced, worst pay. This is by far the worst company to work at."
bad,"Dishonest company from CEO to management. "
bad,"The overall benefits is not bad but don't expect good increases in pay. "
bad,"Many really good people work there at all levels. The culture is broken though and toxic politics prevail. Senior management ""kingdom building"" is rampant, and the C-level rarely intervenes. VP level infighting often spills out and impacts customers. Rarely do senior leaders talk about how the politics impact customers or employee morale."
bad,"Interviewed, was offered a job, turned it down. They came back and offered a higher title and higher reporting structure. Accepted. Started the job and it was the lower title, and lower reporting structure. Bait and switch. Co-worker said the same thing happened to her. HIGHLY UNETHICAL management. Stay away. You can do better in Silicon Valley."
bad,Varian has some great employee's but they are all under valued. Management is horrible.
bad,Managers don’t even take care of the people leave it to the leads. Too much work no recognition. Under paid over worked. Would not recommend nepotism at its worst
bad,"Very political cliquish environment, people rarely think outside the box; service org bad, ageism transparent all over.  Forced vaca year end due to poor financial results.  Basic benefits."
bad,Products are good; management is toxic.  Very political place.  It is also a male driven company.  Not many women in managerial roles.  Expectation is to brown nose in order to move ahead.
bad,"1% raises (the most you can receive); poor management, and mandatory holiday schedule without appropriate compensation.  Varian has potential to be a good company, but they have a long way to go in the area of employee compensation, work/life management, and employee morale."
bad,"Management team is very rude and non understanding, there is no accountability or ownership over projects a lot of passing the buck, very stressful and chaotic work environment."
bad,There are a lots of obstacles prevent you make progress and improve and processes. You have to be a mediocre to be a survivor.
bad,"Poor Management. Lack of accountability. Relies on 20% to do 80% of the work. Poor planning for projects. Lack of communication."
bad,"The company is doing great things to treat cancer; however, management leaves a lot to be desired. The company needs to hold management accountable for developing their employees and to provide leadership training for their managers."
bad,many changes and employees in sales are expected to work 60+ hrs per week and many weekends. Inconsistent information is passed on to customers and sales.
bad,"A terrible place to work. Management rotates shifts on a whim. For 2 weeks you're on days, then swing-shift, then nights. You're constantly exhausted from the schedule changes."
bad,Not a great place to work. Miss leading. Expect you to know thing in a short period of time. Can get boring a times and repetitive. Not a very good work life balance
bad,You will work every day and it still won’t be enough for management ... go work 3rd party and make more money and not work every weekend; In 10 years working there were always had 3 to 5 job openings that we could never fill and work so much you will never see your kids or wife ever
bad,"They have some great managers and attorneys, but are trying to function on a skeleton support staff.  It was just okay, not what I expected. They have a few persons in their staff that behave in a superior manner as if no one can match or learn how the corporation functions. It's a shame because there are lots of talented people that can offer their talents to the company without being intimidated by the current staff."
bad,"I worked for this employer longer than any other. The job security was very good, but trying to advance your skills as a machinist in this place was next to impossible. Showing interest in learning a new skill, or how to run another machine was viewed as a threat by both co-workers and lower management. Politics were rife in this company. I had many friends here, but unfortunately, I made many enemies as well. If you didn't belong to one of the many click's it was easy to become a scapegoat for one or many of the constant problems that were going on in the shop. "
bad,"Keine Struktur, schlechtes Management. Keine Führungskompetenz"
bad,"This job is good for a 20+ year experienced, old, single, white male. No other people will be accapeted into the culture in the Chicago. In the past 10 years, 12 to 14 different people have been in the FSE position, none made it past 2 years working for Varian in Chicago. This is due to the ""good ol boy"" network of engineers and at the time of my emplyoment, management (who got fired shortly after I left)."
bad,"Overall, Varian is an okay place to work.  However, management is pretty horrible at actually managing things sometimes.  There are a LOT of barriers to execution, and they send out surveys every 2 months to give you the illusion your voice counts.  If you are friends with the managers you can get away with just about anything.  If not, expect to show up and adhere to policies while other do what they want, with no consequence."
bad,Sales have been slowly declining and numerous management and procedural changes have fed an already low employee morale.
bad,Analytical thinking is key as a Sales Operations Specialist at Varian Medical Systems.  Supporting multiple field reps and fulfilling ad hoc requests makes for an different day every day.
good,"You are working 60-80hrs week, the company has great job security but you are always working and little time to be at home with family."
good,"Varain was an over all fun place to work! I enjoyed it for a time of being there, however if any issues araised they took their time to solve them, if you didn't know anyone in the company you would not move up in the work place. A lot of people brought their personal life into the work place, their work ethic declined. If you made someone mad they would ruin your reputation. Aside from the listed. there were times where i had lots of fun it was definitely a learning experience."
good,It is a decent place to work.  Lots of growth and new product development going on. Challenging work environment with so many projects going on at once.
good,"Working for Varian was a well paying job. That is where the company stops caring about you and your family. If you don't work unreal amounts of overtime then you get so far behind in work and then it snow balls out of control from there. In the end you have NO work/life balance at all. This isn't a job, it's a life style."
good,"The work was definitely rewarding from the technical aspect. However, my hours were over 11 and sometimes 13 per day. I exceeded 60 hours per week regularly and at times above 70. Time-sheet software would only allow me to enter 40 hours and no more. I would recommend VMS for young engineers wanting to drink from a fire hose of technical learning, but be prepared to swap all daylight hours."
good,"Currently performing many tasks - phone calls from customers, other colleges, working problems and issues with both.  Contributing and correcting new and existing documentation.  "
good,"This would have been a great workplace. Instead it was slowly devolved into a siloed, unproductive control-zone."
good,"Innovative professional leader with comprehensive US/Global experience in Finance, Operations, Accounting and Mgmt. Experience supporting various U.S. industries; Communications, Distribution, Industrial, Federal & Financial Services. Recognized for measurable positive results in process restructuring, pioneering productivity tools and systems, centralizing overseas job functions, enhancing profitability and revenue growth, reducing overhead cost. Analytical with solid communication, negotiation, leadership talents and unique ability to synergize teams increasing productivity to drive corporate goals."
good,When I started there 20yrs ago it was less stress and less politics. The last 5 yrs I was there management changed and it was a battle every day! Too much politics.
good,"i enjoyed the company to work, the timing was good, people were good, work was good, this was a temp position, so its not so welcoming to temps, but still it was good."
good,Great work balance.  Company has been around for a while and the culture is predicated on it.
good,"I  will typically respond to emails from the night before then check our inicident ticketing system in order to organize the ticket queue. I will then contact clients and begin the process to set up either deskside assistance or remote troubleshooting. Once the tickets are under control, I will move onto to one of the many projects we have going such as encryption upgrade or upgrading systems to the current standard. This has been a great place to learn a diverse set of skills to troubleshoot and resolve a wide array of issues. They have also given me good practice at mantaining, managing and auditing AD servers as well as other software administration servers we work with."
good,"Varian is one of the Silicon Valley's earliest technology companies. Many employees have been there for 15 years or more. Naturally, most of management are old timers. As a result, the company is change- and risk-resistant and management is hierarchical."
good,"Varian has manager that doesn't even have an education. He only knows how to play politics and protect his rear. Many work there just to earn a pay check. No love, no loyalty."
good,There is a real problem with work/home life balance at Varian but the company compensates you well for the time you put in.  The benefits package is nearly unbeatable and you get to work with some great people.
good,"Typical day at work for me involves troubleshooting issues with completion of deliveries.  I also handle all Importer Security Filing issues, interact with our international offices for process detail and improvement and manage department personnel.  In the past year, I've expanded my skill set and achieved APICS CSCP certification."
good,"Varians product lines are very technical which often requires that engineers and physicists get involved in the development of marketing concepts. This often made the job of Marketing quite challenging. Finding the right balance with Marketing, Engineering, Legal and Regulatory required strong diplomatic management skills and was often a long term process.  Knowing how to present a marketing program, who to target and when, worked well for me. "
good,"- work was based as on call status"
good,"Big company with Traditional culture "
good,Only issue is there are periods of time where there is little work and then out of nowhere you get tasked with a mountain of work right after all at once
good,"NA- This is a personal question and I do not think it would be professional to post an opinion about a company that I worked eleven(11) yearsfor online. Good, bad, or indifferent."
good,Varian is a leading medical device company with a large customer base.  Its goal is to help cancer patients fight AGAIST CANCER and beat it...………………..
good,"Très belle entreprise. Très bien accueillie et bonne intégration par les Ressources Humaines."
good,"Old mentality. Too many internal hires for key positions when they should take advantage of multi company external hires. Descent compensation, descent benefits."
good,"My manager would look out for his team and always care for his team. "
good,"Varian is great place to work. They have awesome benefits. Bonuses were a plus, you get a quarterly bonus which was always nice, and that was based on the companies performance during that quarter. Great environment to work in, management was good and easy to approach."
good,There is not much I can say about this company. The work that I did there was very cut and dry as a typical sales job. I am looking for other opportunities.
good,I am a Chemical Engineer and they wouldn't let me do anything higher up than production work. Usually involved tube tests. The hardest thing was trying to get them to change the culture of procrastination for getting product out.
good,office is decent in Milpitas.  good group of people.  little room for advancement in this office since it's not corporate
good,"Daily duty includes administration, maintenance and health check of the VMware vSphere ESXi/vCenter cluster environment. Also, maintain and support VMware Site Recovery Management and vCloud Networking and Security across two sites."
good,This company was a very busy place to work. I had a lot of shipping to do and plenty of mail to post and deliver. The economy took it's toll just like everyone else.
good,"1st level Management was poor, severe lack of training and oversite and personal agendas. Senior management was great, it just didn't trickle down very well."
good,"Compensation is on the very low end and advancing is tricky. They are always on the tail end of technologies having to upgrade to avoid running systems that have completely been abandoned by the companies that used to support them. Everything is very slow moving, teams would rather push a problem down the road until something forces them to update and take over a week to do so, than to take 2 days to fix the issue outright now."
good,"As a medical product developer, interest in auditable compliance with regulatory standards and continuous improvement should have outweighed fulfilling over-optimistic task completion schedules that led to much rework."
good,"Every employees focus was the costumers needs. Biggest focus point is how many X-ray tubes can we build to fill the sales. There is a high pressure to make a perfect X-ray tube that will work in field. Management really only over saw customer satisfaction. Technicians were operators that knew the why's and how's of our systems  and could help us troubleshoot when they were needed. "
good,Under the new management there is constant pressure to do more with less. This may be temporary. Varian just spun off the X-Ray & Imaging Division (20% of the Company) now there is more pressure to keep stock values up.
good,"If you want to settle down with good work-life balance just join this company."
good,"The people w/in Varian are great people. Varian has some trouble with their middle management choices; underqualified, weak, micromanaging. And they tend to let these folks linger on well past their date of usefulness and into destructiveness."
good,"Conservative company that is well run. The company has a storied past and a fantastic future (vision and mission), but struggles because of its old school culture and inability to adapt to change fast enough. It is an absolute privilege to be a part of a company that gets to work on ""a world without fear of cancer"" everyday, but the company is experiencing growing pains and multiple reorganizations that is diminishing employee morale. Though they have a long term vision that resonates well, they are too focused on short term results and sales. The culture does not support their ambition and something will have to give or change to move the company forward."
good,"Good company with an excellent product, but slow-paced and with too many layers of middle and upper management."
good,The company is changing a lot hence a lot of changes in the management levels and their ideas. Some great and some not at all. But all in all lot of projects and days are getting busier than when I started work here. Again with respect to co-workers some are really good to work with others really tough. The hardest part is to deal with few people. Great peers are something that will get you going.
good,Up to mark in technology (in healthcare industry) and great place to work.
good,"Work wasn't terribly challenging, but the culture of the company is very old school and fairly boring. They are working on improving culture but it will happen slowly. Otherwise they do great for the community and employees are nice to work with."
good,Good benefits and management.  Nice place to work. Safe workplace.
good,"This was a temp agency didn't work with them personally. Was assigned to work at other places. One point at time didn't have no assignment."
good,"professional, nice environment ,"
good,"a typical day at varian consists of mostly standing all day and working on the manufacturing floor. i learn a lot of stuff while i was there i got my forklift license and crane operating license also."
good,I worked graveyard shift in Final System Test in an environment where most everything you did alone. It was also 22 years ago so I do not know if the work environment is still the same. The rules on PTO and sick time were strange for someone working graveyard shift. You were only allowed 2 unplanned sick days per year which meant you had to tell them if you were going to be out sick 24 hours in advance. Some people I worked with sometimes called in each day to say they may not be in even though they were not sick just to get around the rule. I wasn't so lucky and missed work mainly because was a single parent with a sick 4 year old at home
good,"VMS was a great place to work, then the executives began implementing new standards which focused on the bottom line more than the worth of the employees.  The company culture changes and many 10, 20, 30+ year employees left or were terminated due to the changes.  The company lost its compassion and experience. "
good,"	Created and managed multiple product installation and service plans from initiation to final acceptance with physicists, therapists, medical oncologists and department administrators. "
good,"An excellent company from an investment perspective but from an IT empolyment perspective a far cry now compared to the 90""s and early 00's.  I learned almost everything I know while employed there for 19 years and would still be there if the old senior IT management team was still in place.  The co-workers were great until senior management changed and started letting people go that had been excellent and loyal employees for many years and replaced them with their friends.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who did not value the contributions of their team and worked to pit team members against each other.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always the ability to have intelligent conversations and debates with peers and at the end of the day walk away with consensus and go play soccer and have a beer.  "
good,"Empresa ótima de se trabalhar, benefícios ótimos, pessoas talentosas, porém, muita rotatividade na logística, promoção zero, e difícil de intercalar vida pessoal e profissional."
good,Overall good. Good environment with lots of employees. Overall treated most everybody fair. They are splitting the company into three different companies and the new system will not work for some engineers.
good,"Wonderful management, awesome co-workers.  Very busy environment but fun place to work. My co-workers are great and I could not have asked for a better team to work with."
good,"What can i say, really great place to start and develop your career."
good,This is the anti-startup.  Work days hardly ever start before 9 or go after 5.  If you're looking for fast paced - this is not for you.  If you are looking for work life balance and the days of old join today!
good,Very good company to work for. Employees are very friendly. Benefits are outstanding. Good opportunity for career advancement.
good,Doing the complete install of linear accelerators from install to completion. Worked on each install independent.  Travel was the hardest part of the job.
good,Plenty of work and opportunity to get involved.  Expectations are high so there is no risk of boredom and there is constant change which adds to the excitement.
good,"Varian is a good company to work for with good job security."
good,". Great benefits. Company car, stock program, and paid vacation."
good,"Die tägliche Arbeit findet in einem angenehmen Umfeld von engagierten Physikern und Ingenieuren statt. Auch wenn Zielvorgaben der amerikanischen Geschäftsführung meistens kaum einzuhalten sind, ist der Zusammenhalt der Mitarbeiter gut."
good,"I enjoyed performing installation and maintenance on cancer treatment systems because it provided a means that helped save lives.  I worked solo most of the time, but also would work with a great group of people who were mostly previous military.  The hardest part of the job would be the traveling.  I spent to many days away from home, 20 nights a month in a hotel and I flew all over northern America."
good,"Challenging and an interesting place to work, hours can be demanding but the compensation is comparable to other like jobs. Management can be frustrating at time due to changes in policy that have not been thought through"
good,"I worked there 2.5 years then they did a re-org in my division so I was gone. Ok salary, ok management. Good budget. I managed 4 direct reports and they were good employees."
good,"The technical aspects of the company are the most attractive features of working here.  "
good,"I've been here 8 months and so far pretty good.  School rebrusm of 7500.00 a year, quarterly bonus is base on quality, great lunch room with hot cocoa and tea, pretty good co-workers to be around, Salt Lake City location is adding to the building for expansion of future jobs, on the flat panel side."
good,"Challenges are provided everyday, but can get a little mundane if you arent kept busy day to day."
good,Project manager working remotely form home office and customer sites.
good,"The working environment at Varian is great. At times it can be tense, especially when there is an emergency. That is natural for people who are trying to be productive and only have the company in mind. Otherwise, the people are the most professional people that I have ever worked with."
good,"A typical day was filled with tasks that kept you very busy with unforeseen problems on the side that needed attention.  This type of schedule required good time management with a balance in mind as well.  Some of the task were required to be done by the end of the day but sometimes the manager wanted it to be done first, so unclear expectations.  Some individuals worked very hard and that was expected on a daily while others never worked hard and that was excepted with no improvement plans in place. Overall I learned a lot about politics and what to do and what not to do."
good,"balance of work and life"
good,"Varian Medical Systems was a very professional place to work.  The employees that I worked with were very knowledgeable in the tasks that they were assigned to and work together to get the job done right.  Quality of work, safety of the employees and education were high on the list of importance.  As employees, we were always encouraged to gain higher education and knowledge within our positions to be the best in our industry."
good,Varian / Varex is a good company to work for. It employs a lot of smart and dedicated people. The technology is leading edge for the most part which keeps it interesting. The benefits are good as well.
good,"I love the people that I work with. I think it's a great environment, unfortunately there are no vacation time and when the company has a shut down, you don't get paid, but that's because my position is a temp. I really wish they had a permanent position."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was learning, I came from a background of assembler to working with the Engineering Group. I learned so much with the product line which manufactures/builds cancer machines. I have enjoyed being part of the Engineering group, the process and what their value is to the company. I have also provided assistance dealing with Supervisors and Management to generate, review and redline ECO (Engineering Change Orders), work with BOM's (Bill of Materials), and update routers per request."
good,"Good environment, various tasks, Good support from coworkers."
good,"integrated water,vacuum,electrical harnesses into the mainframe"
good,"What the talented people at Varian Medical Systems do everyday is inspiring. "
good, 
good,"I really enjoy working at varian most days but like any job it can’t always be enjoyable. It’s very diverse and most people working at varian have been there for a long time. Things are starting to go south very slowly as more and more old timers are retiring and different managers and leads are taking over. The whole culture is shifting and not for the better. We were informed this year raises will be slim to none and instead they use the carrot on a stick method for a bonus instead. most years the employees never get a 100 percent payout due to not reaching company goals set for the year. "
good,"If you love traveling, this is a great job! Great company with great benefits.  I love working with Medical Oncology Practices and love to teach.  Challenges are life/work balance."
good,The job is easy but the pay rate is not what an individual would want to have in this job market. Having a bachelors degree you would want to get paid more.
good,"The purpose of why you work here is supreme, in my opinion. The culture reflects the passion for this purpose. The transition is going on to re-build, never easy while culture evolves."
good,"Varian Medical Systems is a great company to work for.  They offer one of the best benefits to include medical, dental, stock purchase plan, vision and paid time leave."
good,Progressive company in that it offered an onsite clinic and active wellness programs for its employees. There was a NP onsite and an emergency response team.
good,Old school. Management is good. Need some updating. People are nice. Work life balance is good. Coworkers are nice. Systems could be better.
good,Challenging and rewarding work. Always interesting. Technical and fun. Encouragement for advancing responsibilities.  Competitive compensation and benefits.
good,"We can plan our work 6 hours a day. No pressures, happens only at times. Team members are very supportive and helping in nature."
good,I really enjoyed Varian. Most people are friendly they are really family oriented. They pay well. They have good benefits. They provide good overall experiences for their employees. Most management was good. My manager was in the minority. He took his information from a gossip ladder but all the other managers tried to have a relationship with their employees.
good,Ive learned a lot in this company not only professionally but personally as well.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Varian.  I always learned something new daily, always challenged to be better, and awarded for productivity and quality control.  Highly recommend."
good,"Varian is a good company to employees. The workplace is good. The culture is OK. The business is OK."
good,My department team members all contribute inputs towards company's next fiscal year goals. Processes are reviewed regularly and proposals discussed every team meeting. Final implementation is discussed prior to end of fiscal year and implementation at start on fiscal year.
good,great Place to work with a central Palo Alto location that has many amenities either onsite or close by.  The goal of the company is to help people by treating cancer.  It is a great goal.  Good people to work with
good,"Varian Medical Systems was a great company to work for and I learned a lot about the treatment of cancer."
good,"The environment is very accommodating from business perspective and individual perspective. The expectation is high as far as performance is concern at the same time, you control your own pace with high degree of success. There is no micro-managing in this company."
good,"Everything except project scope is good in this company. Good work-life balance, good benefits. Supportive team members. Good appreciations given at times. Free cab service, subsidized food. Free breakfast items."
good,"During my time as a contractor, the environment and culture at Varian   Medical systems was enjoyable. My manager and team were friendly and showed positive team work."
good,"working in healthcare allows me to help patients through the toughest fight of their lives, surviving cancer.  The technology we employ is cutting edge and evolving quickly"
good,"Wellknown organization."
good,"A typical day is ensuring documentation is correct for product build.  The documentation in our company is always changing and we as documentation coordinators need to ensure all wording, redlines are captured so our manufacturing team can understand and build per process."
good,"decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. fun work place with supportive management."
good,"Company needs to provide management training for their managers and team leaders and offer advancement opportunities for employees. Benefits are awesome, overtime is required often which is nice if you need extra cash, but it can throw off your work/life balance. Job security is there, but advancement is not (without a college degree.). They are growing and under new management and they say they will address the lack of advancement opportunities available to the average blue collar worker. Time will tell."
good,"Varian (as it was known when I worked there) was an amazing company. There was vastly more good than bad. The pressure to stay ahead of the curve was tremendous, but not unwarranted considering the technologies, and products provided. It is a heavily regulated business whose Sixth Sigma and Lean Manufacturing processes run parallel to the goals of the FDA. "
good,"Incredibly exciting opportunities at a very impactful oncology company. Offering jobs that touch the clinic, work with all the major hospitals around the world, starting new businesses. A very successful company with a long history that continues to innovate."
good,"my typical day starts with me arriveing alittle early. taking a look at what need to be accomplished first and get into that work vibe that i strive for. I take great pride in getting the job done and helping our department be the best it can be. \Im a team players i work well with others. I don't find any part of the job being the hardest there are just sometime your not having the best day. i don't find work to be hard. My most enjoyable part of the job is knowing to we got everything done in a timely manner, and done right."
good,"Salary could be higher, but management, staff, office coworkers, and overall experience is excellent.  Great mechanical engineering department with lots of chances to promote and prove ideas via R&D, fun projects to work on."
good,Managed the information systems installers in the Midwest.
good,Great culture at Varian. Good people to work with. Varian truly cares about the health and well being of their employees.
good,"Went in early to update spreadsheets to let coworkers what needed to be done for the day.  Assemble various items for the next area.  Co-workers are good to work with.  Constantly learning what needed to go into new product.  Hardest part was extremely heavy item needed to assemble, the most enjoyable were the people."
good,The best part of my day is waking up going to the office to complete a full work day. Upon the completion of each work day I leave with a smile knowing that my job function contributed to the fight against Cancer.
good,"I have very good experience in Varian medical systems."
good,Responsible for high-tech electronic and mechanical x-ray system manufacturing operations and supply chain management to include developing and directing multiple cross functional teams throughout the business
good,I am employed as a junior software developer. Great work/life balance. Fair pay and decent benefits. Access to stay of the art software tools. Strong managment.
good,"Its a very relaxing environment, get your job done and leave with no worries. I work the night shifts, it can get difficult because of the schedule but overall this place is great."
good,Worked with a nice team and ready to help peers and fun at work culture. the most enjoyable was the summer outings with your colleagues and the games.
good,A typical work day at Varian was fun but also hard working employes. We did monthy birthday's and also had variety fun thing's but it was a work enviroment also.
good,The team I worked in was good. The timings were relaxed. Co-ordinating with other teams was difficult at times.  Added advantage was I was working for a manager who was supportive and helpful whenever I needed some help.
good,"great company, very caring for employees. Stable and manager supports and willing to be available any time of day. Friendly employees, great environment."
good,* Plenty of installation & commissioning activities during a normal shift.
good,I typical day at work is.when things go right & stay productive & positive & time just flies by.
good,I love electronics assembly. This was one of my favorite jobs from the past. I would probably still be there if I didn't have to relocate. Bosses were good.
good,"Awesome place to work, has full amenities including a kitchen with a dude named nacho who makes excellent food. Bathrooms are always clean and workers are considerate."
good,I am a vendor for Varian. The managers are easy to work with. I managed the temp positions for Varian. Overall nice place to work. The people are nice here.
good,"Really good environment to grow, learn from the industries leading experts and expand your horizons and domain knowledge by grasping different concepts from people with different backgrounds"
good,"Great environment.  Active, fun, and friendly people.  I was able to meet many of the employees and watch them compete in a Summer Olympics that I planned."
good,"Varian is a great place to work.  Great group of people, fun and exciting projects working with the latest technology.  Management was helpful and engaging."
good,Good working place. Nice environment. A traditional company.
good,"I've had the pleasure of working at one of NYC University. It was a change of pace for me, as I'm used to the corporate environment, but one I truly enjoyed. I was able to work at several of the offices and departments in my time there."
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day.  Management were nurturing but systems antiquated thus long hours at work to get work done."
good,Professional setting interfacing with medical managers.  Field service representative must address system problems when the machine doesn't work.  Time becomes a major criteria thus creating another dimension of stress.  Systems were complex.  Training was adequate.  Support to local area was adequate.  A lot of overtime was required to properly maintain systems and provide solutions to emergency situations.  A high degree of responsibility was conveyed.  Customer satisfactions levels improved.
good,"Varian is a really great place to get started in a future career. However the management is a little too judgmental if you are the specific religion or race they are wanting."
good,I would start by getting the parts needed for the job i was to get done replace the parts and send it to QC for inspection then move on to the next job. The management was pretty good and the co-workers were okay some of them were really good but most were just there for a pay check. And i would have to say the hardest part of the job was doing 9 jobs to everyone eases 1 for the same pay got a little irritating at times. And the hardest part of the the job was trying to keep the parts form one job separate for the others when they kept putting everything at my work station and i enjoyed feeling satisfied when everything worked perfect
good,pull oders for manufacturing floor via sap system. load unload trucks via forklift/palletjacks. detrash and stock material. learned a great deal with sap. got along good with co-workers hardest part of the job was the demanding schedule for production the most enjoyable part of the job was the very fexible and high demand for overtime.
good,The day starts with doing the large international shipments. If those get done then I help out recieving or domestic shipping. Always something to do. There's always someone that needs a hand. The warehouse management is always on top of things. The management from other departments we sometimes clash with.
